carnal innocence by nora roberts carnal innocence nora roberts bantam books new york toronto london sydney auckland this edition contains the complete text of the original hardcover edition prologue the air was raw with february the morning bobby lee fuller found the first body they would say he found it when in truth what hed done was trip over what was left of arnette gantrey either way the end was the same and bobby lee would live with that wide white face floating into his dreams for a long time to come if he hadnt broken up with marvella truesdale again the night before hed have been hunkered over his desk in english lit trying to twist his brain into coping with shakespeares macbeth instead of dropping his line into gooseneck creek but this last fight in his rocky eighteenmonth romance with marvella had worn him down bobby leed decided to take himself a day off to rest and reflect and to teach that sharptongued marvella that he wasnt no pussywhipped wimp but a man the men in bobby lees family had always ruled the roost or pretended to he wasnt about to break the tradition at nineteen bobby lee was long past grown he was six one and gawky with it the fillingout years still to come but he had big workingmans hands like his fathers on the ends of long skinny arms and his mothers thick black hair and luxuriant lashes he liked to wear that hair slicked back in the style of his idol james dean bobby lee considered dean a mans man one who wouldnt have tolerated book learning any more than bobby lee did if it had been up to him hed have been working fulltime in sonny talbots mobile service station and eatery instead of hacking his way through twelfth grade but his mama had other notions and nobody in innocence mississippi liked to cross happy fuller if they could help it happy whose childhood name was appropriate enough since she could smile beauteously as she sliced you off at the knees hadnt quite forgiven her eldest boy for being held back twice in school if bobby lees mood hadnt been so low he wouldnt have risked hooking a day not with his grades already teetering but marvella was the kind of girl who pushed a man a mans man into doing rash and reckless things so bobby lee dropped his line into the sulky brown waters of gooseneck creek and hunched in his faded denim jacket against the raw air his daddy always said when a man had powerful things on his mind the best cure was to take himself down to the water and see what was nibbling it didnt matter if you caught anything it was the being there that counted damn women bobby lee muttered and peeled his lips back in a sneer hed practiced long hours in the bathroom mirror damn all women to hell and back again he didnt need the grief marvella handed out with both pretty hands ever since theyd done the deed in the back of his cutlass shed been picking him apart and trying to put him back together her way it didnt sit right with bobby lee fuller no indeedy not even if she made him dizzy with love when they werent scrapping not even if she had those big blue eyes that seemed to whisper secrets just for him when they passed each other in the crowded hallways of jefferson davis high and not even if when he got her naked she near to fucked his brains out maybe he loved her and maybe she was smarter than he was but hed be damned if she was going to tug him along like a pig on a rope bobby lee settled back among the reeds along the skinny creek fed by the mighty mississippi he could hear the lonesome whistle from the train that was heading down to greenville and the whisper of the damp winter breeze through the limp reeds his line hung slack and still the only thing nibbling this morning was his temper maybe hed just take himself down to jackson shake the dust of innocence off his shoes and strike out for the city he was a good mechanic a damn good one and figured he could find work with or without a high school diploma shitfire you didnt need to know nothing about some fag named macbeth or obtuse triangles and the like to fix a dinky carburetor down to jackson he could get himself a job in a garage end up head mechanic hell he could own the whole kit and kaboodle before too long and while he was at it marvella itoldyouso truesdale would be back in innocence crying her big blue eyes red then hed come back bobby lees smile lit his tough goodlooking face and warmed his chocolate eyes in a way that would have made marvellas heart flutter yeah hed come back with twentydollar bills bulging in his pockets hed cruise on back into town in his classic caddy one of his fleet of cars duded up in an italian suit and richer than the longstreets and there would be marvella thin and pale from pining away for him shed be standing on the corner in front of larssons dry goods clutching her hands between her soft pillowy breasts and tears would be streaming down her face at the sight of him and when she fell at his feet sobbing and wailing and telling him how sorry she was for being such an awful bitch and driving him away from her he might just might forgive her the fantasy lulled him as the sun brightened to ease the stinging air and danced lightly on the duncolored water of the creek he began to contemplate the physical aspects of their reunion hed take her to sweetwater having purchased the lovely old plantation from the longstreets when theyd fallen on hard times shed gasp and shiver at his good fortune being a gentleman and a romantic hed sweep her up the long curving stairs since bobby lee hadnt been above the first floor in sweetwater his imagination shifted into high gear the bedroom he carried the trembling marvella into resembled a hotel suite in vegas which was bobby lees current idea of class heavy red draperies a heartshaped bed as big as a lake carpet so thick he had to wade through it music was playing something classic he thought bruce springsteen or phil collins yeah marvella got all gooey over phil collins then hed lie her down on the bed her eyes would be wet as he kissed her shed be telling him again and again what a fool shed been how much she loved him how she was going to spend the rest of her life making him happy making him her king then hed run his hands down over those incredible white pinktipped breasts squeezing just a little the way she liked it her soft thighs would spread apart her fingers would dig into his shoulders while she made that growly sound back in her throat and then his line tugged blinking bobby lee sat up wincing a little when his jeans bunched against the bulge at his crotch distracted by the hardon he flicked the fat fish out of the water where it wriggled in the silvering sun with his hands clumsy and slippery with arousal he thumped his catch into the reeds imagining himself about to pop it to marvella had him tangling his line in the reeds he hauled himself up swearing a little at his carelessness since a good fishing line was as valuable as the fish it caught bobby lee waded into the reeds and began to set it to rights the perch was still flopping he could hear its wet struggles grinning he gave the line a quick tug it resisted and he muttered a halfhearted oath he kicked a rusted miller can aside took another step into the high cool grass he slipped his foot sliding on something wet bobby lee fuller went down on his knees and found himself facetoface with arnette gantrey her look of surprise mirrored his wide eyes gaping mouth white white cheeks the perch lay quivering with its last breaths beneath her naked mutilated breasts he saw she was dead stone dead and that was bad enough but it was the blood frosty pools of it soaking into the damp ground turning her limp peroxided hair into something dark and crusty drying hideously from where it had spilled out of dozens of jagged holes in her flesh necklacing her throat where a long smiling gash spread it was the blood that forced the harsh animal sounds out of him and had him scrambling back on his hands and knees he didnt realize the sounds came from him but he did realize that he was kneeling in her blood bobby lee struggled to his feet just in time to lose his breakfast grits all over his new black converse chucks leaving his perch his line and a good portion of his youth in the bloody reeds he ran for innocence chapter one summer that vicious green bitch flexed her sweaty muscles and flattened innocence mississippi it didnt take much even before the war between the states innocence had been nothing but a dusty flyspeck on the map though the soil was good for farming if a man could stand the watery heat the floods and the capricious droughts innocence wasnt destined to prosper when the railroad tracks were laid they had stretched far enough to the north and west to tease innocence with those long echoing whistles of pace and progress without bringing either home the interstate dug through the delta nearly a century after the tracks veered away linking memphis to jackson and leaving innocence in the dust it had no battlefields no natural wonders to draw in tourists with cameras and cash no hotel to pamper them only a small painfully neat rooming house run by the koonses sweetwater its single antebellum plantation was privately owned by the longstreets as it had been for two hundred years it wasnt open to the public had the public been interested sweetwater had been written up once in southern homes but that had been in the eighties when madeline longstreet was alive now that she and her tosspot skinflint of a husband were both gone the house was owned and inhabited by their three children together they pretty nearly owned the town but they didnt do much about it it could be said and was that the three longstreet heirs had inherited all of their familys wild good looks and none of their ambition it was hard to resent them if the people in that sleepy delta town had churned up the energy for resentment along with dark hair golden eyes and good bones the longstreets could charm a coon out of a tree quicker than you could spit nobody blamed dwayne overmuch for following in his daddys alcoholic footsteps and if he crashed up his car from time to time or wrecked a few tables in mcgreedys tavern he always made smooth amends when he was sober through as years went on he was sober less and less everyone said it might have been different if he hadnt flunked out of the fancy prep school hed been shipped off to or if hed inherited his fathers touch with the land along with the old mans taste for sour mash others less kind claimed that money could keep him in his fancy house and in his fancy cars but it couldnt buy him a backbone when dwayne had gotten sissy koons in trouble back in hed married her without a grumble and when two kids and numerous bottles of sour mash later sissy had demanded a divorce hed ended the marriage just as amiably no hard feelings no feelings at all and sissy had run off to nashville with the kids to live with a shoe salesman who wanted to be the next waylon jennings josie longstreet the only daughter and youngest child had been married twice in her thirtyone years both unions had been shortlived but had provided the people of innocence with endless grist for the gossip mill she regretted both experiences in the same way a woman might regret finding her first gray hairs there was some anger some bitterness some fear then it was all covered over out of sight out of mind a woman didnt intend to go gray any more than a woman intended to divorce once shed said till death do us part but things happened as josie was fond of saying philosophically to crystal her bosom friend and owner of the style rite beauty emporium she liked to make up for these two errors in judgment by testing out all the men from innocence to the tennessee border josie knew there were some tightlipped old biddies who liked to whisper behind their hands that josie longstreet was no better than she had to be but there were men who smiled into the dark and knew she was a hell of a lot better than that tucker longstreet enjoyed women perhaps not with the abandon his baby sister enjoyed men but hed had his share he was known to tip back a glass too though not with the unquenchable thirst of his older brother for tucker life was a long lazy road he didnt mind walking it as long as he could do so at his own pace he was affable about detours providing he could negotiate back to his chosen destination so far hed avoided a trip to the altar his siblings experiences having given him a mild distaste for it he much preferred walking his road unencumbered he was easygoing and wellliked by most the fact that hed been born rich might have stuck in a few craws but he didnt flaunt it much and he had a boundless generosity that endeared him to people a man knew if he needed a loan he could call on old tuck the money would be there without any of the sticky smugness that made it hard to take of course there would always be some who muttered that it was easy for a man to lend money when he had more than enough but that didnt change the color of the bills unlike his father beau tucker didnt compound the interest daily or lock in his desk drawer a little leather book filled with the names of the people who owed him who would keep owing him until they plowed themselves under instead of their fields tucker kept the interest to a reasonable ten percent the names and figures were all inside his clever and often underestimated mind in any case he didnt do it for the money tucker rarely did anything for money he did it first because it was effortless and second because inside his rangy and agreeably lazy body beat a generous and sometimes guilty heart hed done nothing to earn his good fortune which made it the simplest thing in the world to squander it away tuckers feelings on this ranged from yawning acceptance to an occasional tug of social conscience whenever the conscience tugged too hard he would stretch himself out in the rope hammock in the shade of the spreading live oak tip a hat down over his eyes and sip a cold one until the discomfort passed which was exactly what he was doing when delia duncan the longstreets housekeeper of thirtysome years stuck her round head out of a secondfloor window tucker longstreet hoping for the best tucker kept his eyes shut and let the hammock sway he was balancing a bottle of dixie beer on his flat naked belly one hand linked loosely around the glass tucker longstreet delias booming voice sent birds scattering up from the branches of the tree tucker considered that a shame as hed enjoyed dreaming to their piping song and the droning counterpoint of the bees courting the gardenias im talking to you boy with a sigh tucker opened his eyes through the loose weave of his planters hat the sun streamed white and hot it was true that he paid delias salary but when a woman had diapered your bottom as well as walloped it you were never in authority over her reluctantly tucker tipped the hat back and squinted in the direction of her voice she was leaning out all right her flaming red hair peeking out from the kerchief shed tied around it her broad heavily rouged face was set in the stern disapproving lines tucker had learned to respect three strings of bright beads slapped against the sill he smiled the innocent crafty smile of a boy caught with his hand in the cookie jar yesm you said youd drive into town and bring me back a sack of rice and a case of cocacola well now tucker rubbed the stillcool bottle over his torso before bringing it to his lips for a long swallow i guess i did delia figured id ride in once it cooled off some get your lazy ass up and fetch it now else therell be an empty plate on the table at dinner tonight too damn hot to eat he mumbled under his breath but delia had ears like a rabbit what is that boy i said im going graceful as a dancer he slid out of the hammock polishing off the dixie as he went when he grinned up at her the hat tipped rakishly on his sweatcurled hair and the light of the devil in those golden eyes delia softened she had to force herself to keep her mouth pursed and stern youre going to root to that hammock one day see if you dont a bodyd think you were ailing the way youd rather lie on your back than stand on your feet lots more a man can do lying down than nap delia she betrayed herself with a loud lusty laugh just make sure you dont do so much you end up getting hauled to the altar with someone like that slut sissy who snagged my dwayne he grinned again no maam and bring me back some of my toilet water its on sale down at larssons toss me down my wallet and keys then her head withdrew then popped out a moment later just before she flung both objects down at him tucker snagged them out of the air with a deft flick of the wrist that reminded delia the boy wasnt as slow as he pretended to be put your shirt on and tuck it in delia ordered as she would have had he been ten tucker lifted it from the hammock shrugging into it as he walked around the front of the house where a dozen doric columns rose from the covered porch to the lacy ironwork of the secondstory terrace his skin was clinging to the cotton before he reached his car he folded himself into his porsche an impulse buy of six months before that hed yet to grow tired of he weighed the comfort of airconditioning against the excitement of wind slapping his face and opted to leave the top down one of the few things tucker did fast was drive gravel spat under the tires as he slammed into first and streaked down the long meandering lane he swung around the circle where his mother had planted a bounty of peonies hibiscus and flashy red geraniums old magnolia trees flanked the lane and their scent was heavy and pleasing he flicked by the bonewhite granite marker where his greatgreatuncle tyrone had been thrown from a badtempered horse and had broken his sixteenyearold neck the marker had been set by tyrons grieving parents to honor his passing it also served as a reminder that if tyrone hadnt chosen to test himself on that meanspirited mare he wouldnt have broken his stubborn neck and his younger brother tuckers greatgreat grandfather wouldnt have inherited sweetwater and passed it down tucker could have found himself living in a condo in jackson he was never sure whether to be sorry or grateful when he passed that sad old piece of stone out through the high wide gates and onto the macadam was the scent of tar going soft in the sun of still water from the bayou behind the screen of trees and the trees themselves with their high green smell that told him though the calendar claimed summer was still a week away the delta knew better he reached for sunglasses first sliding them onto his face before he chose a cassette at random and punched it into its slot tucker was a great lover of fifties music so there was nothing in the car recorded after jerry lee lewis shot out and the killers whiskeysoaked voice and desperate piano celebrated the fact that there was a whole lot of shakin going on as the speedometer swung toward eighty tucker added his own excellent tenor his fingers drummed up and down on the steering wheel looking like piano keys barreling over a rise he had to swing wide to the left to avoid ramming into the back side of a natty bmw he tooted his horn not in warning but in greeting as he skidded around the elegant maroon fender he didnt slack his speed but a glance in his rearview mirror showed him the beemer was stopped half in and half out of the lane leading back to edith mcnairs house as jerry lee switched into his rawthroated breathless tucker gave a passing thought to the car and driver miss edith had passed on about two months before around the same time that a second mutilated body had been discovered floating in the water down at spook hollow that had been sometime in april and a search party had been whipped up to look for francie alice logan whod been missing for two days tuckers jaw clenched when he remembered what it had been like trudging through the bayou carrying a ruger red label and hoping to hell he didnt shoot off his own foot or find anything but theyd found her and hed had the bad luck to be with burke truesdale when they did it wasnt easy to think about what the water and the fish had done to sassy old francie the pretty little redhead hed flirted with dated a time or two and had debated sleeping with his stomach clenched and he bumped up the volume on jerry lee he wasnt thinking about francie couldnt hed been thinking about miss edith and that was better shed lived to be nearly ninety and had passed on quietly in her sleep tucker recalled that shed left her house a tidy twostory built during the reconstruction to some yankee relative since tucker knew that no one within fifty miles of innocence owned a bmw he concluded that the yankee had decided to come down and take a peek at his inheritance he dismissed the northern invasion from his thoughts took out a cigarette and after breaking a thumbnaillength piece from the tip lighted it half a mile back caroline waverly gripped the wheel of her car and waited for her heart to slide back down her throat idiot crazy bastard careless jerk she forced herself to lift her trembling foot off the brake and tap the gas until the car was all the way into the narrow overgrown lane inches she thought hed missed hitting her by inches then hed had the gall to blast his horn at her she wished hed stopped oh she wished hed stopped so she could have given that homicidal jackass a piece of her mind shed have felt better then having vented her temper she was getting damn good at venting since dr palamo had told her that the ulcer and the headaches were a direct result of repressing her feelings and of chronically overworking of course well she was doing something about both caroline unpried her sweaty hands from the wheel and wiped them against her slacks she was taking a nice long peaceful sabbatical here in nowhere mississippi after a few months if she didnt die of this vicious heat shed be ready to prepare for her spring tour as for repressing her feelings she was done with that her final ugly blowout with luis had been so liberating so gloriously uninhibited she almost wished she could go back to baltimore and do it again almost the past and luis with his clever tongue brilliant talent and roving eye definitely belonged to the past was safely behind her the future at least until shed recovered her nerves and her health wasnt of much interest for the first time in her life caroline waverly child prodigy dedicated musician and emotional sap was going to live only for the sweet sweet present and here at long last she was going to make a home her way no more backing away from problems no more cowed agreeing to her mothers demands and expectations no more struggling to be the reflection of everyone elses desires she was moving in taking hold and by the end of the summer she intended to know exactly who caroline waverly was feeling better she replaced her hands on the wheel and eased the car down the lane she had a vague recollection of skipping down it once on some longago visit to her grandparents it had been a short visit of course carolines mother had done everything possible to cut off her own country roots but caroline remembered her grandfather a big redfaced man whod taken her fishing one still morning and her girlish reluctance to bait a hook until her grandfather had told her that old worm was just waiting to catch himself a big fat fish her trembling thrill when her line had jerked and the sense of awe and accomplishment when theyd carried three husky catfish back home her grandmother a wiry stick of a woman with steelgray hair had fried up the catch in a heavy black skillet though carolines mother had refused to taste a bite caroline herself had eaten hungrily a frail towheaded sixyearold with long slender fingers and big green eyes when the house came into view she smiled it hadnt changed much the paint was flaking off the shutters and the grass was anklehigh but it was still a trim twostory house with a covered porch made for sitting and a stone chimney that leaned just slightly to the left she felt her eyes sting and blinked at the tears foolish to feel sad her grandparents had lived long contented lives foolish to feel guilty when her grandfather died two years before caroline had been in madrid in the middle of a concert tour and swamped by obligations it simply hadnt been possible to make the trip back for his funeral and shed tried really tried to tempt her grandmother to the city where caroline could have flown easily between tour dates for a visit but edith hadnt budged shed laughed at the notion of leaving the house where shed come as a new bride some seventy years before the house where her children had been born and raised the house where shed lived her whole life and when she died caroline had been in a toronto hospital recovering from exhaustion she hadnt known her grandmother was gone until a week after the funeral so it was foolish to feel guilt but as she sat in her car with the airconditioning blowing gently on her face she was swamped with the emotion im sorry she said aloud to the ghosts im so sorry i wasnt here that i was never here on a sigh she combed a hand through her sleek cap of honeyblond hair it did no good to sit in the car and brood she needed to take in her things go through the house settle herself the place was hers now and she meant to keep it when she opened the car door the heat stole the oxygen from her lungs gasping against its force she lifted her violin case from the backseat she was already wilting when she carried the instrument and a heavy box of sheet music to the porch it took three more trips to the car lugging suitcases two bags of groceries which shed stopped to pick up in a little market thirty miles north and finally her reeltoreel tape recorder before she was done once she had all her possessions lined up she took out the keys each one was tagged front door back door root cellar strongbox ford pickup they jangled together like musical notes as caroline selected the frontdoor key the door squeaked as old doors should and opened on the dim dust of disuse she took up the violin first it was certainly more important than any of the groceries a little lost and for the first time lonely she walked inside the hallway led straight back to where she knew the kitchen would be to the left stairs climbed hooking to a right angle after the third tread the banister was dark sturdy oak layered now with a fine cloak of dust there was a table just beneath the stairs where a heavy black dial phone sat beside an empty vase caroline laid down her case on it and got busy she carried groceries back to the kitchen with its yellow walls and white glassfronted cabinets because the house was ovenhot she put them away first relieved that the refrigerator was sparkling clean shed been told some neighbor women had come in to wash and scrub after the funeral caroline could see that this country courtesy was true beneath the dust of two months beyond the lacy webs that industrious spiders had woven in corners was the faint lingering smell of lysol she walked slowly back to the front hall her heels echoing on the hardwood she peeked into the sitting room with its petit point cushions and big rca console television that looked like an ancient artifact into the living room where faded cabbage roses climbed the walls and company furniture was ghosted under dust covers then her grandfathers den with its case of hunting rifles and target pistols its big easy chair ragged at the arms hefting her suitcases she started upstairs to choose her room both sentiment and practicality had her settling on her grandparents bedroom the heavy fourposter and weddingring quilt seemed to offer comfort the cedar chest at its foot might hold secrets the tiny violets and roses twined on the walls would soothe caroline set her valises aside and walked to the narrow glass door that led to the high open porch from there she could see her grandmothers roses and perennials struggling against the weeds she could hear the lap of water against some rock or downed log behind the tangle of live oaks and spanish moss and in the distance through the haze of heat she saw the brown ribbon of water that was the powerful mississippi there were birds calling a symphony of sound through the hot air jays and sparrows crows and larks and perhaps the gargled call of wild turkey she dreamed there for a moment a delicately formed woman a shade too thin with exquisite hands and shadowed eyes for a moment the view the fragrances the sounds faded away she was in her mothers sitting room with the whispering tick of the ormulu clock the scent of chanel very soon they would be leaving for her first recital we expect the best from you caroline her mothers voice was smooth and slow and left no room for comment we expect you to be the best nothing else is worth aiming for do you understand carolines toes were curled nervously in her glossy mary janes she was only five yes maam in the parlor now her arms aching after two hours of practice the sun so bright and golden outside and she could see a robin perched in the tree he made her giggle and pause caroline her mothers voice flowed down the stairs you still have an hour of practice left how do you expect to be ready for this tour if you have no discipline now start again im sorry with a sigh caroline lifted the violin that to her twelveyearold shoulders was beginning to feel like a lead weight backstage fighting off the queasy nerves of opening night and tired so tired from the endless rehearsals preparations traveling how long had she been on this treadmill now was she eighteen twenty caroline for heavens sake put on more blusher you look like death that impatient hammering voice taut fingers taking her chin and lifting it why cant you at least show some enthusiasm do you know how hard your father and i have worked to get you where you are how much weve sacrificed and here you are ten minutes before curtain brooding into the mirror im sorry she had always been sorry lying in a hospital bed in toronto sick exhausted ashamed what do you mean youve canceled the rest of the tour her mothers tense furious face looming over hers i cant finish it im sorry sorry what good is sorry youre making a shambles of your career youve inconvenienced luis unpardonably i wouldnt be surprised if he broke your engagement as well as cutting you off professionally he was with someone else caroline said weakly just before curtain i saw him in the dressing room he was with someone else thats nonsense and if it isnt you have no one but yourself to blame the way youve been acting lately walking around like a ghost canceling interviews refusing to attend parties after all ive done for you this is how you repay the debt how do you expect me to deal with the press with the speculation with the mess youve left me in i dont know it helped to close her eyes to close them and shut it all away im sorry i just cant do it anymore no caroline thought opening her eyes again she just couldnt do it anymore she couldnt be what everyone else wanted her to be not now not ever again was she selfish ungrateful spoiled all those hateful words her mother had hurled at her it didnt seem to matter now all that mattered was that she was here ten miles away tucker longstreet streaked into the heart of innocence kicking up dust and scaring the spit out of jed larssons fat beagle nuisance whod been resting his bones on the pad of concrete beneath the striped awning of the dry goods store caroline waverly would have understood the dogs distress when he opened one eye to see the shiny red car barreling straight for him and skidding to a stop a bare eighteen inches from his resting place with a yipe the dog gained his feet and took himself off to safer ground tucker chuckled and called to nuisance with a click and a whistle but the dog kept moving nuisance hated that red car with a passion so great he never even ventured near enough to pee on its tires tucker dumped his keys in his pocket he fully intended to get delias rice and cokes and toilet water then head back to stretch out on the hammock again where he figured a smart man belonged on a hot airless afternoon but he spotted his sisters car tilted across two parking spaces in front of the chat n chew it occurred to him that the drive had made him thirsty and he could do with a tall glass of lemonade and possibly a hunk of chilled huckleberry pie later hed spend a lot of time regretting that small detour the longstreets owned the chat n chew just as they owed the wash dry laundromat the innocence boarding house the feed and grain the hunters friend gun shop and a dozen or so rental properties the longstreets were wise enough or lazy enough to have managers for their businesses dwayne took a mild interest in the rental houses cruising along to each on the first of the month to collect checks or listen to excuses and note down a list of needed repairs but tucker kept the books whether he wanted to or not once when hed bitched about it long enough josie had taken them over shed screwed them up so royally it had taken tucker days to set them to rights again he didnt mind so much really bookkeeping was something you could do in the cool of the evening with a cold drink at your elbow his head for figures made it an annoying chore rather than a difficult one the chat n chew was one of tuckers favorite places the diner had one of those big widepane windows that was forever dotted with posters announcing bake sales school plays and auctions inside the floor was made of linoleum tiles yellowed with age and dusted with brown flecks that looked like fly spots the booths were rugged red vinyl an improvement over the ripped and tattered brown that tucker had replaced just six months before the red was already fading to orange over the years people had carved messages into the laminated tabletops sort of a chat n chew tradition initials were a big favorite along with hearts and stick figures but occasionally someone was inspired to hack in hey or up yours or in the case of one grumpy individual eat shit and die earleen renfrew who managed the establishment had been so put out by that suggestion tucker had been forced to borrow an electric buffer from the hardware store and smudge out the offending words each booth had its own individual juke where you could turn the knob and flip over selections still three for a quarter because earleen favored country tunes so did the juke but tucker had managed to sneak in a few cuts of rock or r b from the fifties the big counter was lined with a dozen stools all topped with the same fading red vinyl a clear threetiered dome held that days offering of pies tuckers gaze lighted on the huckleberry with pure delight exchanging waves and heys with a scattering of customers he made his way through the grease and smoketinged air to where his sister perched at the counter deep in discussion with earleen josie gave her brother an absent pat on the arm and kept talking and so i said to her justine if youre going to marry a man like will shiver all youve got to do to stay happy is buy yourself a padlock for his fly and make sure youre the only one with a key he may wet himself now and again but thats all hes going to do earleen gave an appreciative cackle and wiped a few wet rings from the counter why shed want to marry a noaccount like wills beyond me honey hes a regular tiger in bed josie winked slyly so they say hey tucker she turned to give her brother a smacking kiss before wriggling her fingers in front of his face i just got my nails done hotshot red what do you think dutifully he examined her long scarlet nails looks to me like youve just finished scratching somebodys eyes out gimme a lemonade and some of that huckleberry with french vanilla on top earleen rather pleased with tuckers description of her nails josie ran them through her artfully tangled mane of black hair justine wouldve liked to scratch mine out grinning she picked up her diet coke and sipped through the straw she was over at the beauty parlor getting her roots done and flapping her hand around to show everybody this eensy speck of glass she called a diamond will probably won it knocking down bottles at the fair tuckers golden eyes twinkled jealous josie she stiffened up bottom lip poking out then her face cleared as she tossed back her head and hooted if id wanted him idve had him but outside of bed he just about bored me senseless she stirred what was left of her soda with the straw and sent a quick flirtatious look over her shoulder at two boys lounging in a booth they puffed up quickly sucking in beer guts weve got this burden you and i do tuck about being damn near irresistible to the opposite sex after smiling at earleen he dug into his pie yeah its our cross to bear josie drummed her newly painted nails on the counter for the pleasure of hearing them click the restlessness that had driven her to marry and divorce twice within five years had been flaring up for weeks nearly time to move on she thought a few months back in innocence made her yearn for the excitement of anywhere else and a few months anywhere else made her yearn for the quiet aimlessness of her hometown someone had popped a quarter in a juke and randy travis was crooning about the miseries of love josie drummed her fingers in time and scowled at tucker as he shoveled in huckleberries and ice cream i dont see how you can eat like that in the middle of the day tucker scooped up more pie i just open my mouth and swallow and never gain a goddamn ounce i have to watch every blessed thing i eat or my hipsll be as wide as mamie gantreys she stuck a finger in tuckers ice cream and scooped up a lick whatre you doing in town besides stuffing your face errands for delia passed a car turning into the mcnair place hmmm josie might have given that piece of news more attention but burke truesdale strolled in she wriggled straighter in her chair crossing long smooth legs and sent him a honeydripping smile hi there burke josie he came over to give tucker a thump on the back tuck whatre you two up to just passing the time josie said burke was six feet of solid muscle with a linebackers shoulders and a squarejawed face softened by puppydog eyes although he was dwaynes contemporary he was closer to tucker in friendship and he was one of the few men josie had wanted and done without burke rested one hip on a stool his heavy ring of keys jangling his sheriffs badge winked dully in the sunlight too hot to do anything else he muttered a thanks to earleen when she set an iced tea in front of him burke guzzled it down without taking a breath josie licked her top lip as she watched his adams apple bob miss ediths kins moving into the house burke announced as he set the glass aside miss caroline waverly some kind of fancy musician from philadelphia earleen had refilled his glass and this time he sipped slowly she called down to have the phone and power hooked up how longs she staying earleen always had her eyes and ears open for news as proprietress of the chat n chew it was her right and her duty didnt say miss edith wasnt one to talk about her family overmuch but i do remember hearing she had a granddaughter who traveled around with an orchestra or something must pay well tucker mused i saw her car turn into the lane fifteen minutes ago she was driving a brand new bmw burke waited until earleen had moved away tuck i need to talk to you about dwayne though his face remained passive and friendly tuckers shield slid into place what about he got juiced up again last night had a pushyshovy going over at mcgreedys i put him up in a cell for the night now there was a change a darkening of the eyes a grimness around the mouth you charge him with anything come on tuck more hurt than offended burke shifted his feet he was raising hell and too drunk to drive i figured he could use a place to sleep it off last time i drove him home in the middle of the night miss delia was spitting mad yeah tucker relaxed there were friends there was family and there was burke who was a combination of both wheres he now over at the jail nursing a hangover i figured since youre here you could haul him home we can get his car back later on much obliged his quiet words masked the raw disappointment in his gut dwayne had been on the wagon nearly two weeks this time once hed fallen tucker knew it would be a long slippery climb back on tucker stood pulling out his wallet when the door slammed open behind him rattling glasses on the back shelves he glanced around he saw edda lou hatinger and knew he was in trouble bellycrawling bastard she spat out and launched herself at him if burke hadnt retained the same reflexes that had made him a star receiver in high school tucker might have had his face sheared off hey hey burke said helplessly while edda lou fought like a bobcat you think you can toss me off just like that edda lou from experience tucker kept his voice low and calm take a deep breath youre going to hurt yourself her small teeth bared in a snarl im going to hurt you you fucking weasel with reluctance burke slipped into his sheriffs mode girl you pull yourself together or ill have to take you over to the jail your daddy wouldnt be happy about that either she hissed through her teeth i wont lay a hand on the sonofabitch when burkes grip loosened she slipped free dusting herself off if you want to talk about this tucker began were going to talk about it all right here and now she swung in a circle while customers either stared or pretended not to colorful plastic bracelets clicked on her arms perspiration gave a sheen to her face and neck yall listen up you hear i got something to say to mr bigshot longstreet edda lou tucker took a chance and touched her arm she swung out backhanded and knocked his teeth together no wiping his mouth he waved burke away let her get it out ill get it out all right you said you loved me i never did that that tucker could be sure of even in the throes of passion he was careful with words especially in the throes of passion you made me think you did she shouted at him the powdery spray she was wearing was overwhelmed by the hot sweat of temper and combined in a sicklysweet aroma that reminded tucker of something freshly dead you wheedled your way into bed with me you said i was the woman youd been waiting for you said tears began to mix with the sweat on her face turning her mascara into wet clumps under her eyes you said we were going to get married oh no tuckers temper which he preferred not to have riled began to stir that was your idea honey and i told you flat out it wasnt going to happen whats a girl to think when you come whistling up bringing flowers and buying fancy wine you said you cared about me more than anybody else i did care and he had he always did you dont care about nothing or nobody only tucker longstreet she pushed her face into his spit flying seeing her like this all the sweetness and flutters gone he wondered how he could have cared and he hated the fact that some of the boys whod been lounging over their sodas were elbowing each others ribs and chuckling then youre better off without me arent you he dropped two bills on the counter you think youre going to get off that easy her hand clamped like iron on his arm he could feel her muscles quiver you think you can toss me off like you did all the others shed be damned if he would not when shed hinted marriage to all her girlfriends not when shed gone all the way into greenville to moon over the wedding gowns she knew she knew half the town would already be smirking about it youve got an obligation to me you made promises name one his temper building he pried a clutching hand from his arm im pregnant it burst out of her on a flood of desperation she had the satisfaction of hearing a mutter pass from booth to booth and of watching tucker pale what did you say her lips curved then in a hard merciless smile you heard me tuck now youd better decide what youre going to do about it tossing up her head she spun around and stormed out tucker waited for his stomach to slide back down from his throat oops josie said grinning broadly at the goggleeyed diners but her hand went down to take her brothers ten bucks says shes lying still reeling tucker stared at her what i say shes no more pregnant than you are oldest female trick in the book tucker dont get your dick caught in it he needed to think and he wanted to be alone to do it you get dwayne over at the jail will you and pick up delias stuff why dont we but he was already walking out josie sighed thinking the shit was going to hit the fan he hadnt told her what delia wanted chapter two dwayne longstreet sat on the rockiron bunk in one of the towns two jail cells and moaned like a wounded dog the three aspirin hed downed had yet to take effect and the army of chain saws buzzing inside his head were getting mighty close to the brain he took his head out of his hands long enough to slurp down more of the coffee burke had left him then clamped it tight again afraid it would fall off half hoping it would as always during the first hour after waking from a toot dwayne despised himself he hated knowing that hed strolled smiling into the same ugly trap again not the drinking no dwayne liked drinking he liked that first hot taste of whiskey when it hit the tongue slid down the throat settled into the belly like a long slow kiss from a pretty woman he liked the friendly rush that spread into his head after the second drink hell he fucking loved it he didnt even mind getting drunk no there was something to be said about that floating time after youd knocked back five or six when everything looked fine and funny when you forgot your life had turned ugly on you that youd lost the wife and kids youd never wanted much in the first place to some fucking shoe salesman that you were stuck in a dusty pisshole of a town because there was no place else to go yeah he liked that floaty forgetful time just fine he didnt particularly care for what happened after that when your hand kept reaching for the bottle without warning the rest of you what was coming when you stopped tasting and kept on swallowing just because the whiskey was there and so were you he didnt like the fact that sometimes the drink turned him nasty so he wanted to pick a fight any fight god knew he wasnt a meantempered man that was his father but sometimes just sometimes the whiskey turned him into beau and he was sorry for it what scared him was that there were times when he couldnt quite remember if hed turned nasty or just passed out quietly whenever that happened he was more than likely going to wake up in the cell with a hangover fit to kill gingerly knowing that the movement could change the busy loggers in his head into a swarm of angry bees he got to his feet the sun streaming through the bars at the window all but blinded him dwayne shielded his eyes with the flat of his hand as he groped his way out of the cell burke never locked him in dwayne fumbled his way into the bathroom and whizzed out what felt like a gallon of the wild turkey that had filtered through his kidneys wishing miserably for his own bed he splashed cold water in his face until his eyes stopped burning he hissed through his teeth when the door slammed in the outer office and whimpered just a little when josie cheerfully called his name dwayne are you in here its your own sweet sister come to bust you out when he stepped into the doorway to lean weakly on the jamb josie raised her carefully plucked brows my oh my you look like something three cats had to drag in she stepped closer tapping a bright red nail on her bottom lip honey how do you see through all that blood in your eyes did i he coughed to clear the rust out of his throat did i wreck a car not that i know of now you come on along with josie she moved to him to take his arm when he turned his head she stepped back fast sweet jesus how many men have you killed with that breath clucking her tongue she dug in her purse and pulled out a box of tic tacs here now honey you chew on a couple of these she popped them into his mouth herself otherwise im likely to faint if you breathe on me delias going to be real pissed he mumbled as he let josie guide him to the door i expect she will but when she finds out about tucker shell forget all about you tucker oh shit dwayne staggered back as the sun slammed into his eyes shaking her head josie pulled out her sunglasses the ones with the little rhinestones circling the lenses and handed them to him tuckers in trouble or edda lous claiming he got her in trouble but well see about that christ almighty for a brief moment his own problems faded away tuck got edda lou knocked up josie opened the passenger door of her car so dwayne could pour himself in she made a big scene over at the chat n chew so everybody in towns going to be watching to see if her belly bloats christ almighty ill say this josie started the car and was sympathetic enough to flick off the radio whether shes knocked up or not hed better think twice before moving that whiny slut into the house dwayne would have agreed wholeheartedly but he was too busy holding his head tucker knew better than to go back to the house della would be on him in a new york minute he needed some time alone and once he drove through sweetwaters gates he wouldnt get any on impulse he swerved to the side of the road leaving a streak of rubber on the sweaty macadam with home still the best part of a mile away he left his car on the grassy verge and walked into the trees the paralyzing heat lessened by a few stingy degrees once he was under the shelter of green leaves and dripping moss still he wasnt looking to cool his skin but his mind for one moment back at the diner for one hot hazyred moment hed wanted to grab edda lou by the throat and squeeze every last accusing breath out of her he didnt care for the impulse or for the fact that hed taken an instants sheer pleasure from the image half of what shed said had been lies but that meant half of what shed said had been the truth he shoved a lowhanging branch aside ducked and made his way through the heavy summer growth to the water a heron startled at the intrusion folded up her long graceful legs and glided off deeper into the bayou tucker kept an eye out for snakes as he settled down on a log taking his time he pulled out a cigarette pinched a miserly bit from the tip then lighted it hed always liked the water not so much the pound and thrust of the ocean but the still darkness of shady ponds the murmur of streams the steady pulse of the river even as a boy hed been drawn to it using the excuse of fishing to sit and think or sit and doze listening to the plop of frogs and the monotonous drone of cicadas hed had only childish problems to face then whether he was going to get skinned for that d in geography how to finesse a new bike for christmas and later whether he should ask arnette or carolanne to the valentines day dance as you got older problems swelled he remembered grieving for his father when the old man went and got himself killed in that cessna traveling down to jackson but that had been nothing nothing at all compared to the sharp stunning misery hed felt when he found his mother crumpled in her garden already too close to death for any doctor to fix her seizured heart hed come here often then to ease himself past the misery and eventually like all things it had faded except at the odd moments when hed glance out a window half expecting to see her face shaded by that big straw hat with the chiffon scarf trailing clipping overblown roses madeline longstreet would not have approved of edda lou she would naturally have found her coarse cheap and cunning and tucker thought as he slowly drew in and expelled smoke would have expressed her disapproval by that excruciating politeness any true southern lady could hone to a razoredged weapon his mother had been a true southern lady edda lou on the other hand was a fine piece of work physically speaking bigbreasted widehipped with skin she kept dewy by slathering on vaseline intensive care lotion every morning and night of her life she had an eager hardworking mouth willing hands and by god hed enjoyed her he hadnt loved her nor had he claimed to tucker considered promises of love a cheap tool for persuading a woman into bed hed shown her a good time in bed and out he wasnt a man to stop the courtship process once a woman had spread her legs but the minute shed started hinting about marriage hed taken a long step back first hed given her a coolingoff period taking her out maybe twice in a twoweek period and cutting off sex completely hed told her flat out that he had no intention of getting married but hed seen by the smug look in her eye she hadnt believed him so hed broken it off shed been tearful but civilized tucker saw now that shed believed shed be able to reel him back tucker also had no doubt now that shed heard hed been seen with someone else all of that mattered and none of it mattered if edda lou was pregnant he was pretty sure that despite precautions he was the one whod made her so now he had to figure out what to do about it he was surprised austin hatinger hadnt already come looking for him with his shotgun loaded austin wasnt the most understanding of men and hed never been fond of the longstreets the fact was he hated them and had ever since madeline larue had chosen beau longstreet ending forever austins blind dream of marrying her himself since then austin had turned into one mean hardbitten son of a bitch it was common knowledge that he slapped his wife around when the mood was on him he used the same thumping discipline with each of his five children the oldest of which aj was now serving time in jackson for grand theft auto austin had spent a few nights behind bars himself assault assault and battery disorderly conduct usually carried out while spouting scripture or calling on the lord tucker figured it was only a matter of time before austin came after him with that shotgun or those hamsized fists hed just have to deal with it just as hed have to deal with his responsibility to edda lou responsibility was what it was and hed be damned if hed marry responsibility she might have been skilled in bed but she couldnt keep up her end of a conversation with a hydraulic jack and hed discovered she was as smallbrained and cunning as a shefox that was one thing he wasnt about to face over breakfast every morning for the rest of his life hed do what he could and what was right there was money and there was his time that much he could give and maybe once the worst of the anger wore off hed feel affection for the child if not for the mother he hoped thered be affection rather than this sick feeling in his gut tucker scrubbed his hands over his face and wished edda lou would just disappear that she would pay for that ugly scene in the diner where shed made him look worse than he was if he could just think of a way hed he heard a rustle in the leaves and swung toward it if edda lou had followed him she was going to find him not only ready to fight but eager when caroline stepped into the clearing she muffled a scream there in the shady spot where shed once fished with her grandfather was a man golden eyes hard as agate fists clenched mouth pulled back dangerously in something between a snarl and a sneer she looked around desperately for a weapon then realized shed have to depend on herself what are you doing here tucker shucked off the tough shell as quickly as he might have peeled off his shirt just watching the water he flashed her a quick selfdeprecating smile that was supposed to signal he was harmless i didnt expect to run across anyone the taut and ready stance had relaxed into idleness but caroline was not convinced he was harmless his voice was smooth with that lazy drawl that could so easily be mocking though his eyes were smiling at her there was such melting sexuality in them that she was ready to run if he so much as leaned toward her who are you tucker longstreet maam i live just down the road im trespassing again that dont worry about a thing smile sorry if i gave you a turn miss edith didnt mind if i wandered in here to sit so i didnt think to stop by the house and ask you are caroline waverly yes she found her own stiff answer rude in the face of his country manners to soften it she smiled but didnt lose that reserved tensed stance you startled me mr longstreet oh just make that tucker smiling he took her measure a tad too thin he thought but she had a face as pale and elegant as the cameo his mama had worn on a black velvet ribbon usually he preferred long hair on a woman but the short style suited her graceful neck and huge eyes he tucked his thumbs in his pockets were neighbors after all we tend to be friendly round innocence this one she thought could charm the bark off a tree shed known another like him and whether the words were delivered in a southern drawl or a spanish lilt they were deadly she nodded regally he thought i was just taking a look around the property she continued i didnt expect to come across anyone its a pretty spot you settling in all right if you need anything all you have to do is holler i appreciate that but i think i can manage ive been here only an hour or so i know i passed you coming in on my way to town she started to come up with another bland response then her eyes narrowed in a red porsche this time his grin was slow and wide and devastating shes a beauty huh it was caroline who stepped forward eyes hot you irresponsible idiot you must have been doing ninety shed gone from being fragile and lovely to downright beautiful with that flush of heat in her cheeks tucker kept his thumbs in his pockets hed always figured if you couldnt avoid a womans temper you might as well enjoy it nope as i recollect i was just coming up on eighty now shell do a hundred and twenty in a good straightaway but you almost hit me he seemed to consider the possibility then shook his head no i had plenty of time to swing around probably looked closer from your point of view though i sure am sorry for giving you a scare twice in the same day but the glitter in his eyes had nothing to do with apology mostly i try to have a different effect on a pretty woman if there was one thing carolines mother had pounded into her head it was dignity she caught herself before she could sputter you have no business being on the road at all i should report you to the police all that yankee indignation tickled him well you can do that all right maam you call into town and ask for burke thats burke truesdale hes the sheriff and your cousin no doubt she said between her teeth no maam though his baby sister did marry a second cousin of mine if she assumed he was a southern rube hed oblige they moved across the river into arkansas my cousin thats billy earl larue hes on my mamas side he and meggie thats burkes baby sister they run one of those storage places you know where people store furniture or cars or whatever by the month doing right well too im delighted to hear it thats neighborly of you his smile was as slow and easy as the water beside him you be sure to tell burke i said hey when you talk to him though he was taller by several inches caroline managed to look down her nose at him i think we both know it would do very little good now ill thank you to get off my property mr longstreet and if you want to sit and watch the water again find someplace else to do it she turned and had taken two steps before tuckers voice and dammit it was mocking called out to her miz waverly welcome to innocence yall have a nice day now you hear she kept walking and tucker being a prudent man waited until he figured she was out of earshot before he started to laugh if he werent up to his neck in quicksand hed enjoy teasing that pretty yankee on a regular basis damn if she hadnt made him feel better edda lou was primed and ready shed been worried that shed botched things by going on a rampage after she heard tucker had taken that bitch chrissy fuller over to greenville to dinner and the movies but for once it seemed her temper had worked in her favor that scene in the diner and her public humiliation of tucker had brought him around as surely as a brass ring through his nose oh it could be that hed try to sweettalk her into letting him off the hook tucker longstreet had the smoothest tongue in bolivar county but he wasnt going to waggle himself loose with it this time she was going to have a ring on her finger and a marriage license in her hand quick as a lick shed wipe the smug look off every face in innocence when she moved into the big house and she edda lou hatinger whod grown up on a dirt farm with dusty chickens squawking in the yard and the smell of pork grease forever in the kitchen would wear fine clothes and sleep in a soft bed and drink french champagne for breakfast she had a fondness for tucker and that was the truth but she had more room in her thirsty heart for his house his name and his bank account and when she swept into innocence shed do it in a long pink caddy thered be no more working the register at larssons no more scraping pennies together so she could keep her room at the boardinghouse instead of living at home where her daddy would as soon smack her as look at her sideways shed be a longstreet weaving her fantasies she pulled her rattletrap impala to the side of the road she didnt question the fact that tuckers note had asked her to meet him back at the pond she found it sweet edda lou had fallen in love as much as her avaricious heart would allow because tucker was so downright romantic he didnt grab and grope like some of those who sidled up to her at mcgreedys he didnt always want to get right into her pants either like most of the men she dated no tucker liked to talk and though half the time she didnt know what in the blue blazes he was talking about still she appreciated the courtesy and he was generous with presents bottles of perfume bunches of posies once when theyd had a spat shed made herself cry buckets that had landed her a genuine silk nightie once they were married shed have herself a whole drawerful if she wanted and one of those american express credit cards to buy them with the moon was full enough so she didnt bother with a flashlight she didnt want to spoil the mood she fluffed her long blond hair then tugged her skinny tank top down until her ripe breasts all but spilled over the edge her hotpink shorts cut into her crotch a bit but she figured the effect was worth it if she played her cards right tucker would have her out of them in no time just thinking of it made her damp nobody did it like tucker why sometimes when he was touching her she forgot all about his money she wanted him inside her tonight not only for the thrill of doing it outside but because the timing was just right with luck her claim about being pregnant would be fact before morning she moved through the thick leaves the vines through the heady smells of wet and honeysuckle and her own perfume moonlight spilled onto the ground in shifting patterns country born and country raised she didnt shiver at the night sounds the plop and peep of frogs the rustle of marsh grasses the high song of cicadas or rude hoot from owls she caught the glint of yellow eyes that might have been a coon or a fox but they vanished when she stepped closer some small victim squealed in the grass edda lou paid no more attention to the sound of the creatures death than a new yorker would have to the commonplace wail of a siren this was the place of the night hunter the owl and the fox she was too pragmatic a woman to consider herself as prey her feet were silent on the soft ground and marshy grasses moonlight filtered over her turning the skin she religiously pampered into something almost as elegant as marble and because she was smiling certain in her victory there was a kind of hot beauty to her face tucker she used the littlegirl voice that was her way of wheedling im sorry im late honey she stopped by the pond and though her night vision was almost as sharp as a cats saw nothing but water and rock and thick vegetation her mouth thinned erasing the beauty shed purposely arrived late wanting to keep him sweating for ten or fifteen minutes in a huff she sat on the log where tucker had sat only hours before but she didnt feel his presence only annoyance that she had come running when hed crooked his finger and he hadnt even crooked it in person but with a stingy little note meet me at mcnair pond at midnight well fix everything i only want to be alone with you for a little while and wasnt that just like him edda lou thought making her go all soft saying how he wanted to be alone with her then pissing her off because he was late five minutes she decided that was all he was getting then she was going to drive on up the road right through those fancy gates and up to the big house shed let tucker longstreet know that he couldnt play around with her affections at the whisper of sound behind her she turned her head prepared to flutter her lashes the blow to the base of her skull had her tumbling facedown in the earth her moan was muffled edda lou heard it in her head and her head felt as though it had been split in two by a dull rock she tried to lift it oh but it hurt it hurt when she started to bring her hands up to hold the ache she found them stuck tight behind her the first quiver of fear pierced through the pain opening her eyes wide she tried to call out but her mouth was gagged she could taste the cloth and the cologne that scented it her eyes rolled wildly as she fought to work her hands free she was naked and her bare back and buttocks were scraping into bark as she wriggled against the tree shed been tied hand and foot to a live oak her feet expertly cinched so that her legs were spread in a vulnerable v visions of rape danced hideously through her mind edda lou edda lou the voice was low and harsh like the scrape of metal against rock edda lous terrified eyes wheeled in their sockets as she tried to find the source all she saw was the water and the thick black of clustered leaves she tried to scream and choked on the gag ive had my eye on you i wondered how soon wed get together like this romantic isnt it being naked in the moonlight and were all alone you and me all alone lets have sex paralyzed with terror she watched the figure slip out of the shadows saw the moonlight glint on naked skin saw it flash for one hideous instant on the longbladed knife now it was terror and revulsion she felt as she recognized what was coming toward her her stomach clenched and rolled and she tasted sickness on her tongue but the figure came closer gilded by a fine sheen of sweat and smelling of madness her pleas and prayers were smothered by the gag thin streams of blood ran down her back and legs as she twisted desperately against the tree the hands were on her squeezing stroking and the mouth hot frightened tears slid down her cheeks as the mouth closed hungrily over her defenseless breasts slick with sweat the body rubbed against hers doing things she didnt want to believe could be done to her her weeping was mindless now her body shuddering at every touch of the wet mouth the intruding fingers the smooth flat of the buck knife for she had remembered what had happened to arnette and francie and knew they had felt this same numb terror felt the same sick revulsion in the last moments of their lives you want it you want it the breathless chant rolled over the dull buzzing in eddas brain whore the knife turned slicing delicately almost painlessly down edda lous arm as the mouth closed greedily over the wound edda lou slumped into a half faint no you dont a hand slapped playfully across her face to revive her no sleeping on the job for whores there was a quick almost giggly laugh blood smeared the smiling lips edda lous glazed eyes opened and fixed better thats better i want you to watch ready please please please her mind screamed dont kill me i wont tell i wont tell i wont tell no the voice was husky with arousal and edda lou smelled her own fear her own blood when that face leaned close to hers with madness shining out of eyes shed known very well youre not worth fucking one hand ripped aside the gag part of the pleasure the need was to hear that one high scream it was cut off as the knife slashed edda lous throat caroline sat straight up in bed heart thudding like a maytag with an unbalanced load she was clutching both hands to it nearly ripping her thin sleep shirt in reaction a scream she thought wildly while her ragged breathing echoed in the room who was screaming she was nearly out of bed and fumbling for the light when she remembered where she was and sagged back against the pillows not philadelphia not baltimore or new york or paris she was in rural mississippi sleeping in the bed her grandparents had slept in night sounds seemed to fill the room peepers crickets cicadas and owls she heard another scream eerily like a womans screech owls they called them she remembered now her grandmother had soothed her one night during that longago visit when the same rusty cry had awakened her just an old screech owl pumpkin pie dont you worry now youre safe as a bug in a rug closing her eyes caroline listened to the long whooowhooo of another bettermannered owl country sounds she assured herself and tried to ignore the creaking and settling of the old house soon they would seem as natural to her as the whoosh of traffic or the whine of distant sirens it was just as her grandmother had told her she was safe as a bug in a rug chapter three tucker sat on the side terrace where purple clematis wound up the white wicker trellis a hummingbird streaked behind him iridescent wings a flashing blur as it hovered to drink deeply from one of the wide tender blooms inside delias electrolux hummed busily the sound drifted through the screened windows to mix with the drone of bees underneath the glass table sprawled the aged family hound buster a huddle of loose skin and old bones occasionally he worked up the energy to thump his tail and look hopefully through the glass at tuckers breakfast tucker wasnt paying conscious attention to any of the morning sounds and scents he absorbed them in the same absent way he absorbed the chilled juice black coffee and toast he was performing one of his favorite daily rituals reading the mail as always there was a stack of fashion catalogues and magazines for josie he tossed them one at a time onto the padded seat beside him each time a catalogue plopped buster would shift his rheumy old eyes hopefully then mutter in canine disgust there was a letter for dwayne from nashville addressed in sissys childishly correct handwriting tucker frowned at it a minute held it up to the sunlight then set it aside he knew it wasnt a request for child support as family bookkeeper he made out the monthly checks himself and had sent one two weeks before in keeping with his filing system he tossed bills on another chair personal correspondence was shoved over to the other side of the coffeepot and those letters obviously from a charitable organization or some other group sneakily begging for money were tossed in a paper sack at his side tuckers way of handling them was to dig into the bag once a month choosing two envelopes at random those would receive generous contributions whether they were for the world wildlife fund the american red cross or the society for the prevention of hangnails in this way tucker felt the longstreets were fulfilling their charitable obligations and if certain organizations were confused when they received a check for several thousand dollars one month and nothing for several years thereafter he figured it was their problem he had problems of his own the simple routine of sorting the mail helped shift those problems to the back of his mind at least for the moment the fact was he didnt know what his next move should be since edda lou wasnt even talking to him shed had two days to follow up on her staggering public announcement but was apparently playing possum not only hadnt she contacted him but she wasnt answering her phone it was worrying particularly since hed had a taste of her temper and knew she could lash out with the stealth and skill of a water moccasin waiting for the sting made tucker jumpy he piled up the you are a winner envelopes dwayne liked to ship off to his kids and found the lilaccolored and scented stationery that could only belong to one person cousin lulu his grin flashed and his worries drained away lulu longstreet boyston was from the georgia longstreets and a cousin of tuckers grandfather speculation put her age in the midseventies though she had stubbornly clung to sixtyfive for many years she was spitinyourface rich a dainty five foot in her sensible shoes and crazy as a june bug tucker flat out adored her though the letter was addressed to my longstreet cousins he ripped it open himself he wasnt about to wait until dwayne and josie wandered back from wherever theyd gone he read the first paragraph written with a hotpink felt tip and let out a hoot cousin lulu was coming to call she always phrased it just that way so you could never tell if shed stay for dinner or settle in for a month tucker sincerely hoped it was the latter he needed a distraction the last time shed come to call shed brought along a whole crate of ice cream cakes packed in dry ice and had worn a paper party hat with an ostrich feather poking through the pointy top shed kept that damn hat on for a full week waking and sleeping saying she was celebrating birthdays anybodys birthday tucker licked strawberry jam from his fingers then tossed the rest of his toast to buster leaving the rest of the mail to be picked up later he started toward the door he was going to tell delia to have cousin lulus room ready and waiting even as he swung open the door tucker heard the dyspeptic rattle of austin hatingers pickup there was only one vehicle in innocence that made that particular gruntrattlebelch sound after giving one brief thought to going inside and barring the doors tucker turned and walked out to the porch prepared to face the music not only could he hear austin coming he could see him by the stream of black smoke rising up between the magnolias with a halfhearted sigh tucker waited for the truck to come into view and pulling a cigarette out of his pocket broke off a fraction of the tip he was just enjoying his first drag when the truck pulled up and austin hatinger rolled out of it he was as grizzled and bulky as the old ford but was held together by sinew and muscle rather than bailing twine and spit beneath his greasestained planters hat his face looked as if it had been carved out of tree bark deep lines flared out from his walnutcolored eyes scored his windburned cheeks and bracketed his hard unsmiling mouth not a speck of hair showed beneath the hat not that austin was bald every month he drove into the barber shop and had his grayflecked hair buzzed perhaps tucker sometimes thought in memory of the four years hed served in the corps semper fi that was just one of the sentiments he had tattooed on his cinderblock arms along with it rippling over muscle was the american flag austin who would be the first to tell you he was a godfearing christian had never gone in for such frivolities as dancing girls he spit a stream of red indian into the gravel heaving a nastylooking puddle of yellow beneath his dusty overalls and sweaty work shirt which even in the heat austin wore buttoned clear to the top his chest was broad as a bulls tucker noted that he hadnt brought out any of the rifles slotted into the rack in the back window of the cab he hoped he could take that courtesy as a good omen austin he came down one step a sign of marginal friendliness longstreet he had a voice like a rusty nail skidding over concrete where the hell is my girl since it was the last question tucker expected he only blinked politely excuse me you godless rutting fuck where the hell is my edda lou the description was a little more along the lines of what tucker had expected i havent seen edda lou since day before yesterday when she went at me in the diner he held up a hand before austin could speak there was still something to be said for being part of the most powerful family in the county you can be as pissed as you want austin and id expect that to be mighty damn pissed but the fact is i slept with your daughter he took a long slow drag you probably had a pretty good idea what i was doing when i was doing it and i dont figure you liked it much and i dont figure i can blame you for it austins lips peeled back from yellowed uneven teeth no one would have mistaken it for a smile i shoulda skinned your worthless hide the first time you came sniffing around her maybe but seeing as eddas been over twentyone for a couple years or more she does her own choosing tucker drew on the cigarette again considered the tip then flicked it aside the point is austin whats dones done easy to say when you planted a bastard in my daughters belly with her full cooperation tucker said slipping his hands into his pockets im going to see to it that she has everything she needs while shes carrying the baby and therell be no pinching on the child support big talk austin spat again smooth talk youve always been able to get your tongue around words real good tucker now you listen to a few i take care of my own and i want that girl out here now tucker merely lifted a brow you think eddas here shes not liar fornicator his grating voice rose and fell like an evangelists with strep throat your souls black with sin i cant argue about that tucker said as agreeably as he could but edda lous not here ive got no reason to lie about that and you can take a look for yourself but im telling you i havent seen or heard from her since she made her grand announcement austin considered barging into the house and he considered just what kind of fool that would make him he wasnt about to play the fool for a longstreet she aint here she aint nowhere in town i tell you what i think you sonofabitch i think you talked her into going to one of those murder clinics to get rid of it edda lou and i havent talked about anything if thats what shes done she came up with it all on her own hed forgotten just how fast the big man could move before the last word was out of his mouth austin had leapt forward grabbing him by the shirt and lifting him clean off the steps dont you talk that way about my girl she was a godfearing christian before she got hooked up with you look at you nothing but a lazy rutting pig living in your big fine house with your drunk of a brother and whore of a sister fine spit sprayed tuckers face as austins skin turned a mottled angry red youll rot in hell the lot of you just like your sinsoaked father as a matter of course tucker preferred to talk charm or run his way out of confrontations but there was always a point no matter how he tried to prevent it when pride and temper kicked in he plowed a fist into austins midsection surprising the older man enough to make him loosen his grip you listen to me you sanctimonious bastard youre dealing with me not my family just me i told you once ill do right by edda lou and im not telling you again if you think i was the first one to get her on her back then youre crazier than i figured he was getting himself worked up and knew better but the embarrassment the annoyance and the insult outweighed caution and dont think being lazy means stupid i know damn well what shes trying to do if the pair of you think that screams and threats are going to have me dancing down the aisle then think again the muscles in austins jaw quivered so shes good enough to fuck but not good enough to marry that says it plain enough tucker was quick enough to duck the first swing but not the second austins hamsized fist shot into his gut stealing his breath and doubling him over he took a rain of blows on the face and neck before he managed to find the wind to defend himself he tasted blood smelled it the fact that it was his own sent a ripe dazzling fury pouring through him he didnt feel the pain when his knuckles rammed into austins chin but the power of the punch sang up his arm it felt good damn good a part of him continued to think with a silveredged clarity he had to stay on his feet he would never match austin for size or strength and had to depend on agility and quickness if he was brought down and managed to get up again hed likely do so with broken bones and a bloody pulp for a face he took one just beneath the ear and heard the archangels sing fists thudded against bone blood and sweat flew out in a grisly spray as they grappled lips peeled back in animal snarls tucker realized it wasnt simply his pride he was defending it was his life there was a dull gleam of madness in austins eyes that spoke more clearly than hard grunts or sneering curses the sight of it had a snake of panic curling in tuckers gut his worst fears were realized when austin came at him head down bulldozer body behind it he let out a long triumphant cry as tuckers feet skidded on the gravel and he went flying backward into the peonies his wind was gone he could hear the pathetic wheeze of air struggling to get down his throat and into his lungs but he still had his fury and he had fear when he started to scrabble up austin fell on him one beefy hand closing over tuckers throat the other pummeling his kidneys even as he levered a hand under austins chin frantically struggling to pry the head up and away his vision dimmed all he could see were those eyes bright now with the pleasure of the kill blank with madness send you to satan austin chanted send you to satan shouldve killed you before beau shouldve done it feeling his life passing tucker went for the eyes austin threw back his head and howled like a wounded cur when his hand slipped off tuckers throat tucker sucked air in big greedy gulps that burned and revived you crazy sonofabitch im not my father he choked gagged and managed to haul himself to his hands and knees he was terrified he would toss his breakfast into the crushed peonies get the hell off my land he turned his head and felt a moments thrill of satisfaction at seeing austins bloodied face hed given as good as hed got and a man couldnt ask for more unless it was a cool shower an ice pack and a bottle of aspirin he started to sit back on his heels quick as a snake austins hand darted out for one of the heavy stones that circled the peonies good christ was all tucker could manage as austin levered the stone over his head the shotgun blast had them both jolting pellets skimmed through the peonies ive got another full barrel you bastard delia said from the porch and its aiming right at your useless dick you put that stone back where you got it and mighty quick cause my fingers dripping sweat the madness was fading tucker could actually see it drain out of austins eyes to be replaced by a violent but somehow saner anger it probably wont kill you delia said conversationally she was standing on the edge of the porch the resting comfortably on her shoulder her eye at the sight and a grim smile on her face you might have another twenty years to pee in a plastic bag austin dropped the stone the sickening thud it made when it hit the mulch had tuckers stomach lurching for judgment i am come austin quoted hes going to pay for what he did to my girl payings just what hell do delia said if that girls carrying whats his tuckerll see to it but i aint as gullible as the boy austin and were going to see whats what before he signs any papers or writes any checks fists clenched at his side austin rose you saying my girls lying delia kept the shotgun sighted midbody im saying edda lous never been any better than she had to be and i aint saying i blame her for it now you get the hell off this land and if youre smart you get that girl to doc shays and have him see if shes breeding well talk this through civilized or you can come ahead and ill blow you apart austins impotent hands clenched and unclenched blood ran unheeded down his cheeks like tears ill be back he spat again as he turned to tucker and next time there wont be no woman round to protect you he strode back to his pickup gunned around the circle of flowers and rattled down the drive black smoke belched in his wake tucker sat in the ruined flower bed and dropped his head on his knees he wasnt getting up yet no not just yet hed sit a spell on the mangled blooms letting out a long breath delia lowered the gun carefully she propped it against the rail then walked down stepping over the border stones until she could reach tucker he looked up the beginnings of thanks on his tongue she smacked the side of his head hard enough to make his ears ring christ delia thats for thinking with your glands she smacked him again and thats for bringing that biblethumping maniac around my house and another flathanded slap on the top of his head and thats for ruining your mamas flowers with a satisfied nod she folded her arms over her chest now when you get your legs out from under you you come back into the kitchen and ill clean you up tucker wiped the back of his hand over his mouth and looked down absently at the smear of blood yesm because she figured her hands were about steady now she tipped a finger under his chin going to have a shiner she predicted but it looked to me like he was going to have a pair of em you didnt do too bad guess not gingerly he got to his knees again breathing shallowly he inched his way to his feet it felt as if hed been trampled by a herd of runaway horses ill do what i can with the flowers later see that you do she slipped an arm around his waist and taking his weight helped him inside though he didnt much care to get himself riled up on edda lous behalf tucker couldnt quite get past the niggling sense of worry in his gut he told himself to let crazy austin worry about his crazy daughter whod more than likely gone to ground for a few days to avoid her daddys wrath and to stir up tuckers guilt but he couldnt forget what it had been like to find sweet little francie floating those bloodless wounds gaping all over her fishwhite skin so he stuck on a pair of sunglasses to conceal the worst of the sunburst bruise on his left eye and downing two of the painkillers josie took for menstrual cramps set out to town the sun beat down mercilessly making him wish hed just crawled off to bed with an ice pack and a long whiskey that was what he was going to do once he talked to burke with any luck edda lou would be behind the counter at larssons selling tobacco and popsicles and bags of charcoal for barbecues but he could see plainly through the wide front window as he drove past and it was young gawky kirk larsson at the main counter not edda lou tucker pulled up in front of the sheriffs office if hed been alone he would have eased himself out inch by painful inch whimpering but the three old coots who always planted themselves out in front to chew the fat curse the weather and hope for gossip were in position straw hats covered grizzled heads windburned cheeks were puffed out with chaws and faded cotton shirts had gone limp with sweat hey there tucker mr bonny he nodded to the first man as was proper seeing that claude bonny was the eldest of the group all three had lived off social security for more than a decade and had staked out the awningshaded sidewalk in front of the rooming house as their retirement heaven mr koons mr ohara pete koons toothless since his forties and no fan of dentures spat through his gums into the tin bucket his grandniece provided boy looks like you ran into a mean woman or a jealous husband tucker managed a grin there were few secrets in town and a smart man chose his wisely nope a pissedoff papa charlie ohara gave a wheezy chuckle his emphysema wasnt getting any better and he figured hed die of it before another summer came so he appreciated all of lifes little jokes that austin hatinger when tucker jerked his head to the side in acknowledgment ohara wheezed again bad apple once saw him whale into toby march course toby was a black boy so nobody paid much mind mustve been in sixtynine stove in tobys ribs and scarred his face sixtyeight bonny corrected his crony because accuracy was important in such matters that was the summer we got the new tractor so i remember austin said tobyd stole a length of rope outta his shed but that was nonsense toby was a good boy and never took nothing wasnt his he come to work out on the farm with me after his ribs healed never had a bit of trouble outta him austins a mean one koons spat again either from need or to emphasize his point went to korea mean and came back meaner never did forgive your mama for marrying up when he was over there fighting slant eyes had his mind set on miss madeline though christ knows she never looked at him twice when he was smack in front of her he grinned toothlessly you taking him on as a daddyinlaw tuck not in this life yall dont work too hard now they chuckled and wheezed appreciatively as he made the turn and pushed open burkes door the sheriffs office was a steamy box of a room holding a metal army surplus desk two swivel chairs a scarred wooden rocker a gun cabinet for which burke held the keys on the heavy chain at his belt and a shiny new mr coffee a gift from burkes wife at christmas the wood floor was scattered with hard little dots of white paint from the last time the walls had been done beyond the office was a closetsized john and through the john a narrow storage room with metal shelves and just enough room for a foldup cot this was used if burke or his deputy needed to watch a prisoner overnight more often it was used if either man found himself in the domestic doghouse and needed to give his spouse a night to cool off tucker had always wondered how burke the son of a onceprosperous planter could be happy here making his living processing traffic tickets breaking up the occasional brawl and watching out for drunks but burke seemed content enough just as he seemed content to be married for nearly seventeen years to the girl hed gotten pregnant while they were both still in high school he wore his badge easily and was affable enough to remain popular in innocence where people didnt like to be told what they couldnt do tucker found him huddled over his desk frowning over files while the ceiling fan stirred stale smoke and hot air overhead burke hey tuck whatre youhe trailed off as he took in tuckers swollen face holy hell boy what did you run into tucker grimaced the movement costing him no little discomfort austins fists burke grinned howd he look delia says worse i was too busy holding my insides where they belonged to notice she probably didnt want to hurt your feelings knowing the truth of that tuck eased himself down on the frayed seat of the swivel chair probably still i dont think all the blood on my shirt was mine hope not edda lou yeah tucker poked gentle fingers under his sunglasses to probe his bruised eye socket way he sees it i debauched a lilywhite virgin whod never seen a dick before shit there you go tucker caught himself before he made the mistake of shrugging thing is shes twentyfive and i slept with her not her old man happy to hear that tuckers quick grin pulled at his puffy lip edda lous ma must close her eyes and pray to jesus every time he takes a poke at her then he sobered the image of austin pounding it to his frailboned miserableeyed wife too disturbing to dwell on thing is burke i want to do whats right he blew out a breath realizing there was more than one reason hed come into town this was the opening for the first one things worked out for you and susie yeah burke drew out a pack of chesterfields took one then tossed the pack across the desk for tucker we were too young and stupid to think they wouldnt he watched as tucker broke off a fraction of the tip and i loved her flat out loved her then still do he flipped his matches to tucker it hasnt been easy with marvella coming along before graduation our having to live with my folks for two years before we could afford our own place then susie pregnant again with tommy blowing out smoke he shook his head three babies in five years you could have kept your fly zipped burke grinned so could you yeah tucker blew smoke between his teeth well it comes to this i dont love edda lou flat out or any other way but ive got a responsibility i cant marry her burke cant do it burke tapped his ash into a metal ashtray that had once been blue and was now the color of smut i gotta say youd be a fool if you did he cleared his throat before venturing onto boggy ground susie tells me that eddas been bragging for weeks about how shes going to be living up in the big house with servants susie said she never paid it much mind but some of the others did sounds to me like that girl was set on life at sweetwater it was both a blow to his pride and a great relief so it had never been him tucker realized it had been the longstreet name but she must have figured that would get back to him sooner or later i came in to tell you i havent been able to get hold of her since that day in the diner austin came down on me figuring i was hiding her there at the house she been around town slowly burke crushed out his cigarette i cant say as ive seen her myself for a day or two probably with a girlfriend the idea settled him thing is burke ever since we found francie yeah burke felt a twang inside his gut you got anything on that or arnette nothing the failure had heat rising up his neck county sheriffs mostly in charge ive been working with the medical examiner and the state boys have helped but theres nothing solid some woman was sliced up in nashville last month if they can find a connection well call in the fbi no shit burke merely nodded he didnt like the idea of federal officers in his town taking over his job looking at him out of the corner of their city eyes and thinking he was a rube who couldnt lock up a passedout drunk it was remembering francie that had me worrying tucker continued ill ask around he rose wanting to do so quickly like you said shes probably staying with a girlfriend for a few days thinking thatll sweat you into a proposal yeah relieved that hed passed his burden onto burke tucker stood and limped to the door youll let me know first thing burke walked out with him took a long slow look at his town where hed been born and raised where his children raced the streets and his wife shopped where he could raise a finger in salute to anyone and be recognized and acknowledged look at that tucker let out a little sigh as he watched caroline waverly climb out of her bmw and stroll toward larrsons thats one long cool drink of water makes a man thirsty just to look edith mcnairs kin yep ran into her the other day talks like a duchess and has the biggest green eyes youve ever seen recognizing the signs burke chuckled youve got problems enough son its a weakness tucker limped a little as he walked to his car changing his mind he headed across the street i think ill go buy a pack of smokes burkes grin faded as he turned toward the rooming house he remembered francie too surely edda lou would have stayed close by to pressure tucker into marriage the fact that she hadnt left a sick taste in the back of his throat she was settling in just fine caroline told herself as she walked across the heatbaked lawn toward the trees the ladies shed met in larssons that afternoon had been more curious than she was used to but theyd also been friendly and warm it was nice to know if she got lonely she could drive into town for company shed particularly liked susie truesdale whod stopped in to buy a birthday card for her sister in natchez and had stayed for twenty minutes of course that longstreet man had come in as well to flirt with the women and dispense southernfried charm his dark glasses hadnt disguised the fact that hed been fighting when questioned about it hed milked sympathy from every female in the store his type always did she thought if luis had gotten a hangnail women were ready to donate blood thank god she was through with him with men with everything about them it had been pathetically easy for her to rebuff tuckers smooth charm miz caroline hed called her she remembered with a thin smile she was quite sure his eyes had been laughing behind those dark lenses a pity about his hands though she thought as she ducked under hanging moss they were really quite beautiful longfingered widepalmed it had been a shame to see the knuckles skinned and bruised annoyed she shook off the sympathy the moment hed strolled out limping slightly the women had begun to buzz about him and someone named edda lou caroline took a deep breath of the verdant smell of heat and green and smiled to herself it looked like our slipperysmooth mr longstreet had gotten himself into a nasty little mess his girlfriend was pregnant and screaming for marriage and according to the local gossip her father was the type whod be more than willing to load up the shotgun trailing a finger over a branch she began to scent the water lord she was a long way from philadelphia how could she have known it would be so peaceful and so entertaining to listen to the chatter about the town lothario shed enjoyed her halfhour visit to town the ladies talk about children recipes men sex she laughed a little apparently north or south when women got together sex was a favored topic but down here they were so frank about it who was sleeping with whom and who wasnt must be the heat she thought and sat down on the log to watch the water and listen to the music of early evening she was glad shed come to innocence every day she could feel herself healing the quiet the vicious sun that baked all of the energy out of you the simple beauty of water shaded by mosshung trees she was even getting used to the night noises and that blackerthannight country darkness the previous night she had slept for eight hours straight the first time in weeks and shed awakened without that plaguing headache it was working the solitude the serenity of smalltown and rural rituals the roots shed never been allowed to plant the roots her mother would have furiously denied existed had begun to take hold nothing and no one was going to pull them free again she might even try her hand at fishing the idea made her laugh and wonder if she still had a taste for catfish she shifted and picked up a pebble to toss in the water it made such a satisfying plop that she picked up another and another watching the ripples spread spotting a flatsided stone by the verge of the water she rose to pry it up it would be fun to try to skip it that too was an old almost forgotten image her grandfather standing here just here and trying to teach her how to skip the rock over the water pleased with the memory she bent curled her fingers around it odd she had the most ridiculous sensation of being watched stared at even as the first shiver worked down her spine she caught something white out of the corner of her eye she turned looked and froze even the scream turned to ice in her throat she was being stared at though the eyes that watched saw nothing there was only a face bobbing above the rippling surface of dark water with a hideous mop of long blond hair that had tangled and caught in the roots of an old tree her breath hitched coming through her lips in small terrified whimpers as she stumbled back but she couldnt take her eyes off that face the way the water lapped at the chin the way a shaft of sunlight beamed off those flat lifeless eyes it wasnt until she managed to throw her hands over her face blocking the image that she was able to draw the air to scream the sound echoed through the bayou bouncing off the dark water and sending birds streaking from the trees chapter four most of the sickness had passed sour waves of nausea still rose in her stomach but if she forced herself to breathe slowly caroline could manage to hold down a little tepid water she sipped again breathed deeply and waited for burke truesdale to come back out of the trees he hadnt asked her to go in with him she supposed hed taken one look at her face and known she wouldnt have made it ten feet even now as she sat on the top step of the porch her hands almost steady again she couldnt remember how shed gotten from the pond back to the house shed lost one of her shoes she noted absently one of those pretty navy and white flats shed bought in paris a few months before with glazed eyes she stared down at her bare foot streaked with dirt and grass frowning with concentration she toed the other shoe off it seemed important somehow that she have both feet bare after all someone might think she was crazy sitting there on the porch with one shoe on and with a body floating in the pond when her stomach pitched rolled and threatened to expel even the tap water she dropped her head between her knees oh she hated to be sick hated it with a passion only someone who had recently recovered from long illness could feel the weakness of it the shaky loss of control clenching her fists she used all her concentration to pull herself back from the edge what right did she have to be sick and scared and dizzy she was alive wasnt she alive and whole and safe not like that poor woman but she kept her head down until her stomach settled and the dull buzzing faded from her ears she lifted it again when she heard the sound of a car bumping down her lane caroline brought a weary hand up to her face as she watched the dusty station wagon squeeze through the overgrowth shed have to cut those vines back she thought she could hear them brushing against the already scarred paint of the car must be some clippers in the shed best to do it in the morning before the day heated up dully she watched the station wagon stop beside the sheriffs cruiser a wiry man with a red tie knotted around a turkey neck climbed out he wore a shortsleeved white shirt and a white hat atop a full head of hair hed dyed as densely black as coal and slicked into a modified pompadour pouches of loose flesh dipped below his jaw and his eyes as if the skin had once been full of fat or fluid and had stretched under the weight his black slacks were hauled up with sassy red suspenders and he wore the heavy shiny black tie shoes caroline associated with the military but the cracked leather bag he carried announced his profession you must be miz caroline his highpitched voice would have made her smile at any other time or place he sounded eerily like a usedcar salesman shed seen on the old rca console only the night before im doc shays he told her as he propped one foot on the bottom step i tended to your grandfolks near to twentyfive years caroline gave him a careful nod how do you do fine and dandy his sharp physicians eyes scanned her face and recognized shock burke gave me a call said he was headed on down here shays took out a huge white handkerchief to mop his neck and face though he could move fast when he had to his slow and easy pace was more than bedside manner it was the way he preferred to do things hell of a hot one aint it yes why dont we go on inside where its cooler no i think she looked helplessly back toward the shielding trees i should wait he went in there to see i was throwing stones in the water i could see only her face he sat beside her took her hand in his fingers still nimble after forty years of medicine monitored her pulse whose face darlin i dont know when he reached down to open his bag she stiffened months of vigilant doctors with their slim shiny needles had her system jittering i dont need anything i dont want anything she jolted to her feet and though she tried she couldnt keep her voice from shrilling im all right you should try to help her there must be something you could do to help her one thing at a time darlin to show good faith he shut his bag again why dont you sit on down here and tell me all about it nice and slow then we can figure out whats what she didnt sit but she did gain enough control to take several long breaths she didnt want to end up in the hospital again couldnt im sorry i dont suppose im making much sense well now that dont worry me none most people i know spend about half their lives making sense and the other half exercising their jaw you just tell me how it occurs to you i think she must have drowned caroline said in a calm and careful voice in the pond i could see only her face she trailed off forcing back the image before it nudged her toward hysteria again im afraid she was dead before shays could question further deputy carl johnson came out of the trees and started across the sunbleached lawn his usually spotless uniform showed traces of dirt and streaks of wet still he walked with military precision a commanding figure six foot six of taut muscle his glossy skin was the color of chestnuts he was a man who enjoyed his authority and prized his control just now he was fighting to maintain his professional aura when what he wanted to do was find a secluded spot to lose his lunch doc carl it needed only that for the two men to exchange information muttering an oath shays mopped his face again miss waverly id be obliged to use your phone of course can you tell me what again her gaze was drawn toward the trees her mind to what was beyond them is she dead carl hesitated only a moment pulling off his cap to reveal tight black curls cut as close and neat as a newly mowed lawn yes maam the sheriffll talk to you as soon as he can doc with a weary nod shays rose theres a phone right here in the hall caroline began as she started up the steps deputy johnson maam carl johnson deputy johnson did she drown he shot caroline a quick look as he held open the screen door for her no maam she didnt burke was sitting on the log turned away from the body a polaroid camera sat beside him he needed a minute before he slipped back into his lawandorder suit a minute for his head to clear for his stomach to settle hed seen death before had known the look and the smell of it from boyhood hunting with his father first theyd gone out for the sheer pleasure of it then when crops and investments had failed theyd hunted to put meat on the table hed seen the death of his own kind as well starting with his fathers suicide when the farm had been lost and wasnt it that death that had led him to this one without the farm with a wife and two young children to support hed signed on as town deputy then as sheriff the rich mans son who had detested the futility of his fathers death and the cruelty of the land that had caused it had chosen to channel his talents such as they were toward law and order but even finding his father hanging in the barn hearing the quiet creak of the rope rubbing over the thick beam hadnt prepared him for what hed found in mcnair pond he still had much too clear a picture of what it had been like to wrestle that body from the water to drag it out onto the ground it was funny he thought drawing hard on a cigarette hed never liked edda lou there had been a coarseness about her a sly look in her eyes that had milked away any sympathy he might have felt for her being unfortunate enough to be kin to austin hatinger but just now he was remembering the way shed looked one longago christmas when he and susie had come across her in town shed have been no more than ten mousy hair stringing down her back patched dress hiking up too far at the side hem and drooping at the front and her nose pressed up to larssons window as she stared at a doll with a blue cape and rhinestone tiara shed just been a little girl then wishing there was a santa already knowing there wasnt he turned his head when he heard the rustle of brush doc he blew out a stream of smoke on the word christ shays laid a heavy hand on his shoulder squeezed once then moved to the body death wasnt a stranger to him and he had come to know that death wasnt only for the old either he could accept that the young were taken through illness through accident but this mutilation this wild destruction of a human being was beyond acceptance gently he picked up one of the limp hands and studied the raw wrist the same telltale signs braceleted the ankles it hurt him more somehow this ring of broken skin and the hopelessness it represented than the vicious slices on her torso she was one of the first babies i delivered when i came back to innocence with a sigh he did what burke had not been able to do he reached down and shut edda lous eyes its hard for parents to bury their children by jesus its hard for doctors too he messed her up pretty good burke managed to say just like the others he picked up the camera they would need more pictures and god knew he had to do something before the coroner came he swallowed a hard knot of anger she was tied to that tree there theres blood dried on it you can see from the scrapes on her back where she rubbed against it used clothesline pieces of it are still there he lowered the camera again and his eyes were bright with fury what the hell was she doing here her cars back in town cant tell you that burke cant tell you a hell of a lot she was hit on the back of the head shayss hands were as soothing as they would have been had his patient been alive to feel them maybe he hauled her out here maybe she came on her own and riled him up struggling to hold on to his nerves burke nodded he knew just as everyone in town knew who it was edda lou had riled up caroline paced the porch if she could have worked up the courage shed have marched into the bayou and demanded information she wasnt sure how much longer she could stand this waiting but she knew shed never make it past the first stand of trees not when she knew what was beyond them she saw the dark sedan creep down the drive followed by a white van coroner she thought when the men got out of the van with a stretcher and a thick black bag she turned away that bag that long black bag not so different in shape and size from the kind people used to haul off things they no longer wanted that bag reminded her much too forcibly that it wasnt a person in the pond it wasnt a woman it was only a body that wouldnt suffer from the indignity of being taken away in a big piece of plastic it was the living who suffered and caroline wondered who the woman had left behind to grieve and mourn and question her heart ached to make music to make music so passionate it would drive away everything else she could still do that thank god she could still do that escape there when there was nowhere else to run leaning against the post she closed her eyes and played it in her head filled her mind with melody so rich she didnt hear the next car jolt down the lane hey there josie slammed her car door and finishing off the last of a cherry popsicle started toward the porch hey she said again and offered a friendly curious smile when caroline raised her head yall got a commotion here she licked the stick clean with a savoring tongue saw all these cars turn in while i was heading home and thought id see what was doing caroline gave her a blank look it was odd almost obscene to see someone so vivid and pulsing with life when death was still hovering i beg your pardon no need for that honey still smiling josie walked up the steps im just nosy thats all cant stand for something to be going on and not know about it josie longstreet she held out a hand still a bit sticky from the melted ice caroline caroline waverly after shed shaken hands caroline thought how innate manners were how absurdly automatic you got trouble here caroline josie set the sticks on the porch rail i see burkes car gorgeous isnt he hasnt cheated on his wife not even once in better than seventeen years never seen anyone take marriage so damn serious but there you go doc shays too she glanced back at the crowded lane now hes a character that shoeblack hair all puffed up and slicked back like a fifties rock and roll singer sounds a little like mickey mouse dont you think caroline nearly smiled yes im sorry would you like to sit down dont worry about me josie took a cigarette out of her purse she lighted it with a gold butane you got all these visitors but i dont see a soul theyre she looked toward the trees she swallowed hard the sheriffs coming now josie shifted position subtly turning her body slightly lifting her shoulders the sassy smile she offered burke faded when she saw his eyes still her voice was bright why burke im jealous you hardly ever come to pay calls on us at sweetwater and here you are official business josie well well miss waverly i need to speak to you could we go inside of course as he started by josie took his arm the teasing had gone out of her face burke i cant talk to you now he knew he should tell her to leave but he thought caroline might want another female around when hed finished with her can you wait maybe stay with her awhile the hand on his arm trembled how bad is it as bad as it gets why dont you go in the kitchen fix us something cold id be obliged if youd stay in there until i call you caroline settled him in the front parlor on the striped divan the little cuckoo clock that she had wound faithfully since her arrival ticktocked cheerfully she could smell the polish shed used on the coffee table just that morning and her own sweat miss waverly im awfully sorry to have to ask you questions now when you must be upset but its best to get to all this quickly i understand how could she understand she thought frantically shed never found a body before do you know do you know who she is yes maam the deputy johnson her hand was up at her throat rubbing up and down as if she could stroke the words free he said she didnt drown no maam burke took a notebook and pencil from his pocket im sorry i have to tell you she was murdered she only nodded she wasnt shocked a part of her had known it from the moment she had looked into the wide sightless eyes what do you want me to do i want you to tell me anything you saw anything you heard in the last fortyeight hours but theres nothing really ive only just arrived and ive been trying to to settle to put things in order i understand that he tipped his hat back on his head used his forearm to dab at sweat on his brow maybe you could think back you didnt maybe hear a car pull into your lane at night or anything that didnt sound quite right to you no that is im used to city noises so nothing really sounds right to me she dragged an unsteady hand through her hair it was going to be all right she told herself now that they were down to the questions and answers the mechanics of law and order the quiet seems so loud if you know what i mean and the birds and insects the owls she stopped and what was left of her color drained away the other night the first night i was here oh god you just take your time maam i thought i heard a woman scream id been asleep and it woke me frightened me then i remembered where i was and about the owls those screech owls she closed her eyes on a flood of guilt i went back to sleep it could have been her calling for help i just went back to sleep or it could have been an owl even if it was her miss waverly you couldnt have helped could you tell me what time it woke you up no im sorry i have no idea i didnt look do you walk back there much i have a couple of times my grandfather took me fishing back there once when i visited ive gotten some good cats back there myself he said conversationally do you smoke no manners rising again she glanced around for an ashtray please go ahead he pulled one out but he was thinking about the single cigarette butt hed found near the log edda lou didnt smoke either you havent noticed anyone poking around here no ones come by to see you as i said i havent been here long i did run into someone the first day he said my grandmother let him come down to watch the water burke kept his face impassive but his heart began to sink do you know who that was his name was longstreet tucker longstreet tucker was back in the hammock holding a cold beer against his swollen eye and sulking his body no longer felt like it had been trampled by horses it felt like it had been dragged a few miles first he was regretting bitterly his decision to face austin far better to have slunk off to greenville or even vicksburg for a few days what the hell had made him think that pride and honesty were worth a fist in the eye worse yet was the fact that edda lou was probably off somewhere smirking at all the trouble shed caused the more he thought about it the surer he was that austin had battered him for no good reason edda lou wasnt about to have an abortion not that tucker figured shed turn from one on moral or maternal grounds but if she wasnt pregnant she wouldnt have any hold on him a hold he thought miserably that would last the rest of his life nothing took hold of you like family he thought and his blood would mix with edda lous in the baby she was carrying all the good and bad there was between them would stir around leaving it up to god or fate or maybe just timing to determine which traits endured he took a long swallow of beer then rested the bottle against his eye again it wasnt any use thinking about something that wasnt going to happen for months yet he was better off worrying about the almighty present he hurt and if he didnt feel so damn stupid about the whole mess hed have called doc shays to lull himself he let his thoughts drift to more pleasant matters caroline waverly she was as pretty as one of those tall glossy icecream parfaits the kind that cooled you off and made you greedy for more he grinned to himself as he remembered the snooty look shed given him in larssons that afternoon that queentopeasant look christ it made him want to just scoop her right up not that he had any plans to he was swearing off women awhile not only did his body hurt but he figured his luck was a bit shaky still it was pleasant to think about it he liked the way her voice sounded all soft and smoky so different from her cool handsoff look he wondered just what hed have to do to convince her to let him get his hands on tucker fell asleep with a smile on his face tuck he muttered and tried to shrug off the hand shaking his shoulder the sudden movement brought pain back with a bang he swore opened his eyes jesus cant a man get any peace around here he blinked up at burke the shadows were lengthening and his first thought was delia hadnt called him in for supper his second as he swung around to sit was that his stomach was so sore it was just as well remember when the bonny brothers and their crazy cousin jumped us down at spook hollow burke kept his hands jammed in his pockets yeah we were younger then tucker flexed his swollen knuckles i dont recollect it hurt so damn much taking a licking then why dont you go in get us a couple beers im on duty tucker i gotta talk to you talk better with a beer but when he looked up and focused on burkes face his quick grin faded what is it its bad real bad and he knew as if it had already been said its edda lou isnt it before burke could answer tucker was up and pacing his hands dragging through his hair oh jesus jesus christ tuck give me a minute goddammit sick furious he pounded a fist against the tree youre sure yeah it was like arnette and francie holy god he leaned his brow against the rough bark and struggled to keep the image out of his mind he hadnt loved her had gotten to the point where he didnt even like her but he had touched her tasted her been inside her he felt a well of grief rise up that was staggering not only for her but for the child he hadnt even wanted you ought to come on and sit down no he turned from the tree his face had changed it had taken on that hard dangerous look so few were allowed to see where did you find her mcnair pond just a couple hours ago thats less than a mile from here he thought first of his sister of delia of protection then he thought of caroline she caroline she shouldnt be alone there josies with her now and carl burke rubbed a hand over his face josie bullied her into drinking some of miss ediths apple brandy shes caroline shes the one who found the body fuck he sat on the hammock again put his head in his hands what the hell are we going to do burke what the hells going on here i gotta ask you some questions tuck but before i do i want to tell you i went to see austin i had to tell him he pulled out a cigarette you watch your back son tucker took the cigarette he cant believe id hurt edda lou for chrissake he lit a match then stared as it burned down toward his fingers you dont believe he dropped the match and sprang to his feet goddammit burke you know me burke wished hed taken the beer or anything else to wash this nasty taste from his mouth tucker was his friend the closest thing he had to a brother and his most likely suspect knowing yous got nothing to do with it tucker felt a punch of panic worse than any fist to the gut the hell with that its my job tucker i got a duty sick at heart he took out his notebook you and edda lou had a public argument only a couple days ago shes been missing nearly ever since tucker struck another match this time he lighted the cigarette and drew and expelled smoke you going to read me my rights put the cuffs on me what burkes hand fisted at his side goddammit tucker i just spent two hours looking at what someone did to that girl this aint the time to push me tucker held out a hand palm up but there was too much sarcasm in the gesture for it to be taken as one of peace go on burke do your frigging job i want to know if you saw edda or talked to her after you left the diner didnt i come in your office this afternoon and tell you i hadnt whered you go after you left the diner i went to he broke off paling christ i went to mcnair pond he started to bring the cigarette to his lips then stopped his tawny eyes glittered in the lowering light but you already knew that didnt you yeah but it helps you telling me yourself fuck you burke grabbed him by the shirtfront listen to me i dont like what ive got to do but this is nothing nothing compared to what the fbill do once they get here weve got three women dead sliced up like catfish edda lou threatened you in public and shes found dead not two days later ive got a witness who puts you at the scene a day maybe hours before the murder the first lick of fear joined the tension in tuckers stomach you know ive been over to mcnair pond hundreds of times sove you he shoved burkes hands away and being pissed at edda lou doesnt make me a killer what about arnette francie burkes jaw set you dated them all three of them it wasnt temper now but simple shock jesus burke he had to sit again and do so slowly feeling his way you cant believe that you cant what i believe doesnt have a damn to do with the questions i have to ask i have to know where you were night before last why he was losing his shirt to me playing gin rummy josie strolled over to them her cheeks were pale but there was a hard gleam in her eye you interrogating my brother burke why im surprised at you she walked between them to lay a hand on tuckers shoulder ive got a job to do josie then you ought to be doing it why arent you out looking for someone who hates women rather than someone who has such a powerful affection for them like tuck here tucker put a hand over hers i thought you were staying with caroline susie and marvella came down to be with her she shrugged it gets to be too many women in one place and shes holding up just fine now anyway you might want to run on home burke make sure those boys of yours arent tearing up the house he ignored the suggestion and the anger in josies eyes you and tucker played cards thats not a crime or a sin in this county is it she took tuckers cigarette from between his fingers and drew on it we sat up till two maybe twothirty tucker got a little bit drunk and i won thirtyeight dollars a wave of relief thickened burke voice thats good im sorry i had to ask but when the federal boys get in youll have to talk to them too thought itd be easier from me the first time it wasnt tucker got to his feet again what are they going to do with her took her down to palmers funeral parlor hold her there overnight anyway till the fbi gets here he stuffed the notebook back in his pocket shuffled his feet steer clear of austin long as you can with a sour grin tucker rubbed an absent hand on his bruised ribs you dont have to worry about that awkward miserable burke stared off at a trio of rhododendrons ill be going then it might look better if you came on in tomorrow talked to the feds right off right tucker let out a long breath as burke walked away hey when burke turned around he offered a half smile i still got that beer if you want the tension seeped out of burkes shoulders i appreciate it but i best go see to my kids thanks im a sick person tucker josie said with a sigh im as pissed off at that man as i can be and id still like to get in his pants with a half laugh tucker laid his cheek on her head thats just reflex honey the longstreet reflex with an arm draped around her waist he began to lead her toward the house jose not that im in any position to question your veracity but we havent played gin in weeks that so she tucked her tongue in her cheek well now the days just seem to blur together dont they she pulled back to study him seems better that way simpler maybe cautious he took her face in his hands he had a way of looking into a person when he had to and he needed to see into josie now you dont think i killed her sweetie pie ive lived with you most of my life and i know you just about choke with guilt if you have to squash a beetle youve got too much heart even when your tempers up she kissed both his cheeks i know you didnt kill anybody and if it makes it all go away quicker whats the harm in saying we were at cards that night we were at cards some night or other anyway he hesitated it didnt seem quite right then he shrugged right or wrong it was easier than the truth which was that hed fallen asleep while reading keats what the hell would the boys down at the chat n chew say if they found out he read poetry on purpose and whod believe him chapter five like fire through dry brush news of edda lou hatingers murder had spread like dust from the bayous to the levees from town square to farm all the way from market street down to hog maw road where happy fuller discussed the event with her dear friend and bingo partner birdie shays henry wouldnt talk about it birdie said as she cooled her face with a church of redemption paper fan burke truesdale called him on down to the mcnair place bout two oclock and he didnt get back till five the fierceeyed jesus painted on the fan blurred as she waved it he came home all pale and sweaty told me edda lou hatinger was dead and to cancel all the appointments this evening said she was murdered just like arnette and francie and wouldnt say another word lord love us happy looked out over her trim backyard satisfied with the backwash of birdies fan whats the world coming to a womans not safe walking the streets i passed by the diner before i came out birdie gave a knowing nod her lacquered hair which earleen renfrew colored every six weeks with bombshell beige sat still and stiff as a helmet with its two rigid curls like question marks on either side of her forehead heard that burkes called for the fbi and maybe the national guard hmph happy made a sound between a snort and a grunt she was fond of birdie mighty fond but that didnt stop her from seeing faults birdie had a tendency to be gullible which in happys opinion fell just behind laziness on the top ten list of sins weve got us a homicidal maniac not a riot birdie i dont think were going to see soldiers marching down market street now the fbi maybe and i expect theyll call my boy in to talk since he found poor arnette back in february her handsome face set into thoughtful lines shed yet to forgive bobby lee fully for hooking school and damn near flunking out again but it was hard to resist the prestige of being the mama of the one whod found the first body bobby lees carried that sadness with him ever since birdie put in why you can see it in his eyes just this morning when he filled up my tank down to sonnys i thought to myself that bobby lee hes never going to be the same had nightmares for weeks happy said with only the faintest trace of pride only natural i know henrys hearts about broke and ill tell you happy its worrisome why it couldve been my own sweet carolanne not that shed be wandering around somewhere alone when shes got a husband and two children to tend to but it makes you worry and theres your own darleen and her being best friends with edda i tell you i can barely stand to think on it i expect ill have to call darleen see how shes bearing up happy let out a sigh it had been a great relief to her when darleen had married junior talbot and settled down in town with her husband and brand new baby but she knew darleens wild ways were flaring again were going to have to get some of the ladies together birdie and go pay our respects to mavis hatinger birdie started to make an excuse but the paper jesus glared at her its the christian thing to do do you think austinll be there dont you worry about austin happy set her chin well have the power of motherhood on our side that night doors were locked in innocence guns were loaded and sleep came hard come morning edda lou was the first thought on many minds for darleen fuller talbot happys third child and first great disappointment grief was mixed with lethargy throughout her teenage years darleen had trailed along behind edda lou thrilled by the risks they took together hitching clear to greenville swiping cosmetics from the counter at larssons hooking school with the bonny boys to have sex down at spook hollow theyd worried together if their periods were late talked frankly about their sexual encounters and doubledated at the sky view drivein theater more times than she could count edda lou had been her maid of honor when darleen had married junior and darleen was to have returned the favor when edda lou finally snagged tucker longstreet now she was dead and darleens eyes were puffy from weeping she barely had the energy to settle little scooter in his playpen wave her husband out the front door and shuffle into the kitchen to let her lover billy t bonny in through the back oh now darlin billy t already sweaty in his athletic tshirt and torn jeans took the redeyed darleen into his tattooed arms you shouldnt go on like this sugar plum i just hate to see you cry i cant believe shes gone darleen sniffed against his shoulder and comforted herself by squeezing his butt she was my dearest closest friend billy t i know he moved his full ready mouth down to hers sliding his tongue in and around in sympathy she was a great girl and were all going to miss her she was like my sister darleen drew back so he could slip his hands under her nylon nightie and find her breasts more a sister than belle or starita ever were theyre just jealous cause youre the prettiest he pinched her hardened nipples while he backed her up against the counter id rather itd been one of them instead of edda lou tears sparkling in her eyes she unzipped his jeans i dont care if they are my blood kin i could always talk to edda lou you know just talk about anything even us she sighed as he pulled her nightie down far enough to nip at her breasts she was always happy for me she was a little jealous when i married junior and had scooter but that was only natural dont you think mmmm i was going to be her maid of honor when she married tucker longstreet she tugged his jockeys down i cant hardly stand to think about how she was killed dont think about it honey his breath was coming quick and hard let billy t help you forget all about it he brought his hands down to push her thighs apart edda lou wouldve wanted it that way yeah she sighed and snuggled against his hand with a shiver she shoved a bowl of cherrios aside to brace herself on the counter shell always have a place in my heart when she wrapped her fingers around him she opened her eyes love shining he was already wearing a condom youre just so good to me honey she guided him in and he began to grind so much more fun than junior why since we got married we dont do it anywhere but in bed highly flattered billy t hitched up her hips rapping her head against an open cupboard door since she was already coming darleen didnt notice caroline was surprised shed slept so well maybe it was her minds way of escaping or the security of having susie truesdale and her daughter tucked into the next bedroom or maybe it was just that she felt safe in her grandparents bed whatever it was she awakened to sunlight and the smell of coffee and bacon her first reaction was embarrassment that she should have slept while her guests fixed breakfast that reaction struck her as so feeble after the horror of the day before she was tempted to roll over and will herself back to sleep instead she took a long cool shower and dressed by the time she came downstairs susie and marvella were already seated at the table talking in hushed tones over coffee and scrambled eggs there was enough resemblance between mother and daughter to make caroline want to smile two pretty women with minkcolored hair and big blue eyes they whispered together like children in the back pew of a church service they both had bowshaped mouths like kewpie dolls that curved into sympathetic smiles when they spotted her there was a closeness between them a simple understanding and respect that caroline had never enjoyed with her own mother seeing it feeling it she felt herself struck by a hard unexpected wave of envy we hoped youd sleep awhile longer susie was already up pouring another cup of coffee i feel like i slept a week thanks she took the cup susie offered it was so kind of you to stay i thats what neighbors are for marvella fix caroline a plate oh really i you have to eat susie nudged her into a chair when youve had a shock like that you need fuel mom makes great eggs marvella offered she tried not to stare at caroline as she served she wanted to ask her where shed gotten her hair cut though bobby lee would just about shit bricks if she had her own shoulderlength curls whacked like that you always feel better if you eat last time i broke up with bobby lee mom and i had great big chocolate sundaes its hard to feel blue when youre full of chocolate susie smiled and served up a plate of toast i got some of your grandmas wild raspberry jam out of the cupboard hope you dont mind no fascinated caroline picked up the handlabeled jelly jar i didnt realize this was around oh my miss edith put by every year nobody had a hand like hers for jams and jellies she won the blue ribbon at the fair the last six years running bending susie opened a bottom cupboard and gestured toward the lines of jars youve got a good years supply here i didnt know all those pretty colorful jars so carefully labeled so lovingly aligned the sense of loss and shame closed her throat i wasnt able to see her often she was so proud of you used to talk about her little caro traveling all around the world and how you played music for royalty and presidents and all showed around the postcards you sent her there was one of paris france marvella put in with the eiffel tower off in the back miss edith let me use it for a report marvella took two years of french susie sent her daughter a pleased look she herself had had to quit school four months before graduation when shed begun to show it never failed to delight her that her daughter already held a high school diploma she glanced at her watch honey hadnt you better get on to work oh lordy marvella popped out of her seat look at the time marvella works up in rosedale as a legal secretary they said she could come in late today considering she glanced over as marvella freshened her lipstick in the reflection of the toaster you go on and take my car honey ill call your daddy to come get me rising she rested her hands on marvellas shoulders you dont stop for anybody even if you know them im not stupid susie pinched her chin no but youre my only girl i want you to call me if youre going to be later than fivethirty i will and you tell that bobby lee theres to be no more parking down on dog street road if the two of you have to get romantic youll do it down in the family room moma slow flush worked its way up her throat to her cheeks you tell him or i will she kissed marvellas pouty lips now get yesm she smiled at caroline dont let her bully you miss waverly once she starts she never stops sassy susie chuckled after the front screen door slammed hard to believe shes grown up on me shes a lovely girl yes she is that hardheaded and sure of what she wants though shes wanted bobby lee fuller for the best part of two years so i guess shell get him all right she gave a wistful smile before she picked up her cooling coffee once i set my sights on burke he didnt have a prayer shes the same only you worry because they always seem so much younger than you were at the same age she frowned at carolines plate you didnt eat much im sorry with effort caroline took another bite it all seems so strange i didnt even know that girl but its dreadful just thinking about her resigned she pushed her plate aside susie i didnt want to ask too many questions with marvella here but do i understand this right this girl was the third murdered since february susie said with a nod they were all three stabbed god burke wont say much but i know its bad really bad some kind of mutilation she rose to clear the table as a mother as a woman it scares me and i worry about burke too hes taking this all on himself like it was his fault somehow god knows nobody around here was prepared for this kind of thing but burke thinks he should have been able to stop it the way susie remembered hed thought he should have been able to stop his father from putting a noose around his neck caroline filled the sink with soapy water no suspects if so hes not saying with arnette it seemed like it had tove been a drifter i mean when youve got eight or nine hundred people in a town you get so you know damn near everybody it just didnt seem possible it could have been one of us then when francie was killed the same way people began to look around a little and still when it came right down to it none of us wanted to believe it could have been a neighbor or a friend but now now you have to look among your own we do she picked up a tea towel as caroline began to wash the breakfast dishes though i think its more likely weve got some psycho living in the swamp hiding in there caroline looked out the window toward the trees trees that seemed so much closer to the house than before well thats a comfort i dont mean to scare you but if youre living out here alone you need to be careful caroline pressed her lips together i heard that tucker longstreet and edda lou had a fight that she was pressuring him into marriage trying to more like susie polished a plate clean then laughed lordy you dont know tucker or else you wouldnt have that look on your face the idea of him killing someone well its just laughable first place it would take too much effort and emotion tucker tends to be lacking in both departments caroline remembered the look on his face when shed come across him by the pond thered been plenty of emotion then the dangerous kind still i guess burkell have to talk to him susie said and thatll be hard theyre as close as brothers we all went to school together she continued as she dried and stacked dishes tucker and dwayne thats tuckers brother burke and me they were all planters sons though by that time the truesdale place was already failing so private school was out of the question for burke dwayne went off to boarding school for awhile him being the first son and all but he couldnt keep out of trouble so the school shipped him on home thered been talk of sending tucker off too but then old beau was so pissed about dwayne he kept tuck home she smiled as she examined a glass for spots tuck always said he owed dwayne big for that one i guess thats why he tries to look after him now hes a good man and if youd known tuck as long as i have youd know he could no more work up the gumption to kill a person than he could fly not that he doesnt have his faults god knows but to take a knife to a woman the idea made her laugh despite the horror of it truth be known hed be too busy trying to get under her skirts to think about anything else carolines mouth went grim i know the type believe me honey youve never known anyone like tuck if i wasnt a happily married woman with four kids i might have taken after him myself hes got a way about him tuck does she slanted caroline a look odds are hell come sniffing your way before too long then hell end up with a foot in his nose susie let out a peal of laughter i hope im around to see it now then she set the last plate aside you and me have work to do work i wont feel right leaving you here until i know youre protected after drying her hands on the flowered tea towel she walked over to pick up her purse out of the straw bag she pulled a deadlylooking jesus christ was all caroline could think of to say this is a doubleaction smith and wesson i like the feel of a revolver rather than an automatic is that is it loaded why sure it is honey she blinked her big blue eyes hell of a lot of good it would do me empty i won the fourth of july target shoot three years straight burke cant decide whether to be proud or embarrassed that i can outshoot him in your purse caroline said weakly you carry it in your purse since february i have have you ever fired a gun no instinctively caroline linked her hands behind her back no she repeated and you think you cant susie said briskly well let me tell you honey if someone was coming after you or yours youd fire quick enough now i know your granddaddy had a collection lets go pick one out susie set her on the kitchen table and started out susie baffled caroline hurried after her i cant pick out a gun the way i would a new dress its just as interesting susie strolled into the den and tapping a finger against her lips studied her choices were going to start with a handgun but i want you to practice loading that shotgun it makes a statement i bet her eyes bright she curled a hand around carolines arm listen here if someone comes along and bothers you you step outside with this dove duster on your shoulder point it midbody and you tell the sonofabitch you dont know diddly about shooting if he doesnt hightail it fast he deserves a load of buckshot with a half laugh caroline sat on the arm of the easy chair youre serious about this down here we take care of ourselves now this heres an old beauty susie opened the case and took out a handgun colt fortyfive army issue bet he used this in the war she broke open the gun with a finesse caroline had to admire and spun the empty chamber clean as a whistle too after snapping the barrel back into place she pointed it at the wall and pressed the trigger good pulling open the drawer she gave a satisfied cluck of her tongue as she saw the ammo she tucked a box in her back pocket then grinned at caroline lets go kill some cans special agent matthew burns wasnt doing cartwheels at the prospect of working in a dusty little delta town burns was an urbanite born and bred one who enjoyed an evening at the opera a fine châteauneuf and a quiet afternoon strolling through the national gallery hed seen a good deal of ugliness in his ten years with the bureau and preferred to cleanse his emotional pallet with a taste of mozart or bach hed been looking forward to the end of the week which would have included tickets to the ballet a civilized dinner at jeanlouis at the watergate and perhaps a tasteful and romantic interlude with his current companion instead he found himself driving into innocence with his field kit and garment bag tucked into the trunk of a rental car that had a faulty airconditioning pump burns knew the case would create a media hullabaloo and he certainly never doubted he was the appropriate man for the job he specialized in serial killers and with all due modesty hed be the first one to admit he was damn good still it irked him that his weekend had been ruined it upset his sense of order that the bureaus pathologist assigned to the case had been delayed by thunderstorms in atlanta he didnt trust some backwater coroner to perform a decent autopsy his irritation grew as he drove through town in the nearly airless car it was just as hed suspected a few sweaty pedestrians a couple of loose dogs a huddle of dusty storefronts there wasnt even a movie theater he gave a little shudder at the faded handprinted letters that spelled out chat n chew on the only restaurant in sight thank god hed packed his own krups coffeemaker a job was a job he reminded himself as he pulled up in front of the sheriffs office there were times one had to suffer in the pursuit of justice taking only his briefcase and trying not to strangle in the heat he meticulously locked his car when jed larssons dog nuisance wandered up to lift his leg on the front tire burns merely shook his head he didnt doubt hed find the manners of the twolegged residents equally crude nice car claude bonny said from his perch in front of the rooming house and spat burns lifted one dark brow it serves you selling something son no bonny exchanged looks with charlie ohara and pete koons ohara wheezed out a couple of breaths and squinted youd be that fbi man from up north then yes burns felt sweat slide down his back and prayed the town ran to an adequate dry cleaner i used to watch that show with efrem zimbalist on it every week koons took a pull on his lemonade damn good show that one dragnet was better bonny stated cant understand why they took it off the air dont make shows like that no more if youll excuse me burns said go on in son bonny waved him on sheriffs inside been there all morning you catch that psycho thats killing our girls and well string em up for you really i dont didnt that guy from dragnet go on over to be a doctor on that m a s h show ohara wondered seems i recollect that jack webb never played no doctor bonny said taking it as a personal affront no tother one little guy my missus near to bust a gut watching that show good lord burns said under his breath and pushed open the door of the sheriffs office burke was at his desk the phone cupped between his chin and shoulder while he busily scrawled on a legal pad yes sir the minute he gets here ihe looked up and identified burns as quickly as hed have separated a quail from a pheasant hold on you special agent burns thats right following procedure burns pulled out his id and flashed it he just walked in burke said into the phone then held it out its your boss burns set his briefcase aside and took the receiver chief hadley yes sir my eta was a bit off there was a problem with the car in greenville yes sir dr rubenstein should be here by three ill be sure to do that just off the top id say well need another phone this appears to be a single line and he placed a hand over the mouthpiece do you have a fax machine burke ran his tongue around his teeth no sir i dont and a fax machine burns continued into the receiver til call in as soon as ive done the preliminary and settled in yes sir he handed the phone back to burke and checked the seat of the swivel chair before sitting now then youd be sheriff truesdale burke truesdale the handshake was brief and formal burke caught a whiff of baby powder weve got a mess here agent burns so im informed three mutilations in four and a half months no suspects none burke barely caught himself before apologizing we figured a drifter but with the last one then theres that one up in nashville burns steepled his hands you have files i presume yeah burke started to rise not quite yet you can fill me in orally as we go ill want to see the body we have her down at the funeral parlor most appropriate burns said dryly well take a look then go to the crime scene youve secured it burke felt his temper heating kinda hard to secure a swamp burns let out a sigh as he rose ill take your word for that in the backyard caroline sucked in her breath gritted her teeth and pulled the trigger the punch jumped up her arm and made her ears ring she hit a can though it wasnt the one shed aimed at now youre getting somewhere susie told her but you got to keep your eyes all the way open she demonstrated plowing three cans off the log in rapid succession couldnt i just throw rocks at them caroline yelled when susie went to reset the cans did you play a symphony the first time you picked up your fiddle caroline sighed and rotated her shoulder is this how you intimidate your kids into doing what you want damn right susie came back to her side now relax take your time hows the gun feel in your hand actually it feels she laughed a little and glanced down at it sexy right she patted carolines back its okay youre among friends thing is you got the power right here and the control and the responsibility same as having sex she grinned thats not what i tell my kids go ahead now you sight in on that first can on the left make a picture on it have an exhusband no thanks susie hooted old boyfriend one who really pissed you off luis caroline hissed between her teeth whew was he spanish or something or something her teeth were clenching he was a big sleek mexican rat caroline pulled the trigger her mouth fell open when the can jumped i hit it just needed incentive try the next couldnt you ladies take up needlepoint burke called susie lowered her revolver and smiled youre going to have more competition next fourth of july darlin she skimmed her gaze over burns before rising on tiptoe to kiss her husband you look tired i am tired he squeezed her hand agent burns this is my wife susie and caroline waverly miss waverly found the body yesterday caroline waverly burns said the name reverently i cant believe it taking her free hand he brought it to his lips while susie rolled her eyes at burke behind the fbi mans back i heard you play just a few months ago in new york and last year at the kennedy center i have several of your recordings for a moment caroline only blinked at him all that seemed so far away she almost thought hed mistaken her for someone else thank you oh no thank you he was thinking the case might have benefits after all i cant tell you how many times youve saved my sanity just by letting me hear you play his smooth cheeks were flushed with excitement and his hand continued to grip hers this is well delightful despite the circumstances i must say its the last place id expect to find the princess of the concert halls a little ball of discomfort wedged in her stomach this was my grandmothers home agent burns ive been here for only a few days his pale blue eyes clouded with concern this must be terribly distressing for you be assured ill do everything in my power to resolve the matter quickly caroline made certain to avoid susies eyes and managed a small smile thats a comfort to me anything anything i can do anything at all he picked up the field kit hed set at his feet ill take a look at the scene now sheriff burke gestured and after glancing at burnss shiny italian loafers winked at his wife kinda cute susie decided as they walked toward the trees if you go for the suitandtie type fortunately i dont go for any type right now never know susie flapped the bodice of her blouse to stir some air why dont i show you how to clean your gun then well make something cold for the boys she gave caroline a curious look i didnt know you were really famous and all i thought it was just miss edith bragging fame all depends on the ground youre standing on doesnt it i guess it does susie turned toward the house because shed developed a fondness for caroline and because it seemed to her caroline needed a smile just then susie swung an arm over her shoulders can you play orange blossom special caroline had her first real laugh in days i dont know why not chapter six tucker propped his feet on burkes desk and crossed his ankles he didnt mind waiting in fact waiting was one of the things he did best what was often interpreted as a bonedeep laziness even by tucker himself was an innate and boundless patience and a clear untroubled mind at the moment his mind wasnt as unfettered as he liked and the truth was he hadnt slept well the night before a little catnap while he waited for burke to come along seemed like a sensible way to pass the time it hadnt taken long for news of the fbi blowing into town to get down to sweetwater tucker already knew that special agent burns dressed like a mortician and drove a tan mercury just as he knew that burns was down at mcnair pond doing whatever fbi types did at murder scenes murder with a little grunt tucker closed his eyes the better to relax sitting there listening to the creak of the ceiling fan and the whine of the useless window air conditioner it didnt seem possible that edda lou hatinger was stretched out on a slab a few blocks away at palmers funeral parlor he winced trying to get beyond the discomfort the plain creepiness of remembering how ready hed been to go head to head with her worse hed been looking forward to the battle to hearing her wail when she finally got it through her conniving brain that she wasnt going to be the new mistress of sweetwater he wouldnt have to set her straight now or salvage some of his pride by hacking at hers now because hed made the mistake of finding something sexy about the way she punched keys on the cash register at larssons because hed indulged himself by sharing her bed and nibbling on that soft skin he was going to have to make up an alibi to keep himself from being a suspect in her murder hed been accused of many things of laziness which was no sin in tuckers book of carelessness with money which he readily admitted of adultery which he took objection to hed never slept with a married woman except for sally guilford a few years back and shed been legally separated even of cowardice which tucker preferred to think of as discretion but murder why it would be laughable if it wasnt so scary if his father had been alive hed have busted a gut laughing he the only man tucker had truly feared hadnt been able to bully or embarrass his son into shooting anything but thin air on any of their enforced hunting trips of course edda lou hadnt been shot not if shed been killed like the others because it was all too easy to slide her face over his image of francies to see what had been done to her smooth white skin he fumbled in his pocket for a cigarette he pinched off part of the tip he was up to nearly a quarter of an inch now and was just lighting it when burke walked in with a sweaty annoyedlooking man in a dark suit spending the best part of the day with the fbi hadnt put burke in the best of moods he scowled at tuckers feet as he tossed his hat toward the pole by the door make yourself at home son doing my best tucker blew out a stream of smoke his stomach was jumping but he sent burke a lazy smile you ought to get yourself some new magazines burke a man needs more to entertain his mind than field and stream and guns and ammo ill see if we can find some issues of gentlemans quarterly and people id be obliged tucker took another drag while he scanned burkes companion the dark suit had wilted in the heat but the man didnt have the sense to loosen his tie though he couldnt have said why that simple fact had tucker taking an instant dislike to burns i thought itd be a good idea for me to come on in and talk to you boys burke nodded and wanting to take authority walked behind his desk tucker longstreet special agent burns welcome to innocence tucker didnt get up but offered a hand it pleased him that burnss was soft and a little clammy from the humidity what makes you special agent burns its my rank burns took a measure of tuckers scuffed sneakers his casually expensive cotton slacks and cocky grin the dislike was mutual what did you want to discuss mr longstreet well now we could start with the weather tucker ignored burkes warning look looks like weve got a storm rolling in might cool things off for a spell or we could talk baseball oriolesre playing the yankees tonight birds got themselves a tight pitching staff this year might just pull it off tucker sucked in smoke you a betting man special agent im afraid i dont take an avid interest in sports well thats okay there was a yawn in tuckers voice as he angled the chair back i dont take an avid interest in much of anything avid takes too much effort lets get to the point tuck since the look hadnt worked burke tried his quiet cutthebullshit tone tucker knew the victim edda lou the word youre scratching for is intimately tucker provided his stomach muscles clenched up on him again so he shifted to crush out the cigarette burns settled in the third chair in his fussily efficient way he took a mini recorder and a pad from his pocket you wanted to make a statement like the only thing we have to fear is fear itself tucker stretched his back not particularly burke here thought you might want to ask me some questions and being the cooperative sort im here to answer them unruffled burns switched on the recorder im informed that you and the deceased had a relationship what we had was sex come on tuck he shot burke a look thats as honest as it gets son edda lou and i went out a few times had some laughs and tangled some sheets his eyes hardened and he had to stop himself from reaching for another cigarette couple weeks back i cut things off because she started talking marriage you ended the affair amicably burns asked i wouldnt say that i figure you already know about the scene in the diner a few days ago its safe to say edda lou was pissed your term mr longstreet i have it here he tapped his pencil on his pad that she was angry and agitated you put those two words together with edda lou and what you get is pissed she claimed youd made her promises lazily tucker lowered his legs the chair squeaked as he rocked it thats the thing about me agent burns i dont make them cause its unlikely ill keep them and she announced publicly that she was pregnant yeah she did that after which you left the chat n chew is it you left abruptly he smiled thinly would it be safe to say mr longstreet that you were pissed having her come down on me in the diner tell me for the first time in front of maybe a dozen people that she was pregnant and threatening to make me pay for it yeah he gave a slow considering nod itd be safe to say and you had no intention of marrying her not a one and being infuriated embarrassed and trapped you had a motive for killing her tucker ran his tongue over his teeth not as long as ive got a checkbook he leaned forward though his face was hard his voice flowed easily like honey over corn bread let me give you a clear picture of this friend edda lou was greedy she was ambitious and she was smart now maybe there was a part of her figured she could intimidate me into a doublering ceremony but shed have settled happily enough for a check with enough zeroes on it he rose then forced himself to take a breath and sit on the corner of the desk i liked her maybe not as much as i once did but well enough you dont sleep with a woman one week and slice her up the next its been done something dark came alive in tuckers eyes not by me burns shifted the recorder an inch to the right you were also acquainted with arnette gantrey and frances alice logan me and most everybody else in innocence did you also have relationships with them dated them some didnt sleep with either his lips curved a little in memory though with arnette it wasnt for lack of trying she rejected you hell in disgust tucker pulled out another cigarette it seemed hed picked a lousy time to try to quit smoking we were friends and she didnt want to wrestle truth is shed always had her eye on my brother dwayne but he never picked up the ball francie and i were just at the flirtandgiggle stage he tossed a bit of paper and tobacco aside she was a sweetheart he shut his eyes i dont want to talk about francie oh fury bubbled up look i was with burke when he found her maybe youre used to seeing that kind of thing but im not especially when its someone i had a fondness for interesting that you were fond of all three women burns said mildly and mrs logan was found in spook hollow he gave a quick snort at the term thats just a couple of miles from your home and miss hatinger was found in mcnair pond less than a mile from your home you visited that spot the day you argued with miss hatinger thats right and plenty of other times according to miss waverly you seemed tense upset when she came across you i thought wed settled on pissed yeah i was thats why i stopped off there its a peaceful spot and a secluded one can you tell me what you did with the rest of your evening mr longstreet it wasnt going to be the truth i played gin with josie my sister tucker lied without a blink being as i was distracted she took me for about thirty or forty dollars then we had a drink and went on up to bed what time did you leave your sister i went up about two twothirty maybe agent burns burke broke in id like to say that on the afternoon edda lou was found tuck came in to see me he was worried because he hadnt heard from her and she wasnt answering the phone burns lifted a brow so noted sheriff how did you come by your black eye mr longstreet edda lous father gave it to me thats how i came to realize she was missing he rode up to the house figuring i was hiding her then he got it into his head id talked her into going somewhere for an abortion did you discuss abortion with the deceased she was deceased before i had a chance to discuss anything with her he pushed himself off the desk thats all ive got to say if you have any more questions you ride on down to sweetwater and ask ill see you around burke burke waited until the door slammed agent burns ive known tucker all my life i can tell you that no matter how het up he was about edda lou he couldnt have killed her burns merely switched off his recorder isnt it fortunate that i have an objective eye i believe its time we checked at the funeral parlor sheriff the pathologist is due tuckerd just about had it hed done nothing but mind his own business live his own life and what did he have to show for it sore ribs a swollen eye and the novelty of being a murder suspect he shot out of innocence and cranked the car up to eighty the way he figured it it all had to do with women if it hadnt been for the way edda lou had rubbed up against him every blessed time hed walked into larssons he wouldnt have started dating her if delia hadnt nagged him he wouldnt have been in town for edda lou to harp on if that waverly woman hadnt wandered into the bayou she wouldnt have seen him sitting by the pond looking tense and upset jesus h christ hed had a right to look that way he was sick about edda lou gutchurning sick no matter how sneaky shed been she didnt deserve to be dead but dammit he didnt see why he had to suffer for it having to sit there and take it while that stiffnecked yankee bastard prodded him with questions and gave him those cop looks worse than cop looks he thought as he swung around a curve it had been those superior bigcity honchotoaddledgoodoldboy sneers that burned his ass caroline waverly had looked at him the same way shed probably done handsprings on her way to tell the fbi about coming across the dirty reb plotting murder in the swamp a yard past the mcnair lane tucker slammed on the brakes his tires screamed on the pavement as he whipped into a uturn maybe hed just go have himself a talk with the duchess as he sent gravel spitting he didnt notice the pickup lumbering down the road austins blackened eyes narrowed as he spotted the red flash disappearing into the brush his lips spread in a smile as he pulled over to the side he turned off the ignition pocketed the keys before reaching for the shoe black studying himself in the rearview mirror he sliced black lines under his eyes adjusted his camouflage hat from the rack in the window he chose his weapon opting for the remington woodsmaster and checked the load he was still smiling as he stepped out of the truck wearing full camouflage with keenedged hunting knife tucked in his ammo belt he was going hunting for the glory of the lord caroline didnt mind being alone though shed enjoyed susies company the womans energy pitch had all but exhausted her nor did she believe that anyone was going to break into the house and kill her in her sleep she was a stranger after all and no one knew her well enough to wish her harm now that the pistol was tucked away she had no intention of touching it again to please herself she picked up her violin shed barely had time to do more than tune it since arriving her hands passed over the smooth polished wood brushed over the strings this wasnt practice she thought as she rosined the bow it wasnt performance it was the urge she was often too pressured to remember to make music for herself with her eyes closed she laid the violin on her shoulder her head and body shifting automatically into position as a womans does to welcome a lover she chose chopin for the beauty for the peace and for the hint of a sadness she couldnt quite dispel as always the music filled all the voids she didnt think of death now or of fear she didnt think of luis and betrayal of the family shed lost or done without she didnt think of the music but only felt it it sounded like tears thats what tucker thought as he walked from his car to the porch not hot passionate tears but slow ones aching ones the kind that bled out of the soul though no one could hear them his thoughts embarrassed him it was just violin music the longhaired kind that didnt even make you want to tap your toe but it sounded so heartbreaking drifting out of the open windows he would have sworn he felt it actually felt the notes shiver over his skin he knocked but so softly he barely heard the rapping himself then he reached down opened the screen and stepped inside he moved quietly following those haunting notes into the front parlor she was standing in the center of the room facing the windows so that he could see her profile her head tilted slightly toward the instrument her eyes were closed and the smile that curved her lips was as wistful and lovely as the music though he couldnt have said how he knew it that particular melding of notes came straight from her heart like a whispered question they hung on the air he slipped his hands into his pockets leaned a shoulder against the jamb and let himself drift along with her it was odd and certainly foreign to him that he could find a woman so restful so quietly appealing so deeply arousing when it had nothing whatsoever to do with sex when she stopped the music fading off into silence he felt a disappointment so keen it was almost physical if hed been wise he would have slipped out again while her eyes were still dreamy and knocked instead he went with instinct and clapped she jolted her body snapping into tension her eyes filling with fear then sharpening with simple annoyance what the hell are you doing in here i knocked he gave her the same little shrug and grin hed offered by the pond guess you were too involved to hear me she lowered the violin but held the bow up somewhat like a fencer with a blade or its possible i didnt want to be disturbed cant say i thought of it i liked the music im more into r and b myself a little jazz but that was something no wonder you do it for a living she kept her eyes on his as she set the violin aside what a fascinating compliment just an honest observation you reminded me of a knickknack my mama had it was a pearl caught in a big chunk of amber it was the prettiest thing but sad too the pearl was all alone in there and could never get out you looked like that when you were playing do you always play sad songs i play what i like his bruises had blossomed over the last day they gave his face a rakish dangerous look with just enough of the little boy to make a woman want to press something cool her lips perhaps on the swelling do you have a reason for walking into my house uninvited mr longstreet you might as well make it tucker im going to call you caroline or caro his teeth flashed thats what miss edith called you i like it that doesnt answer my question he eased away from the jamb we tend to drop by on neighbors around here but as it happens i did have a purpose you going to ask me to sit down she tilted her head no damn the nastier you are the more i like you im perverse that way and other ways he chuckled and sat on the arm of the sofa well have to get to know each other better first you might hear im easy caroline but the thing is ive got my standards what a relief she tapped the bow against her open palm as to your purpose he cocked a foot on his knee as thoroughly at home as a hound in a patch of green shade lord i like the way you talk as fine and cool as a bowl of peach ice cream im real partial to peach ice cream when her lips threatened to quirk she turned them down in defense im not terribly interested in your partialities at the moment nor am i in the mood to entertain company ive had a difficult couple of days the easy humor vanished it was rough on you finding edda lou that way rougher on her id say he stood reaching for a cigarette as he paced being as youve been here a few days youll know everything thats been said though she tried she couldnt prevent a twinge of sympathy it was never easy to have your private life your private mistakes the topic of hot speculation she knew if youre saying the gossip around here is as thick as the humidity i wont argue i cant stop you from thinking what youre inclined to think but i want my say she lifted a brow i cant fathom why my thoughts would concern you you jumped fast enough to give them to that shinyshoed yankee she waited the way he was pacing up and down the room struck as more frustrated than violent she relaxed enough to set down the bow if youre speaking of agent burns i told him what id seen you were by the pond his head whipped around sure i was there goddammit did i look like i was planning to murder somebody you looked angry she tossed back i have no idea what you were planning he stopped turned and took a step toward her if you think i did that to edda lou why the hell are you standing here talking to me instead of running for your life she jerked up her chin i can take care of myself since ive already told the police everything i know which is essentially nothing youd have no reason to hurt me he balled his hands at his sides lady you keep looking at me as if i were something you scraped off your shoe and i might come up with a reason or two dont threaten me adrenaline began to pump through her pushing her forward until she was nearly nose to nose with him i know your kind tucker you just cant stand it that im not tripping over myself to get you to blink my way it galls your male pride when a woman isnt interested then when one is like this edda lou you cant wait to shake her off one way or another it was close enough to the truth to sting honey women come and women go doesnt mean a damn to me i dont pine away for them and i sure as hell dont kill them and as far as tripping over yourself christ she managed one short scream as he grabbed her and tossed her to the floor then the breath was knocked out of her when he landed hard on top of her she heard the explosion and thought for a moment it was the crack of her head hitting the hardwood what the hell do you think stay down holy bleeding jesus his face was only inches from hers and she saw something move into his eyes that might have been fear or cunning if you dont get off me this minute whatever she planned to do next was forgotten as she heard the next shot and watched a hole explode in the cushion of the couch just above their heads my god her fingers dug into his arms someones shooting at us you caught on sugar what are we going to do we could stay like this and hope he goes away but he wont on a sigh he lowered his forehead to hers in a gesture that was curiously intimate shit hes crazy enough to kill you too and figure it was gods will who she pounded on his back who is it edda lous daddy tucker lifted his head a fraction under the circumstances he didnt dwell on the fact that her mouth was ripe and full and naked he noticed but he didnt dwell on it the woman who was killed her father is out there shooting at us at me mostly but he wouldnt worry much about hitting you along the way i got a glimpse of him through the window while he was sighting between my eyes thats crazy a man cant go around shooting into someones house ill be sure to mention that to him if i get the chance there was only one thing to do and he hated it you got a gun around here yes my grandfathers in the den across the hall heres what i want you to do stay down keep quiet she nodded i can do that as he eased down her body she grabbed his shirt are you going to shoot him christ i hope not he shimmied back using the couch as cover then sucking in a breath when he was forced to crawl out into the open when he reached the doorway he figured he was far enough away to keep any strays from hitting caroline austin you sonofabitch theres a woman in here my daughter was a woman another slammed through the window scattering glass im going to kill you longstreet for this is the time of the lords vengeance im going to kill you then im going to slice you up into pieces just like you done to edda lou tucker pressed the heels of his hands to his eyes and concentrated you dont want to hurt the lady dont know if shes a lady might be another of your whores the lords guiding my hand this heres an eye for an eye for the lord thy god is a consuming fire the wages of sin is death while austin quoted scripture tucker bellycrawled across the hall once inside he moved quickly he grabbed a remington and with sweaty hands loaded it queasy at the knowledge that he might have to use it he moved to the window eased out the screen and crawled through the next shot had him babbling his own prayer as he hunched over and darted into the bush austin had picked his spot not two yards from the front of the house he leaned against a lone maple sweat streamed off his face and dampened the back of his camo shirt he called on jesus peppering his prayers and threats with rifle fire all of the front windows were smashed he could have rushed the house and ended it but he wanted needed to know tucker was suffering for more than thirty years hed been waiting for a way to pay back a longstreet now hed found it im going to shoot your nuts off tucker gonna blow away that cock youre so proud of thats the justice for a fornicator youll go to hell dickless thats gods will you hear me you heathen sinner you hear what im saying with little regret tucker shoved the rifle barrel into austins left ear i hear you no need to shout he hoped austin didnt notice the gun was wavering in his shaking hands put down the gun austin or ill have to put a bullet in your brain believe me itll be hard on me youll be dead but ill have to throw away this shirt its almost brand new ill kill you austin tried to turn his head but tucker poked hard with the rifle not today you wont now you toss that gun away then you unbuckle that ammo belt slow and easy when austin hesitated tucker gave him another nudge he got a ridiculous image of the barrel sliding right through austins head and poking out the other ear i know im not much of a shot but even i cant miss when ive got the barrel in your ear he breathed a little easier when austin tossed the gun aside caroline he shouted you give burke a call now tell him to get his ass down here on the double then bring me some rope the moment the ammo belt hit the dirt tucker kicked it aside now what was that about my dick austin two minutes later caroline streaked out of the house with a length of clothesline hes on his way i just she trailed off and stared down at the man sprawled in the grass his face was battered and grimy with sweat and black streaks camouflage wear covered his tanklike torso and steelgirder legs despite the fact that tucker stood over him pointing a gun at the nape of his neck the younger man looked toothpickthin and vulnerable i brought the rope she said swallowing when her voice squeaked good honey you want to scoot around behind him moistening her lips she gave austin a wide berth how did you i mean hes so big big mouth too he couldnt resist giving austin a little nudge with his foot he was so busy screaming his fire and brimstone he didnt hear the sinner coming up behind him can you shoot this thing yes she eyed the rifle sort of sort ofs good aint it austin shes liable to shoot something vital off you if you move too quick nothing more dangerous than a female with a loaded gun unless its a yankee female here now you just keep pointing that right at his head while i tie him up he balanced the gun in her hands their eyes met with twin expressions of giddy relief for an instant they were the fastest of friends thats the way sugar just dont point it at me now if he moves you just press your finger then close your eyes cause itll blow his head off and i wouldnt want you to see something that nasty he winked at her so that she understood the warning was for austins benefit okay but im a little shaky i hope i dont press it without meaning to tucker grinned as he hunkered down to tie austins hands just do the best you can caro nobody can ask for better than that gonna hogtie you austin seems to fit he looped the cord and tugged bowing austins beefy legs dont seem right to me that you blew out all this ladys windows ruined her davenport too as i recall miss edith was fond of that davenport he stepped back to take the gun from caroline darlin would you mind fetching me a beer ive worked up a thirst she had an insane urge to laugh i dont have any beer that is i have some wine some chardonnay she babbled thatd go down nice too all right i sure she started up the steps then turned back to see tucker taking out a cigarette putting a hand to her giddy head she watched him pinch off the tip why do you do that hmm he squinted as he struck a match tear off the tip oh he drew in smoke with every indication of pleasure im fixin to quit seems a sensible way to go about it figure after a couple weeks ill be down to a half a smoke at a time he smiled at her wildly attractive and pale as a sheet you put that chardonnay in a big glass for me now okay yeah she let out a shaky breath as she heard the wail of a siren tucker was still close enough that she heard the same sigh of relief from him you bet the screen door slammed behind her chapter seven thunder grumbled over in the east a breeze the first shed felt since crossing the mississippi border stirred the leaves in the maple where not thirty minutes before a man had stood with a loaded rifle it didnt seem reasonable or even possible but caroline found herself sitting on the porch steps drinking chardonnay out of a water glass with what was left of the bottle wedged between her hip and tuckers her life she decided as she took another long swallow had certainly taken some interesting twists and turns this is good stuff tucker swirled the wine he was beginning to feel mellow again a state he preferred its a particular favorite of mine mine too now he turned his head and smiled at her nice breeze very nice weve been needing rain yes i suppose he leaned back on his elbows lifting his face to the cool the way the winds coming it shouldnt blow the wet into your parlor almost absently she turned to look at her shattered windows well theres good news we wouldnt want it to soak the couch after all it has only one bullet hole he gave her a friendly pat on the back youre a good sport caro i expect some women wouldve gone bawling or screaming or fainting but you held up fine right since her glass was nearly empty she refilled it tucker may i ask you a regional sort of question he held his glass out enjoying the music of fine wine striking fine wine when she poured right now sweetie you can ask me damn near anything i was curious are murders and shootouts common in this part of the state or is this just a phase well now he contemplated the wine in his glass before drinking speaking for innocence and since my familys been here since before the war thats the war between the states naturally i feel confident in holding an opinion on it i have to say were new to the kind of murder youre thinking of now whiteford talbot blew a goodsized hole in cal beauford back when i was a kid but whiteford caught old cal shimmying down the drainpipe outside his bedroom window and whitefords wife that was ruby talbot was buckass naked in bed at the time an entirely different matter caroline concluded there you go and not more than five years back the bonny boys and the shivers peppered each other with buckshot but that was only over a pig and seeing as theyre cousins and crazy too nobody paid much attention i see by jesus tucker thought he liked her liked her in a companionable sort of way that ran a friendly parallel alongside physical attraction but mostly innocence is pretty peaceable she frowned over the rim of her glass do you put that on which is that that slightly addled goodolboy routine he grinned and drank only if it seems appropriate she sighed and looked away overhead the sky was darkening and the occasional rumbles of thunder were closer as were the quick sharp flashes of lightning but it felt good too good just to sit are you worried when the sheriff took that man away he kept swearing he was going to kill you no use getting in a lather over it but the concern in her voice stirred the juices smoothly he slid an arm around her shoulders dont you worry sweetheart i wouldnt want you to fret over me she turned her head again her face was inches from his its a bit morbid isnt it using a neardeath experience as a seduction ouch he was goodnatured enough to laugh experienced enough to keep his arm where it was are you always so suspicious of a man of a certain kind of man she lifted a hand and unwrapped his arm from her shoulders thats cold caro after all weve shared on a sigh of regret he touched his glass to hers dont suppose youd invite me to supper her lips twitched i dont suppose i would maybe youd play me another tune she didnt smile now only shook her head im taking a break from playing for anyone now thats a shame tell you what ill play for you her brows lifted in surprise you play the violin hell no but i play the radio he stood and realized abruptly the wine had gone straight to his head it wasnt a feeling he objected to strolling to his car he pushed through his cassettes after choosing one he turned the key to auxiliary and popped it in fats domino he said with proper respect as blueberry hill slid out he walked back holding out a hand come on before caroline could refuse he was pulling her to her feet and into his arms i just cant hear this song and not want to dance with a pretty woman she could have protested or broken away but it was harmless and after the last twentyfour hours she needed a little harmless diversion so she settled against him enjoying the fluid way he moved from walk to lawn laughing a little when he eased her back into a dip appreciating the way the wine spun inside her head feel good he murmured hmmm youre smooth tucker maybe too smooth but its a lot better than being shot at i was thinking the same thing he nuzzled his cheek against her hair it was soft as silk against his skin since hed always had a weakness for texture he didnt try to prevent himself from feeling the contrast of her buttersmooth cheek against his or the way her blouse shifted under his guiding hand how long and slim her thighs were as they brushed and bumped against his the sexual pull didnt surprise him it was as natural as breathing what did surprise him was the overwhelming desire to toss her over his shoulder and carry her inside upstairs hed always preferred to take it slow and easy with the ladies savoring the chase holding on to control dancing with her as the air took on that hushed and pearly light before a storm had him jumpy tucker passed it off as due to his being more than half drunk its raining caroline whispered her eyes were closed and her body swayed with his umhmm he could smell the rain on her hair on her skin and it was driving him crazy she smiled enjoying the way the slow fat drops soaked through her clothes thered been no rifle fire in her life before she mused but thered been no dancing in the rain either its cool wonderfully cool the way he was starting to feel he was surprised the rain didnt sizzle as it plopped against his skin he found his teeth were at her ear and her quick surprised shudder when he closed them gently over the lobe sliced straight through him her eyes shot open glazed for a moment as he nipped his way along her jawline something hot and delicious stirred in her gut before she managed to cut it off an instant before his mouth took hers she slapped a hand on his chest and leaned back what do you think youre doing he blinked kissing you no he stared at her for a moment at the rain streaming down her hair at her eyes which betrayed as much passion as determination there was an urge to ignore the protesting hand and take what he wanted the fact that he couldnt had him sighing out an oath caroline youre a hard woman the alarm bells in her head slowed her lips curved a little he wasnt going to push so they say i could hang around awhile persuade you to change your mind i dont think so his eyes laughed he made one slow pass down her back before releasing her now thats a challenge but i figure you had a difficult day so ill save it i appreciate that you damn well should he took her hand skimmed his thumb over her knuckles and damn him she felt the shiver clean down to her toes youre going to think about me caroline when you snuggle into your bed tonight what im going to think about is getting those windows repaired his gaze moved beyond her to the jagged glass stabbing viciously from the worn wooden frame i owe you for that he said and there was a grimness in his eyes that reminded her how theyd come to be holding hands in the rain i think its austin hatinger who owes me she said lightly but that wont get my windows fixed ill take care of it he looked back at her you sure are pretty when youre wet if i stay around much longer im going to try to kiss you again then youd better go she started to tug her hand away then glanced at his car laughter bubbled out tucker did you know your tops down shit he turned and stared rain was bouncing off his white leather upholstery thats the trouble with women they distract you before she pulled her hand free he brought it to his lips for a long kiss that ended with the barest scrape of teeth ill be back caroline she smiled stepped back then bring some window glass and a hammer he slid into his car without bothering to lift the top tucker gunned the engine blew her a kiss and started down the lane in the rearview mirror he watched her standing in the rain her hair like wet wheat her clothes clinging to her curves fats belted out aint that a shame tucker could only agree caroline waited until hed driven out of sight before she walked back to the steps sat and downed the raindiluted wine susie had been right she thought tucker longstreet was no more a killer than she was and he did indeed have a way about him she rubbed the hand hed kissed over her cheek and let out a long shaky breath it was a good thing she wasnt interested eyes closed caroline lifted her face to the rain a very good thing when she awakened the next morning it was in a foul mood shed slept poorly and dammit she had thought of him between that and the sound of the rain pattering against the tin roof shed tossed and turned the better part of the night shed nearly given up and downed one of the sleeping pills left over from dr palamos last prescription but shed resisted wanting to prove something to herself as a result she opened bleary eyes to steamy sunlight on top of it her head was pounding from the wine as she swallowed aspirin and stepped under the shower she knew exactly where to place the blame if it hadnt been for tucker she wouldnt have indulged in too much wine if it hadnt been for tucker she wouldnt have laid awake half the night taunted by an unwanted sexual ache and if it hadnt been for tucker she wouldnt have holes in her house that had to be dealt with before flies mosquitoes and god knew what else decided to come in and live with her so much for peace and tranquility she thought as she stepped out of the shower to dry off so much for a quiet period of healing since shed had the misfortune to bump into tucker her life had been in upheaval dead women crazy men with rifles muttering to herself caroline pulled on her robe why the hell hadnt she gone to the south of france and baked herself whole on a nice crowded beach because shed wanted to come home she thought with a sigh despite the fact that shed spent only a few precious days of her childhood in this house it was as close to home as she had nothing and no one was going to spoil it for her caroline marched downstairs one hand nursing her drumming head she was going to have her quiet time she was going to sit on the porch and watch the sunset tend flowers listen to music she was going to be just as peaceful and solitary as she chose starting right this minute chin set she shoved open the front door and let out a strangled scream a black man with a scarred cheek and shoulders like a brahma bull stood by a broken window caroline caught the glint of metal in his hand her thoughts tumbled over each other to dash inside and try for the phone to streak to her car and hope the keys were inside it to simply stand and scream miz waverly maam after a frantic search she found her voice ive called the sheriff yesm tuck told me you had yourself some trouble out here i excuse me hatinger blew out your windows sheriffs got him down in jail i oughta be able to take care of things right quick take care she saw his hand move and sucked in air to scream let it out again when she saw that the metal in his hand was a tape measure while she fought to lower her pulse rate he stretched the tape across the empty space where glass had been youre going to fix the windows yesm tuck gave me a call last night said hed let you know id be by in the morning sos i could measure them up and reglaze his nutbrown eyes flickered then filled with quiet amusement guess he didnt let you know no as relief and annoyance flooded through caroline pressed a hand to her speeding heart no he didnt mention it tucks not what you call dependable ive come to understand that with a nod he jotted figures on a pad guess i gave you a turn thats all right she managed a smile i think im getting used to it settling she ran fingers through her damp hair you didnt mention your name im toby march he tugged on the brim of his battered fielders cap in a kind of salute i do handyman kind of work its nice to meet you mr march after a moments hesitation he took the offered hand just call me toby maam everybody does well toby i appreciate you

i was just about to make a pot id sure be obliged then black with three sugars if you dont mind ill bring it out in a minute the phone began to ring excuse me pressing a hand to her forehead caroline hurried down the hall and snatched up the receiver yes well honey you sure do lead an exciting life susie caroline leaned back against the banister whoever said small towns were uneventful nobody who lived in one burke said you werent hurt any id have come down to see for myself but the boys had a sleepover even keeping an eye on them the place looks like we had a war im fine really except for a hangover shattered nerves and an unwelcome dose of sexual frustration just a little frazzled who could blame you honey tell you what were having a barbecue tomorrow you come out here and sit in the shade eat till you cant walk and forget all about your troubles that sounds wonderful five oclock you drive into town go all the way to the end of market and turn left on magnolia were the third house on the right the yellow one with white shutters you have any trouble finding it just follow the smell of charring ribs ill be there thanks susie caroline hung up and started back to the kitchen she put the coffee on popped some bread in the toaster and took out some of the wild raspberry jam the sun was sizzling on the wet grass outside and the wild hot smell was as appealing as the scent of coffee she watched a woodpecker settle against the side of a tree to root for breakfast from the front porch came tobys voice a rich creamy baritone it was lifted in a bodyswaying gospel tune about finding peace caroline found that her headache had vanished her eyes were clear all in all it was good to be home not so far away someone lay tangled in sweaty sheets and moaned in sleep dreams like dark twisted rivers flowed dreams of sex of blood of power the dreams were not always remembered in the daylight sometimes they flitted in those waking moments razorwinged butterflies slicing through the mind and leaving shallow wounds that stung women there were always women those brutal smirking bitches the need for them the smooth skin the soft scent the hot flavors was hateful it could be overcome for long stretches for days weeks even months there could be a gentleness a warmth even a respect and then then one of them would do something something that required punishment the pain would begin the hunger would grow and nothing would quench it but blood but even through the pain even through the hunger there was guile there was a wild satisfaction in knowing that no matter how they looked how they struggled no one would find proof madness was alive in innocence but it cloaked itself well as the summer wore on it would fester inside its unwilling host and smile dr theodore rubenstein teddy to his friends polished off his second cherry danish he washed the pastry down with lukewarm pepsi straight from the bottle hed never developed a taste for coffee teddy had just skimmed past his fortieth birthday and had begun to comb grecian formula through his thick brown hair he wasnt balding praise be but he didnt care for the professorial look the threads of gray gave him teddy considered himself a funloving kind of guy he knew that with his small dark eyes slightly receding chin and sallow complexion he wasnt heartstirring handsome he used humor to attract the ladies personality he liked to tell himself caught as much pussy as a perfect profile humming to himself he scrubbed his hands in the sink in palmers embalming room the sink just below the trick picture of jesus to amuse himself teddy swayed from side to side when he shifted left jesus wore a red robe a kindly expression and held an elegant hand up to the valentineshaped heart prominent on his chest shift right and the face shivered for an instant then moved to sadness and pain understandable as there was now a crown of thorns perched atop the chestnut hair thin rivulets of blood marring the intellectual forehead teddy wondered which image palmer preferred before he reached for his rockhard cavity fluid while he experimented trying to find that precise point where he could stand and have the two images merge into one he dried his hands behind him edda lou hatinger lay naked on the porcelain embalming table the oldfashioned kind with the runoff grooves along the sides her skin was ghastly under the merciless fluorescent lights such things didnt put old teddy off his danishes hed chosen pathology because hed been expected to go to medical school he was the fourth generation of rubensteins with doctor in front of his name but long before hed completed his first year of internship hed discovered in himself a nearly obsessive abhorrence of sick people dead was different it had never bothered him to work on a cadaver hospital rounds with the wheezing moaning patients had put him off but the first time hed been called upon to watch a dissection he knew hed found his vocation the dead didnt complain they didnt need to be saved and they sure as hell werent going to sue for malpractice instead they were like a puzzle you took them apart figured out what went wrong and filed your report teddy was good at puzzles and he knew he was a hell of a lot better with the dead than with the living both of his exwives would have been more than happy to point out his lack of sensitivity his selfishness and his ghoulish offputting sense of humor though teddy happened to think he was a pretty funny guy putting a joy buzzer in a cadavers hand was a surefire way to liven up a dull autopsy burns wouldnt think so but then teddy enjoyed irritating burns he smiled to himself as he snapped on surgical gloves hed been working on a trick for weeks waiting for the opportunity to pull it on someone like straightandnarrow matt burns all hed needed was a suitably mangled victim teddy blew edda lou a kiss in thanks as he turned on his tape recorder what we have here he began using a thick southern accent is a female caucasian midtwenties identified as edda lou hatinger got her height as five foot five weight one twentysix and boys and girls shes built like your oldfashioned brick shithouse that teddy thought gleefully would burn burns our guest today suffered from multiple stab wounds pardon me edda lou he said as he made his count twentytwo punctures concentrated on the areas of breasts torso and genitalia a sharp smoothbladed instrument was used to sever her jugular trachea and larynx in a horizontal stroke from the angle and depth id say left to right indicating a righthanded assailant in laymans terms ladies and gentlemen her throat was slit from ear to ear probably by a knife with a he whistled as he measured six to seveninch blade anybody out there see crocodile dundee he tried on a heavy aussie accent now thats a knife on examination of other traumas this throat wound was probable cause of death it would do the job believe me im a doctor he whistled theme from a summer place as he continued his exam a blow to the base of the skull by a heavy roughtextured instrument delicately he tweezered out fragments bagging fragments that appear to be wood or tree bark for forensic i think well agree that victim was clubbed with a tree branch blow issued prior to death if you detectives out there conclude that the blow rendered the victim unconscious you win a free trip for two to barbados and a complete set of samsonite luggage he glanced up as the door opened burns nodded at him teddy smiled let the record show that special agent matthew burns has arrived to watch the master at work hows it hanging burnsie your progress oh edda lou and i are getting to know each other thought wed go dancing later inside burnss clenched jaw his teeth ground together as always rubenstein your humor is revolting and pathetic edda lou appreciates it dont you dear he patted her hand bruises and broken skin at wrists and ankles using his tools he located and removed tiny white fibers bagged them while he continued to detail cheerfully his findings burns suffered through another fifteen minutes was she sexually assaulted pretty hard to tell teddy said through pursed lips im going to take tissue samples burns averted his eyes as teddy did so i put her in the water for twelve to fifteen hours a rough guess before i run the tests puts time of death between eleven and three on the night of june sixteenth i want those results asap teddy continued taking his scrapings god i love it when you talk in acronyms burns ignored him i want to know everything there is to know about her what she ate when she ate it if she was drugged or had used alcohol if she had sexual relations she was supposed to be pregnant i want to know how many weeks ill take a look teddy turned ostensibly to exchange instruments you might want to check out her left molar i found it very interesting her teeth thats right ive never seen anything like it intrigued burns leaned over he opened edda lous mouth narrowed his eyes kiss me you fool she demanded burns yelped and stumbled back jesus jesus christ as laughter doubled him over teddy had to sit down or fall down hed spent months studying ventriloquism for just such a moment the wildeyed panic on burns face had made it all worthwhile youve got some style burnsie even dead women fall for you fighting for control burns clenched his fists at his sides if he took a swipe at rubenstein hed have no choice but to put himself on report youre fucking crazy teddy only pointed at burnss white face pointed at edda lous gray one and whooped there wasnt any use threatening burns knew any official complaint he made would be duly noted then ignored rubenstein was the best a known lunatic but the best i want the results of your tests by the end of the day rubenstein you may find it all highly amusing but i have a psychopath to stop unable to speak teddy just nodded and held his aching ribs when burns swung out the door teddy wiped his teary eyes and slid off the stool edda lou honey he said in a voice still breathless with mirth i cant thank you enough for your cooperation believe me youre going down in the annals of history for this one the boys back in dc are going to love it whistling he picked up his scalpel and went back to work chapter eight darleen fuller talbot listened to the sounds of the truesdale barbecue drifting through her bedroom window she thought it was a damn shame that uppity susie truesdale hadnt even invited her own nextdoor neighbor to the party darleen wouldve liked a party to take her mind off her troubles of course susie didnt socialize with darleen she preferred the longstreets or the shayses or the noseintheair cunninghams from across the street and didnt she know for certain that highandmighty john cunningham had cheated on his prissy wife with josie longstreet it seemed to darleen that susie had forgotten shed had to get married and had waited tables at the chat n chew while her belly was bulging maybe her husband had come from rich but he hadnt ended up that way everybody knew burkes daddy had killed himself because all he had left was a pile of debts the truesdales were no better than she was and neither were the longstreets maybe her daddy made his way working at a cotton gin instead of owning one but he wasnt a drunk and he wasnt dead darleen thought it was downright unfriendly that susie would give a party right out in the backyard where the smell of grilling meat and spicy sauce could make someone feel lonely why even her own brother was down there not that bobby lee ever gave his sisters feelings any thought the hell with him the tightassed truesdales and everybody else she didnt want to go to any damn party anyhow even if junior was working four to midnight down at the gas station how could she laugh and lick barbecue sauce off her fingers when her very best friend in all the world was going to be set in the ground come tuesday she sighed and billy t who was sucking for all his worth on her rosy breasts took that to mean she was finally going to start putting some effort into it he shifted so he could stick his tongue in her ear come on baby you get on top okay that perked her interest junior not only liked it only in bed these days but he liked it only in one position when they were finished billy t lay puffing contentedly on a marlboro darleen stared at the ceiling listening to the music from the truesdales billy t she said her mouth moving into a pout dont you figure its rude to give a party and not ask your nextdoor neighbors shit darleen will you stop worrying about them people it just aint right piqued by his lack of sympathy darleen rose to fetch her rosescented talcum powder if she was going to pick up scooter from her mas in an hour it was the quickest way to soak up the scent of sweat and sex i mean she thinks shes bettern me her snotty marvella too just cause theyre friends with the longstreets she tugged on her tshirt and shorts forgoing underwear as a concession to the heat her breasts high and full and round bulged against the cotton distorting the faded picture of elvis that tuckers down there right now cozying up to the waverly woman why edda lou aint even buried yet tuckers a shithead always was well edda lou loved him to distraction he brought her perfume she sent a hopeful look toward billy t but he was too busy blowing smoke rings darleen turned back to frown out the window i just hate them hate them all why if burke truesdale wasnt tuckers best friend that boy would be locked up same as austin hatinger hell billy t rubbed his damp belly and wondered if they could get in one more poke tuckers a shithead but he aint no killer everybody knows it was a black that done it them blacks the ones who like to carve up white women he broke her heart just the same it just seems he ought to pay somehow she looked back at billy t one tear slipping out of one eye i sure wish someone would get back at him for making her so unhappy before she died as the laughter rose up from the next yard infuriating her darleen blinked her wet lashes why i guess id do just about anything for somebody who had the guts to pay him back billy t crushed out his cigarette in the little ashtray that had a picture of the washington monument on it well now honey if you were to come on over here and show me how much you want it it might be i could do something to even things out oh honey darleen tugged elvis away from her breasts as she rose to kneel between billy ts legs youre so good to me while darleen was busy bringing a smile to billy ts face ribs were sizzling on the grill in the yard next door burke presided over them wearing a big apron that sported a cartoon chef and the caption kiss the cook or else he tipped back a budweiser with one hand and sauced the ribs with the other susie hauled bowls and platters from the kitchen to the picnic table shooting off orders to her children to grab the potato salad fetch more ice to stop sneaking the deviled eggs caroline had to admire the orchestration one would swing into the kitchen another would swing out although two of the boys tommy and parker she remembered would occasionally pause for a few elbow pokes and jostling the choreography went smoothly the younger boy sam named after uncle sam as hed be nine on the fourth of july was engrossed in showing his baseball card selection to tucker tucker was sprawled on the grass and despite the heat held sam in his lap as they perused the album ill trade you my eightysix rickey henderson for that cal ripkin nuhuh sams mop of sandy hair flopped in his eyes as he shook his head thiss cals rookie year but youve gone and bent the corner son and my hendersons in prime condition might even throw in my brandnew wade boggs shoot thats nothin sam turned his head and caroline caught the gleam in his dark eyes i want the sixtythree pete rose thats robbery boy im going to have your daddy throw you in jail for even suggesting it burke this boys a born criminal better send him off to reform school now and save yourself the heartache he knows a scam when he hears one burke said mildly hes still pissed that i got his mickey mantle back in sixtyeight tucker murmured to sam the man doesnt understand creative trading now about that cal ripkin ill take twentyfive dollars for it shit that does it he caught sam in a headlock and hissed in his ear you see that guy sitting there working on boring miss waverly to death the one in the suit yes sir the one in the suit hes an fbi agent and asking twentyfive dollars for cal ripkins rookie year is a federal offense nuhuh sam said grinning it sure as god is and your daddyd be the first to tell you ignorance of the law is no excuse im going to have to turn you in sam studied matthew burns then shrugged he looks like a pansy tucker hooted with laughter where do you learn these things he decided to try another tack and see if he could torture the card from sam he flipped the boy over hung him upside down then began to tickle him as caroline watched them wrestle she lost track of burnss conversation something about the symphony ball at the kennedy center she let him drone on managing an occasional smile or murmur of agreement she was much more interested in watching the other guests a scattering of people were huddled under the shade of an oak it was the only tree in the yard and a perfect place for a gathering of lawn chairs and lazy conversation the skinny swarthylooking pathologist was making some of the ladies giggle caroline wondered how a man could perform an autopsy one day and tell jokes the next josie was posed in a tire swing flirting with him and with every other man within reach dwayne longstreet and doc shays were sitting on the back porch rocking and sipping beers marvella truesdale and bobby lee fuller were sending each other long intimate looks and the beautyshop owner crystal something was gossiping with birdie shays she could see little patches of yard running on either side of the truesdales the clothes strung on lines to bake dry in the yellow sun there were kitchen gardens in nearly every one with tomatoes heavy on vines snap beans collards waiting for the pot she could smell the beer the spicy meat the hot flowers baking in the late afternoon sun tommy punched a new cassette in his portable radio and blues drifted out heavy on the bass bittersweet and slow and easy as heartbreak caroline didnt recognize bonnie raitt but she recognized excellence she wanted to hear it she wanted to hear sam squeal and giggle as tucker wrestled him she wanted to hear crystal and birdie gossip about someone whod died twenty years earlier in a car wreck she wanted to dance to that music to watch the way burke kissed his wife through the fragrant smoke of the grill kissed her as if they were still teenagers sneaking love in shadows and she wanted to feel what marvella was feeling when bobby lee took her hand and pulled her through the kitchen door she wanted to be a part of it not someone sitting on the sidelines discussing rachmaninoff excuse me matthew she offered him a quick smile as she swung her legs over the wooden bench i want to see if susie needs any help while sam bounced on his back tucker admired the way carolines neat white shorts showed off her legs he sighed when she bent down to pick up a frisbee then he yanked sam over his back gave him a quick pink belly and rose i think ill get myself a beer caroline paused by the grill smells great she said to burke five more minuets he promised and susie laughed thats what he always says what can i get you caroline nothing im fine i thought you could use some help honey thats what ive got four kids for i just want you to sit down and relax really i she sent a cautious look over her shoulder burns was still sitting at the table his tie ruthlessly knotted as he sipped the chardonnay caroline had brought as a contribution oh susie had followed her glance i guess there are times a woman needs to keep herself occupied why dont you run in and fetch the breadandbutter pickles theres a fresh jar in the cabinet left of the refrigerator grateful caroline headed off to comply on the porch doc shays tipped his hat dwayne gave her the sweet absent smile of a man already half drunk caroline stepped inside and pulled up short bobby lee and marvella were locked in a heated embrace in front of the refrigerator when the screen door slammed they jumped apart marvella flushed and hitched her blouse back into place bobby lee offered a smile that was caught somewhere between prideful and sheepish im terribly sorry caroline began uncertain who was the most flustered i just came in to get something for susie there was enough heat in the kitchen to fry bacon i can come back she nearly backed into the door when tucker pulled it open caro you cant leave these two in here alone he winked at bobby lee kitchens are dangerous places yall get outside where your mamas can keep an eye on you im eighteen marvella said with a gleam in her eye were both grownup tucker grinned and pinched her chin thats my point sweetie pie besides marvella went on were getting married marvella the tips of bobby lees ears turned bright red i havent even talked to your daddy yet she tossed her head we know what we want dont we well yeah he swallowed under tuckers quiet stare sure but its only right i talk to him before we say anything she hooked an arm through his then youd better start talking she pulled him through the back door tucker stared after them jesus shaken he dragged a hand through his hair she used to drool on my shoulder now shes talking about getting married from the look in her eyes id say it was more than talk how the helld she get to be eighteen tucker wondered i was just eighteen myself a minute ago with a light laugh caroline patted his arm dont worry tucker i have a feeling shell be giving you another baby to drool on your shoulder in a year or two holy god even the thought had him sputtering thatd make me something like a grandfather wouldnt it im thirty goddamn three im too young to be a grandfather id think it would be more of an honorary title doesnt matter he looked at the beer in his hand im not going to think about it im sure thats wise she turned to open the cupboard what are breadandbutter pickles hmm he turned back to her and his thoughts about life and aging flitted away lord she did have fine legs and the sweetest little butt top shelf he said stretch on up there he watched the way her shorts rode high on her thighs when she rose to her toes and reached thats the way carolines fingers brushed the jar before she realized what was going on dropping back on her heels she glanced over her shoulder youre a sick man tucker i do feel a fever coming on still grinning he strolled over here let me help you with that his body pressed lightly against hers as he reached for the jar you smell good caro like something a man would be happy to wake up to in the morning the instant jolt of reaction forced her to take a slow breath like coffee and bacon he chuckled and pleased himself by nuzzling her neck like soft lazy sex too much was happening inside her too much too fast tingles and pressures and muscles going lax she hadnt felt anything like it since luis her muscles tensed again youre crowding me tucker im trying he plucked the jar out set it on the counter putting his hands on her hips he turned her toward him you ever come across something like a piece of music that kept playing through your mind even when you didnt think you were that fond of it his hands slid up his thumbs just brushing the sides of her breasts the blood began to swim in her head i suppose i have thats the trouble im having with you caroline you just keep playing through my head you could almost say im fixated his eyes were level with hers and so close she saw that there was a faint and fascinating outline of green around his pupils maybe you should think of a different tune he leaned closer and when she stiffened contented himself with a light quick nip on her bottom lip ive always had the damnedest time doing what i should he lifted a hand to rub his knuckles over her cheek she had a way of looking at him tucker realized a straight unwavering gaze that made him feel defensive protective and weakkneed all at once did he hurt you or just disappoint you i dont know what you mean youre skittish caro i figure theres a reason the liquid warmth that had been spreading through her hardened into iron will skittish is a word better applied to horses what i am is uninterested and the reason for that might be that i dont find you appealing now thats a lie he said mildly the uninterested part if we didnt have company right outside the door id show you how i know its a lie but im a patient man caro and i never blame a woman who likes to be persuaded hot temper streaked to her throat all but scalding her tongue oh im sure youve persuaded more than your share of women like edda lou amusement fled from his eyes to be replaced by anger then by something else something akin to grief even as he stepped back she laid a hand on his arm tucker im sorry that was despicable he lifted his beer to swill some of the bitterness out of his throat it was close enough to truth she shook her head you pushed the wrong button but thats no excuse for saying something like that to you i am sorry forget it he set aside the empty beer and as much of the hurt as he could manage they heard burke shout and though tuckers lips curved she saw that the smile didnt reach his eyes looks like were finally going to eat go on take that jar out ill be along all right she paused at the door wishing there was something she could say but another apology was useless when the door swung behind her tucker laid his forehead against the refrigerator he didnt know what he was feeling didnt have words for it he hated that his feelings had always come so easily even the bad ones but this morass of emotion that churned inside him at odd times was new unpleasant and more than a little frightening hed even dreamed of edda lou and shed come to him with her body torn and bloated with death moss and dank water had dripped from her hair and her skin had oozed black blood as she pointed a skeletal finger at him she had not had to speak for him to know what she meant his fault she was dead and it was his fault christ almighty what was he going to do tucker honey josie slipped into the kitchen to curl an arm around him you feeling bad as bad as it gets he thought but let out a sigh headache thats all he smiled as he turned to her too much beer on an empty stomach she stroked his hair ive got aspirin in my purse extrastrength something or other id rather have food lets go get you a plate she kept her arm around him as she walked to the door and onto the porch dwaynes already mostly drunk and i dont want to have to haul both of you home especially since ive got a date tonight whos the winner that fbi doctor hes just cute enough to eat she chuckled and sent teddy rubenstein a wave i thought id try him out for crystal shes been sending a lot of looks his way youre a true friend josie i know it she took a deep breath lets get some of those ribs beyond the old slave quarters with their heatbaked stone beyond the cotton fields smelling of fertilizer and pesticides was the dark horseshoeshaped pond that sweetwater was named for the water wasnt so sweet now as the poisons used to kill weevils and other crop pests seeped into the ground generation after generation and thence into the lake but if it wasnt fit to drink if most would think twice or more about eating any fish caught there it was still a nice sight under a crescent moon reeds danced languorously in the current and frogs talked and plopped cypress knees poked through the surface like old dark bones the night was clear enough that you could see the gentle ripples on the surface made by mosquitoes and the creatures that snacked on them dwayne had shifted from the beer hed drunk at burkes barbecue to his favorite wild turkey the bottle was only a quarter empty but he was feeling miserably drunk hed have preferred to sit in the house and drink until he passed out but delia would have laid into him and he was sick to death of women picking at him the letter from sissy had him eagerly fueling his anger with whiskey she was going to marry her shoe salesman he didnt care about that he told himself he didnt give a flying fuck if she married some asshole who put his hands all over other peoples feet christ knew he didnt want her never had if it came to that but hed be damned if shed dangle his kids in front of him to try and soak him for more money expensive private schools expensive clothes hed come through hadnt he even when sissy and her slickhaired lawyer had made it next to impossible for him to so much as see either of the boys limited supervised visitations they called it just because he liked to have a drink now and then scowling at the dark water dwayne guzzled more whiskey theyd made him out to be some kind of monster and hed never laid a hand on those kids sissy either if it came to that though hed been sorely tempted a time or two just to show her her place but he wasnt a violent man dwayne reminded himself not like his own daddy had been he could hold his liquor just fine and had proven it since he was fifteen and sissy koons had known just what she was getting when shed spread her legs for him had he blamed her for getting pregnant no sir hed married her bought her a nice house and all the pretty clothes she wanted given her more than shed deserved dwayne told himself now remembering the letter if she thought he was going to let that guitarplaying shoe hawker adopt his blood children she had another think coming hed see her in hell first and hed be damned if hed buckle under to that veiled threat that shed take him back to court if he didnt increase his monthly child support payments it wasnt the money he didnt give a damn about money tucker took care of all that it was the principle more money shed said in her wheedling way or your sonsll be wearing another mans name his children he thought again his symbol of his own immortality and he had a fondness for them of course they were his blood after all his link to the future his shackles to the past that was why he sent them presents and candy bars but it was a whole lot different if you had to deal with them facetoface he could still remember how little dwayne whod been no more than three had wailed and cried when he walked in on his daddy during a mean drunk dwayne had been getting a lot of satisfaction out of smashing sissys company glasses against the wall then sissy had run in scooping up little dwayne as if his father had been tossing him against the wall instead of the goldrimmed tumblers and the baby had started to bawl dwayne had just stood there wanting nothing more than to bash all their heads together you want something to cry for by god ill give you something to cry for thats what his daddy would have said and the lot of them would have trembled in their boots he thought maybe he had said it too maybe hed screamed it but sissy hadnt trembled she just screamed back at him her face all red her eyes full of fury and disgust he almost slapped her dwayne remembered he came within a hair of knocking her sideways he even lifted his arm and saw his fathers hand on the end of it instead he stumbled out and drove off to wreck another car sissy had the door bolted when burke hauled him home the next day and that had been a powerful humiliation not being able to get into his own house and having his wife shout out through the window that she was going down to greenville to see a lawyer innocence had been ripe with talks for weeks about how sissy kicked dwayne out of the house and tossed his clothes through the upstairs window he had to drink himself into oblivion for days to be able to take it with a shrug women just messed up the natural order of things now here was sissy popping back to do it again what made it worse what made it bitter was that sissy was going to do something with her life shed shed sweetwater as easily as a snake sheds skin and was moving on while he he was bound and mired in generations of longstreet obligations the expectations a father passed on to his son a woman didnt have that to tie her down no a woman could do just as she damn well pleased it was easy to hate them for that dwayne tipped back the bottle and brooded he watched the dark water and as he sometimes did imagined himself just walking into it going under taking a big deadly drink and sinking to the bottom with his lungs full of lake his eyes still on the surface he drank drowning himself in whiskey instead at a table at mcgreedys tavern josie was just heating up next to the beauty parlor the tavern was her favorite spot in town she loved its dark whiskeysoaked walls its sticky floors its rocky tables she loved it every bit as much as she loved the equally boozy but much more elegant parties she often attended in atlanta and charlotte and memphis it never failed to cheer her up to walk into that smoke and liquortainted air listen to the country sounds on the juke to the voices raised in anger or amusement the snap of pool balls from the room in the back shed brought teddy here to down a few beers at her favorite table under the head of the scarred old buck mcgreedy had bagged back when people were pinning i like ike buttons to their lapels she slapped teddy on the back hooted with laughter at an outrageous joke hed told her then reached for her cigarette youre a pistol teddy you sure you havent got a wife hiding somewhere two exes teddy grinned through josies haze of smoke he hadnt had so much fun since hed rigged a cadaver with fishing wire so he could make the arms and legs move in time with twist and shout now thats a coincidence ive got two of my own first one was a lawyer smiling she drew the word out into two elongated syllables a fine upstanding young man from a fine upstanding charleston family just the kind of husband my mama wanted me to hook on to nearly bored me to death before the year was out stuffy oh honey she tilted her head back so the cool beer slid straight down i tried to shake him out of it i gave a party a fancy dress ball for new years i came as lady godiva cocking a brow she ran her hand through her wild black hair i wore a blond wig her eyes glittered as she rested her chin on her hands just the wig old franklin that was his name franklin just couldnt get himself in a partying mood teddy could easily imagine her in nothing more than a fall of blond hair and figured hed have partied just fine no sense of humor he commented you said it so naturally when i decided to go husbandhunting again i looked for a different kind i met a rough tough cowboy type on a dude ranch up in oklahoma we had some high old times she sighed reminiscing then i found out he was cheating on me that wasnt so bad but it turned out he was cheating with cowboys instead of cowgirls ouch teddy said wincing in sympathy and i thought it was rough just having my wives tell me i had a disgusting job he gave josie a wink women dont usually find my work suitable for conversation i think its fascinating she signaled for another round shifting so that she could rub her bare foot over his calf you have to be smart dont you running all those tests finding out who killed someone just by cutting up you know a corpse her eyes glowed as she leaned closer i just dont see how it works teddy i mean how can you tell about a killer from a dead body well he slurped up some beer its pretty technical but in easy terms you just put all the puzzle pieces together cause of death time and place fibers maybe blood that doesnt belong to the victim skin scrapings hair samples sounds creepy josie gave a delicate shudder are you finding out stuff about edda lou weve got the time the place and the method unlike some of his colleagues he wasnt bored by shop talk once i conclude my tests im going to correlate my findings with the county coroners on the other two women sympathetic teddy patted her hand i guess you knew all of them i sure did went to school with francie and arnette arnette and i even doubledated some in our wild misspent youth she grinned into her beer and i guess i knew edda lou all her life not that we were good friends but its scary thinking about her dying she cupped her chin on her hands there was a gypsy look about her that long curling black hair the golden eyes and golden skin shed exploited the image that day by adding wide hoops to her ears and baring her shoulders in a red elasticnecked blouse teddys mouth watered just looking at her i guess you cant tell if she suffered much josie said softly i can tell you most of the wounds were inflicted after death he gave her hand a comforting squeeze dont you think about it i cant help it her eyes flicked down to her fresh drink then back to his to tell the truth i can tell you the truth cant i teddy sure death just fascinates me she gave a quick embarrassed laugh then leaned closer he caught a seductive drift of her perfume felt the brush of her breast against his arm i guess i can tell you because its your business when people get killed and its in the papers and on the tv i just lap it up he chuckled everybody does they just dont say so youre right she scooted her chair closer to his so that her dark sweep of hair brushed his cheek you know when they have that stuff on like a current affair or unsolved mysteries those shows about like psychos and hatchet killers i just think its so interesting i mean how come they do all that stuff to people and why theyre so hard to catch i guess were all a little nervous about having somebody like that roaming around town but its exciting too you know teddy lifted his beer in salute thats what sells supermarket tabloids inquiring minds right she chuckled and tapped her bottle against his ive got a real inquiring mind you know teddy ive never seen a dead body i mean before its all prettied up and in a casket in church he saw the question in her eyes and frowned now josie you dont need to see that her bare foot continued to caress his calf i guess it sounds kind of morbid and awful but i think it might be kind of educational teddy knew it was a mistake but it was hard to resist josie longstreet when her mind was set the fact that they were both half drunk and giggly didnt help after three wavering tries he stuck the key hed been given into the lock in palmers rear door this the delivery entrance josie said covering her mouth to hold in the shaky chuckle teddy reached back into childhood palmers funeral parlor you kill em we chill em josie laughed so hard she had to cross her legs together they stumbled through the doorway gosh its dark let me get the light no her heart was thudding to show him she took his hand and pressed it to her breast that would spoil the mood teddy leaned her back against the door and enjoyed a long sloppy kiss pressing himself against her he worked his hands under her blouse her breasts spilled over the flimsy half cups that supported them and filled his palms her nipples were long and hard as stone jesus his breath was coming in pants youve got terrific muscle tone he replaced his hands with his mouth and started to struggle with her shorts hold on honey i swear youre as horny as a twopeckered goat she laughed and nudged him away let me find a flashlight thrusting her hand in her purse she rooted until she came up with a pensized flash she ran it over the walls making shadows shake she felt giddy with fear and excitement as if shed been watching the horror flick showing at the sky view which way to humor her teddy danced his fingers up her arm until she shivered walk this way he invited her and set off in a shambling gait that made her giggle again youre such a card teddy but she kept close to his back smells like dead roses and lord knows thats the ghostly scent of departed souls my dear no use telling her it was embalming fluid formaldehyde and mr clean he moved to another door and using her light found the next key youre sure she swallowed nodded teddy pushed open the door wishing the palmers were less fastidious a nice moaning creak would have been perfect josie took a deep breath and hit the lights shit she rubbed damp palms on her thighs it looks sort of like a dentists office what do you use those hoses for he smiled wiggled his eyebrows do you really want to know she moistened her lips maybe not is that she gestured toward the form under the white sheet is that her the one and only josie felt her insides tremble i want to see okay but its look and dont touch teddy walked over and eased down the sheet josies mind spun once twice then settled jesus she whispered jesus shes gray havent had time to fix her makeup pressing a hand to her stomach josie took another step her throat cause of death he rubbed a palm on josies applefirm bottom the knife had a six maybe seveninch blade now look here he eased one of edda lous arms from under the sheet see the way this area of the wrist is discolored the flaking skin she was tied with a common clothesline wow she also bit her nails he tuttutted and covered the hand again this contusion at the base of the skull he turned the head it shows that she was struck before death certainly hard enough to render her unconscious during which time we would conclude she was bound and gagged there were fiber traces in her mouth and on her tongue that indicate the use of a red cotton cloth you can tell all that josie found herself hanging on every word all that and more was she you know raped im running tests on that if were lucky enough to find a trace of sperm we can run a dna uhhuh shed heard the term somewhere whoever did it killed her and the baby the lady died alone teddy corrected her hormone levels were flat low pardon no buns in her oven oh yeah josie looked down at the gray lifeless face and her mouth pursed in thought i told him she was lying told who she shook off the thought this was no time to bring up tuckers name instead she looked away from edda lou and around the room the thing was once you got settled inside it was fascinating all those bottles and tubes and slim shiny instruments she strolled over to pick up a scalpel and in testing the blade sliced the pad of her thumb shit baby you shouldnt touch those things all solicitude teddy whipped out a handkerchief and dabbed at the thin line of blood over his head josie stared at the face on the embalming table beer made her head woozy i didnt know it was so sharp sharp enough to slice little pieces off you he clucked and dabbed until she smiled he really was the cutest thing itll stop quicker if you suck on it she brought her wounded thumb to his mouth eased it between his lips while his tongue laved the wound she let her eyes close there was a powerful intimacy knowing he was tasting her blood when her eyes opened again they were heavy with lust ive got something for you teddy as he drew her thumb deep into his mouth she reached over the tray of keenedged instruments her hand wavering then finding the purse shed dropped there while his hand slid up her thigh hers dug into the bag it convulsed into a fist as his fingers slid under the hem of her shorts nipped under the elastic of her panties and found her here you go with a little sigh she pulled out a condom her eyes were gold and hot as she yanked down his zipper why dont i put this on for you teddy shuddered as his pants fell to his ankles be my guest when josie shot down the drive to sweetwater about two am feeling used up and sated from sex billy t bonny was crouching behind the front fender of the red porsche he swore as the headlights sliced the dark a few inches from his head ten more minutes and hed have been finished and gone his heartbeat roared as josie hit the brakes gravel spat out and bounced on the toes of his work boots his greasesmeared fingers tightened around the handle of his wrench as she climbed out of her car he held himself in a tight ball and watched her feet they were bare carminetipped and she wore a thin gold chain around her ankle he felt a quick rush of sexual interest her scent was on the air darkly sweet mixed with the deeper tones of recent sex she was humming patsy clines crazy she dropped her purse scattering lipsticks loose change a small department stores worth of cosmetics two mirrors a handful of foilwrapped condoms a bottle of aspirin a neat little pearlhandled derringer and three boxes of tic tacs billy t bit back an oath as she bent to retrieve her belongings from the underbelly of the porsche billy watched the long line of her legs fold up as she crouched saw her hand scramble around dumping the contents back into the bag along with a fair share of gravel hell with it she muttered yawning hugely she got to her feet and started toward the house billy t waited a full thirty seconds after the door shut before he went back to work chapter nine on sunday mornings most of innocence gathered in one of its three churches the church of redemption was for the methodists and made up a large part of the religious pie it was a small gray box smack in the center of town it had been built in on the site of the original first methodist church which had washed away along with reverend scottsdale and the church secretary hed been breaking several commandments with in flood waters in on the south end of town was innocence bible church where the blacks went to worship there was no law of god or man that segregated the churches but tradition was often stronger than law every blessed sunday the sound of rich voices raised in song flowed through the open windows with a clarity the methodists couldnt compete with across from redemption and down a block was trinity lutheran it was famous for its bake sales delia duncan being in charge of such matters was given to bragging that trinity had raised enough money selling brownies and custard pies to buy a stained glass window that had inspired happy fuller to organize three catfish suppers for redemption so that they could buy a bigger window those down at the bible were content with their clear glass and clear voices sundays were a time for prayer contemplation and fierce competition in innocence from three pulpits the word of god rang out and sin was put in its place in hard wooden pews old men and children nodded off in the heat and women wielded their fans organs blared and babies wailed hardearned money was dropped into the passing plates sweat rolled in all three holy places preachers bowed their heads and reminded the congregation of edda lou hatinger prayers were requested for mavis hatinger her husband in none of the churches was austin referred to by name and her remaining children in the back pew of redemption pale with grief and confusion mavis wept silent tears three of her five children were with her vernon whod inherited his fathers sullen looks and mean temper sat beside his wife loretta she hushed their toddler as best she could with a wellused pacifier and practiced knee bounces her cotton dress stretched tight across her pregnant belly ruthanne sat beside her dryeyed and silent she was eighteen and ten days out of jefferson davis high school she was sorry her sister had died though she hadnt loved edda lou sitting in the stifling church all she could think of was how quickly she could make enough money to get out of innocence bored and wishing he were anywhere else was young cy his feet were cramped inside the hard black shoes that were already a size too small and his neck was chafed from the starch his mother had sprayed into his collar his family was an embarrassment to him but at fourteen he was stuck with them he hated the fact that the preacher was talking about them like they were to be pitied and prayed for too many of his peers were scattered through the congregation and his face flamed every time one of them shot a look over a shoulder it was a great relief to cy when the service ended and they could stand up as sachetscented ladies made their way to his mother to express sympathy he ducked out the back of the pew and hurried off to have a smoke behind larssons it all sucked as far as cy could see his sister was dead his father and his brother were in jail his mama didnt do much more than wring her hands and talk to the legal aid guy in greenville all vernon could talk about was paying somebody back loretta agreed with every word shed learned to agree fast and avoid a fist in the eye a real quick study that loretta cy lighted one of the three pall malls hed swiped from vernon and tugged at his tie ruthanne had more sense than the rest cy decided but she was always busy counting her money just like silas marner and his coins cy knew she hid her cache in a box of sanitary napkins a place her father would never look because cy had a sense of loyalty and hed be just as happy to see her go he kept ruthannes secret to himself hed already figured that the minute he had his high school diploma hed be lighting out himself there would be no chance of college for him as cy had a keen and thirsty mind that hurt more than a little but he was also a pragmatic sort and accepted what was though hed yet to find real pleasure in smoking he took another drag hey jim march sidled around the building he was a tall boy gangly with skin the color of molasses like cy jim was in his sunday best whatcha doing in the way of old friends he dropped down beside cy just having a smoke you nothing comfortable with each other they lapsed into silence sure am glad schools out jim said at length yeah cy wasnt about to embarrass himself by admitting he liked school got the whole summer for cy it stretched out interminably going to get you a job cy moved his shoulders aint no work jim carefully folded his bright red tie and put it in his pocket my daddys doing some work for that miz waverly jim didnt consider it politic to mention that his father had replaced the windows cys father had blown out going to paint her whole house im helping guess youll be a rich man shit jim grinned and began to draw patterns in the dirt get me some pocket money though got two dollars right now thats two moren i got lips pursed jim slanted a look at his friend they werent supposed to be friends not according to cys old man but theyd managed to remain so on the sly i heard tell the longstreets are hiring on for field work cy hooted and passed the pall mall to jim to finish off my daddyd skin me alive if i went near sweetwater guess so but his daddy was in jail cy remembered if he could get work he could start his own secret fund just like ruthanne you sure theyre hiring what i heard miss delias down at the church bake sale you could ask her he smiled at cy theyve got lemon pies down there might get one for two dollars sure would be nice to take some lemon pie down to gooseneck creek and catch some cats sure would cy cast a look at his friend his grin was slow and surprisingly lovely i really oughta help you eat it or else youll just pig it down and puke it up while the boys were negotiating for pie and women were showing off their sunday dresses tucker was spread over his bed luxuriating in a half doze he loved sundays the house was quiet as a tomb with delia off to town and everyone else asleep or sprawled somewhere with the sunday paper in his mothers day it had been different then the whole house had marched off to church spit and polish to take their place in the front pew his mother would smell of lavender and be wearing her grandmothers pearls after service there would be a varied critique of the sermon talk of weather and crops new babies would be admired and clucked over grown children come back to visit would be shown off by proud parents and the young would take the opportunity to sashay and flirt afterward they would sit down to sunday dinner glazed ham sweet potatoes fresh biscuits green beans swimming in pot liquor and maybe some pecan pie and flowers there would always be flowers on the table his mother had seen to that out of respect for her tuckers father never touched a bottle on sunday not from sunup to sundown as a result those long afternoons took on a pleasant dreamy quality in retrospect an illusion perhaps but a comforting one part of tucker missed those days but there was something to be said for snoozing in a quiet house with the chatter of birds piping outside the hum of the fan stirring air and the happy notion that there was no place to go and nothing to do he heard a car engine and rolled over in bed the movement revived a few aches he grunted waiting for the discomfort and the disturbance to pass the knock on the front door had tucker opening one eye sunlight speared it causing him to hiss through his teeth he considered playing possum waiting for josie or dwayne to handle things but josies room was on the other side of the house and dwayne was probably just as comatose as hed been last night when tucker hauled him in from the lake shit go the hell away he had snuggled into the pillow and was willing himself back to sleep when the knocking stopped before he could congratulate himself burkes voice rose from beneath his window tucker get your butt up i gotta talk to you dammit tuck its important always goddamn important tucker muttered as he pushed himself out of bed all of his aches and pains began to awaken naked and irritable he pushed open the terrace doors jesus burke tossed his cigarette aside and took a long slow scan of tuckers body it was a palette of black blue and sickly yellow he really worked you over didnt he son did you come all the way out here and wake me up just to make that stunning observation you come on out and ill tell you why im here and put some clothes on before i haul you in for indecent exposure up yours sheriff tucker stumbled back into the bedroom looked at his tangled sheets with some regret then grabbed some cotton drawstring pants and his sunglasses that was as close to dressed as he intended to get since he wasnt feeling kindly toward burke he took a detour into the bathroom to empty his bladder and brush his teeth havent even had a cup of goddamn coffee he grumbled when he walked out onto the porch burke was sitting on one of the rockers from the shine on his shoes and the crispness of his shirt it was obvious hed come straight from service sorry to get you up so early cant be more than a minute past noon give me a cigarette you bastard burke obliged waited until tucker had finished his little routine you really think making them shorters going to help you quit eventually tucker pulled in smoke winced as it burned then blew it out he drew again felt marginally better and sat so burke what brings you calling burke frowned at the peonies tucker had tried to salvage talked to that dr rubenstein a while ago he was having breakfast at the chat n chew waved me inside hmmm that had tucker giving some thought to breakfast himself maybe he could sweettalk delia into fixing up some hotcakes he wanted to fill me in on a couple things mostly because he knows itll yank burnss chain hes strictly bythebook burns i mean damn near taking over my office cant say i care for it youve got my sympathy can i go back to bed now tucker its about edda lou burke fiddled with his sheriffs badge he knew it wasnt purely professional for him to pass any information along to tucker especially since the fbi still considered him a suspect but some loyalties ran deeper than the law there wasnt a baby tuck huh burke sighed she wasnt pregnant came out during the autopsy there was no baby i thought you had a right to know a rushing sound filled tuckers head as he stared down at the tip of the cigarette when he spoke his voice was slow and deliberate she wasnt pregnant no for certain rubenstein knows what hes doing and he says she wasnt with his eyes closed tucker sat back and rocked he realized a large portion of his guilt and grief had been due to the child but there wasnt a child had never been a child and grief easily transformed into rage she lied to me id have to say thats true she stood there in front of all those people and lied about something like that feeling useless burke rose i thought you should know it didnt seem right for you to think well i thought you should know thanks didnt seem quite appropriate so tucker only nodded keeping his eyes closed until he heard the cruiser start listened to it purr down the long winding drive his hands clenched at his sides there was a black bubbling rage in him geysering up from the pit of his stomach until he tasted the vileness of it in his throat he recognized the signs and at another time they might have frightened him he wanted to hurt something smash it pull it apart and grind it to dust his eyes were wild when he opened them in a headlong rush he was racing into the house up the steps in his room he grabbed for his keys and gave himself the satisfaction of smashing a lamp he snatched a shirt from the arm of a chair and shoved his arms through as he stalked out again tuck heavyeyed and wrapped in a red silk robe josie started down the hallway tuck i have something to tell you the one violent glance he sent her before he flung himself down the stairs cleared the sleep from her brain she streaked after him calling tuck wait she caught up with him as he was yanking open the door of his car tucker whats wrong he shook her off fighting to hold the animal inside him on a choke chain stay away from me honey i just want to help were family she made a grab for the keys then gasped when his hand clamped tightly around her wrist get the hell away a film of tears coated her eyes if youll just let me talk to you tucker tucker i went out with the doctor last night the fbi doctor she raised her voice to a shout as the porsche gunned to life edda lou wasnt pregnant there wasnt a baby tuck it was a trap just like i told you his head whipped around his gaze speared into hers i know he sent gravel flying as he tore up the drive josie hissed and grabbed her calf where one of the stones struck furious she snatched up a handful and flung them after the car jesus h christ whats all this racket josie turned to see dwayne on the porch his hands were over his eyes he squinted out from under them swaying wearing nothing but his jockey shorts its nothing josie said on a sigh as she started back up the steps there didnt seem to be anything she could do for tucker but she could tend to dwayne lets go get us some coffee honey the wheel vibrated under tuckers hand when he whipped it to make the turn toward town he was too furious to give a damn when the rear end fishtailed and the tires sang she wasnt going to get away with it that single thought ran circles in his head she was damn well not going to get away with it teeth clenched he punched the accelerator and jumped up to eighty even with the curves and twists the road took he could see for miles the heat waves shimmied up from the patched road and turned distance into a watery mirage he didnt know where he was going or what he was going to do but it would be done now right now he closed a hand over the gearshift preparing to downshift for the curve just before the mcnair place but when he tugged the wheel the car stayed arrow straight he had time to swear to wrestle the wheel and to tramp on what turned out to be nearly useless brakes with one of her grandmothers widebrimmed hats shading her face caroline attacked the overgrowth beside her lane despite the heat and her aching arms she was having the time of her life the clippers were sharp as a razor and their wooden handles were worn smooth by time and use the short gardening gloves she wore protected her hands from blisters she imagined her grandmother wearing them to perform this same homey chore she knew she could have waited and assigned the task to toby but she was enjoying it the sun the dusty heat the verdant smell of green she was enjoying the simple accomplishment of caring for her own all around her was a chorus of birds the hum of the afternoon the heaviness of solitude it was precisely what she wanted and after taking a moment to rub her aching shoulder she sheared off a vine as thick as her thumb she heard the roar of a car engine before she shaded her eyes and looked down toward the slice of road she could see at the end of her lane she knew it was tucker the car was coming so fast and she recognized the powerful purr of his engine one of these days she thought as she put a hand on her hip he was going to turn that car into a tinker toy and put himself in the hospital and if he was heading her way she would tell him so why the man was her thoughts spun off as she heard the high squeal of rubber on pavement she heard the shout and though it contained more fury than fear she was already running before she heard the crash of glass and rending of metal the clippers went flying out of her hands above the roaring of her heart all she could hear was the bouncy strains of the young carl perkins warning everybody off his blue suede shoes oh my god she saw the ruts torn into the grassy shoulder an instant before she spotted the porsche sitting drunkenly against the post that had held her mailbox shattered glass winked like diamonds over the surface of the road she saw tucker slumped over the wheel and screaming his name ran to the car oh god my god tucker terrified to move him terrified to leave him she touched gentle hands to his face she squeaked out a fresh scream when he jerked his head back fuck she inhaled in three shaky gasps you idiot i thought you were dead you should be dead the way you drive a grown man tearing down the road like some hypedup irresponsible teenager i dont see how you can shut up caro he put a hand to his pounding forehead and discovered he was bleeding what else was new when he fumbled for the door handle she jerked it open herself if you werent hurt id punch you but she leaned over to help him to his feet im in the mood to punch back his vision grayed infuriating him and he leaned on the undamaged rear fender turn the radio off will you get the keys she was still muttering to herself when she ripped them out of the ignition you killed my mailbox i suppose we should be thankful it wasnt another car ill make sure you have a new one tomorrow its so easy for you to replace things isnt it fear sharpened her voice as she put an arm around his waist and took his weight most things his fucking head was going to fall off he thought that might not be so easy to replace she was still ripping into him as she guided him down the lane toward the house the sharp stab of gravel reminded him hed neglected to stop for shoes he felt a trickle of blood skim down his temple back off caroline there was something in his voice not the anger but the misery that made her subside lean on me a little more she murmured im stronger than i look you look like something a good breeze would blow away the house wavered in his vision and he was afraid he might faint he squinted which hurt his bruised eye enough to clear the dizziness youve got this fragile look about you never appealed to me before im sure im supposed to be flattered but youre not fragile youre a tough one caro and youre pissed at me just hold off yelling for a little while why should i yell she could tell from the hollowness in his voice that he was close to passing out keep him angry keep the adrenaline up she told herself if he went down she wouldnt be able to get him up it certainly wouldnt make a difference to me if you wrecked your car and ended up a smear on the road id prefer you do it somewhere other than next to my lane though do what i can honey i gotta sit down almost to the porch she half dragged him another foot you can sit down there never liked bossy women then im safe when she got him to the porch and he was still upright she pulled him along inside you said i could sit i lied he gave a weak somehow grim laugh women always do now you can she eased him down on the couch with the bullet hole through the cushion after heaving his legs up she propped a pillow under his head im going to call doc shays then ill clean you up he made a grab for her hand and missed but the movement stopped her dont call him its just a bump and ive got plenty more you could be concussed i could be a lot of things all hell do is give me a shot of something i really hate needles you know because she did know and sympathized she wavered the bump didnt seem so bad and he was certainly lucid ill clean you up then well see fine how about a bucket of ice with a beer in it ice yes beer no just lie still woman never will get me a beer tucker said under his breath im lying here bleeding to death and all she does is bitch and nag i heard that caroline called from the kitchen they always do on a sigh tucker let his eyes close he didnt open them again until caroline pressed a cold cloth to the cut on his forehead how come youre wearing that ugly hat its not ugly she felt a trickle of relief as she studied the wound and found it shallow honey you may be wearing it but im looking at it and im telling you its ugly fine annoyed she tossed it off then took a bottle of iodine from the coffee table where shed set her medical supplies tucker sent the bottle a baleful glance dont do that baby smiling he took her wrist i think youre real cute too sugar that wasnt an endearment she merely switched the bottle to her other hand and dabbed on the iodine he yelped and swore oh get a grip tucker least you can do is blow on it she did his hand snuck from her wrist to her thigh caroline gave the cut one last blow then slapped his hand aside jesus have some respect for the injured just be still while i bandage this she snipped some gauze and tape and if your hand starts wandering again ill give you a lump twice as big as this one yes maam her hands were gentle and except for the sledgehammer pounding his brain he was feeling considerably better are you hurt anywhere else her hands felt soft and cool as raindrops cant say why dont you check she ignored the smirk in his voice and unbuttoned his shirt i certainly hope this teaches you oh god tucker his eyes jerked open what what youre all black and blue he took a moment to be grateful she hadnt found a rib sticking out thosere old austin why thats hideous horror stung her voice and turned her eyes green as emeralds he should be locked up he had to smile he is locked up darlin right and tight in the county jail carl transported him yesterday caroline laid gentle fingers on his bruised ribs he really hurt you pride nettled he didnt walk away smiling of course that makes it all right caroline jerked her hands away and popped open a bottle of painkiller dr palamo had prescribed for her stress headaches men are all idiots carefully tucker propped himself on his elbows i didnt start it he came after me just shut up and take one of these what am i taking something that wont laugh at that headache i imagine youve got he took the pill grateful but also scanned the label of the bottle if it did the job hed have to ask doc shays to get him some for the rest of his pains tucker swallowed it with a sip of the water she offered can i have that beer if im able to stand up no he laid his head back against the cushion just as well darlin do me a favor and call junior talbot hes going to have to come on down and tow my car ill take care of it she rose then shot him a warning look dont go to sleep youre not supposed to sleep if you have a concussion why not frustration added an edge to her voice i dont know why not im not a doctor its just something you hear all the time i wont go to sleep if you promise to come right back and hold my hand caroline lifted a brow if you go to sleep im calling doc shays and telling him to bring his longest needle christ youre a mean one but his lips curved as she walked out she gave him less than three minutes to consider drifting off before she returned with an ice pack junior said hed be out as soon as he could get away when he only grunted she laid the ice pack on his head and the grunt turned into a long ah of gratitude i didnt know whether i should call your family not yet dellall be in town awhile longer i forgot she was running a bake sale today josies not likely to go anywhere especially if dwayne wakes up with his usual sunday head lord he was tired not the pleasant sleepy tired of a lazy afternoon but tired clean to the bone anyway wrecking cars is kind of a hobby in my family she frowned at him since his color was coming back she felt she had a right to demand an explanation then the lot of you should take up croquet or needlepoint where the hell were you going in such a hurry i dont know anywhere anywheres a stupid place to go barefoot at a hundred miles an hour more like eighty you tend to exaggerate you could have killed yourself since i felt like killing somebody else it was a better bet he opened his eyes and though she could see the pain had misted away dr palamos magic worked quickly there was something else something deeper and more poignant did something happen there wasnt a baby he heard himself say excuse me she wasnt pregnant she lied to me she stood there looked me right in the eye and told me she had my baby inside her and it was a lie it took caroline a moment to realize he was talking about edda lou the edda lou she had found floating in the pond im sorry she folded her hands in her lap unsure what to say or how to say it he didnt know why he was telling her but once started he couldnt stem the words these last few days its been eating at me thinking about her dying that way she meant something to me once almost meant something to me thinking about that and thinking that a part of me died with her was but there wasnt any part of me in edda lou except for a lie maybe she made a mistake she might have thought she was pregnant he gave a short laugh i hadnt slept with her in nearly two months a woman like edda lou keeps close track of that kind of female business she knew he closed his eyes briefly and when they opened again a trace of the wild rage glowed in them why am i so mad that there wasnt a baby she lied so that means no baby died and i dont have to hurt thinking about it anymore caroline did hold his hand even brought it up to her cheek for a moment in comfort she hadnt realized he had feelings that traveled that deep and difficult a road the part of her that softened for him would never be able to harden again sometimes we hurt more for what might have been than for what is he turned his palm so that their fingers linked she had the loveliest and the saddest eyes hed ever seen you sound like you know what im talking about she smiled and didnt object when he kissed her knuckles i do always cautious she drew her hand free before it lingered too long in his why dont i go out and see if juniors made it yet he didnt want to break the contact yet not quite yet with an effort he pushed himself up why dont we both go the room revolved once slowly then settled if youll give me a hand she looked down at his outstretched hand it was foolish she supposed to think he was asking for more than momentary support shaking off the feeling she reached out and joined her hand with his chapter ten junior talbot stepped out of the cab of his tow truck stuck a finger under his atlanta braves fielders cap and dug through his tangled mop of red hair to scratch his head he made a long slow circle around tuckers mangled porsche his j c penney work boots crunching on shards of glass his pale blue eyes were sober in his round powerfully freckled face thoughtfully he pulled at his full bottom lip caroline thought he looked like howdy doody on tranquilizers seems like you got yourself some trouble here he said at length little bit tucker agreed got a smoke junior guess so junior pulled a pack of winstons from the breast pocket of his greasestained work shirt he shook the pack shooting a cigarette out to the filter carefully replacing the pack after tucker had taken it then he crouched down to contemplate the mashed fender there was another long moment of silence sure used to be a pretty car tucker knew junior wasnt rubbing his nose in it it was simply his nature to state the obvious leaning over tucker opened the glove compartment and found a pack of matches i spose they can fix her up down in jackson junior thought about that awhile i spose he decided could be you bent the frame though they got a way of straightening them out now used to be you bent the frame and that was all she wrote tucker smiled through a haze of smoke you just cant stop progress thats the truth taking his time junior straightened then studied the torn grass on the verge of the road the shower of glass and the lack of skid marks after some consideration he decided to have a cigarette himself you know tucker i always said you were the best driver ive seen outside of the time i went down to daytona to watch the caroline gave a snort and was politely ignored i recall how you took the bonny boys for twenty dollars in the drag race down on highway one back in july of seventysix it was they put their camaro up against your mustang junior accepted a match from tucker and lit it with a flick of his thumbnail wasnt no contest tucker remembered the race with pleasure mightve been closer if billy t had let john thomas drive junior nodded agreeably closer maybe but neither of those boys got the talent for driving you have idiots caroline said under her breath if junior heard her he pretended not to hed been a married man more than a year now and knew when a man should let his ears work and when he shouldnt i gotta ask you junior continued in the same slow quiet voice howd you happen to hit this pole here well tucker took a considering drag you could say the car got away from me steering seized up junior nodded and continued to smoke caroline nearly asked them if theyd like her to go back and fetch a couple of folding chairs so they could have their conversation in comfort dont look to me like you even hit the brakes i hit them tucker said they were out junior eyes came as close to sharp as they ever did if it had been anyone else he would have shrugged off the story but he knew and admired tuckers skill at the wheel now thats a puzzle bad steering bad brakes all at once in a car like this no more than six months old is she just junior nodded again well have to take a look id be obliged if you would junior caroline held her tongue until junior walked back to his tow truck what the hell does a drag race more than fifteen years ago have to do with you crashing into my mail post tucker smiled it was a hell of a night get on back from the car now darlin it might shift some when he hooks it on careful to keep her sympathy close to the surface tucker slid an arm around her shoulders leaned a little of his weight on her and allowed her to help him move back a few feet are you dizzy he wasnt but there was such sweet concern in her voice maybe a little he said bravely he thought itll pass he bit back a smile when her arm curved around his waist in support lets get you back in the car shed insisted on driving him to the end of the lane rather than allowing him to walk ill take you home home hell he was just starting to make progress maybe i could just stretch out on your couch till i get my strength back she was wavering he could tell when he heard the blare of a horn he had to swallow an oath dwayne screeched his white caddy to a stop dead in the middle of the road he hadnt shaved yet and his hair was sticking out at all angles he had pulled a pair of pants over his jockeys and had added a muscle shirt jesus h christ boy he glanced at tucker saw he was standing on both feet and gave his attention to the car junior was hooking up out for a sunday drive dwayne crystal called dwayne whistled through his teeth as he took a look at the front end of the porsche seems singleton fuller was in the mobile when junior got the call he ran into jed larsson then crystal stopped in for a sixpack of cokes good thing i answered the phone before josie or shedve had a hissy fit for sure his hangover thanks to josies stock of pills and remedies had backed off enough to make him sympathetic shit on toast tuck you sure did kill that pretty little toy out of patience caroline sucked in a breath hes doing as well as can be expected she shot out it could have been worse but as it happens he only rapped his concrete head its understandable that youre so concerned about your brothers condition but let me reassure you hell be fine junior had stopped what he was doing to stare the cigarette dangling from the corner of his mouth dwayne blinked tucker struggled not to lose his dignity by hooting with laughter she was crazy about him he decided yes maam dwayne said meticulously polite i can see he is i just rode down so i could take him home what a concerned closeknit family you must be we do tend to stick together when he smiled there was something charming about him despite the bloodshot eyes the barroom glow ive never known another family like yours caroline said sincerely shes all set tuck junior called ill let you know whats what you do that thanks tucker had to turn away he just couldnt watch his car being towed off it was almost as bad as watching a loved one being carried away on a stretcher nice to see you again caroline dwayne began then headed to his car lets go tucker there was a game starting when crystal called ive missed the whole first inning by now in a minute tucker turned back to caroline i appreciate the nursing he touched a hand to her hair and the listening i didnt realize i needed someone to listen it took her a moment to understand he was being sincere there were no teasing lights in his eyes no trace of mockery in his voice youre welcome id like to pay you back when she started to shake her head tucker cupped her chin id like you to come to dinner tonight at sweetwater really tucker you dont have to it occurs to me that id like you to see me under some better circumstances than ive managed so far his thumb traced along her jawline and id just like to see you period her heartbeat skittered for a moment but her voice was clear im not interested in starting anything not with anyone having neighbors in for sunday dinners an old country custom she had to smile i dont mind being neighborly shit tuck would you just kiss her and come on smiling back tucker brushed a finger over her lips she wont let me yet come on down around five caro ill show you around sweetwater all right she watched him walk to the caddy ease in carefully beside his brother he flashed her a quick grin before dwayne shot toward sweetwater the caddy hugging dead center of the road here i come rushing home from the bake sale thinking youve cracked your skull or worse and you tell me companys coming delia whacked her rolling pin down on the pie crust now i dont even know how much we took in had to leave susie truesdale in charge and she dont know squat about salesmanship as this particular refrain had been playing for the best part of three hours tucker decided to act he pulled a twenty out of his pocket and slapped it on the counter there thats my contribution to the trinity lutheran bake sale hmph but delias nimble fingers snatched up the bill and tucked it away in the deep pocket of her apron she was far from through nearly had me a spell when earleen came running down to tell me youd gone and wrecked that car told you when you bought it no good comes of buying foreign out racing the roads on the lords day too she flipped the crust into a pie plate and when i come hurrying home to see if youre dead or alive you tell me youve invited a guest for dinner fuming she trimmed and fluted the edges as if that ham in the oven was going to fix itself ediths grandbaby too i had a great fondness for edith and she told me how her grandbabyd been to paris france and italy walked right into buckingham palace and even had dinner with the president of the united states in the white house she pounded out the next crust here shes coming to dinner and i aint had time to see if the silver needs polishing your mamad turn over in her grave god rest her if i werent to use the good silver she wiped the back of her wrist over her brow her heavy charm bracelet danced and jangled its just like a man to think sunday dinner makes itself tucker scowled down at the potato he was peeling im helping you arent i she gave a superior sniff and glanced at him fine help you are youre taking too much meat off them taters and getting peelings all over my clean floor jesus christ delias eyes flashed with the cold ire tucker respected dont you use the lords name in vain not in my kitchen on sunday ill clean up the floor delia see that you do and not with one of my good dishrags neither no maam it was time to pull out the big guns tucker decided he set the bowl of potatoes in the sink then moved over to wrap his arms around delias considerable waist i just wanted to do something nice for caroline after shed patched up my head delia grunted ive see what she looks like i can guess what that something nice is he grinned into her wild red curls cant say the thought hasnt passed through my mind passed under your zipper more like but her lips were quirking seems a bit skinny for your taste well see i figured shed flesh out some especially after sampling your cooking you know theres nobody in the county who can set a table compared to yours i kind of thought id like to impress her and the surefire way was to have her taste some of your honeyglazed ham delia snorted and shifted but the flush of pride was creeping up her cheeks i guess i dont begrudge giving the girl a decent meal decent he gave delia a squeeze sugar she wont have had better in the white house you can take that to the bank delia chuckled and slapped his hands away she wont get nothing if i dont finish you drop them taters in that kale i got simmering then clear out i can do this quicker without you sniffing round yesm tucker pressed a kiss to her cheek that made her grumble and grin when he walked out of the steamy kitchen a few minutes later he found dwayne sprawled in the parlor watching another baseball game wouldnt hurt you to shave dwayne shifted and reached for the bottle of coke sitting on the floor its sunday i never shave on sunday weve got company coming dwayne took a long swallow and swore when the shortstop bobbled the ball if i shave she might see that im better looking than you then whered you be ill risk it dwayne snorted theyre going to be pulling this pitcher before the innings up if they got half a brain ill do it then satisfied tucker started upstairs before he reached his room josie called to him tucker is that you honey im going to take a shower well just come on back here for a minute and help me out he checked the grandfather clock saw he had a half hour before caroline would arrive and sauntered down the hall to josies room it looked like a department store after a clearance sale blouses dresses lingerie shoes were tossed over bed chair and window seat a black lace teddy hung suggestively from the trunk of a stuffed pink elephant some forgotten swain had won for her at the state fair she was still wearing the little red robe and her head was stuck in her closet as she pawed through what was left hanging there as always there was a scent clinging to the air a mixture of perfumes powders and lotions the result was something between the perfume counter at blooming dales and a highclass bordello tucker gave the room a brief survey and came to the obvious conclusion got a date teddys driving me down to the nine oclock show in greenville i told him to come on to dinner since were having company anyway hows this she turned holding a short orange leather skirt up to her waist too hot for leather josie pouted a minute because she knew the skirt showed off her legs then tossed it aside youre right i know what i need that little cotton dress the pink one i wore it at a garden party last month in jackson and got a marriage proposal and three indecent propositions now where the hell is it tucker watched as she started tossing through clothes already discarded i thought you were trying out the doctor for crystal i did she glanced up and grinned thing is i decided he wasnt crystals type at all and hell be going back north in a day or two and that would just break her heart she couldnt afford to visit him if things got serious between them and i can does your head still hurt not much look here she pointed to a small bruise on her calf you went tearing out of here so fast before you kicked up gravel now ill have to put erase on that if i want to wear a skirt sorry she shrugged and went back to looking for the pink dress i guess its okay you were upset everybodys going to know she was lying tucker even before they bury her on tuesday everybodyll know i expect so he spotted a swatch of shell pink and crouched down to pull the dress out from under the pile ive calmed down josie hearing it from burke just fired me up she touched the bandage on his forehead and they stood close in a drift of josies perfume they shared more than their mothers face more than the longstreet name between them was a tie deeper than blood it went to the heart im sorry she hurt you tucker poked a few holes in my pride thats all he kissed josie lightly on the lips theyll heal up fast enough youre just too nice to women tucker it makes them fall in love with you then youve got nothing but trouble if you were a little harder on them you wouldnt get their expectations up ill keep that in mind next time i take a woman out ill tell her shes ugly josie laughed and stood up to hold the dress in front of her as she twisted and turned in front of her cheval glass dont go reciting any poetry either who says i do carolanne told me you talked poetry when you took her over to lake village to look at stars tucker shoved his hands in his pockets how come women always tell the intimate details of their life over a manicure or a permanent its the same as men bragging about the size of their wangers over a bottle of beer hows this look he scowled im finished handing out compliments to females josie only chuckled as he strode off to shower caroline was so stunned by sweetwater that she stopped her car halfway up the drive to stare the house was pearly white in the afternoon sun all gracious curves and delicate ironwork slender columns and glinting windows it took no imagination at all to picture women in hoop skirts strolling across the grass or gentlemen in frock coats sitting on the porch discussing the possibility of secession while silent black servants served cool drinks flowers grew everywhere climbing up trellises spilling over the borders of brickedged beds the heady smells of gardenia magnolia and roses perfumed the air a confederate flag faded and ragged at the edges hung from a white pole in the center of the front lawn beyond the house she could see neat stone buildings what once were slave quarters smokehouse summer kitchen she could guess that much the lawn stretched back to acre after acre of flat fertile land thick with cotton she saw a single tree in the center of one of the fields a huge old cypress left standing either through laziness or sentiment for some reason that just that single tree brought tears to her throat the simple majesty of it the endurance it symbolized touched her in some deep corner of her heart surely it had stood there for more than a century watching over the rise and fall of the south the struggle for a way of life and the ultimate end of it how many spring plantings had it seen how many summer harvests she shifted her gaze back to the house it too symbolized continuity and change and the stately elegance of the old south that so many from the north thought of as indolence babies had been born there grown up and died there and the rhythm of this quiet spot on the delta went on and on i he slow pulse or their culture and traditions survived the proof was here just as it was in her grandmothers house in those houses and farms and fields dotting the road into innocence and in innocence itself she wondered why she was just beginning to understand that when she saw tucker come out the front doorway to stand on the porch she wondered if she was beginning to understand him as well she got the car moving again eased it around the island of peonies and stopped the way you were sitting back there on the drive i was beginning to think youd changed your mind no she opened the car door and stepped out i was just looking he was doing some looking of his own and decided not to speak until the fingers squeezing his heart loosened up she was wearing a thin white dress with a full skirt he imagined would billow gloriously in a breeze two fingerwidth straps held it over her shoulders and left her arms bare there was a necklace of polished stones around her throat her hair was sleeked back to set off matching stones that dangled from her ears shed done something mysterious and female to her face deepening her eyes darkening her mouth as she mounted the steps toward him he caught the first whiff of her light tempting scent he took her right hand in his left and turned her slowly in a circle under the arch of his arm as if in a dance it made her laugh when he saw how low the dress dipped in the back he swallowed hard ive got to tell you something caroline all right youre ugly he shook his head before she could comment thats just something i had to get out of my system its an interesting approach my sisters idea its supposed to keep women from falling in love with me why did he always make her want to smile it could work are you going to ask me in he traded her left hand for her right it seems like ive been waiting a long time to do just that he led her to the door opened it pausing he studied her wanting to see how she looked in the doorway his doorway with flowers and magnolia trees at her back she looked he realized perfect welcome to sweetwater the moment she stepped inside caroline heard the shouting if youve gone and asked somebody to come and sit at my table the least you can do is set it delia stood at the base of a curving stairway one hand braced on a mahogany newel post the other on her sturdy hip i said i would didnt i josies voice tumbled down the steps i dont know what youre in such a godawful lather about im going to finish putting my face on then ill get to it way shes messing around with those paints itll get set next week delia turned the righteous indignation on her face gave way to curiosity when she spotted caroline well now youre ediths grandbaby arent you yes i suppose i am edith and i we used to have ourselves some nice chats out on her front porch you favor her a bit round the eyes thank you this is delia tucker announced she takes care of us ive been trying for the best part of thirty years but it aint done all that much good you take her on into the guest parlor and give her some of the good sherry dinnerll be ready before long with a last scowl at the stairway she lifted her voice if somebody would stop tarting herself up and come set the table id be happy to do it caroline began but delia was already pulling her along the hallway toward the living room no sir youll do no such thing tucker peeled the potatoes and that girls going to set out the china least she can do after asking that dead doctor to dinner she patted carolines arm then scurried off toward the kitchen ah dead doctor tucker grinned strolling over to an antique walnut server for the sherry pathologist oh teddy hes certainly an interesting character she took a slow sweep of the room with its tall windows lace curtains turkey carpets the twin settees as she was sure they were called were in misty pastels cool colors predominated in the subtle stripes of the wallpaper the handworked pillows the plump ottoman the richness of antiques melded with it on the mantel above the white marble fireplace was a waterford vase filled with baby roses this is a lovely house she took the glass he offered thank you ill give you the grand tour sometime tell you the whole history id like to hear it she walked to the window where she could look out at the garden and beyond to the fields and the old cypress i didnt realize you farmed were planters he corrected her as he came up behind her longstreets have been planters since the eighteenth century right after beauregard longstreet cheated henry van haven out of six hundred acres of prime delta farmland in a twoday poker game down in natchez in it was in a bawdy house called the red starr caroline turned you made that up no maam thats just the way my daddy told it to me and his daddy to him and so on since that fateful april night in ninetysix course its just speculation about the cheating part the larssons put in that bit theyre by way of being cousins of the van havens spoilsports caroline said smiling could be that or it could be the gods truth but neither changes the outcome he was enjoying the way she looked at him her lips tilted up just a little her eyes laughing anyhow henry got so irritated about losing the land he tried to ambush old beau when beau finished celebrating with one of the starrs best girls her name was millie jones caroline sipped and shook her head you ought to write short stories tuck im just telling you the way it was now millie was pleased with beaus performance did i mention that the longstreets have always been known as exceptional lovers i dont believe you did documented through the ages tucker assured her he loved the way laughter brightened her eyes softened her mouth if he hadnt had a story to tell by god he wouldve made one up and millie being grateful for beaus stamina and the extra fivedollar gold piece hed left on the night stand went on over to the window to wave him off it was she who spotted henry in the bushes with his flintlock loaded and ready at just the right moment millie shouted a warning the gun went off beaus frock coat was singed at the arm but his reflexes were keen he pulled out his knife and sent it whipping into the brush where the shot had come from hit henry dead in the pump as my grandpappy used to say he was of course an expert at knifethrowing as well as lovemaking a man of many talents tucker agreed and being a prudent man as well he decided it best not to stay around natchez and answer uncomfortable questions about a deed a dead man and an arkansas toothpick being a romantic he took pretty young millie out of that bawdy house and they traveled to the delta and planted cotton planted cotton got rich and had babies it was their son who started building this house in caroline said nothing for a moment it was much too easy to become caught up in the flow of his words the easy rhythm of his voice its not really the point how much is true and how much is made up she decided its all in the telling she moved away from the window acutely aware that he was about to touch her again and less sure if shed want to stop him i dont know much of anything about my family history and certainly nothing that goes back two hundred years we look back more than forward in the delta history makes the best gossip and tomorrow well tomorrows going to take care of itself anyway isnt it he thought he heard her sigh but the sound was so soft it might have been silence ive spent my whole life thinking about tomorrow planning next month next season it must be the air here she said and this time she did sigh there was something wistful in the sound ive hardly thought of next week since i walked into my grandmothers house havent wanted to anyway she said remembering the phone calls from her manager that shed been dodging ever since she decided to come to mississippi he had a strong urge to hold her just to offer her the circle of his arms and the support of his shoulder but he was afraid the gesture would spoil whatever was happening between them why are you unhappy caro surprised she looked back at him im not but she knew it was only part of the truth and part of the truth was a lie i listen almost as well as i talk his hand was gentle as he touched her face maybe youll try me sometime maybe but she moved back marking the distance someones coming now he knew the time wasnt right and turned to the window again the dead doctor he said and grinned lets go see if josie set the table chapter eleven in the county jail in greenville with its scarred ringless toilet and graffitilaced walls austin hatinger sat on a boardhard bunk and stared at the bars of sunlight on the floor near his feet he knew why he was in a cell like a common criminal like an animal he knew why he was forced to stare at bars in a cage with filthy sayings painted on the sweaty walls it was because beau longstreet had been rich hed been a godcursing rich planter and had tossed all his tainted money to his bastard children they were bastards sure enough austin thought madeline might have worn that traitors ring on her finger but in the eyes of god she had belonged to only one man beau hadnt gone off to the stinking hole of korea to serve his country and save good christians from the yellow peril but had stayed behind in sin and comfort to make more money austin had long suspected that beau had tricked madeline into marriage not that that excused her betrayal but women were weak weak of body weak of will weak of mind without a strong guiding force and the occasional back of the hand they were prone to foolish behavior and to sin god was his witness that hed done his best to keep mavis on a straight path hed married her in a blindness of despair trapped by his own raging lust the woman thou gavest me she gave me of the tree and i did eat oh yes mavis had tempted him and weak of flesh he had succumbed austin knew that from eve down satan spoke first to women in his smooth seductive voice they being more open to sin they fell and with a wily heart took a man down with them but hed been faithful to her only once in thirtyfive years had he turned to another woman if there were times when exercising his marital rights plunging into mavis he felt tasted smelled madeline in the dark it was only the lords way of reminding him what had belonged to him madeline had pretended to be indifferent to him hed known all those years ago hed known that shed gone with beau only to tease and torment him as women did shed belonged to him only him her shocked denial when hed made his declaration before shipping out to war had only been another pretense if it hadnt been for beau shed have been waiting for him when hed returned that had been the beginning of the end for him hadnt he worked his fingers raw broken his back sweated out his heart trying to make a decent life for the family hed taken and while hed worked and failed sweated and lost ground beau had sat up in his fine white house and laughed and laughed but beau hadnt known despite all his money and his fine clothes and fancy cars hed never known that once on a dusty day in high summer when the air was thick and still when the sky was baked white with heat austin hatinger had taken what was his he remembered still how shed looked that day and the picture in his mind was so clear his hands trembled and his blood pumped hard and hot shed come to him carrying a basket up to his porch a big straw basket filled with charity for him for his squawling son for his wife who lay inside sweating through the birthing of another child shed been wearing a blue dress and a white hat that had a filmy blue scarf trailing from the crown madeline had always been one for floating scarves her dark hair was curled under the hat so that it framed the creamy skin of her face skin she could pamper with the lotions beaus godless money could buy shed looked like a spring morning strolling up the dirt path to his sagging porch her eyes soft and smiling as if she didnt see the poverty the broken cinderblock steps the dingy clothes hanging on the line the scrawny chickens pecking in the dust her voice had been so cool as shed offered him that basket filled with castoff clothes beaus money had bought for the babies hed planted in austins woman he couldnt hear past it to the weak whine of his own wife calling to him that it was time to fetch the doctor he remembered how madeline had started to go in concerned for the woman who would never have laid in his bed at all if it hadnt been for betrayal and deceit you fetch the doctor austin she had said in that cool springwater voice the kindness in her golden eyes burned a hole in his gut hurry and fetch him and ill stay with her and your little one it wasnt madness that had gripped him no austin would never accept that it was righteousness right and wrath had filled him when he had dragged madeline off the porch truth had pounded through him when he had pulled her down to the dirt oh shed pretended that she didnt want him shed screamed and shed fought but it had all been a lie hed had the right the godgiven right to push himself into her no matter that shed worn a mask that had wept and pleaded shed recognized that right hed emptied his seed into her and all these years later he could still remember the power of that release the way his body had bucked and shuddered as the part of him that was a man flowed into her shed stopped her weeping while hed rolled over in the dirt to stare up at that white sky she had gotten up gone away and left him with the sound of triumph in his ears and the taste of bitterness on his tongue so hed waited day after day night after night for beau to come his second son had been born and his wife lay stonyfaced in the bed and austin waited his winchester loaded and ready and hed ached with the need to kill but beau had never come he knew then that madeline had kept their secret and had doomed him now beau was dead and madeline they were buried together in blessed peace cemetery it was the son now the son who had brought the circle twisting back from generation to generation he thought the son had seduced and defiled his daughter the girl was dead retribution was his right retribution was his sword austin blinked and focused on the bars of light again bars that came through bars they had shifted with oncoming dusk hed been sitting in the past for more than two hours it was time to plan for today in disgust he stared down at his loose blue pants prison clothes he would be rid of them soon he would get out the lord helped those who helped themselves and he would find a way he would make his way back to innocence and do what he should have done more than thirty years ago he would kill the part of beau that lived in his son and balance the scales caroline stepped out onto the flowerdecked patio and inhaled deeply of summer the light was gentling easing quietly toward dusk and insects stirred in the grass she had that smug toofull feeling shed forgotten could be so pleasant the meal had been more than platters of food served on old silver trays it had been a slow almost languorous pocket of time filled with scents and tastes and talk teddy had done magic tricks with his napkin and the flatware dwayne passably sober had displayed a remarkable talent for mimicry moving from old standards like jimmy stewart to jack nicholson and on to locals like junior talbot tucker and josie had kept her laughing with rambling often graphic stories of sex scandals most of which were fifty or sixty years old so different she thought now from her own family dinners where her mother would dictate the proper conversation and not a drop would spill on the starched damask cloth those dinners had been so stifling and lifeless more like a corporate meeting than a family meal the peccadilloes of ancestors would never have been discussed nor would georgia mcnair waverly have found it amusing to have a guest pluck a salad fork out of her bodice no indeed but caroline had enjoyed the evening more than any she could remember and was sorry it was nearly over you look happy tucker commented why wouldnt i be its just nice to see thats all he took her hand and what he felt when his fingers linked with hers was not so much resistance as uncertainty want to walk it was a pretty evening a lovely spot and her mood was mellow all right it wasnt really a walk she thought as she wound through rosebushes and the heavy scent of gardenia it was more of a meander no hurry no destination no problems she thought meander suited tucker perfectly is that a lake she asked as she saw the glint of water in the last light of the sun sweetwater obligingly he shifted directions beau built his house there on the south side of it you can still see whats left of the foundation what caroline saw was a scattering of stones what a view they had acres and acres of their own land how does that feel i dont know it just is dissatisfied she looked out over the wide flat fields of cotton she was a child of the city where even the wealthy held only squares of property and people crowded each other for space but to have all this it has you it surprised him to say it but he shrugged and finished the thought you cant turn away from it not when its been handed down to you you cant see it go fallow when youre reminded that the longstreets have held sweetwater for the best part of two centuries is that what you want to turn away maybe there are some places id like to see his shoulders moved again with a restlessness she recognized and hadnt expected then again travelings complicated it takes a lot of effort dont do that the impatience in her voice nearly made him smile i havent done anything yet he skimmed a hand up her arm but im thinking about it frustrated she broke away you know what i mean one minute you act as though there might be something inside your mind other than a thought for the easiest way out the next thing you shut it off i never could see the point in taking the hard way what about the right way it wasnt often he came across a woman who wanted to discuss philosophy taking out a cigarette tucker settled into the conversation comfortably well whats right for one isnt necessarily right for the other dwayne went off and got a degree hes never done a damn thing with because hed rather sit around and brood about how things should have been josie runs off and gets married twice flies off to anywhere at the drop of a hat and always ends up back here pretending things are better than they can be what about you whats your way my ways to take it as it comes and yours he glanced back at her yours is to figure out whats coming before it gets here that doesnt make either of us wrong but if you figure it out and its not the way you want it you can change it you can try he agreed theres a divinity that shapes our ends roughhew them how we will he inhaled smoke hamlet caroline could only stare he was the last man on earth shed have expected to hear quoting shakespeare you take that field there he put a companionable arm around her shoulders as he turned her now that cotton all things being equal is going to grow that topsoils better than a foot deep and full of fertilizer we spray off the goddamn weevils and when summers gone itll be harvested bailed trucked and sold and my worrying myself sick about whether all those things are gonna happen wont help the situation one bit besides ive got an overseer to do the worrying there has to be more to it than that she began were taking this down to the basics caro it gets planted it gets harvested and somewhere along the line it ends up in a pretty dress like the one youre wearing tonight sure i could sit up nights worrying whether were going to get enough rain or too much rain whether the truckers are going on strike or those dimwits up in washington are going to fuck up again and shuck us into a depression or i can get myself a good nights sleep the results would be exactly the same with a half laugh she turned to him why does that make sense she shook her head there has to be a flaw in that logic you let me know if you figure it out but i think it holds solid let me give you another example you wont let me kiss you because youre worried you might like it too much her brows shot up thats incredibly egocentric the reason could very well be that im sure i wont like it at all either way tucker said agreeably as his arms slid around her waist youre trying to figure out the answer before theres a problem thats the kind of thing that brings on headaches really her voice was dry and she kept her arms at her sides trust me caroline ive made a study on it its like standing on the edge of a swimming hole worrying about the water being too cold youd be better off if somebody put a foot to your butt and pushed you in is that what youre doing his lips quirked in a grin i could tell you i was doing it for you so youd just fall in and stop thinking about the whatifs but the truth is he lowered his head something twisted inside her when his warm breath fluttered over her lips thinking about this is keeping me up at night he gave her chin a playful nip and i need my sleep her body was stiff as his lips light as moth wings cruised over hers practiced seduction she told herself as her heart began to thud she hadnt forgotten how clever some men were at exploiting a womans needs you can kiss me back if you want to tucker murmured against her mouth if you dont ill just please myself first he indulged in a lazy journey of her face lips tracing along her temples over her closed lids down her cheeks the gentleness in him was too ingrained for him to heed the urgency growing inside him to rush and take instead he concentrated on her first faint shiver on that gradual glorious softening of her body against his on the quickening of her breath as he slowly quietly brought his mouth back to hers and oh it was nice so nice to feel that slow female yielding to hear that quick hitch of her breath to smell her over the scent of water and shadows as he eased them both into the kiss this time her lips parted at the first touch as he increased the pressure degree by tormenting degree her hands shot up to grip his arms his last coherent thought was that the water wasnt cold but it was a hell of a lot deeper than hed expected she couldnt think at all not with this steady roaring in her ears she had grabbed him for balance but no matter how desperately she clung the world kept spinning caution had gone up in smoke with a quick helpless moan she dived into the kiss his mouth drank and drew from hers but it wasnt enough the taste was hot honeyed and he craved more tongue and teeth drove the kiss into greater intimacies still he ached he wasnt supposed to ache over a kiss his head wasnt supposed to swim when she locked herself around him he wasnt supposed to tremble when she moaned out his name he knew what it was to want a woman it was a natural pleasurable part of being a man it didnt rip at you or carve a hole in your gut it didnt make your knees shake until you were afraid youd fall down on them and beg he felt himself teeter on some high thin edge selfpreservation had him windmilling his arms and stumbling back before he could fall carefully he put his hands on her shoulders and drew her away his brow rested weakly against hers while he struggled to catch his breath caroline let her unsteady hands stay at his hips gradually through the mist of sensation she forced her thoughts to surface and hold it had simply been too long since shed felt the comfort of an embrace or tasted genuine desire on a mans lips those were reasons enough to excuse losing herself for a moment but she was back now the blood was no longer pounding in her head she could hear the whirl and click of insects the croak of frogs the sweet threenote call of a whippoorwill the light was shadowed caught in that final magic moment between day and night already day was losing ebbing away and taking the passionate heat with it i guess we both couldve been wrong tucker said about what you figuring you wouldnt care for it and me thinking that once id kissed you id sleep better on a long breath he lifted his head i gotta tell you caroline wanting a womans always been a pleasure for me since i was fifteen and laureen ohara and i wrestled off each others clothes in her daddys barn youre the first woman ive come across since that monumental day whos complicated that pleasure she wanted to believe him wanted to believe that what hed felt here was more difficult more intimate more dangerous than anything hed felt before and because she did believe him she was frightened enough to shake him off i think it would be best if we left it alone his gaze flicked down to her lips swollen and soft from his in a pigs eyes he said mildly i mean it tucker a trace of desperation crept into her voice ive just ended a destructive relationship and have no intention of starting another and you your life certainly has enough complications at the moment without adding another normally i might agree with that you know your hair looks just like a halo in this light maybe i want a shot at redemption the angel and the sinner christ knows theres just about that much difference between us thats the most ridiculous his hand shot out quickly so quickly she swallowed the rest of her words as it fisted into her hair this time when he spoke the mild tone was lined with steel something about you caroline i dont know what the hell it is but it eats at me at the oddest times theres usually a good reason for a reaction like that i figure itll come out sometime my time doesnt flow the way yours does tucker she thought her voice was admirably calm particularly when her heart was thudding in her throat in a few months ill be in europe a quick affair to pass a hot summer isnt in my plans the ghost of a smile lit his mouth you do make plans ive noticed that about you he stepped forward and crushed her lips under his in a hard brief kiss that rocked her back on her heels im going to have you caroline sooner or later were going to have the hell out of each other ill try to leave the timing up to you thats the most outrageously arrogant despicably male statement ive ever heard depends on your point of view he said affably i meant it as fair warning but i dont want to get you so riled up it spoils your digestion clamping his hand over hers he started back toward the house lightning bugs were glinting and dancing in the growing dark why dont we sit on the porch awhile i have no intention of sitting anywhere with you now honey you talk like that im going to think you find me irresistible her quick hoot of laughter made him grin the day i cant resist some selfstyled delta don juan he gave a hoot of his own and scooped her off her feet to swing her in a circle im crazy about that sassy mouth of yours he gave it an enthusiastic kiss i bet you went to one of those fancy finishing schools in switzerland i did not and put me down she squirmed for a minute i mean it tucker someones coming he didnt put her down but he did look across the lawn a pair of headlights were coming fast i guess well just mosey on over and see whos calling he carried her to the drive as much to fluster her as for the pleasure of having that long slim body cupped in his arms and he figured once she got over being irritated by it shed see the romance first stars out he said conversationally and she made a sound suspiciously like a growl you know you dont weigh much more than a sack full of flour feel a lot nicer though the mans a poet caroline said between her teeth and wished she didnt see the humor of it he couldnt resist fair as a star when only one is shining in the sky he sent her a smile i guess wordsworth said it better huh before she could think of a proper response he set her on her feet gave her bottom a friendly pat then waved at bobby lee who was scrambling out of his rusting cutlass hey boy shouldnt you be out sparking marvella tucker bobby lee pushed a hand through his drooping pompadour in the headlights hed neglected to turn off his face was pale with fear or excitement i rode on out as soon as i finished he nodded belatedly to caroline evening miz waverly hello bobby lee if youll excuse me id like to thank delia again for dinner before i leave she hadnt even taken the first step when tucker captured her hand its early yet what brings you out he asked bobby lee junior brought in your car this afternoon holy jesus it sure was a mess tucker tucker grimaced and touched fingers gingerly to his bandaged head yeah its a heartbreaker all right barely had five thousand miles on her frames bent then well yeah bent to shit excuse me maam we saw that soon as we had her up on the lift we figured youd have to have her hauled down to jackson but seeing as we havent had a real good wreck come through since bucky larsson creamed his buick out on sixtyone during that ice storm last january we wanted a looksee tucker settled his hip against the cutlass that buick looked like itd been run over by a tank when you towed it in never could figure out how bucky got off with only a broken collar bone and eighteen stitches gets a queer look in his eyes sometimes bobby lee added course he always did now that i think on it tucker nodded his mama was spooked by a nest of copperheads when she was carrying him might have addled him caroline no longer felt the urge to leave but she did have to resist the urge to cup her head in her hands and bray with laughter you came all this way to tell tucker his cars wrecked the two men looked over at her with identical expressions of puzzlement to them it was obvious bobby lee was only setting the stage for whatever hed come to say no maam he said politely i come out to tell tucker how his car come to be wrecked tucker here drives slick as spit everybody knows that thanks bobby lee just telling it like it is well the thing is junior mentioned as to how there wasnt no skid marks or nothing brakes were out yeah he said so i got to thinking and when juniors old lady kept calling complaining how hed promised to take her and the baby on down to greenville for spaghetti i told him id stay to watch the station its quiet on sundays anyhow so i figured id take a look at those brakes for you he pulled a piece of double bubble from his pocket unwrapped it and popped it into his mouth i took a good look at the lines and at the hydraulics for the power steering too might notve seen it if i hadnt been so curious but i did see what caroline demanded when tucker seemed content to let the silencehang holes poked through the lines not rotted or nothing like that but poked through like with an awl or maybe an ice pick fluid wouldve dribbled on out thats how your wheel seized up on you see you couldve wrestled with it if youda been expecting it but coming up to a curve at a clip well the cars gonna keep going dead ahead then you hit the brakes and theyre useless as tits on a bull beg your pardon miz waverly my god her fingers dug into tuckers arm are you saying someone deliberately sabotaged the car he couldve been killed couldve bobby lee agreed but more like busted up some everybody round here knows tucker handles a car as good as those formula one guys i appreciate your coming down to tell me tucker flipped his cigarette away his eyes following the arch of spark he was angry bloodpumping angry and needed to sit on it awhile you going by to see marvella this evening i was planning on it then you go on and tell the sheriff what you told me but nobody else hear dont tell anybody else if thats the way you want it for now id be obliged if we keep it just like that for now get on back to town before marvella lays into you for being so late guess i will be seeing you tucker evening miz waverly caroline didnt speak until the cutlasss taillights winked off at the end of the drive he couldve made a mistake hes just a boy hes one of the best mechanics in the county makes sense anyway if i hadnt had my brains rattled idve seen it myself i just have to figure out whos riled enough to give me trouble trouble caroline echoed tucker i dont care what bobby lee believes about your superhuman skill with a car you might have been seriously hurt even killed you worried about me sugar though his mind was working in other directions he smiled and ran his hands up and down her arms i like it dont be such a jerk now dont get mad caro though god knows i like the look of you when you get heated up her voice chilled im not going to stand here while you pat me on the head and put me off like a helpless female im offering to help you thats sweet of you no he grabbed her as she swore and swung away i mean it its just that until i sift the whole thing through theres nothing to help with its obvious to me that it had to be someone close to edda lou hatinger she tossed her head unless of course youve got a list of jealous husbands you need to consider i dont date married ladies except that once he began and caught her look never mind austins in jail and i cant picture poor old mavis scooting under my car with an ice pick caroline angled her chin she had brothers true enough tuckers lips pursed as he considered vernon wouldnt know a crankshaft from a fence post hes not the sly kind either more open like his daddy and young cy theres no meanness in him that ive ever seen they could have hired someone tucker snorted with what gently he pressed his lips to her temple dont fret honey im going to sleep on it staring she stepped back i think you could she said slowly i believe you could actually close your eyes and sleep like a baby even after this i already wrecked my car and banged my head he pointed out i dont see why whoever did this should have the pleasure of keeping me from sleeping too he got that look in his eye she was beginning to recognize that gleam that sent off warning signals in her brain and flutters in her heart the only thing keeping me up at night is you now if we were to he trailed off as another set of headlights bounced down the drive christ almighty were doing big business tonight im going now caroline said decisively ill call delia tomorrow and thank her just hold on he was trying to make out the type of car all he could tell for sure was that its muffler had parted ways sometime before the noise was enough to wake the dead it was difficult to beheve that the sedate black lincoln that came to a rocky stop in back of carolines bmw could be so rude when the door opened and a small whitehaired woman in a tiedyed tshirt blue jeans and army boots stepped out tucker broke into a hoot and a grin cousin lulu that you tucker she had a voice like a freight train loud and rattly and full of dust what are you doing over there in the dark with that girl less than id like to he was beside lulu in two strides bending himself nearly in half to kiss her powdered paperthin cheek pretty as ever he pronounced and she giggled and swatted him youre the pretty one look more like your ma than she did herself you you there she signaled to caroline with one bony finger come on over where i can see you dont you scare her off tucker warned cousin lulu this is caroline waverly waverly waverly not from these parts she cast her bright birds eyes up and down not your usual type either tucker doesnt look topheavy or pinheaded caroline thought about it thank you yankee lulu set up a screech that could have shattered crystal christ in a sidecar shes a yankee only half tucker said quickly shes miss ediths granddaughter lulus eyes narrowed edith mcnair george and edith yes maam caroline said with her tongue in her cheek im staying the summer in my grandparents house dead arent they yes theyre dead but they were mississippians born and bred so that counts for something that your hair girl or a wig my automatically caroline lifted a hand to her hair its my hair good dont trust baldheaded women any more than i trust yankees so well see tucker you take my cases in and get me a brandy i need you to call that talbot boy about my car lost my muffler somewhere in tennessee maybe it was arkansas she paused at the base of the steps well come on girl i was i was just leaving tucker you tell that girl when i offer to have a brandy with a yankee that yankee better drink with that lulu clumped up the steps in her army boots shes something isnt she tucker asked as he switched off the purring ignition something caroline agreed and decided she could use a brandy at that chapter twelve cy hatingers palms were sweating the rest of him wasnt exactly arriddry either as they said in the commercials his armpits dripped despite his conscientious use of ban rollon he had hair there now had for the best part of a year between his legs too the fact both thrilled and embarrassed him his sweat was the sweat of youth clear and mostly inoffensive it came from a combination of the thick morning heat and his own fear and excitement what he was doing would bring his fathers holy beltflashing wrath down on him he was going to ask the longstreets for work of course his father was in jail and that comforted him some the fact that it did brought on hot little flashes of guilt that made him sweat more arent you glad you use dial he thought dont you wish everybody did he didnt know why he was thinking in commercials unless it was because his mother left the flickering old tv on day and night for company she would say wringing her hands and looking at him dully out of redrimmed eyes she cried just about all the time now and hardly seemed aware of him or ruthanne at all he might come across her sitting on the sagging and faded sofa still in her bathrobe in the middle of the day a basket of laundry at her feet while she sniffled and watched days of our lives at this point cy wasnt sure the tears were for herself or in sympathy for the trials and tribulations of the people in that mythical town of salem to cy the hortons and the bradys of salem were more real than his mother who wandered the house like a ghost each night while the tv droned on through lenos monologue or reruns of sitcoms or commercials for gadgets like the clapper that magical boon to society that allowed you to turn on lights or turn off tvs and all you had to do was applaud it was like congratulating an electrical appliance and cy found it creepy he could imagine his mother with one weeping in the front room and clapping her hands together while the lights jumped and the tv flipped on thank you thank you the dusty screen would say and for my next number heres the reverend samuel harris to show all you sinners the way through those gates of paradise oh yes his mama was right fond of all those religion programs with their hypnoticvoiced reverend this or that shouting down sin and bartering salvation for social security checks after hed come home from fishing with jim the day before hed followed the sound of organ music and hallelujahs through the kitchen and into the front room where his mother stared glassyeyed at the screen it had scared him more than a little because for a minute just a minute the face of the tv preacher had become his fathers face and his fathers allseeing eyes had stared right at him got hair between your legs and evil thoughts in your mind his father had accused the next step is fornication fornication its satans tool between your legs boy as he walked along the dusty verge of the road cy adjusted satans tool which seemed to have shriveled up in memory of his fathers voice his father couldnt see him cy reminded himself and swiped his forearm over his sweaty brow he was in jail and would likely stay there for a while just like aj who had gone from shoplifting packs of cigarettes and mars bars to grand theft auto the minute the cell doors had clanged shut behind his oldest brother his father had said hed no longer had a son named austin joseph now that his father was in the same kind of pickle cy wondered if that meant he no longer had a father the sweet relief of that possibility had another flash of guilt slicing through his gut he wasnt going to think of his father he was going to think of getting this job cy knew his mother would have forbidden him to set foot on sweetwater that pale pasty look would have come over her face the look she got when his daddy decided she needed punishment what sins had his mother committed cy asked himself as his hands clenched and unclenched at his sides what sins that needed to be washed away in her own blood and when black eyes or split lips or bruised ribs had saved her from satan she would tell the neighbors how shed fallen if the sheriff came by she would get that horrible terrified smile on her face and insist over and over that shed taken a tumble down the porch steps no matter how often or how viciously those thick fists rained down on her his ma would stay at his daddys side so cy knew she would have forbidden him to go to sweetwater that was why he hadnt told her she noticed so little these days outside her television world and those whining calls to the lawyer that cy had had no problem slipping out of the house that morning he hadnt even hurried down the hardpack knowing if she looked out and saw him walking down the road her eyes would flick over him then flick back to the screen after three miles on the hardpack hed hit the gravel on gooseneck road and had been lucky enough to catch a ride for two miles with old hartford pruett in the cab of his chevy pickup that left a fourmile walk to sweetwater hed worked up a powerful thirst by the time he reached the crushed mailbox and splintered pole at the mcnair place he could feel the heat beating up through the soles of his shoes his throat was dry as a picked bone through the morning silence he could hear jims daddy singing about the sweet by and by the longing rushed through him so fast he could only stand helpless he knew because jim had told him that his friend had felt his daddys big callused hand across his butt he knew that once when jim had been four and had wandered off into the swamp his daddy had found him and had laid a switch across his legs that had made the young jim dance a jig all the way home but jims father had never come wheeling down with his fists or locked jim in his room for two full days with nothing but bread and water according to him his daddy had never once not once raised a hand to his ma and he had seen for himself the way tobys hand could come down to lay gently and somehow proudly on jims shoulder the way they would walk off together with fishing rods over their shoulders and even though they werent touching you could tell they were his throat ached miserably and cy fought back an urge to walk down the lane to watch jim and his daddy slap paint on the boards of miss ediths place he knew toby would turn and smile his teeth white as the moon against his dark skin skin scarred by cys own father nearly twenty years before look whos here jim he would say looks to me like that boys ready to paint we got us some nice tomato sandwiches for lunch if you was to pick up a brush and get to work might be id find one for you cy yearned toward the lane he could almost feel his body lean toward it even as his feet stayed planted on the glasssplattered hardtop no son of mine is going to run with niggers austins voice cut through cys mind like a rusty blade if the lord wanted us to truck with them hedve made them white but it wasnt that which had cy turning away from the lane it was the knowledge that if he spent the morning painting and eating tomato sandwiches with jim and his daddy he would never work up the nerve to walk the last mile to sweetwater his faded checked shirt was clinging to his skin by the time he turned through the iron gates hed walked nearly eight miles in the steadily spiraling heat and wished now hed taken the time for breakfast his stomach growled ominously one minute then churned the next turning his sweat cold with nausea cy took a faded bandanna out of his back pocket and swiped at his face and neck maybe it was best he hadnt had that breakfast because he was pretty sure if there was anything in his stomach it would be coming up quick hed missed supper the night before too half sick on his share of a lemon pie hed gorged on at the fishing hole the thought of that lemon pie had his stomach rising it took two hard swallows to settle it down again he looked longingly at the cool green grass beyond the line of magnolias he could just stretch out there a minute press his hot face into that sweet grass but he thought someone might see him and hed never get the job he put one foot in front of the other hed seen sweetwater only a time or two before sometimes he thought hed imagined how grand it was with its white walls and tall winking windows but it was never as grand in his imagination as it was in reality the thought that people lived there ate and slept there was an amazement to cy who had lived his whole life in a cramped shack with a dirt yard lightheaded from heat and hunger cy stared at the house as the sun splashed on those white walls and winking windows vapors shimmering up from the gravel made it look as though it were underwater an underwater palace he thought and had some vague recollecttion of reading about mermen and mermaids who lived under the sea he felt as if he were walking through water his steps were slow and sluggish and the air he breathed in was like thick warm liquid that filled up his throat instead of soothing it a little nervous he looked down at his feet and wasnt sure if he was relieved or disappointed to see his cracked and dusty shoes instead of a shiny green tail the scent of flowers was strong as he rounded the peony bed where his father had recently kicked the shit out of tucker cy hoped miss delia would come to the door he liked miss delia with her wild red hair and colorful jewelry shed given him a quarter once just for carrying her bags from the market to her car and since miss delia had thick muscles in her arms cy knew she could have carried them herself and saved her quarter if she came to the door she might tell him to come on around back when he got around to the kitchen shed give him a cold glass of lemonade and maybe a biscuit then he would thank her real polite and ask her if lucius gunn was about so he could ask the overseer about work a little dazed he found himself on the porch facing the big carved door with its polished brass knocker he licked his dry lips lifted his hand the door swung open before hed reached the knocker standing in front of him wasnt miss delia but a small elderly lady who wore orange lipstick and what looked like an eagle feather in her hair cy didnt know that the shiny stones around her crepy neck were russian diamonds her feet were bare and she carried a set of bongos my greatgranddaddy on my mamas side was half chickasaw lulu told the gaping cy might have been a time when my ancestors scalped the hell out of yours yesm cy said for lack of anything better lulus orangeslicked mouth curved you sure do have a fine head of hair on you boy she threw back her head and let out with a screeching warwhoop that had cy stumbling back i just i just i just was all cy managed to get out cousin lulu youre scaring the spit out of that boy tucker strolled up to the door his grin indulgent shes only fooling it took him a moment to place the boy then most of the grin faded what can i do for you cy i i came down looking for work he said then pitched forward in a dead faint something was dripping down cys temples as he surfaced for a horrible moment he thought it was his own blood from where the crazy woman had scalped him he struggled weakly against the syrupy world of unconsciousness and tried to sit up just hold on boy it was miss delias voice and cy was so relieved to hear it that he nearly floated off again but she slapped her hand lightly against his cheeks until he opened his eyes she was wearing painted wooden earrings in the shape of parrots cy watched them swing as she cooled his face with a damp cloth passed clean out she told him cheerfully tucker hadnt been quick enough to catch you youdve bashed your head good on the porch cupping a hand behind his neck she lifted a glass to his lips i was coming down the steps and saw it myself dont believe tuckers moved that fast since his daddy found out he broke one of the panes in the sun room from over the back of the sofa lulu leaned down nearly into his face she smelled like a lilac bush cy discovered didnt mean to scare you green boy no maam i was just i think i had too much sun is all hearing the mortification in the boys voice tucker stepped forward stop fussing over him hes not the first one to pass out in this house delia turned to spit at him but caught the gentle warning in tuckers eye and understood i got work to do cousin lulu id be obliged if youd come up with me im thinking of changing the curtains in the rose room dont see why but lulu was interested enough to tag along when they were alone tucker sat down on the coffee table cousin lulus developed an interest in her indian heritage yes sir since cy felt hed humiliated himself beyond redemption he got shakily to his feet i guess id best get on tucker looked up at the pale face with its two flags of embarrassment riding high on bony cheeks you came a long way to talk about work best part of ten miles tucker thought christ in a sidecar had the boy hoofed it in all this heat why dont you come on back with me to the kitchen i was about to get some breakfast you can join me and say your piece cy felt a splinter of hope prick through the haze yes sir id be obliged he did his best not to gawk as he followed tucker down the hallway with its gleaming floors there were paintings on the walls richer more elegant than anything hed seen before he had an urge to touch one but kept his hands close to his sides in the kitchen with its rosecolored counters and shiny white tiles the light was golden and cool cys stomach juices started churning the minute tucker opened the door of the whirlpool refrigerator and revealed shelf after shelf of food when he took out a platter of ham cys eyes nearly fell out of his head have a seat while i fry some of this up cy would have eaten it cold hell hed have eaten it raw but he choked down the whimper and sat yes sir i believe weve got some biscuits around here too you want coffee or a coke cy rubbed his damp hands on his thighs a coked be fine thank you mr longstreet i expect you can call me tucker since you fainted on my porch tucker popped the top on a chilled sixteenounce bottle and set it in front of cy by the time hed tossed a couple of slices of ham in a skillet cy had downed half the bottle a belch erupted out of him and had his pale face going red as an american beauty rose beg pardon he muttered and tucker bit back a chuckle them bubbles work on a man as the ham began to sizzle tormenting cy with its aroma tucker tossed him a cold biscuit sop some of them up with that im going to heat the rest up in this atomic oven if i can figure it out while tucker pondered over the microwave cy devoured the biscuit in two famished bites tucker caught the act out of the corner of his eye and decided to add eggs to the ham the boy was eating like a starved wolf the eggs were a little runny in the center and singed on the edges but cys eyes rounded with gratitude when tucker set the plate in front of him as they ate he studied the boy who was plowing through ham and eggs goodlooking kid tucker mused for some reason cy reminded him of a picture of the apostle john in the family bible young and frail and lit with some inner light but he was thin as a rail not just teenage gangly but painfully thin his elbow sharp edges his wrists like sticks what the hell was that bastard doing he wondered starving his kids into heaven patient he waited until cy had mopped up every trace of egg so youre looking for work tucker began and cy nodded his mouth still full anything particular in mind cy swallowed gamefully yes sir heard you were hiring on for the fields lucius is pretty much in charge of hiring field hands tucker said hes gone to jackson for a day or two cy felt the strength the good food had put back into him waver hed come all this way only to be told to go home and try again maybe you could tell me if youre hiring tucker knew they were but there was no way in hell he was putting this pale holloweyed boy with pencilthin arms out in a cotton field he started to tell him they had all the hands they needed but something in those dark shadowed eyes stopped him this was edda lous brother he reminded himself austins son the last thing in this world he needed was to hire on a hatinger christ knew he had no business caring about one but those eyes stayed steady on his full of hope and despair and painful youth you know how to ride a tractor the hope began to deepen yes sir can you tell the difference between a weed and a pansy i think so can you swing a hammer without hitting your thumb unexpectedly cy felt his lips twitch most times what i need is something more than a field hand i need somebody to keep things up around here what you might call a man of all work i i can do anything you want tucker took out a cigarette i can give you four an hour he said and pretended not to hear cys sputter of amazement and deliad give you your lunch at noon or thereabouts you can take your time eating but i expect you to watch the clock i dont pay you for munching on corn bread i wont cheat you mr longstreet mr tucker i swear it no i dont expect you will the boy was as unlike the rest of his family as day to night tucker had to wonder how such things happened you can start now if you want to sure i can cy was already pushing back from the table ill be here every day first thing and i can he trailed off as he remembered eddas lous funeral the next day i ah tomorrow i know it was all tucker could think of to say you do this little job for me today then come on back wednesday and thatll be fine yes sir ill be here i sure will come on out here tucker led him out the door and across the patio over the green lawn to a shed after rapping on the side a few times in case any snakes were napping inside tucker pulled open the door its hinges squeaked like old bones i expect you ought to oil those sometime tucker said absently he was struck with the scent here the damp richness of peat that brought back memories of his mother turning it into the ground as she planted what he was looking for was tilted against the shed wall opposite the garden spades and hoes and pruning sheers grinning to himself tucker dragged out his old tenspeed schwinn both tires were dead flat but there was a pump and there were patches the chain needed oiling worse than the hinges on the shed door and the seat had developed a nice coating of mold tucker flicked back the lever of the bell bolted to the handlebars it jingled he could see himself flying down the blacktop toward innocence hed driven fast even then eating up the miles toward cherry popsicles and fountain cokes the sun at his back and his whole life ahead i want you to clean this up for me yes sir cy touched a reverent hand to the handlebars hed had a bike once a wobbly secondhander hed bartered for with a flute hed carved out of a birch branch then one afternoon hed forgotten and left it in the driveway and his father had crushed it flat with his pickup thatll teach you to put your trust in worldly goods then i want you to keep it in tune for me tucker was saying and cy forced himself back a good bikes like a good shit hed almost said woman horse needs to be ridden well and ridden often i figure riding this back and forth from your place to here every day ought to do it cys mouth opened and closed twice you want me to ride it cy let his hand fall away from the handlebars i dont think i could do that you dont ride a bike yes sir i can ride one but it dont seem right i dont think walking close to twenty miles a day and fainting on my porch is right either he put his hands on the boys shoulders ive got the bike im not using it if youre going to work for me you cant balk on the first thing i ask you no sir cy wet his lips if my daddy finds out hell be awful mad you look like a smart boy a smart boy oughta know where he could pull a bike like this off the road someplace close to home where nobodyd pay much attention to it cy thought of the culvert under dead possum lane where he and jim used to play soldier i guess thats true fine everything you need should be in the shed otherwise ask delia or me mark your time paydays on friday cy watched tuckers retreating back then looked down at the dull flecks of blue paint under the grime on the cross bars of the schwinn three hours later after hed finished all the busy work tucker could think of on such short notice cy was cruising down the blacktop the tenspeed wasnt the slick racing machine it had been in tuckers day but for cy it was a steed a stallion a winddancing pegasus this time when he got to the lane leading to the mcnair place he turned in he tilted dangerously on the gravel muttered whoa boy to his trusty mount and managed to keep upright he saw jim and his daddy each perched on extension ladders that leaned against the side of the house fresh blue paint glistened halfway down the lane he couldnt hold back and let out a hoot and a holler jims paintbrush stopped in midair holy crow lookit what cys got whered you get that he shouted you steal it or something heck no he stopped the bike just short of running over some of the petunias he was a little out of practice its like a loan of transportation sliding off he toed down the kickstand i got me a job over to sweetwater no shit jim said before he remembered his father his slip earned him a halfhearted bop on the head sorry but he was still grinning down at cy you working the fields nuhuh mr tucker said i was going to be his man of all work and hes paying me four an hour no fooling honest to god and he said hold on god be patient toby shook his head you two going to stand around shouting all day miz waverlyll send us packing no she wont amused by the whole scene caroline stuck her head out of the window between father and son but it seems to me its a good time to take a break ive been waiting all day for you to offer me another cup of your wifes lemonade id be pleased to jim you go on down mind your step the truth was toby wanted to see what was doing himself by the time he got down jim was already ooing over the schwinn toby went to get the twogallon cooler while cy related his adventure fainted jim said mightily impressed right there on the porch caroline stepped through the screen door in time to hear her brows drew together she listened murmuring an absent thanks to toby as he handed her a paper cup filled with tart lemonade tucker had hired the boy she thought in amazement as a for heavens sake man of all work chores tucker was to lazy to do himself she decided the child was stickthin and holloweyed shed been much the same herself not so long ago and she felt pangs of empathy and annoyance that boy has no business working she said under her breath oh i expect hed like some pocket money toby said easily he looks like he could use a hot meal more she started to call out prepared to fix the child a late lunch herself whats his name hes cy miz waverly cy hatinger her blood froze hatinger tobys eyes flicked away from the appalled look in hers he aint nothing like his daddy miz waverly in an old habit toby ran a fingertip down the scar on his cheek hes a good boy hope you dont think im overstepping but im partial to him hes a good friend to jim caroline struggled with her conscience he was a child after all she had no business having this urge to shout him off her land only because he carried the hatinger name and hatinger blood the bikes bell jingled as cy and jim took turns ringing it the sins of the fathers that had been austins quote and his threat she didnt believe it not when she looked out at the thinfaced boy who smiled like a dreamy angel cy his head came up not like an angels but like a wolfs fast and wary maam i was about to fix myself some lunch would you like some no maam thank you maam i had me some breakfast down to sweetwater mr tucker he fixed me up ham and eggs himself he i see but she didnt see at all beside her toby let out a bellow of laughter tuck cooked you ate and youre still standing boy you must have a castiron stomach he cooked it good he has this microwave he put biscuits in and quick as you blink they came out again steaming revving up cy went on about how he was going to get lunch fixed for him every day by miss delia and about the loan of the bike and how mr tucker had given him two dollars in advance already and he said i should spend it as i pleased as was a mans privilege with his first pay long as it wasnt on whiskey and women he flushed a little and shot a look at caroline he was only kidding caroline smiled im sure youre right cy thought she was the prettiest female hed ever seen he was afraid if he kept looking at her his old tool of satan would start to twitch so he looked at the ground im awful sorry about how my daddy shot out your windows caroline hated to see his thin shoulders go tense that way theyre all fixed now cy yesm he was going to say something maybe offer her the two dollars for the damage but he heard the car seconds before any of the others heard the sound of the engine slowing the whisper of gravel under tires he turned its that fbi man cy said his voice expressionless they all watched in silence as matthew burns drove up and stopped at the end of the lane he wasnt terribly pleased to come across the crowd hed hoped to find her alone so that they could have a leisurely chat but he fixed a pleasant enough smile on his face as he stepped from the car good afternoon caroline hello matthew what can i do for you nothing official i had an hour free and thought id drop by to see how you were im fine but she knew that wouldnt be enough would you like some iced tea that would be wonderful he stopped by the bike where cy had his eyes planted firmly on the ground youre the young hatinger boy correct yessir cy remembered burns coming out to the house trying to get some sense out of ma while she wept into her apron id best be getting home come on jim lets get back to work i wish youd take a longer break toby its so hot toby matthews gaze sharpened on the broadshouldered black man toby march muscles tensed toby nodded thats right coincidentally your names on my list to be interviewed that scar on your face hatinger gave that to you matthew caroline said appalled her gaze locking on cys face i gotta go cy said again quickly maybe ill see you tomorrow jim he hopped on the bike and pedaled furiously matthew did you have to do that with the child here burns spread his hands in a town like this im sure the boy knows already now mr march if you have a moment jim you go on around and scrape that window trim but daddy do as i say head down shoulders slumped jim obeyed you wanted to ask me a question mr burns agent burns yes about your scar ive had it going on twenty years from when austin hatinger come down on me for being a thief toby bent to lift an unopened bucket of paint and turned it back and forth in his broad hands he accused you of stealing he said i took some rope from his place but i never took nothing wasnt mine in my life and thereve been hard feelings between you since toby continued to shift the can caroline could hear the paint slop gently inside we aint been what youd call neighborly burns took a pad out of his pocket sheriff truesdale has a report of a crossburning on your lawn some six months ago according to your statement you believed austin hatinger and his son vernon were responsible something cold and hard flashed into tobys eyes i couldnt prove it i couldnt prove it when i came out of larssons one evening and found the tires on my truck slashed either and vernon hatinger was standing across the street paring his fingernails with his pocket knife and grinning even when vernon says to me i should be glad it was my tires this time and not my face i couldnt prove anything so i just said what i thought hatinger didnt like his boy being seen with mine there was an altercation between you and austin hatinger a few weeks later in the hardware store where he threatened to harm your son if you didnt keep him away from cy is that true he come in while i was buying some threepenny nails he said some things do you recall what things tobys jaw set he said nigger keep your little black bastard away from whats mine or ill peel the skin off him i said if he touched my boy id kill him the quiet dispassionate way toby said it sent a chill racing up carolines spine he said some more things quoting scripture and talking trash about how us coons forgot where was our place then he picked up a hammer we got to fighting there in the store and somebody took off for the sheriff i guess cause he come hauling ass and broke it up and did you say to hatinger something along the lines of he consulted his pad again youd be better off worrying about how often that girl of yours is spreading her legs than about cy fishing with my jim i mighta and the girl you were referring to was the nowdeceased edda lou hatinger slowly toby set down the paint can he was saying things about my family shouting filth about my jim and my little lucy and my wife not a week before that vernon stopped my wife on the street and told her shed best keep a closer eye on her boy before he got himself a broken arm or leg a man dont have to take that from nobody and so you brought up miss hatingers sexual habits tobys skin heated with anger i was mad maybe i shouldntve brought in his kin since it was him that riled me but im curious how you happen to be acquainted with the deceaseds sexual habits everybody knows it didnt take much to get her on her back he looked at caroline with mute apology and do you have personal knowledge of that now the fury flashed bright as a sword in his eyes frightened by it caroline stepped forward to lay a warning hand on his arm i took vows to a woman fifteen years ago toby said clenching his fists ive been faithful to her well mr march i have a witness who claims you visited edda lou hatinger three or four times in her room at the innocence boarding house thats a shitfaced lie i never been in her room not when she was there but you were in her room toby began to feel something very much like a noose tighten around his throat mrs koons hired me on to do some work there i retrimmed the windows in all the rooms did some painting too and when you did your work in edda lous room you were alone thats right you were never in the room with her toby stared at burns for a slow five seconds when she came in i went out he said simply now i gotta get my work done and see to my boy when toby stepped off the porch and around the side caroline realized she was trembling that was horrible im sorry caroline burns put his pad away questioning suspects can be difficult you dont believe he killed that girl because of the hateful things her father did though she wanted to shout it she forced herself to speak quietly hes a family man you only have to see him with his son to understand what kind of person he is believe me caroline a murderer does not often look like a murderer particularly a serial killer i could give you statistics and psychological patterns that would astonish you please dont she said coolly im sorry you seem to be dragged into this affair again and again he smiled id hoped to come by and spend a quiet hour continuing our conversation of the other day and of course id hoped to persuade you to play for me she took three careful breaths perhaps she thought he couldnt help being an insensitive arrogant clod im sorry matthew im taking a rest from performing oh his face crumpled in disappointment well perhaps sometime soon im hoping to have some time at the end of the week from the little research ive done im told theres an adequate seafood restaurant in greenville id love to take you thank you matthew but im sticking very close to home for now he stiffened a bit at the brushoff pity well the work wont wait i suppose id best get back he walked to the car annoyed but not defeated ill take a raincheck on the iced tea if i may yes goodbye the moment his dust had cleared she went inside for the first time in days she picked up her violin and played chapter thirteen overnight a slow dreary rain had moved in soaking the thirsty ground by midmorning it had moved on sluggishly to arkansas having done little more than turn the dirt to a slick mud that would bake dry by afternoon beside the open grave a huddle of people stood ankledeep in the tattered fog that was already burning off in the yellow glare of the sun some yards away a narrow line of oaks dripped with rain a distracting monotone that reminded cy of the rusty faucet in the bathroom that leaked day and night sometimes he would lie in bed at night thinking that steady drip drip drip would drive him crazy just like that chinese water torture he had read about he was cy hatinger secret agent and the water would drip drip drip on the center of his forehead but he would never break not even if the water wore right through the skin and bone and down to the brain no they would never break him he was bond james bond he was rambo he was indiana jones then he would just be cy stuck in his mustysmelling room and he would get up stuff a ragged washcloth under the leak so that the drip would muffle to a bearable plop this time he didnt try to block out the sound but concentrated on it instead using it to turn his mind away from where he was and what he was doing the reverend slater seemed ancient to cy though in truth the good man was not yet sixty but cys young eyes saw only the thin puffs of white hair on a sunburned scalp the roadmap lines that scored the windroughened face and the loose skin of his throat that hung stringily from bony chin to concave chest to cys mind the reverend was too old to know much about life then again today was for death and there he was bound to be an expert reverend slaters voice rose and ebbed flowing melodiously over phrases about salvation and eternal life and that old standard gods will cy wondered what would happen if he stepped forward and snatched the bible out of reverend slaters hand excuse me he could say but thats a big pile of horseshit god didnt have anything to do with edda lou getting all sliced up how come we have to put it on him that shes going into the ground today how come we just shuck it aside as the will of the lord when we all know it was a mans hand who held the knife he was sick of having everything bad put off that way if the hail came and sliced the young cotton plants to ribbons it was gods will he knew where hail came from and it all had to do with hot air hitting cold and turning rain into hard little balls of ice cy couldnt picture god sitting up there on his golden throne and deciding it was time to pitch hail at austin hatingers pitiful cotton crop just as he couldnt picture god willing that edda lou be hacked to pieces and tossed in the pond he wanted to say so the words almost burned on his tongue in their need to be spoken he knew his mother would only cry harder and groan and sway ruthanne would hush him mortally embarrassed vernon would cuff him hard enough to make his ears ring others might just stare at him they were mostly ladies who had come wrapped in their black dresses mrs fuller and mrs shays grouped together with mrs larsson and mrs koons darleen was there too bawling up a storm so that her mama finally stepped forward and took the baby she was clutching there were other women some who had been friends with edda lou most whod come out of christian duty but men were scarce sheriff truesdale was there holding his wifes hand the fbi man stood off to the side his face solemn and his head bent but cy knew that his eyes were watching watching watching i am the way the truth and the light slater intoned and mavis swayed so violently into her eldest son that vernon tipped into his wife and sent a domino reaction around the circle of mourners everyone jigged and jogged for a moment while the reverend went on heedless whosoever believest in me will enter the kingdom cy wanted to shout to shout at all of them that edda lou hadnt believed in anything but edda lou that all this praying and carrying on was only making a bad thing worse but he kept his silence and he kept his head down because there was one man attending the graveyard service whom he feared more than he feared the reverends god that was his father austin hatinger stood straight in his shiny sunday suit his ankles and wrists shackled and a glumfaced deputy flanking him at each side he listened to the holy word he watched as the coffin was lowered into its dark moist home and he planned he heard his wifes long ululant cry of grief his eyes flicked up to her face saw the ravage done by ceaseless tears and he plotted as the last fingers of fog began to burn off the damp grass he lowered his head god had provided he thought concentrating he stared unblinking into the hole dug for his daughter in reaction his eyes began to tear let them think he was weak with grief he thought let them see a weak helpless man he waited waited through the end of the service waited waited while the women moved to his wife to murmur useless words of condolence as they began to walk off toward their cars one of the deputies nudged him hatinger please he focused on that hole in the ground and made his voice tremble i need to pray to pray with my wife he could see by the way the deputies shuffled their feet that they had been moved by the service and the womens tears masking everything that was in his heart he lifted his head all they could see was the shinyeyed hopelessness of a father with a dead child please he repeated she was my daughter my only daughter it isnt natural for a man to bury his child is it you know what he did to her dont you he looked down so they wouldnt see the hate i need to comfort my wife she aint strong and this is like to kill her just let me hold my wife he held out his hands a mans got a right to hold his wife over his daughters grave aint he look im sorry come on lou the second deputy had a daughter of his own where the hell can he go with his legs shackled its only decent to give him a minute with his wife austin stood his head bowed and glee in his heart as the key turned on the cuffs but were going to have to stand with you the deputy who was called lou said grudgingly and you only got five minutes god bless you out of the corner of his eye austin saw that burke was already in his car and pulling away a few of the other women had scattered off to older graves to pay respects to family that was gone austin took a step forward opening his arms blindly limply his wife fell into them he held her a moment waiting watching as the deputies averted their eyes out of embarrassed respect for the grieving it was human nature to offer privacy to the mourning the smattering of people still in the cemetery turned away then he moved fast so fast that cy who had never once seen his parents embrace stumbled back into the wet grass austin shoved his wife hard against the first deputy tumbling both him and the screaming mavis into the open grave as the other deputy reached for his weapon austin rammed him hard in the chest going in headfirst like a battering ram the grappling for the gun was brief while lou down in the grave fought to free himself of a flailing hysterical woman austin rapped the side of the gun across the deputys head knocking him unconscious then snatched a wideeyed birdie shays around the throat ill kill her austin shouted full of the wrath of god ill kill her dead as my girl you hear me you throw out your gun and the keys or ill blow a hole in her head fit to drive a truck through birdie made piping sounds and pawed ineffectually at his arm a few feet away ruthanne began to cry certain she would never live down this newest humiliation where you gonna go lou demanded hating the fact that he was crouched on a coffin with a sobbing woman clawing up his back the guys back in the station were going to ride him about this like a conventioneer rides a twentydollar whore think it through hatinger where you gonna go where the lord leads me and yes he could feel the strength and heat of that fierce god pumping through him his eyes shone with it master i will follow thee he shouted cutting off birdies air ten seconds then i do her after that ill just fill that hole youre in with lead and thatll be that swearing and furious lou tossed out the keys your sidearm too goddammit five seconds with a jerk of his head austin signaled vernon to unchain him you oughta just kill them daddy vernon said between his teeth as he turned the key the idea had blood surging to his face just shoot the christless bastards and well go to mexico i aint going nowhere till this is finished lou popped up hoping to get off one shot then ducked down again as a piece of sod two inches away was sheared off by a slug fucking crazy if he thinks im going to end up with a hole in my head lou tossed the gun out austin shoved the babbling birdie toward the grave where she teetered on the edge for a moment her eyes wide with dreadful concentration her arms stretched like a diver preparing for a double gainer she landed spreadeagle on lou by the time everyone had sorted themselves out austin hatinger was gone driving off in birdie shayss buick he was carrying two police specials and a gutful of hate jim march stood patiently in the hallway whistling tunelessly through his teeth and waiting for caroline to come back down so he could ask her if she wanted the braces on her back porch fixed when the painting was done his daddy had run into town for a few supplies and jim had opted to stay behind he was supposed to be painting but hed noticed the sag and give in the old porch and thought his daddy would be pleased if the inquiry led to more work caroline had called down to him to come on in when hed knocked hed been careful to wipe his feet his mama was a fiend about foot wiping and hand washing every few whistles hed edge his paintsplattered keds a little farther down the hall he knew the violin was in the parlor because hed seen it through the window jim wanted a closer look the same way he might have wanted one if hed spotted a brand new wilson ball glove through larssons display window he reached the parlor doorway casual like he thought and there it was he shot a quick glance over his shoulder toward the stairs then made his dash he was just going to take one little look was all he told himself one peek then hed be back in the hallway lickitysplit hed been thinking about that violin ever since caroline had played it the day before jim had never heard music like it not in all his born days it made him wonder if there was something special about this violin something different from the old fiddle rupert johnson would sometimes saw on summer nights jim fumbled with the catches on the side then lifted the top when he saw it nestled there against coalblack velvet it was different oh it seemed to be the same shape and size as old ruperts but it was shiny as a new penny and when jim worked up the nerve to touch it its glossy surface was smooth as silk or what he imagined silk would be forgetting his vow to take one quick peek he gently brushed a thumb over the strings caroline heard the telltale open chord when she reached the bottom of the steps her first reaction was of irritation no one touched her instrument no one she tuned and polished it herself often to the amusement of whatever orchestra she was playing with luis had complained more than once that she spent more time stroking the violin than stroking him that had made her feel guilty until shed discovered hed been doing quite a bit of extracurricular stroking himself she strode toward the parlor the lecture already heating her tongue then she stopped jim was kneeling beside the violin case and his thumb brushed carefully across the strings as gently as if he were stroking the cheek of an infant but it was his face that stopped caroline from speaking the sharp words he looked as though hed just discovered some marvelous secret his smile stretched across his face not in glee but in profound joy his eyes shone with it jim she said quietly and he jerked to his feet like a puppet on a string his eyes widened until caroline was all but sure they were going to swallow the rest of his face i i i was just looking i beg pardon miz caroline i know i wasnt supposed to dont fire my daddy its all right she said and it was wouldnt luis be surprised she thought that it was all right with her if a young black boy handled her violin shed never allowed luis to do more than breathe on it you dont have to pay me for the work or nothing he barreled on i know i shouldnta done it i said its all right jim when she touched a hand to his shoulder the calm amusement in her voice finally reached his rattled brain you aint mad no but it would have been better if youd asked to see it of course if he had she would have said no then she would have missed that glimpse of sheer pleasure the same pleasure she remembered feeling herself once upon a time yes maam i apologize i sure do had no right coming into your parlor like this hardly able to believe his good luck he started backing out i was coming in to ask if you wanted that back porch braced then i justit occurred to him hed be smarter to leave well enough alone what made you want to see it shoot he thought she was going to tell his daddy for sure then the shit would be in the fire it was just hearing you play it yesterday i aint never heard nothing like the way you made that fiddle sing so i thought well i wondered if it was something special it is to me thoughtfully she took the violin from gits case as she had too many times to count the weight the shape the texture all so familiar how much she loved it and how much she hated it have you ever held one jim swallowed hard well old rupert thats deputy johnsons grandpappy he showed me a couple of tunes on his fiddle it aint nearly as pretty as yours dont make music the same neither she doubted old rupert owned a stradivarius she had an impulse that surprised her then she reminded herself that blocking her impulses was what had landed her in that hospital in toronto freeing them had brought her to innocence for better or worse why dont you show me what you can do she offered the violin and jim immediately put both hands behind his back nom i couldnt wouldnt be right its right if i ask you isnt it she watched the boys eyes latch on to the violin saw the war in his face between desire and what he considered propriety his hands came out slowly to take it holy crow he whispered it do shine dont it silently she took out the bow rosined it i wasnt very much older than you the first time i played this violin she thought back so far back to the night her parents had given it to her in her dressing room at the academy of music in philadelphia before her first major solo shed been sixteen and had just finished retching as quietly and discreetly as possible in the adjoining bath then her parents had come in her father so full of beaming pride her mother so full of desperate ambition that the sickness hadnt had a chance against them shed never been sure if the violin had been a gift or a bribe or a threat but she hadnt been able to resist it what had she played that first time caroline wondered there in the dressing room heavy with the scent of flowers and greasepaint mozart she remembered and smiled a little show me she said simply and handed him the bow jim cast his mind around for what might be best settling the violin on his shoulder he eased the bow over the strings in a few testing sweeps then launched into salty dog by the time hed finished the dazed look had left his eyes and a grin was splitting his face he knew hed never sounded better and caught up in the music he flowed into casey jones caroline sat on the arm of the chair and watched oh there were a few wrong notes and his technique could use a little polishing but she was impressed not only with his playing which was clever and bright but with the look in his eye the look that told her he was playing for pleasure that was something that had been denied her and that she had denied herself for nearly twentyfive years jim came back to himself and cleared his throat the music was still dancing and swaying inside his head and his fingers vibrated with it but he was afraid he was pushing his luck thats just some stuff old rupert showed me its nothing like what you played that was holy i guess she had to smile i think we can make a bargain jim maam you show me how to play what old rupert showed you his eyes bulged out of his head you want me to show you how to play those tunes thats right and in return ill show you how to play others like what you was playing yesterday yes like that he knew his hands were sweating and made himself give her back the violin before he smudged it and ruined everything id have to ask my daddy ill ask him caroline tilted her head if youd like to id like it just fine then come over here and watch she remained sitting so he could have a good view of her fingers this is called the minute waltz its by frederic chopin chopin jim repeated reverently we wont play it in a minute just yet its not a race its just for fun yes she tucked the violin under her chin relishing that threeletter word for fun they were well into their first lesson when deputy carl johnson drove by to tell her that austin hatinger had escaped caroline made up her mind about two things after carl johnson had driven off to pass the word at sweetwater first she was going to renew her target practice and she was going to get herself a dog her initial instinct to pack and run had faded almost before it had begun what had replaced it was an emotion much stronger and deeper this was her home now and she intended to protect it following jims advice and directions she headed down hog maw road toward the fullers jim had told her that happy fullers bitch princess had had a litter some two months before happy changed from her funeral dress to her gardening clothes greeted her with pleasure not only was she pleased to be rid of the single remaining pup she wanted a new ear to listen to all the excitement ive never been more terrified happy was saying as she led caroline around to the backyard past a gaggle of ceramic geese and a bed of impatiens i was standing aways apart by my mamas grave she passed in eightyfive from cancer of the ovaries wouldnt see the doctor mama wouldnt so it ran through her like grant took richmond me i go into doc shays and have a pap smear every six months like clockwork im sure thats wise makes no sense to hide from problems happy paused in front of a whirligig of a man sawing wood the air hung so heavy and still the little man was getting plenty of rest anyhow happy continued bending to tug out a weed that had dared intrude on her zinnias im standing by mama and i hear all this commotion shouting and screaming and what all turned around just in time to see that deputy from greenville go tumbling with mavis into edda lous grave then austin he takes a vicious swipe at the other deputy hardly more than a boy that one and knocks him clean out with his own pistol im thinking to myself holy god in heaven hes going to open up with that gun but what does he do he snatches birdie round the throat and orders that deputy the one down in the grave to throw out the key for the leg shackles now you could hear mavis wailing and screaming fit to wake the dead lordy theres plenty to wake there in blessed peace and theres poor birdie white as a sheet with a gun right to her head i thought my heart was going to stop on me birdies a dear friend of mine yes i know caroline had already heard all this from carl johnson but resigned herself that she would hear it again and again when austin let loose with a shot im not ashamed to say i dove behind my mamas headstone its a goodsized one though i had to fight with my brother dick over the price of it dick always was a skinflint why hell squeeze a penny till lincoln shouts uncle then vernon whos just as shiftyeyed as his daddy ever was unlocked those shackles next thing you knew austin was shoving poor birdie into that hole right on top of the deputy from greenville and poor mavis all hell broke loose then let me tell you birdie was screeching mavis wailing and that deputy was cussing like a drunk sailor on a twoday leave happys lips twitched and she would have bitten back the smile if she hadnt seen answering amusement in carolines eyes they stared at each other for a moment struggling for sobriety caroline lost first with a quick snorting laugh she tried to turn into a cough then they were laughing standing in the bright afternoon sun and howling until happy had to dig for her hankie and wipe her eyes i tell you caroline it was a sight ill not forget if i live to a hundred after austin took off in birdies buick i ran over there they were all tangled in a heap of arms and legs on top of the coffin and the first thing i thought god forgive me was that it all looked like one of those unnatural sex doings you might see on an xrated video her eyes twinkled not that ive ever seen one mind you no caroline said weakly of course not birdies skirts were hiked up nearly to her waist shes a bit on the heavy side is birdie and i do believe shed knocked the wind right out of that deputy when she landed on him his face was red as a raddish and mavis why she was hanging on to his legs and shouting about the hand of god awful caroline managed to say then dissolved into laughter again oh its awful happy honked into her hankie and fought back a fresh spray of giggles then that young deputy woke up while those of us left at the cemetery were trying to haul birdie and the rest of them out poor boy was stumbling around and by jesus if cy hadnt caught hold of him hedve tumbled right in with them it was better than watching i love lucy caroline had a picture of ricky ricardo doing a headfirst dive into a grave luuucy im home she sat down on the little stone wall by the impatiens and hugged her sides with a sigh happy sat beside her oh my im glad i got that out birdied never forgive me for laughing its terrible gruesome that added another five minutes to their fight for composure well now breath hitching a bit happy put away her hankie let me call that damn dog while youre looking him over ill go get us something cold princess princess you get on over here and bring that mutt with you only got the one left happy said conversationally and youre welcome to him cant tell you nothing about the father as princess aint too particular going to have her spayed this time meant to before caroline saw a big yellowhaired dog thickbodied wearyfaced come ambling across the yard running circles around her was a goodsized puppy of the same color every few seconds he made a dash under her for one of the floppy tits princess who had obviously had enough of motherhood would shift cagily away here now happy clapped her hands at the sound the pup gave up his quest for mothers milk and cheerfully gamboled over youre a useless little cuss arent you the pup yipped in agreement wagging his tail so fast and hard his hind end nearly met his nose ill leave you to get acquainted happy rose ill fetch us some iced tea caroline eyed the pup with a good deal of doubt certainly he was cute and it was sweet the way he plopped his big front paws on her knees but she was after a guard dog not a pet it certainly wouldnt do for her to develop a fondness for an animal she would have to give away in a few months and though he was already goodsized he was hardly fiercelooking with his dopey long ears and lolling tongue his mother stood nearly as tall as carolines waist but she wondered how long it would take for the son to grow that high it was a mistake she decided she should have asked for the nearest pound and gone in to liberate some fangdripping doberman she could keep chained near the back door but the pups fur was soft and warm while she frowned over him he licked her hand and swiped his tail so hard he tumbled off his perch then set to chasing it once hed gotten a good bite of it he yelped then raced back to her his big brown eyes full of wonder and doggy chagrin dummy she muttered and picked him up to cuddle ah hell she thought as he slobbered all over her cheek and throat when happy came out with the iced tea caroline had already named him useless she decided hed look very dapper in a red collar she bought him one at larssons and added a tenpound bag of puppy food a leash a plastic dish with two bowls and a flowered cushion which would serve as a dog bed he howled in her car the entire time she was in the store she looked out once to see hed propped his feet up on the dash and was staring at her with accusation and terror in his big brown eyes the minute she got back in the car he scrambled into her lap after a short battle of wills caroline left him curled there for the drive home youre not going to do me a damn bit of good she said as the pup let out a shuddering sigh of contentment i can see that already i know what the problem is i always wanted a puppy when i was a little girl we couldnt have one dog hairs in the parlor and piddles on the rug then by the time i was eight i was already traveling on and off during the summer so of course a pet was out of the question she stroked him as she drove enjoying the warm lump of him on her lap the thing is im not going to be here for more than another month or two so its not really fair for us to develop a close relationship not that we cant be friends she continued when useless propped his head in the crook of her elbow and looked up soulfully i mean its certainly all right to have a little affection some respect even some mutual enjoyment for as long as it lasts just as long as we both know he cuddled against her breast and licked her chin shit by the time she turned in her drive she was already in love and berating herself for it it didnt help to see tucker sitting on her front porch steps with a bottle of wine beside him and a spray of yellow roses across his lap chapter fourteen dont you ever work caroline asked as she struggled to gather up the wiggling puppy her purse and some of her purchases only if they catch me tucker set the roses aside then lazily unfolded himself whatcha got there caro i call it a dog he chuckled and wandered over to where shed managed to squeeze her car next to the boatsized oldsmobile cute little fella he ruffled the pups fur then peeked in the back of the bmw need some help she blew her hair out of her eyes what do you think i think youre glad to see me he took advantage of her loaded arms and kissed her and you wish you werent go on and take a load off ill haul the rest of this out for you she did mainly to see if he could do anything with his hands other than raise a womans blood pressure after shed sat on the steps caroline worked on fastening the new collar around the squirming puppys neck looks like you got all the essentials tucker commented he pulled out a bag tossed the sack of puppy food over his shoulder there was a faint and interesting ripple of muscle caroline noticed then he gathered up the brightflowered cushion whats this hes got to sleep on something your bed tucker figured with a grin the pup didnt look backward so he dumped everything on the porch then sat next to her that one of the fuller pups yes the pup deserted her to sniff at tuckers hand caroline could smell the roses and determined not to be charmed by them not to ask about them not even to look at them hey boy tucker scratched the pup in a spot that had useless grinning and slapping a hind foot rhythmically on the step thats a good dog yeah thats a pretty good dog so whats his name useless caroline muttered as the puppy her puppy she reminded herself stretched himself adoringly over tuckers lap ive already figured out he would be as a guard dog tuckers brows drew together briefly guard dog huh he tickled the puppy into turning over hey boy let me see those teeth useless obligingly chewed on tuckers knuckle well theyll grow soon enough just like the rest of him couple of months hell start to grow into his feet in a couple of months i ill be in europe she finished actually i may be leaving sooner than that theres an engagement i might have to take in september that would require me to go to dc in august to prepare have to take she hadnt meant to put it that way theres an engagement she said dismissing the rest but i imagine ill be able to find a good home for the puppy before i leave tucker looked up at her golden eyes calm and just a little hard he had a way of looking now and again she thought that stripped away all the nonsense and carved down to truth i expect you could take a dog along if you wanted to his voice was quiet hardly more than a ripple on the hot still air youre a pretty big deal in what you do arent you she hated the fact that she had to look away had to before he saw through to things she was still hiding from herself tourings complicated she said and left it at that but he didnt do you like it its part of what i do she started to make a grab for the puppy when he scrambled off tuckers lap to go exploring he could wander off hes just sniffing the place out you didnt answer me caroline do you like it its not a matter of like or dislike when youre performing you travel airport to airport she thought city to city hotel to hotel rehearsal to rehearsal she felt the tightening in her stomach the little pull of a knot being tied it warned her to ease off unless she wanted to extend an invitation to her old friend mr ulcer when a man was rarely tense himself he recognized the symptoms casually he put a hand to the back of her neck and rubbed i never could understand why somebodyd make a habit of doing something they didnt care for i didnt say sure you did you didnt say oh my gracious tuck theres nothing like it flying off to london scooting on to paris cruising over to vienna or venice now ive always wanted to see some of those places myself but you dont sound like youve piled up a load of fun by doing it see she thought what did you really see between interviews rehearsals performances and packing there are people in this world who dont consider fun their lifes ambition she heard her own voice recognized it as prim and pouted in disgust now thats a shame he settled back to light a cigarette see that pup there hes sniffing round there happy as a frog with a belly full of flies hell water your grass chase his tail if it appeals to him then settle down and take a nice nap i always figured dogs had the best idea for getting through her lips twitched just let me know if you have an urge to water my grass but tucker didnt smile back he studied the glowing tip of his cigarette a moment then shot her that calm scapelhoned look i asked doc shays about those pills you gave me the percodan he said they were potent it caused me to wonder why youd need them she toughened up the way she drew in reminded him of a porcupine curling up and showing spines to anything curious enough to take a poke thats none of your business he put a hand on her cheek caroline i care about you she was very aware they both were that hed said that before to dozens of women and they were both aware uncomfortably that this time it was different i get headaches she said hating the fact that her voice was waspish and defensive regular what is this a test a lot of people get headaches especially if they do more than sit in a porch rocker all day i prefer a good rope hammock myself he said equably but we were talking about you her eyes went flat and cold back off tucker normally he would have he wasnt one to poke and prod where his hand could get snapped off it doesnt sit well with me thinking about you hurting im not hurting but a headache was coming on as relentlessly as a highballing freight train or worrying worrying she repeated the word twice then dropped her head in her lap and laughed there was a tint of hysteria in the sound that had the puppy bellying over to whine at her feet oh whats to worry about just because some maniacs out carving up women and leaving them floating in my pond why should i worry that austin hatingers on the loose again and may decide to come back and blow out my windows i certainly shouldnt lose any sleep over the fact that hes sure to try to put a few holes in you im not looking for more holes than ive already got he ran a soothing hand up and down her spine we longstreets have a knack for coming out on top oh i can see that with your eye blackened and your head bashed in tucker frowned a little hed been thinking his eye was looking a lot better by next week the bruisesll go and austins likely to be back in jail longstreet luck works that way darlin take cousin jeremiah caroline groaned but he ignored her now he was a good friend of davy crocketts a kentucky boy you know his voice settled naturally into a storytelling mode theyd fought together during the war for independence course jeremiahd been no moren a boy then but he sure did like to fight after the war he knocked around here and there not quite sure what the hell to do with himself never settled down it was like he couldnt find himself a purpose anyhow he heard about this ruckus going on in texas and figured hed mosey on over and see his old friend davy maybe shoot a few mexicans he was still this side of louisiana when his horse stepped down in a rabbit hole tossed jeremiah off horse broke a leg so did jeremiah had to shoot the horse which pained jeremiah some as theyd been together the best part of eight years now it so happened this farmer came along hauled jeremiah back to his place in his wagon the farmer had a daughter as any decent farmer should and between them they set the leg it was a bad break and nearly did jeremiah in but after a couple a weeks he was able to hobble around on a crutch and he fell in love with the farmers daughter had a handsome brood of children who got rich planting cotton or whatever they plant in louisiana thats true enough but not my point exactly the point is jeremiah lost his horse and walked with a limp the rest of his days but he never did get out there to join davy in texas at the alamo shed turned her head to rest her cheek on her knees so that she could watch him as he finished the story which was probably a lie the odd thing was her headache had receded along with those warning jags in her stomach so the point is she said a longstreets lucky enough to break a leg to avoid something more fatal there you go now honey why dont you gather up your dog and whatever you think you need and come on down and stay at sweetwater for a while the instant wariness in her eyes made him smile weve got a dozen bedrooms or more so you dont have to stay in mine he flicked a finger down her nose unless youre ready to admit youre going to end up there sooner or later anyway i thank you for the graciousness of your offer but ill have to decline the faintest shadow of impatience flickered in his eyes caroline youve got plenty of chaperones and a good solid lock on every bedroom door if youre thinking ill try to sneak under your sheets im sure you would she said but with a laugh and dont flatter yourself by thinking im afraid i cant handle you i have to stay here im not proposing you move in permanently but it surprised him that the idea didnt give him the shivers just for a visit till austins where he belongs i have to stay here she said again tucker up until the last couple months ive never taken a stand on anything my whole life ive done what i was told gone where i was pointed and acted as i was expected to act tell me no not now she let out a long sigh maybe some other time but this is my home my place and im sticking my grandmother lived here her entire adult life my mother was born here though shed prefer you didnt mention it id like to think there was enough mcnair in me to last one summer she shook off the mood and smiled are you going to give me those flowers or let them wilt on the step he considered several valid arguments then let it go when people werent allowed to go their own way they were more likely to break than bend these all innocence he held up the roses the little plastic nipple of water each stem was tucked in kept them fresh did you want them she shrugged i wouldnt want them to go to waste me neither since i had to drive all the way over to rosedale to get them and that wine there had to borrow delias car to do it he added taking an indulgent sniff of the blooms and with delia nothing comes free you shouldve seen the list of chores she gave me dry cleaning and marketing and since shed gotten herself a flyer about a dollar sale at woolworths i had to fetch all that stuff too i drew the line at picking out a negligee for her sister sarahs girl whos engaged to be married and having a wedding shower next week a mans got to have his standards and i dont buy fancy underwear for women unless im intimately acquainted with them youre a man of substance tucker its a matter of principle he laid the roses over her lap where the slender cupped blossoms glowed like little points of sunlight i thought yellow ones suited you best theyre beautiful she inhaled the perfume sweet and strong i suppose ill have to thank you for them and for all the trouble you went through to get them for me you could kiss me instead id rather you did he smiled when her brow creased then tipped up his chin with a fingertip dont think about it caroline just do it its better than any pill for curing headaches so with the roses glowing between them she leaned over and touched her lips to his the taste was as sweet and as strong as the fragrance that floated over to her and she discovered as comforting a little dreamyeyed she started to draw back but he cupped a hand around the back of her neck you yankees he murmured always in a hurry he nudged her mouth back to his he was savoring she understood that even as her mind began to mist over with emotion she was aware of how slow how deep a kiss could be if you just let yourself fall into it with a little sigh she did just that even when she felt his fingers tense on her skin she didnt worry under the palm shed pressed to his chest his heart was beating fast and hard but the rhythm brought her pleasure rather than taut nerves and all the while his lips cruised over hers so that the kiss was like slipping into a cool blue lake dappled with sunlight it was he who drew back now he hadnt touched her but for those fingers that had grown strong at the back of her neck he hadnt touched her hadnt dared for he knew once he did he wouldnt be able to stop something here wasnt playing the tune he was used to difficult though it was to stop tucker knew hed better think this through i dont suppose youre going to ask me in no she said and let out a long breath not yet id better be getting back then after a quick internal tugofwar between stay and go he rose i promised cousin lulu a game of parcheesi she cheats he grinned but so do i and im quicker thanks for the flowers and the wine tucker stepped over the pup who was snoring at the base of the stairs since there was only three inches between delias olds and the bmw he had to get in through the passenger side and slide over after hed started the engine he rolled down the window you keep that wine chilled sugar ill be back as caroline watched him shoot backward down her lane she wondered why that brief cocky statement had sounded so much like a threat josie and crystal sat in their favorite booth in the chat n chew their excuse was dinner but since both of them were on a perpetual diet the reason was gossip josie poked at her chicken salad with little interest what she wanted was a thick steak and a side of nice greasy fries but she worried about her body she was past thirty now and watched vigilantly for any sags or droops or paunches her mama had kept a trim willowy figure up to the day shed dropped dead in her roses josie intended to do no less since the day shed realized her mama was different from her daddy josie had been in a subtle and constant competition it had made her feel guilty from time to time but she hadnt been able to resist the need to be as pretty as her mother then prettier to be as desirable to men then more desirable shed never been able to get a handle on her mothers quiet dignity had failed miserably in trying to emulate it in her first marriage so she had chosen to copy her fathers bold and bawdy talk instead she felt it suited her the stunning femmefatale looks and the earthy personality as a child shed fit the pieces of herself together now the puzzle of josie longstreet was linked tight while josie toyed with her chicken salad crystal made short work of her tunastuffed tomato crystal was chattering the whole time she forked the tuna into her mouth as she had all of her life josie turned the sound on and off she was fond of crystal had been since theyd made the solemn decision to be best friends back in first grade when theyd been two privileged little girls with no idea how radically their lives would diverge josie going one way debutante balls and that first proper marriage crystal going another after her lawyer father ran off to parts unknown with his secretary her path had been the work force and a bad marriage that had ended in divorce after a second miscarriage but they had remained friends whenever josie swept back into innocence she always spent time with crystal josie was sentimental enough to want a childhood friend in her adult life and she liked the way they complemented each other crystal was tiny and nicely rounded while josie herself was tall and slim crystal had white skin dashed with a sprinkle of freckles shed spent a fortune on every freckle remover on the market until shed finally accepted them as a personality trait shed learned to care for her skin in madame alexandras beauty school in lamont where shed graduated third in her class and had the certificate to prove it as a result she had the blooming complexion of a milkmaid which was the perfect foil for josies dusky gypsy looks her hair which she changed every few months as a kind of walking advertisement for her skills was currently clairols sparkling sherry which she wore in a viciously lacquered modified beehive crystal insisted they were coming back and then when bea was doing nancy koonss nails that justine started going on about how will told her the fbi figured out it was a black that killed edda lou and the others how they knew it cause of the way they were killed and how theyd found this pubic hair and all crystal dug into her tomato daintily tipping the tuna onto her fork with her pinky now i dont know if thats the way it was or not but i dont think it was right for her to be going on like that with bea whos black as the ace of spades sitting there filing nails i was real embarrassed josie but bea she just asks nancy if she wants ridge filler and keeps on filing josie sucked on her straw justines so besotted with will if he told her a frog shits gold nuggets shed be panning for them in little hope creek thats no excuse crystal said righteously i mean we all know it probably was a colored but you wont find me talking about it in front of bea why beas my best operator so i gave justines hair a jerk and when she squealed i said just as nice as you please oh honey did that hurt im awful sorry all that talk about murder and all just makes me so nervous good thing i didnt clip your earlobe while i was trimming a clipped ear bleeds worsen a stuck pig crystal smiled that shut her right up maybe ill talk will into driving me home tonight josie tossed back her mane of hair thatll give justine something to squeal about crystal gave one of her quick birdlike laughs oh josie youre such a one her eyes shifted as the diners door swung open poking out her lip she leaned closer to josie theres that darleen talbot coming in with her baby she sniffed and sucked her coke dry theres trash and theres trash i say josies gaze flicked up as darleen walked by to settle herself in a booth billy t bonny huh speaking of trash and crystal dearly loved to just like i told you i saw him saunter right on in darleens kitchen door not ten minutes after junior went out the front and all she was wearing was a little pink babydoll nightgown when she let him in i saw them clear through susie truesdales kitchen window there i was rinsing susies hair in the sink now that susie she keeps a spotless kitchen let me tell you even with all those kids if her youngest hadnt had a sick stomach shed have come on in the shop for her usual wash and style and i wouldnt have seen a thing what did susie say well her head was in the sink but when i was blowing her dry i mentioned it real casual like and i could see by the way she looked that she knew but she just said she never paid any mind to what went on next door so darleens cheating on junior with billy t josies lips curved around her straw her eyes took on that deep faraway glow that warned crystal something was up youre thinking josie i was doing just that crystal i was thinking that juniors got a sweet face even if he is a little bit dim and im real fond of him shoot crystal poked at the remains of her tomato far as i know hes about the only man in town between twenty and fifty youve never looked twice at i can be fond of a man without wanting to do it with him josie examined her straw there was a smear of red on the tip seems to me somebody ought to give him a little hint about whats happening in his own house when hes not around to see it i dont know josie i know and thats enough she dug in her bag for a pad and pen lets see now ill just write him a little note and you can get it to him me crystal squeaked then looked guiltily around how come i have to do it because everybody knows you stop at the station on your way home to buy yourself a milky way bar well sure but so when you go in josie continued busily writing all you have to do is distract junior while hes got the cash register open then you drop this on in and scoot out easy as pie you know i always get a rash under my arms when i get nervous crystal thought she could already feel her skin prickling two seconds and youre all done when she saw crystal wavering josie brought out the big guns i told you didnt i how darleen was saying that color you used on her hair turned brassy and she was going to save her money by doing it herself with miss clairol she said right out that it was a crime for you to charge seventeen fifty for a color job when all anyone had to do was pick up a box for five dollars and do it themselves that little bitch has no right talking that way to my customers crystal was fired up now why shes got hair like a brillo pad and if ive told her once ive told her a thousand times shes got to have a professional tend to it or else itll start falling right out of her head she sniffed hope it does josie smiled and waved the note in front of crystals nose glaring crystal snatched it just look at her crystal continued sitting there putting on lipstick while that baby smears ice cream all over itself casually josie turned her head she started to remark that darleen would look better herself smeared with a little cherry vanilla the glint of the gold case on the tube of lipstick stopped her now isnt that funny she murmured what nothing ill be right back crystal josie rose and trailing a finger over the back of the booths strolled up to darleen hey darleen this baby of yours sure is getting big hes eight months now surprised and flattered that josie had come over darleen set the lipstick aside to wipe ineffectually at scooters face with a paper napkin infuriated by the interruption he howled josie eyed the lipstick case while darleen and the baby fussed at each other it wasnt a mistake she thought no indeedy shed bought that lipstick in jackson at the elizabeth arden counter that gold case had caught her eye and that particular shade of red hers was missing too and had been since since the night shed gotten plowed in more ways than one in the embalming room of palmers with teddy rubenstein shed come home josie remembered and had dropped her purse getting out of the car everything had spilled out and the next day tucker had wrecked his car because somebodyd poked holes in some lines thats a pretty lipstick youve got there darleen looks good on you josies eyes had taken on a hard hunting edge but darleen heard only the compliment red lipsticks sexy i think a man likes to see a womans lips coming i like red myself and i never saw that shade before whered you get it oh darleen flushed a little but was flattered enough to pick up the case and turn it around in the light it was a present josies grin was fiercely jovial my i do love presents dont you she turned without waiting for an answer and strode out past a baffled crystal fifteen minutes later tucker who was resting after three hardfought games of parcheesi had his peace disturbed when josie shook him awake and poured out her story blinking against the last slants of sunlight he tried to get his mushy brain around it just slow down jose for chrissake im not even awake yet then wake up goddammit she gave him a shove that nearly tilted him out of the hammock im telling you billy t bonnys the one who messed with your car and i want to know what youre going to do about it youre telling me he used lipstick to poke holes in my hydraulic and brake lines no you peabrain she took a breath and went through the whole business again honey just because darleen had the same color lipstick as you tucker patience wasnt one of josies virtues and she punched him hard a woman knows her own lipstick when she sees it he rubbed his arm willing to concede the point you couldve dropped it anyplace i did not drop it anyplace i dropped it right over there in the drive i used it the night i went out with teddy and i didnt have it the next morning or my motherofpearl foldup mirror either fury flared in her eyes the bitchs probably got that too with a sigh tucker rose it wasnt likely hed be able to get in another nap he wasnt mad yet only because it all seemed a little farfetched where are you going ill go pass this along to burke josie slapped her hands on her hips daddyd have gone and stuck a rifle barrel up billy ts ass tucker turned and though his face remained calm his eyes werent im not daddy josie she was sorry immediately and rushed over to throw her arms around him honey that was awful of me i didnt mean it either it just makes me so mad thats all i know he gave her a squeeze let me handle it my own way he drew back to kiss her next time im in jackson ill buy you a new lipstick ruthless red you just go on in and relax now im going to take your car okay tuck when he turned back she was smiling again maybe juniorll shoot his nuts off chapter fifteen tucker tried the sheriffs office first but found only barb hopkins the parttime dispatcher at her little desk in the corner and her sixyearold mark who was playing jailbird in one of the two cells hey tuck barb whod put on about fifty pounds since shed graduated with tucker from jefferson davis high shifted her girth and put down the paperback novel shed been reading her round jolly face creased into smiles we got ourselves some excitement round here dont we looks like tucker had always had a fondness for barb whod married lou hopkins at nineteen and had proceeded to give birth to a boy child every two years thereafter until mark arrived at which point shed told lou he could either get his dick clipped or take up residence on the sofabed wheres the rest of your brood barb oh theyre running around town raising hell he paused by the cell to look in on the grimyfaced towheaded mark so whatcha in for boy i kilt em mark grinned evilly and shook the bars i kilt em all but there aint no jail can hold me ill bet we got ourselves a dangerous criminal here barb dont i know it i come down this morning and hed done turned up the heater on the aquarium and fried every living guppy in there i got a psychopathic fishmurderer on my hands she dug into the bag of cheese balls on the desk and munched so what can i do for you tuck looking for burke he deputized a few of the boys then he and carl took them out to look for austin hatinger county sheriff come down too in his copter we got ourselves a regular manhunt wasnt so much him taking a few shots at you and blowing out that caroline waverlys windows barb said complacently but he dented that county deputys head pretty good and embarrassed the shit out of the other one now austins an escaped felon hes in big trouble the fbi oh special agent suitandtie well hes leaving this business pretty much up to the local boys went out with them for forms sake but he was more interested in his interviews she took another handful of cheese balls i happened to see one of them lists he makes looked like he wanted to talk to vernon hatinger toby march darleen talbot and nancy koons barb licked salt off her fingers you too tuck yeah i figured hed get around to me again can you call burke up on that thing he pointed to her radio find out where he is and if hes got a minute for me sure can they took walkietalkies obligingly barb wiped her orangesmeared fingers fiddled with some dials cleared her throat then clicked on her mike this is base calling unit one base calling unit one over she put her hand over the mike and grinned at tuck that jed larsson said how we should use code names like silver fox and big bear aint he a one with a shake of her head she leaned down to the mike again base calling unit one burke honey yall out there unit one base sorry barb had my hands full over i got tucker here in the office burke says he needs to talk to you well put him on then tucker bent down to the mike burke i got something i need to run by you can i come on out there was a sharp whine of feedback a protesting oath and a scratching of static im pretty tied up right now tuck but you can ride on down to where dog street road runs off into lone tree we got a roadblock set up there over ill be right along he looked doubtfully at the mike ah over and out barb grinned at him if i was you id keep a shotgun across my lap austin got himself two police specials this morning yeah thanks barb as tucker walked out mark rattled his cage and shouted gleefully i kilt em i kilt em all tucker shuddered he wasnt thinking about fish he spotted two copters circling on his way out of town a trio of men spread out like a long v over old stokeys field another group was making a sweep of charlie oharas catfish farm every one of them was armed it reminded tucker miserably of the search for francie before he could prevent it her dead white face floated into his mind on an oath he fumbled for a cassette it was with relief that he realized he hadnt punched in tammy wynette or loretta lynn two of josies favorites but roy orbison the plaintive silvery notes of crying calmed him they werent out looking for a body he assured himself they were just hunting up an idiot an idiot with a pair ofs on the long straight road he could see the barricade five miles before he came to it it occurred to him that if austin came tooling down this way in birdies buick hed have the same advantage the wooden blockades were painted bright orange and glowed in the quieting sunlight behind them two county cruisers sat nose to nose like two big blackandwhite dogs sniffing each other ranged along the shoulder of the road were jed larssons shiny new dodge pickup between the store and the catfish jed was doing real well sonny talbots truck with its big round lights hooked to the roof like a pair of yellow eyes burkes cruiser and lou hopkinss chevy van lous van was dusty as an old hound someone had scrawled wash me through the grime on the rear window as tucker slowed he noted that two county boys stepped forward rifles oiled and ready though he didnt think theyd shoot first and ask questions later he was grateful when burke waved them off you got yourself a real operation here dont you tucker commented as he stepped out county sheriffs spitting fire burke muttered he didnt like it that the fbi was around to see this screwup he thinks austins halfway to mexico by now but he doesnt want to say so tucker took out his cigarettes offered one to burke then lighted one of his own what do you think burke blew out a long slow stream of smoke it had been a hellishly long day and he was glad to talk to tucker seems to me if a man knew the swamps and rivers around here he could lay low for a good long time specially if he had a reason to he eyed tucker were going to post a couple of uniforms at sweetwater shit on that gotta do it tuck come on now he dropped a hand on tuckers shoulder you got women out there tucker looked across to where the long flat gave way to trees and trees to swamp what a fucking mess it is that something in burkes voice had tucker looking back at him what else is on your mind aint this enough ive known you too long son burke glanced behind him then edged a few more feet away from the county deputies bobby lee came by the house last night now theres news burke looked miserably at tucker he wants to marry marvella got his gumption up and asked to speak to me in private we went on out on the back porch shit tuck it scared me bloodless i was afraid he was going to tell me hed gotten her pregnant then idve had to kill him or something he saw tuckers grin and answered it weakly yeah i know i know but its different when its your little girl anyway he blew in smoke chuffed it out he didnt get her pregnant i guess kidsre smarter today about being protected and all i remember driving clear into greenville to buy rubbers when i was courting susie his grin was a little stronger then when we got into the backseat of my daddys chevy i left them in my pocket the grin faded of course if id have remembered them we wouldnt have had marvella what did you tell him burke shit what could i tell him he rested a hand absently on the butt of his gun shes grown up on me she wants him and thats that hes got a decent job at talbots and hes a good boy hes crazy in love with her and ive gotta figure hell do right but it damn near breaks my heart howd susie take it cried buckets on a sigh burke tossed down the cigarette and stamped it out and when marvella started in on how they were thinking of moving to jackson i thought shed flood the house then she and marvella cried together awhile when they dried up they started talking about bridesmaids dresses i left them to it getting old sucks huh thats the truth but he felt better having gotten it off his chest keep it under your hat for a bit theyre going to break it to the fullers this evening you got room in your head for something else itd be a pure pleasure to push this out for a while tucker leaned back against the hood of josies car and told a tale of lipstick and adultery darleen and billy t burke frowned as he thought it through i havent gotten wind of that ask susie burke sighed and nodded that woman can keep a secret god knows she was three months gone with tommy before she told me worried id be upset because we were just scraping by with marvella being in love with darleens brother i can see how shed keep it to herself thinking he jingled his keys the thing is tucker i cant go up to billy t about all this just because darleens using the same kind of lipstick as josie i know youve got a lot going on burke just figured i should pass it along burke gave a grunt of assent they would lose the light soon and god knew where austin had gone to ground ill talk to susie tonight if it turns out billy ts been seeing darleen on the sly ill make some time to feel him out appreciate it but now that his duty was done tucker figured he would do some feeling out of his own the next morning strung out after barely five hours sleep burke was spooning up corn flakes worrying about having an armed escapee in his territory theyd found the buick ditched out on cottonseed road and nobody was thinking austin was in mexico now on top of that there was the issue of whether hed have to rent a tuxedo to give his daughter away susie was already on the phone with happy fuller and the two of them were mapping out wedding plans with the intensity and guile of generals mounting a major campaign he was wondering how long the county sheriff would be on his back when the screams and crashes from next door had him jumping to his feet holy christ he thought how could he have forgotten about the talbots by the time susie came rushing in burke was already clearing the fence that separated the yards youve killed him youve killed him darleen screamed she was backed into a corner of the small jumbled kitchen pulling her hair the elastic bodice of her shortie nightgown was drawn down cupped beneath one white jiggling breast burke looked politely away from that to the overturned table the splattered remains of soggy cereal and the prone figure of billy t bonny who lay facedown in a pool of grits burke shook his head and looked at junior talbot standing over billy t with a castiron skillet in his hand i sure hope you didnt kill him junior dont figure i did junior put the skillet down calmly enough only whacked him once well lets take a look burke bent down while darleen continued to scream and yank at her hair in the playpen scooter was raising the roof just knocked him cold burke said taking in the sizable lump coming up on the back of billy ts head should probably get him over to docs though ill help you haul him still crouched burke glanced up you want to tell me what went on here junior well junior righted a chair seems i forgot to tell darleen something when i came on back i saw that billy t there had snuck into the kitchen and was forcing himself on my wife he shot darleen a look that shut off her wailing like a finger on a switch aint that right darleen i she sniffled and her eyes darted from burke to billy t and back to junior thats right i he was on me so quick i didnt know what to do then junior came back and you go on and see to the baby junior said quietly he reached over with that same unruffled calm and pulled the pink rayon over her breast you dont have to worry about billy t bothering you again she swallowed and her head bobbed twice yes junior she rushed out and in a moment the babys wails turned to hiccoughing sobs junior looked back at billy t he was beginning to stir a little a man has to protect whats his dont he sheriff burke hooked his arms under billy ts i expect he does junior lets haul him out to my car cy was happy it shamed him a little to be so happy when his sister had just been put in the ground and the whole town was whispering about his father but he couldnt help it it was almost enough just to be out of the house where his mother was sprawled glassyeyed with whatever pills doc had given her watching the today show but it was better than just getting out of the house better than walking away from the police car that sat in the yard waiting to see if his daddy would try to come home cy was going to work and he was going in style his shoes kicked up dust and his lips whistled a tune the prospect of walking and biking ten miles didnt daunt him in the least he was embarking on the cy hatinger freedom fund the fund that was going to buy his way out of innocence on his eighteenth birthday the four years stretched painfully long but not as hopeless as they had been before hed become a man of all work he like the title and imagined himself with one of those business cards like that bible salesman from vicksburg had given his mother last april it would read cyrus hatinger man of all work no job too big no job too small yessir he was on his way by the time he was eighteen hed have saved enough to buy himself a ticket to jackson maybe even new orleans shitfire he could go clean to california if hed a mind to humming california here i come he veered off the hardpack to cross the edge of toby marchs east field he wondered if jim would be over at miss waverlys painting and if hed have time to scoot by and say hey he crossed little hope stream which was hardly more than a piss trickle at this time of year and followed it down to the culvert he remembered how he and jim had scrawled their names on the rounded concrete in crayolas and how in more recent times theyd pored over every page of a playboy magazine cy had swiped from under his brother ajs mattress those pictures had been something he remembered and for cy who had never seen a naked female it had been an aweinspiring experience his pecker had gotten hard as a rock and that night the old tool of satan had cut loose in his first and fascinating wet dream and hadnt his mama been surprised when hed done the laundry for her grinning a little over the memory and wondering if hed have the experience again anytime soon he slid down the gentle bank of little hope and headed into the culvert a hand slapped over his mouth cutting off his cheerful whistle he didnt try to scream or struggle he knew that hand the shape the texture even the smell of it his fear was much too deep much too hopeless for screams i found your little hole austin whispered your den of sin with your filthy book and your nigger writing you boys come down here to jerk each other off cy could only shake his head he grunted when austin shoved him against the hard rounded wall of the culvert he expected the belt to flash but even as he braced he saw his father wasnt wearing one they take away your belt when they put you in jail he remembered take it away so you cant hang yourself he swallowed his father was crouched over because the culvert was too low to allow him to rise to his full height but the position didnt diminish him if anything it made him seem larger stronger with his back rounded his legs bent and spread his face and hands blackened with dirt he looked like something horrible waiting to pounce cy swallowed again his throat clicking theyre looking for you daddy i know theyre looking for me they aint found me have they no sir you know why boy its because i got god on my side those christless bastardsll never find me what we got heres a holy war he smiled and cy felt ice flow into his belly they put me in jail and they left that murdering son of a whore free she was a whore whore of babylon he said softly selling herself when she was mine cy didnt know what he was talking about but nodded yes sir theyll be punished they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity his hands began to clench and unclench slowly all of them down to the last generation his eyes cleared and focused on cy again whered you get that bike boy he started to claim it was jims but with his fathers eyes on him feared the lie might burn his tongue off its just loaned to me is all he began to shake knowing there was no choice i got me a job i got work down at sweetwater austins eyes went blank as he took a shuffling step forward clench unclench went his big blackened hands you went to that place that vipers den cy knew there were worse things than belts there were fists tears sprang to his eyes i wont go back daddy i swear i only thought a hand closed over his throat cutting off words and air even my son betrays me flesh of my flesh bone of my bone he tossed cy aside like a limp sock the boys elbows banged painfully on the concrete but he didnt cry out for a long time there was only the sound of breathing you will go back austin said at length youll go back and youll watch youll tell me what he does which room he sleeps in youll tell me everything you see and hear cy swiped at his eyes yes sir and youll get me food food and water you bring it here every morning every night he was smiling again when he hunkered down by his son his breath was bad foul as a grave the light seeped through the opening of the culvert hit his irises and turned them almost white you dont tell your ma you dont tell vernon you dont tell nobody yes sir cys head bobbed in desperate agreement but vernon hed help you daddy he could get your truck and austin slapped a hand across cys mouth i said nobody theyll be watching vernon watching him day and night because they know hell stand by me but you they wont pay no mind to you just remember ill be watching you sometimes ill be here waiting sometimes i wont but ill always be watching you understand me ill always be watching you and listening the lord will let me see let me hear if you make a mistake his wrath will smite you down cleave you in two with one mighty blow ill bring it cys teeth chattered over the words i promise ill bring it he laid his brutal hands on the boys shoulders you tell anyone you seen me and even god himself wont save you it took cy almost an hour to bike to sweetwater a quarter of the way there he had to stop and toss up his breakfast when he was empty he rinsed off his clammy face with the stingy water of the little hope because his legs were shaking he had to ride slow or risk a spill every few minutes he looked uneasily over his shoulder almost certain he would see his father behind him smiling that smile and snapping the belt theyd taken away from him at the county jail when he got to sweetwater he saw tucker was on the side terrace going through the morning mail cy parked the bike with deliberate movements morning cy mr tucker his voice sounded rusty and he coughed to clear it im sorry about being late i was youre calling your own hours cy tucker glanced absently at a stock report and set it aside we got no time clock here yes sir if youll tell me where to start ill get right on it dont rush me tucker said pleasantly and tossed a scrap of bacon to the everhopeful buster had breakfast cy thought about what hed lost on the side of the road his stomach twisted evilly yes sir then you can come on up here while i finish mine then well see whats to do reluctantly cy climbed the three rounded stairs that led to the terrace buster looked up thumped his tail once in reflex then burped hes thrilled to have company tucker said dryly he tossed one of josies catalogues aside and smiled up at the boy since youre so allfired what the helld you do to yourself sir panic shot into his voice i didnt do nothing hell boy your elbows are all scraped to shit he took cys arm turned it blood was still seeping slowly and there was a scattering of nastylooking grit in the cuts i just took a spill is all tuckers eyes narrowed did vernon do it hed had a few scrapes with vernon himself and was well aware the man wouldnt think anything of laying into the boy like father like son no sir cy felt a rush of relief that at least he could tell the truth i swear vernon didnt touch me he gets mad sometimes but i can stay out of his way until he forgets about it its not like daddy he broke off flushing in mortification it wasnt vernon i just took a spill is all tuckers brow had lifted during the babbling explanation there was no use pressing the boy or adding to his embarrassment by making him admit his father and brother used him for a punching bag well slow down you go on in tell delia to clean you up i dont boy tucker leaned back one of the privileges of being an employer is to give orders you go on in get cleaned up and take a coke out of the refrigerator when you come back ill have figured out how youre earning your keep today yes sir flooded with guilt cy rose he walked into the house with a heavy heart tucker frowned after him the boy looked like hell and that was the truth but who could blame him tucker tossed another scrap of bacon to the dog and figured hed keep cy busy enough to ease his mind by the time the sun was blazing toward noon tucker had cy occupied on the lawn tractor word of the talbot affair had already raced through town and thanks to delias hotline to earleen had reached sweetwater while billy ts bandages were still fresh like good handdipped ice cream the story came in several varieties and was consumed with relish but with the connection between darleen and billy t confirmed tucker was interested in only one story junior had found his wife wrapped around billy t bonny on the kitchen table billy t had ended up with a goose egg on the back of his head and no charges were being filed on either side until something came along to nudge it aside it would be innocences hot news item he took the afternoon to think it through then had a piece of delias banana cream pie and thought some more it was after all a matter of principle a man could walk away from a lot of things but he didnt get far walking away from his principles he bribed delia for the use of her car with the promise of a new pair of earrings and a full tank of gas he drove past carolines lane wondering if he could talk her into a movie that night haifa mile down where old cypress road crossed longstreet he parked to get from town to his house or from his house to town billy t would have to drive by that spot as far as tucker knew billy t hadnt missed an evening at mcgreedys since he could hold a pool cue tucker pulled out a cigarette and settled in to wait he was sitting on the hood of delias car thinking about lighting a second one when he saw caroline being pulled along by the puppy on a red leash she nearly stopped her forward progress and her fruitless attempts to teach the pup to heel because she thought she caught a flash of annoyance in tuckers eyes then he was smiling honey he called out wheres that dog taking you were going for a walk she was panting a bit by the time she reached the car tail wriggling useless leapt up to nip at tuckers ankles this aint the city he leaned over enough to scratch the dogs head as useless hopped on his hind legs around here you just turn em loose in the yard im trying to teach him to mind the leash to show the futility of that useless swiveled around and gnawed at it he seems to mind it plenty he smiled you look tired caro rough night well the puppy cried a lot and even when hed settled shed had a hard time sleeping thinking that austin hatinger might come rapping at her door cardboard box and a windup alarm clock i beg your pardon hes missing his mama you put him in a box maybe with that cushion you bought and tuck an alarm clock in with him its like a heartbeat lulls them off to sleep oh she thought it over and decided not to mention that hed lulled off just fine when shed cuddled him into bed with her ill have to give that a try what are you doing standing on the side of the road im sitting he corrected her just passing the time its an odd place to pass it they havent caught hatinger yet have they not so ive heard tucker susie was by earlier and she mentioned vernon hatinger she said he was as bad as his father idly tucker snapped his fingers to entertain useless more like hes working up to it id say she said he was always looking to pick a fight and picked a few with me tucker interrupted reminiscing kicked my ass im sorry to say then dwayne kicked his he grinned remembering how dwayne had been before the bottle had taken such a choke hold i never could seem to put on muscle as a boy even working in the field i ended up with toothpick arms but dwayne he hulked right up used those arms to quarterback on the football team and set all the girls to swooning after him after vernon tried to pound some righteousness into my face dwayne pounded some sin into his he let out a long satisfied breath sin sure as hell won that day im sure thats a touching story of male bonding but my point is you dont have just austin to worry about but vernon as well there isnt much point worrying about either one of them why she burst out because your big brother will beat them up for you these days hes too busy beating up himself he cast a look down old cypress road and saw the telltale plume of gravel dust and the gleam of billy ts soupedup thunderbird it might be best if you walked on back put this out of your mind maybe ill stop in later and see how that paintings going what is it shed seen that look in his eyes before when hed been sprawled on top of her while glass was shattering when hed asked her if she had a gun this man wouldnt need his big brother or anyone else to fight his battles she heard the roar of billy ts glasspacks and turned what is it tucker nothing to concern you go on home caroline he slid off the hood just as billy t screamed to a stop she gathered up the puppy and stood her ground hey fucker i mean tucker billy t grinned around a toothpick at his own witticism he wasnt in a sunny mood his head still ached and his pride had suffered a more serious blow than his skull he was in a kickass frame of mind billy t hands snug in his pockets tucker strolled across the road heard you had a little incident this morning his eyes slitted what the fucks it to you just making conversation you know as it happens i was just sitting here waiting for you to come along that so yeah out of the corner of his eye tucker saw that caroline had crossed the road as well though she stood several feet back it annoyed the hell out of him a little something id like to clear up if youve got the time before billy t realized the intention tucker had reached in and snatched the keys from the ignition people often forgot he could move faster than a crawl or if you dont tucker added complacently shit for brains billy t shoved the door open i guess youre hoping for another black eye well well talk about that caroline if you come a step closer im going to be mighty unhappy with you billy t slanted caroline a leer letting his gaze crawl up her legs slide over her belly and breasts leave her be tuck maybe after ive finished smearing you over the road shed like to come on and have a peer with a real man that brought her chin up the only thing i see out here are a couple of sulky schoolboys tucker i dont know whats gotten into you but id like you to drive me home right now billy t grinned and flipped away the toothpick got you pussywhipped already getting your plookie regular tuck outraged caroline stepped forward only to be brought up short by the arm tucker shot out now thats no way to talk about a lady billy t but well get to that in a minute i figured we should have a word about my car heard your car was down in jackson getting the pleats ironed out of it you heard correctly you and me we never got along too well and i dont figure well get along in the future but i just cant let what you did to my car go by billy t snorted and spat way i heard it you wrecked that car yeah after you snuck into sweetwater like a polecat and diddled with it tucker knew billy ts brain wasnt his strong point and lied with clear eyes darleen let on how you poked those holes in the lines guess that wasnt very loyal of her after you gave her josies lipstick shes nothing but a lying slut that may be but i reckon shes telling the truth about this billy t swung back the hair that fell across his forehead and what if she is you cant prove it his lips stretched over his teeth in a sneer i can stand right here and tell you that i done it i walked right down your fancy lane and poked holes in your fancy car darleen was feeling blue about your breaking edda lous heart so i did it to make her feel better and because i hate your everfucking guts but you aint going to prove it as if considering tucker took out a cigarette you may have a point there but that doesnt mean youre going to get off clean he broke off the tip of the cigarette lighted it caroline took a step back she recognized that tone and that look it occurred to me that maybe somebody in my family might have taken my car out that morning maybe one of them who doesnt handle the wheel as well as i do you know billy t that just pisses me off you want to do something about it tucker studied the tip of his cigarette i guess i do i gotta say i dont care for the idea of getting my face pounded on again you always was a chickenshit grinning billy t spread his arms go ahead take your best shot well since you put it that way tucker kicked him squarely in the crotch billy t doubled over and a sound escaped him like air coming out of a pressure cooker still clutching himself he went down on the side of the road when tucker crouched down and took a firm hold on his bruised genitals billy ts eyes rolled back in his head dont pass out boy not until i finish what ive got to say you may start thinking again once your nuts slide down from your throat and i want you to think about this listening ga was about the only sound billy t could make good you know who holds the note on your familys land payments been late three months running id sure feel bad if i had to foreclose and that cotton gin where you occasionally find the time to put in a few hours a week by coincidence it so happens i own that too now you want to have a reprisal against me i guess i cant stop you but youll lose your land and your job and as god is my witness ill do my best to turn you into a soprano while im at it he bore down with his fingers to make his point all billy t could do was moan and roll into a ball i was mighty fond of that car tucker said with a sigh and as it turns out im fond of this lady here that you insulted so dont mess with me again billy t im not a skinny tenyearold anymore leave me alone billy t managed to get out you broke something you broke my works dont worry theyll bounce back thats why they call them balls when he rose tucker noticed that caroline had dropped the pup who was now relieving himself on billy ts shoes he grinned but gathered the dog up now thats adding insult to injury he turned to where caroline was standing on the edge of the road mouth agape eyes wide tucker hitched the pup under his arm come on sugar ill give you that ride home now youre just going to leave him there she craned her neck as tucker pulled her to the oldsmobile thats the plan i was thinking we could go take in a movie tonight a movie she said blankly tucker i just stood there and watched you kick that man in the we call them privates in polite company scoot on over unless you want to drive rubbing a hand to her temple she did but thats fighting dirty isnt it all fightings dirty caroline which is why i dearly love to avoid it he leaned over to give her a quick kiss before starting the engine in an absent move he tossed billy ts keys across the road now about that movie caroline let out a long breath whats playing chapter sixteen perhaps youd like a glass of water mrs talbot darleen looked at agent burns through redrimmed swollen eyes ruthlessly outlined with maybelline yes sir she said meekly in the last fortyeight hours shed learned a whole lot about meek id be obliged all solicitude burns rose to go into the bathroom and pour tepid tap water into a paper cup he considered himself an expert interviewer had even instructed a course on the subject as he would have told his class at the fbi academy the first rule of a good interview is to know your subject burns figured he had darleen talbots number sympathy flattery and kindly authority those were the watchwords here burns estimated thirty minutes for the interview including a fourminute prologue to gain darleens confidence along with the paper cup he offered darleen a kindly smile i appreciate your making the time to come in and talk with me this morning mrs talbot cautiously she brought the cup to her unpainted lips shed lost her affection for red lipstick junior said i had to well i know its difficult for a young mother to find the time out of a demanding schedule where is your little one today burns crossed ask about family off his mental checklist mas watching scooter she likes to sit with him as her eyes darted around the room lighting on anything but special agent matthew burns she fiddled with the collar of her flowered blouse hes her only grandson you know my two sisters both have girls a handsome boy too burns said though he didnt know if hed ever laid eyes on the youngest talbot he is pretty his hairs as curly as a little lamb a ghost of a smile brightened her eyes she figured accurately that the only reason junior hadnt tossed her out of the house was his attachment to his son hes quick too hes like greased lightning on his hands and knees i dont know how ill keep up with him once he starts toddling im sure he keeps you on your toes more relaxed darleen set the cup aside why the fbi man wasnt so bad she decided people just didnt know him do you have young uns no i dont nor did the fastidious burns intend to ever im afraid my work keeps me away from home quite a bit looking for criminals exactly he beamed at her as if shed just answered a very complex question and its concerned responsible citizens like yourself who make my job easier still smiling he took out his mini recorder this helps me remember accurately darleen eyed the recorder with distrust she began to twist her hands in her lap shouldnt i have a lawyer or something why certainly if you wish burns sat down behind burkes cluttered desk but i assure you it isnt necessary for this kind of informal chat i just need a little background information from you on your friend edda lou hatinger he stretched out an avuncular hand to hers i know this is difficult for you darleen may i call you darleen why he was just as polite as a waiter in a fancy restaurant though the comparison would have caused burns to cringe it made darleen respond favorably thatll be just fine losing a friend is always painful but in such a tragic way he trailed off letting his silence offer comfort ill try not to upset you it wasnt difficult or even painful so much as terribly exciting but she pulled out a ragged tissue and dabbed her eyes talking about it just tears me in two but i want to help she added bravely she was my dearest friend i know pleased burns switched on the recorder special agent matthew burns interview with darleen talbot re edda lou hatinger june twentyfive now then darleen why dont you tell me something about edda lou darleen blew her nose loudly enough to make burns wince she was my dearest friend she repeated we went to school together and she was my maid of honor i guess she was like a sister to me and like sisters i suppose the two of you exchanged confidences we never had secrets from each other my own blood sisters belle and starita why i could never talk to them the way i could to edda lou another tear squeezed out and she caught it with her knuckle and im sure she felt equally sympatico with you darleen frowned over the word i expect i can see that youre an understanding openhearted woman no doubt edda lou depended on you the image had her preening a bit she did tend to lean on me i never minded with you being a married woman im sure edda lou came to you for advice advice about the men in her life advice hell darleen thought edda lou had liked to brag but darleen didnt think she should say so we talked a lot i guess we talked on the phone every single day and at the time of her death was edda lou involved with anyone in particular well sure everybody knew she was all wrapped up in tucker longstreet she couldve had lots of other boyfriends edda lou kept herself up real nice you know she studied pictures in magazines for hairdos and makeup tricks and all and she wouldnt step out of her room without doing her face up just so but shed set her sights on tucker once she hooked him i was going to i mean to say once theyd set a date i was going to be her matron of honor we went to greenville and picked out dresses and everything and wasnt it a shame shed never have a chance to wear that pretty pink organdy gown with the puffy sleeves and the big bow with encouraging nods burns made neat notations on a legal pad mr longstreet and edda lou were to be married darleen licked her lips and stared at the recorder she was torn between loyalty and truth with truth standing in for selfpreservation her episode with junior had her inching back edda lou had her mind set on it and mr longstreet well shedve brought him around edda lou wasnt one to let loose once she got her teeth in something so you believe she would have convinced mr longstreet to propose i guess you could put it like that pressured him burns was still smiling benignly could she have known about some weakness some problem that would have convinced him to lets say come up to scratch darleen thought about that awhile then to burnss disappointment shook her head no tuckers not one for problems he just shakes them off thing is i tried to tell edda lou the reason he cut things off with her was because she was getting too pushy men dont like to be shoved into marriage darken drew from her vast scope of marital bliss you take my junior i just waited around real calm and ladylike for him to scrape up the courage to ask me if idve been the one to bring up marriage hedve been off like a shot men just naturally resist the idea of settling and thats what i told her darleen said with a knowing nod but she wouldnt listen stubborn that way and she was dead set to live at sweetwater i mean to be with tucker she corrected herself edda lou was wild for him im sure her feelings ran very deep burns murmured and darleen smiled through the sarcasm she and mr longstreet had an altercation the day she died edda lou came to see me right after darleen wiggled more comfortably in her chair it was just like perry mason she thought she was spitting fire too you see tuckerd broke things off with her and shed figured on laying back a few weeks until he couldnt stand being without her anymore thats just how she put it she figured with the sex being so good and all hed come sniffing back round quick enough she caught herself and flushed what i mean to say is she knew he loved her face expressionless burns nodded i understand completely she was starting to get a bit itchy and then tucker starts seeing chrissy fuller her being divorced now and all well edda lou wasnt going to put up with that not for a new york minute she tracked tuck down at the chat n chew and told him what was what and claimed that she was pregnant darleen pressed her lips together and stared down at her shoes i reckon she made a mistake about that she was that upset you see because tucker was maybe going to slip away is that what she told you when she came to see you that afternoon she was that upset darleen began to twist her fingers together a womans bound to say things when shes got a broken heart she was storming up and down my front room said he wasnt going to toss her away like used goods he wasnt going to do to her what his daddy had done to her daddy excuse me darleen perked up it was always rewarding to be the first to pass along gossip even if the gossip was more than thirty years cold years ago edda lous daddy had been courting miss madeline tuckers mama or well he wasnt courting exactly as people say who remember but he wanted to he really was set on marrying miss madeline even though her daddy was a state senator and all and he was just a dirt farmer edda lou used to say it was like a cinderella story in reverse but the thing was that miss madeline was crazy for beau longstreet the more in love she was with mr beau the more austin hatinger wanted her he never had much use for the longstreets so burns interrupted with some hope of making a long story short theres been bad blood between the families for some time real bad he and mr beau almost took each other apart at a church social my daddy was one of the ones that pulled them apart and he tells the story now and then burns cleared his throat thats very interesting darleen but what im trying to say is because of all that the way her father saw beau as taking what was his edda lou thought she deserved sweetwater and she went after tuck cause well hes real goodlookin and he aint stingy with his pennies like his daddy was but mostly i guess she liked the ideal of riling her pa so she was pretty hot about him tucker i mean telling her right there in public that he didnt want her so she says to me hes going to eat those words darleen you wait and see did she happen to tell you how she was going to make him eat them she was going to get him alone somewhere and let nature take its course darleen sent burns a coy wink she took real good care of herself edda lou did kept herself up and knew how to dress so men would look twice any men in particular before tucker she kinda played the field had john thomas bonny stuck on her last winter and before that judson ohara and will shiver and there was ben koons too though he was a married man and she never took him seriously burns noted down the names in meticulous block printing with a woman as attractive as edda lou there might have been a man who remained stuck on her after shed committed herself to mr longstreet oh edda lou liked to brag that men didnt get over her in the wink of an eye she couldve had any of them i see what about toby march oh darleen picked up the paper cup and drank the rest of the water well yes there is nothing to that mr burns no indeed edda lou like to tease some that was just her way she teased mr march it was just a little game darleen brought her thumb to her mouth and began to gnaw on the nail edda lou wouldnt be interested in a black man curious maybe and she was curious about mr march it was just to hit back at her daddy hed walloped toby some years ago gave him that scar and edda lous brother cy he was friends with tobys boy austin hatinger raised holy hell about that so edda lou just liked to flirt with toby because hed get all stiff and flustered did she have an affair with him i cant say darleen chewed the nail down to the nub it wasnt nothing serious she was just teasing but it might have been serious for a black man burns thought a married black in a small southern town where some lines were deadly to cross when did she tease him darleen oh mostly after tucker cut her off thats when toby was doing work at the boardinghouse but she wouldnt have done anything really why her daddy would have killed her hed have strung toby up and hed have skinned edda lou alive if he didnt get to it himself vernon would have done it for him edda lou and vernon didnt have any use for each other but vernon couldnt have held his head up if it got around that edda loud you know with one of tobys kind burns smiled that gave him three more suspects three more motives thank you darken youve been a big help while toby and young jim hammered away at the braces on her back porch caroline took aim at a chickenandrice soup can and missed sight a little more to the right susie advised you jerk toward the left whenever you pull the trigger i dont know why im doing this its comforting hold your breath this time right before you nudge the trigger susie pursed her lips when caroline fired again missed again youll do better once you learn to keep both eyes open but id give this years fourth of july contest a pass im going to hit one just one before i move from this spot maybe itd help if you thought of that luis again nope ive just about gotten that out of my system well hell here ive been hoping youd have a weak moment and tell me all the gory details more clichéd than gory i caught him with another woman oh susie pursed her lips and thought about it do you mean caught him with or caught him with capitalc caught she steadied her hand and took aim i walked in on him while a bigbusted flute player was giving him an oil change my my did you cut off his dipstick the gun wavered as caroline laughed no im afraid this took place during my wimp period you seem to be over it now the wimp period or luis i am pretty much she missed again swore and buckled down dammit im going to hit one its just a matter of practice nobody knows more about practice than a musician she lifted the gun sighted in im going to make that goddamn can sing she clipped the side and while it didnt precisely sing the quick bang was enough to satisfy her nice going deadeye susie gave her a congratulatory pat on the back why dont you take a break why dont i caroline meticulously unloaded unlike susie she was less than comfortable carrying a loaded gun i did better than yesterday it took over two hours for me to hit one of those stupid cans today it took she checked her watch only an hour fortyfive for lack of a better place she dumped the spare ammo in her pocket want a drink i thought youd never ask they started back toward the house youre keeping toby and jim busy i like the new blue paint really freshens the place up theyre going to do the porches too in white can we get through here toby sure just mind your step afternoon mrs truesdale hey toby when youre done here why dont you come on by and shame burke into fixing my side door it still sticks he grinned wiping his face with his bandanna the dirt from under the porch clung to his skin settled wetly into the creases now i told him what needed to be done there musta been six months ago he tells me hes getting around to it she stepped around the toolbox i guess hes got a lot on his mind tobys smile faded yesm jim you hold that board steady now he kept his eyes on his hands as caroline ushered susie into the kitchen well now theres that little pup ive heard so much about susie crouched down to where useless was huddled under one of the kitchen chairs a position hed assumed since the first shot was fired yeah my fierce guard dog caroline watched as he trembled and whined and licked at susies hand i must have been crazy no just softhearted thanks she stood accepting the glass of iced tea caroline offered ive been meaning to stop on out before its been real hectic since marvella got engaged i heard about that noting the look in susies eyes caroline searched through the cupboards for something high in sugar and low in nutrition she settled on the cupcakes shed bought to treat jim at lunch here have some chocolate and preservatives thanks susie sniffled and tore at the cellophane i swear ive been as bad as a leaky faucet ever since it happened i just think about it and off i go she bit into the cupcake i knew it was coming of course theyve been mooning around each other for two years when they werent mooning they were scrapping and thats a sure sign but shes your little girl yeah susie swiped at a tear my baby my first baby im okay when i get caught up in the wedding plans but if i just sit and think about it i start dripping caroline eyed the second cupcake and decided she deserved it have they set a date september marvellas always been partial to chrysanthemums she wants the church full of them and her five bridesmaids in fallcolored dresses shes got her own ideas all right russet and gold she says firing up susie licked crumbs from her fingers now i say russets like red and seems inappropriate for a church wedding but shes set wont even talk about pastels susie caught carolines look and grinned i know i know colors arent so important as why its just easier for me to think about them and the music and if were going to have the reception outside at the house or if we should rent out the moose hall she gave a slow sigh burke and i had a justice of the peace wedding im sure between you and marvella everythings going to be beautiful id feel better if i could talk her into rose instead of russet she polished off the cupcake were going down to jackson this weekend to shop youre welcome to come along if youd like i appreciate that but i dont have anything to shop for when a woman needs an excuse to shop she must have something on her mind caroline licked some of the sticky white filling off her fingers i guess i do i guess we all do burkes hardly been home to do more than fall into bed for a couple of hours since austin took off she tilted her head honey youre not worried that hes going to come back here and bother you i dont know restless caroline rose i cant quite dismiss it though there isnt a reasonable motive for him to do so she looked out the window and her eyes were drawn to the line of trees and the memory of what lay beyond them its more susie i suppose it feels like everything else has been covered up by this search for austin hatinger i cant forget that just a couple of weeks ago i walked out there by the pond and found his daughter nobodys forgotten about edda lou or francie or arnette either its just if you think about it too much you go crazy she lowered her voice that agent burns is talking to everyone in town he interviewed darleen just this morning happy told me about it the thing thats making it hard is hes not working with burke hes working around him doesnt want the local law messing with his federal case i suppose but its a mistake burke knows these people and they trust him they dont trust some shinyshoed yankee caroline had to smile and look down at her own shoes mine havent been polished in weeks oh its different with you susie waved carolines northern connections aside your kin was here of course you could say that you and that burns fellow speak the same language caroline lifted a brow you could but i dont think its quite true it seemed to me he had a lot of respect for you for caroline waverly musician theres a difference on a sigh caroline sat again why dont you tell me what youre dancing around susie its just that i was thinking with you and agent burns in the same circles so to speak he might listen if you made a suggestion what suggestion would that be he cant keep cutting burke out like this susie blurted out and scowled down at the chocolate crumbs im not just speaking as burkes wife because i love him and know this is eating at him im speaking as a woman as part of this community whoever killed those girls needs to be caught and its going to be a whole lot harder without burke smoothing the way with people and getting them to open up i agree with you susie i do but i really dont see how i can help i just thought you might find the opportunity to mention it in passing hows this if the opportunity presents itself ill try i guess he didnt do anything for you susie said romantically speaking caroline gave a quick laugh and shook her head no he didnt and no man will again who thinks of my music first and me second oh that sounds like a story all anticipation susie propped her chin on her hands lets just say i was involved with a man who thought of me more as an instrument than as a woman agent burns looks at me the same way did you get your heart broken carolines lips curved cracked a little well the best way to shore it up again is a nice fling with an easy man she touched her tongue to her top lip i heard you went to the movies with tucker the other night why am i surprised josie mentioned it to earleen id think tucker longstreetd be a nice painless cure for a broken heart cracked caroline corrected her and we just went to the movies that doesnt constitute a fling a man who brings a woman roses is laying the groundwork for one she grinned as caroline shut her eyes he stopped by and took marvella out for lunch while he was down in rosedale picking them out they were just a neighborly gesture uhhuh once burke brought me a real neighborly bunch of violets nine months later we had parker now dont get all flushed and bothered susie said with a wave of her hand im just being nosy and i thought if you had any neighborly interest in tucker you might want to know that agent burns is asking a lot of questions about him what kind of questions questions that apply to edda lou but caroline felt her heart give one uncomfortable thud but i thought that he wasnt a suspect because he was home the night she was killed maybe the fbi would like to find a way around that of course hes asking questions about a lot of people she looked deliberately toward the back door and the porch beyond where toby was humming in the garden susie caroline bit her lip and lowered her voice thats absurd you may think so and i might knowing toby and his winnie all my life the way i have but agent burns has different ideas she leaned closer he went by and talked to nancy koons wanted to know if edda lou and tucker had had any fights there in the rooming house if hed shown her any violence and he asked her about toby too what did she tell him next to nothing because she didnt like the way he asked susie drew lines in the moisture of her glass thats why he needs to bring burke in burke knows how to approach people theyll talk to him i have to figure hell be out this way again soon since you were the one who found the body theres nothing i can tell him honey seems to me he might be interested in the fact that tuckers coming around here caroline rubbed at an ache centered in her forehead my personal life is none of his business that i will tell him long after susie left caroline worried over every point of the conversation she listened to toby and his son pack up for the day and worried some more alone she wandered through the house trying to pinpoint her part in the whole picture she was a stranger yet her family had sprung from innocence she hadnt known edda lou yet she had been the one to find her shed never spoken a single word to austin hatinger but hed shot at her she didnt know matthew burns oh his type certainly but not him still it was true that they moved in the same circles knew the same places spoke the same language how that could help solve a crime was beyond her yet susie had made her feel responsible she was for lack of a better term involved with one of the suspects another was working for her so she felt even more responsible oh she knew all about responsibilities they snuck up on you attached themselves to you like tiny thirsty leeches until you were sucked dry shed had a responsibility to her parents to her music to her teachers her maestros her fellow musicians to her fans and as hed insisted right up to the last shed had a responsibility to luis oddly enough shed come to innocence to escape from responsibility for a little while only to find herself bogged down in it all over again she could do nothing she understood that now it had always been her choice and she had always chosen to give in rather than fight back but wasnt it different this time wouldnt she be giving in by doing nothing though she doubted she had anything to offer she was involved not just with tucker but with innocence and for the time being innocence was home all right all right she pressed her fingers to her temples ill go talk to him ill make a few quiet suggestions yankee to yankee she snatched up her purse and was heading out the front door when matthew burns turned into her drive well caroline thought with a sigh it must be fate ive caught you on your way out burns said as he stepped from his car no that is yes caroline smiled and altered her plans but i have a few minutes yet would you like to come in i would very much the moment he stepped onto the porch useless began to growl behind the screen door hes just a puppy caroline assured burns a little leery of strangers she opened the door and scooped the dog up cute burns commented but caroline heard the word mongrel clear as a bell hes excellent company she decided against setting useless outside and carried him with her into the parlor can i get you something iced tea coffee iced tea would be wonderful im afraid ill never get used to the heat heat caroline said with the same amused derision shed heard from so many of the locals oh it doesnt get hot until august please have a seat ill be right back she snickered to the dog as she went into the kitchen when she returned burns was standing hands linked behind his back frowning at the bullet hole in her sofa an interesting conversation piece isnt it she set the tray of drinks down ive about decided not to have it repaired its deplorable hatinger shooting into this house without any concern that you might have been hurt he didnt even know you fortunately tucker thought quickly if hed thought at all he wouldnt have put you in such a dangerous position caroline took a seat understanding that burnss stiff manners wouldnt permit him to do so first actually i dont believe tucker was aware that austin was out with a rifle it came as quite a surprise to both of us would you like lemon or sugar just a little lemon thank you he took his place on the couch shifting slightly to face her caroline as ive loved your music for years i feel as if i know you her smile remained pleasant its funny how often people make that mistake actually the music i play belongs to numerous composers and isnt mine at all he cleared his throat what i mean is ive admired your talents and followed your career so i feel a certain connection i hope i can speak frankly she sipped so do i im concerned caroline very concerned ive heard talk around town that youve been seeing tucker longstreet she settled back in the crook of the couch thats the marvelous thing about small towns dont you think if you sit in one place for more than five minutes you hear everything he stiffened like a poker personally i dont care for rumor gossip or innuendo her quick burst of laughter had him tightening his lips im sorry you made that sound like a rock group or a law firm she swallowed the next chuckle when he didnt respond in kind laughing at him was certainly no way to soften him up so that hed listen to a suggestion places like this run on gossip matthew i imagine it could even be helpful indeed however much i abhor such habits i must take this professionally youd be wise to do the same tucker longstreet is still being questioned regarding a vicious and brutal murder nerves had caroline passing the glass from hand to hand but her eyes remained level as i understand several people are being questioned i suppose that would include me your involvement with this is merely that of an innocent bystander who happened to find a body theres no merely about it matthew i found the body and im a member of this community i have her lips curved at the truth of it i have friends here and probably numerous cousins of one sort or the other and you consider tucker longstreet a friend im not sure exactly what i consider tucker she gave him a bland look is that a professional question im investigating a series of murders he said flatly i have not crossed mr longstreet off my list i consider him someone to be watched carefully watched you may not be aware that he had relationships with the other two victims matthew ive been here for over two weeks im well aware of it just as im aware that woodrow and sugar pruetts marriage is in trouble and that bea stokeys boy leroy got a ticket for speeding out on route one just as im aware that tucker isnt capable of doing any of those hideous things to those poor women a long patient breath and burns set aside his iced tea it never failed to fascinate him how easily women could be taken in people were fooled by ted bundys charm and attractive looks a serial killer is not someone you recognize as such in the everyday course of things they are clever manipulative and often highly intelligent and often yes quite often they themselves go for periods of time when they have no recollection of what theyve done and if they do they hide it under a mask of affability or concern but they lie caroline they lie because what they live for is the kill the anticipation of it the skill with which they hunt stalk and slay he watched her pale and reached for her hand im frightening you i mean to someone very likely someone in this small rural community is hiding behind a mask and plotting the next kill i will use all my skill all my knowledge to stop him but it may not be enough and if its not he will kill again she had to set the tea aside she needed nothing cool now not when her blood had turned to ice if thats true it is if it is she repeated shouldnt you be using all available assistance i beg your pardon youre an outsider here matthew your badge doesnt change that if anything the fact that its federal makes you more of an outsider if you want to help these people then use burke truesdale his smile was tight as he straightened his shoulders i appreciate your concern caroline but the simple fact is you dont know whats involved here no i dont but i do know about politics and authority no one could perform with dozens of different orchestras under dozens of different maestros and not understand the food chain my point is matthew you as i have been most of my life are the outsider burke knows these people you dont which is precisely part of the problem he knows them he sympathizes with them hes related to them or has old friendships to protect youre speaking about tucker again to be specific the term is good ol boys isnt it they toss back a few beers together shoot some rabbits or other small creatures and sit on their porches and talk about cotton and women he brushed a speck of lint from his trousers no i dont know these people caroline but i know of them the last thing i need to solve this case is to enlist burke truesdale to pave my way i believe him to be an honest man and a loyal one its his loyalties that concern me may i speak frankly matthew he spread his hands please youre behaving like a pompous ass she said and watched his face fall that might work well in dc or baltimore but it doesnt cut it here in the delta if someone else is killed as you seem to believe then look to yourself and wonder if it might have been prevented if you might have prevented it by having a liaison to these people instead of standing back all smug and superior he rose stiffly im sorry caroline that were unable to see eye to eye on this matter however you might feel i must still advise you to curtail your involvement with tucker longstreet until this case is resolved ive discovered a terrible habit in myself of ignoring advice your choice he inclined his head ill have to ask you to come in to my temporary headquarters tomorrow around ten if thats convenient why i have some questions official questions then ill give you answers official answers she didnt bother to see him to the door chapter seventeen caroline didnt even have to weigh her loyalties before burnss dust had cleared she was scooping up useless and heading for her car the keys were dangling in the ignition right where shed left them turning she looked back at the house she hadnt locked the doors hadnt even thought about it foolish perhaps considering the recent violence that had tainted innocence but to lock the doors without closing and latching the windows was even more foolish and to do that meant trapping the heat inside in less than a month shed picked up country habits im not going to be afraid in my own home she told useless as she set him inside the car he immediately propped his front paws on the dash tongue lolling in anticipation of a ride my home she repeated studying the house the fresh paint the polished windows the scarred porch rocker with a sense of satisfaction and purpose she climbed into the car come on useless its time we took an active part in the grapevine she backed down the drive unaware of the figure that stood shadowed by the line of trees watching the statler brothers were wailing away from a fourfoot boom box on the porch at sweetwater keeping them company were lulu and dwayne lulu still wore her eagle feather and her combat boots to complete the outfit she wore a splotched painters smock over levis and a pair of ruby earrings with stones as big as pullet eggs she stood in front of a canvas feet planted body braced more like a prizefighter going into round three caroline thought than an artist dwayne was sprawled in the porch rocker a tumbler full of wild turkey in his hand and the mild smile of an affable drunk on his face lo caroline he gestured with the glass in greeting whatcha got there caroline set useless down and he immediately streaked off to sniff the bushes buster had marked my dog good evening miss lulu she grunted dabbed a little paint on the canvas my grandmammy ran a pair of yankee deserters off her plantation in caroline inclined her head shed come prepared my grandmothers grandfather lost a leg at antietam pushing general burnsides troops off the stone bridge lulu pursed her lisp and considered and when would that have been september caroline smiled and blessed her grandmothers carefully documented family bible his name was silas henry sweeney sweeney sweeney seems to me there were some sweeney cousins on my husbands side thatd be my second husband maxwell breezeport lulu squinted her eyes at caroline and liked what she saw the girl was fresh as a new quart of cream and there was a sharp stubborn look in her eyes in the set of her chin that lulu approved of wholeheartedly the yankee blood was probably diluted anyway lulu decided and besides it was time tucker settled down you come down here to sashay around tucker have you certainly not but caroline found it impossible to take offense i have come to speak with him though if hes here oh hes around right enough lulu studied her palette then plunged her brush into a pool of virulent green come on up here on the porch girl dont be standing down there gawking at me while im working dwayne wheres that brother of yours cant you see this girls come to seduce him i have not come caroline broke off and backed up a foot when lulu leaned over to sniff at her pretty cagey not wearing perfume lulu shook the dripping brush at her when a mans used to women tarting themselves up hell fall flat for the smell of pure soap and water caroline cocked a brow is that so you know its so you dont get to be how the hell old am i dwayne i think its eightyfour cousin lulu eightyfour eightyfour paint dripped on her shoes youre drunk as a polecat dwayne no southern lady would ever reach the miserable age of eightyfour it aint seemly dwayne considered his whiskey he was well on the way to being sloshed but he wasnt stupid sixtyeight he decided what i meant to say was sixtyeight thats better lulu smudged paint on her cheek a dignified age you go on in yankee work your wiles on that poor hapless boy just so you know im on to you ill keep that in mind unable to resist she took a peek at the painting it was dwayne cocked back in the rocker clutching a hugely proportioned glass of whiskey the style was somewhere between picasso and the caricatures for mad magazine dwaynes face was green his eyes cracked with broken red lines poking up from his head were long purple donkeys ears ah an interesting concept caroline commented my daddy always said anybody who drinks for a livings bound to make an ass of himself caroline looked from the portrait to the artist in that single silent exchange she realized that cousin lulu wasnt as crazy as she pretended to be i wonder what reason anyone would have for choosing to drink for a living for some lifes reason enough dwayne wheres that brother of yours this girls waiting and i cant paint with her breathing down my neck back in the library he took a comfortable swallow of whiskey just go on in caroline third door down on the right of the hall caroline stepped in the house was so quiet it immediately crushed her urge to call out and announce herself the light had that mellow golden quality she associated with museums but the silence was more like that of a ladys elaborate boudoir while the mistress was drowsing she began to have doubts that anyone was there at all she caught herself tiptoeing down the hall the door to the library was shut tight as she put her hand up to knock she pictured tucker inside stretched out on the most comfortable flat cushioned surface hands cocked behind his head legs crossed at the ankles he would of course be taking his early evening postafternoon prebedtime nap she rapped softly and got no answer with a shrug she turned the knob and nudged the door open shed just wake him up she told herself she had things to tell him and the least he could do was stay awake long enough to listen because while he was busy sleeping away his life things were but he wasnt on the curvy love seat under the west window nor was he sprawled in the wing chair facing the stone fireplace frowning caroline turned a circle taking a curious scan of the walls of books an excellent georgia okeeffe and a dainty louis xv side table and saw him behind a sturdy oak desk bent over a pile of papers and books with his fingers skimming casually no she realized skillfully over the keyboard of a sleek little office computer tucker there was a world of surprise in the single word he answered with a grunt typed in some more data then glanced up the distraction on his face cleared instantly well hey caroline youre the most welcome thing ive seen all day what are you doing just running some figures he pushed back from the desk to stand looking lean and lazy in a tshirt and chinos nothing that cant wait why dont we go on out on the back porch sit and watch the sun set it wont set for two hours or more he smiled ive got time she shook her head evading him when he came around the desk to reach for her holding him off with one hand she moved closer to the desk to see what hed been up to there were ledgers printouts with columns of figures invoices receipts eyes narrowed caroline ran her finger over files laundromat chat n chew hardware gooseneck unit rooming house trailer park there was a pile of paperwork about cotton seed pesticide fertilizer market prices trucking companies another pile consisted of various prospectus folders and stock reports dragging a hand through her hair caroline stepped back youre working in a manner of speaking are you going to let me kiss you or not she only waved him off trying to think it through bookkeeping youre keeping books he grinned honey its against the law only if you keep two sets which my granddaddy did successfully for twentyfive years so i guess its more accurate to say its against the law only if you get caught keeping two sets which he never did and lived to his dying day as a pillar of this community he sat on the edge of the desk if you dont want to sit on the porch and neck awhile what can i do for you you use a computer well now i admit i was prejudiced about it at first but these damn little things save buckets of time once you get the hang of them im all for that do you do all of this all of what this frustrated she grabbed up a pile of papers and shook them at him do you keep all these records these books do you run all of these businesses he stroked a hand over his chin thoughtfully then he punched a few buttons and the monitor winked off mostly they run themselves i just add the figures youre a fraud she slapped the papers down again all that lazysouthernwastrel routine id rather sleep than sit its just a front what you see is what there is he corrected her amused by the way she was pacing around the room it just seems to me that you have a different definition of lazy up north than we do down here down here we call it relaxed he gave her a pained look honey i sure wish youd learn to relax the way you stir up the air in here is tiring me out every time i think ive got a handle on you you shift like a virus she turned back youre a businessman i dont think that description suits me caro now when i think of a businessman i think of somebody like that donald trump or lee iacocca all those fancy suits messy divorces and bleeding ulcers of course theres jed larsson and he wears a suit only on sunday as a rule been married to his jolette as long as i can remember but he does suffer from some bad heartburn youre changing the subject no i was getting around to it you could say i oversee some ventures now and again and since i have a gift for figures it doesnt take much effort she dropped down on the love seat and scowled at him youre not wasting your life i always figured i was enjoying it he walked over to join her but if itll make you happy i could give wasting it a try oh just shut up a minute im trying to think she folded her arms across her chest hapless she thought wasnt that what lulu had called him what a joke the man knew exactly what he was doing and hed obviously been doing it his own way in his own time for years hadnt she seen it herself the way he could give you that sleepyeyed grin one minute then drill right into your brain with a look the next the other day before that business with bonny did you say that you and dwayne worked in the fields weve been known to and you once mentioned that dwayne had a degree he didnt use but you didnt say if you had one cant say i actually graduated i never could get the hang of sliding through school like dwayne did i studied some business management and accounting though he smiled easily didnt take much thought to figure out its more comfortable behind a desk than sweating in a cotton field want me to dig up my college yearbook she only hissed out a breath i cant believe i actually came over here to protect you protect me he slid an arm around her shoulders so he could sniff at her hair sugar thats awful sweet of you god you smell good better than cherry pie cooling on the windowsill its soap she said between her teeth just soap it makes me crazy he began to nuzzle her neck dead crazy specially this spot right here she shivered as he nipped under her jaw i came here to talk to you tucker not to oh her words trailed off as he began doing sneaky seductive things behind her ear you go ahead and talk he invited her i dont mind a bit if youd just stop that okay he switched from her ear back to her neck go ahead as her better judgment began to dim she tilted her head back to give him more access matthew burns came by she felt his lips pause his muscles tense then gradually gradually relax again i cant say as that surprises me hes had his eye on you a blind man on a galloping horse could see that it had nothing to do with it wasnt personal the hell with her fuzzy brain caroline decided and turned her lips to meet tuckers she let out a quiet sigh as he pleasured them both with slow nibbling kisses he was warning me off you hmmm much to my frustration you havent been on me yet no he was talking about the case the murder a light flashed on in her brain and she jolted back the murder she repeated then stared down openmouthed at her gaping blouse what are you doing he had to take a steadying breath i was just working on getting your clothes off seems ive been working on that for some time now he sat back again studying her and it looks like its going to get put off again she fumbled her buttons back into place ill let you know when i want to be undressed caroline you were letting me know just fine until you started thinking again to douse some of the fire he got up to fix a drink want one he gestured with the decanter no well i do he poured two fingers of whiskey she lifted her chin you can be just as annoyed as you like but annoyed his eyes flashed to hers before he lifted the glass sugar thats a mighty mild word for what you work in me ive never had a woman stir my juices with less effort than you i came here to warn you not to stir anything my point exactly he finished off his drink thought about having another and opted for half a cigarette instead whos luis her mouth opened and closed twice before she managed to speak i beg your pardon no you dont you just dont want to answer me susie mentioned that there was somebody named luis you were pissed at he scowled down at the stub he was smoking hell of a stupid name tuckers so much more dignified he relaxed enough to grin depends on where youre standing i expect who is he caro somebody im pissed at she said lightly now if youd like to hear what ive come to did he hurt you her eyes locked with his in them she saw patience compassion and unexpectedly a quiet steady strength yes id like to promise i wouldnt but i dont guess i can do that something shifted inside her a door shed thought shed locked tight was creeping open i dont want promises she said almost desperately ive never been one for giving them dangerous things promises he frowned down at his cigarette then crushed it out but i do care about you i guess you could say im about neckdeep in caring about you i think im not ready she rose and wished she had something to do with her hands i care about you too tucker and thats where it has to stop i came here because i care about you and i wanted you to know that matthew burns is looking for a way to prove you killed edda lou hatinger hes going to have to look pretty hard still watching her tucker slipped his hands in his pockets i didnt kill edda lou caroline i know that i might not understand you but i know that matthews looking for the connection between arnette francie and edda lou and youre the front runner he also dropped some hints about toby and that concerns me i know these are the nineties but its still rural mississippi and racial tensions she shrugged most people around here have a lot of respect for toby and winnie there arent that many around like the hatingers or the bonny boys but there are some i dont want to see anything happen to toby or his family she took a step forward more i dont want to see anything happen to you then ill have to see to it that you dont he reached out to lift her chin his eyes sharp and steady youve got a headache gently he rubbed at the faint line of stress between her brows i dont like to think i had a part in bringing that on its not you as always she felt a trace of embarrassment at the weakness she associated with pain its the situation not you then were not going to think about the situation were going to go sit out on the porch and watch for that sunset he pressed a kiss to her forehead and you dont even have to neck with me unless you want to that made her smile which was what hed intended what about your work honey he slipped an arm around her waist to lead her out theres one sure thing about work it doesnt go anywhere so they sat on the porch talking idly of the weather of marvellas wedding of young jims progress on the violin and while the sun drifted lower in the sky bleeding red over the horizon while the frisky puppy tried to convince the aging buster to play while the statler brothers gave way to the oak ridge boys neither of them noticed the quick wink of light glazing off the lens of a pair of dented binoculars austin held them to his eyes in taut hands he watched his mouth moving silently in fervent and deadly prayer his mind twisting deeper into madness and two police specials shoved in the waistband of his sunday trousers when cy reached the culvert the next morning his father was waiting he grabbed the boy by the shirt while he peered out at the white morning light you didnt tell anybody ill know if you lie no daddy it was the same question the same answer each morning i swear i didnt i brought you some chicken and a sausage biscuit austin snatched the paper sack you bring the rest yes sir cy handed over the plastic container of water hoping his father would be content with that knowing he wouldnt austin unscrewed the top and took three long swallows before swiping his hand across his mouth the rest cys hands shook his throat was too full of fear to allow any words through he unbuckled the leather holder from his belt and held out the hunting knife daddy theres police still out by the house but they got rid of the roadblocks on route one you could get clean over to arkansas if you wanted anxious to see me gone boy lips peeled back in a grin austin unsheathed the knife it caught the funnel of light and shone no sir i was just oh youd like me to run wouldnt you he turned the blade drawing cys terrified eyes to the gleam youd like me to go leave your way clear to sin and debauchery to buddying up with niggers and kissing mr tucker longstreets rosy ass no sir i was just i was justcy stared at the knife one swipe one quick careless swipe of that knife and hed be dead its just that theyre still out hunting for you not like they were before but theyre still looking the lords my shepherd boy he does provide still smiling austin ran his thumb along the edge of the blade a thin line of red welled out of his skin and sharp is his sword now let me tell you what youre going to do austin turned the knife on his son for one dizzying instant while his bowels turned to ice cy was certain the point was going to plunge into his throat but it stopped a whisper away are you listening boy are you listening cy nodded he was afraid to swallow afraid that the blade would prick his adams apple if it bobbed and youre going to do just as i say arent you cy looked above the blade into his fathers eyes yes sir cy worked hard on sweating out his fear he hauled wheelbarrows full of mulch around the garden dug holes for the new peony bushes tucker had bought to replace the ones that had died off from being trampled he scraped old paint and slapped on fresh he yanked up weeds until his fingers cramped but the fear stayed hot and hard in his belly like a bad meal that refused to digest he didnt eat the meal delia set out for him not even the half he usually took for himself instead he packed the thick pork sandwiches and generous slice of lemon cake into his knapsack he couldnt even stand to look at them but he figured his father would eat well that night hed have a rare appetite after hed finished with tucker cy wiped sweat out of his eyes and tried not to think of right and wrong or good and bad all he had to think about was surviving of getting through one day and onto the next until hed finished up all those days that made up four years he looked around sweetwater the green fields thriving with cotton the dark still water the splashes of color from flowers maybe it was true what his daddy said maybe it was only people like the longstreets who could afford to plant flowers to look at instead of food to eat maybe it was true that they didnt deserve the fine big house and all the land and the easy life they lived maybe it was their fault that his own family was poor as dirt and had to scrape for every penny and edda lou had been his sister his blood family took care of family his daddy said it was tuckers doing that she was dead if he believed that if he could believe that then what he had to do wouldnt be so hard it didnt matter if it was hard or not cy reminded himself as he walked to the side of the house to rinse off his hands and face with the garden hose it was something he had to do because if he didnt his father would come for him he would find him wherever he tried to hide and he would come for him with more than a belt with more than his fists if thy eye offend thee pluck it out his father had said youre my eye boy youre both my eyes and hed held that honed silver point so close so close to cys left eye that hed been afraid to blink dont offend me in this you bring him here and ill be waiting you done for the day son at tuckers voice cy jerked back and managed to soak his shoes tucker merely grinned and put a match flame up to half a cigarette delia told me you were jumpy today better turn that hose off before you drown yourself yes sir im all finished cy stared at his hand watched his own fingers curl around the metal and twist good cause it damn near wears me out watching you you want a coke another piece of that cake no sir cy kept his head down as he rewound the hose he felt something perilously like tears in his throat maybe it wouldnt work he thought desperately maybe tucker would just shoo him on his way lips pressed together cy limped toward his bike whats wrong with your leg cy kept his back to the house and stared straight ahead make him feel sorry for you boy you see that he gives you a ride in one of those fancy cars and you bring him down here to me its nothing mr tucker guess i mighta pulled something he took another couple of limping steps praying that tucker would just shrug and turn away why dont you come on back in here let delia take a look at it cy closed his fingers around the handlebars of the bike and darted a look back toward the house no sir id best get on home tucker caught the glint of tears in the boys eyes and frowned adolescent pride was a touchy thing well ive got to run into town for some things he strolled off the porch improvising as he went that woman runs me ragged fetching this and picking up that how come women cant figure out what it is they need all at once cy stared down at the silver handlebars focusing on the splotches of rust i dont know one of the mysteries of the universe he laid a friendly hand on cys shoulder and felt him flinch with a guilty start he realized again how thin the boy was and how hard hed been working why dont you load that up in the olds cy i can give you a ride most of the way home cys knuckles whitened on the handlebars i dont want to trouble you mr tucker ive got to drive right by your turnoff come on lets get to it before she can think of something else to send me for yes sir head down cy wheeled the bike over to the drive his head was ringing like an anvil by the time tucker had plucked the keys out of the ignition and unlocked the trunk god knows why she drives this old boat tucker muttered you could fit three dead bodies in the trunk he shoved some of delias debris aside a cardboard box full of old clothes meant to go to the church three pair of shoes to be taken in for repair next time she was passing through greenville a box of mason jars and an overandunder winchester cys gaze lit on the gun then jumped away tucker noted the look as he hefted the schwinn into the truck shes been hauling that thing around in there for months says she might need to shoot some crazed rapist if the car breaks down somewhere tucker pulled out a length of rope and wound it carelessly around the bumper i cant quite picture delia sitting on the hood with a shotgun across her lap laying for crazed rapists but there you go cy said nothing nothing at all and climbed in the car tucker pulled one of his cassettes from the glove compartment i hide these in here he told cy a woman never goes in a glove compartment how about some presley okay cy linked his stiff fingers in his lap fine boy presleys not fine hes king tucker flipped in the cassette and revved the engine to heartbreak hotel he sang the opening bars along with the king as they headed down the lane you getting along all right at home at home your mama doing better shes shes getting by if you need something money or something you can ask me you dont have to tell her where it came from cy had to stare out of the window he couldnt face the concern the simple kindness were getting along he caught a glimpse of tobys truck at the end of carolines lane and wanted to weep how could he ever go whistling up to jim again after today hed be the same as a murderer you want to tell me whats on your mind cy sir cy swiveled his head back his heart bobbed up to his throat nothing mr tucker ive got nothing on my mind i havent been fourteen in a while tucker said easily but i remember what it was like i remember what it was like to have a father with a heavy hand and a short fuse tucker glanced over and his eyes were so full of understanding cy had to turn away again you werent limping when you got into the car cy the ball of fear in his belly spread i guess i guess my legs feeling better tucker said nothing for a moment then moved his shoulders if thats the way you want it they were driving along the skinny trickle of little hope now cy knew that theyd be coming up to the culvert in less than a mile i i keep the bike down by the stream in the culvert all right ill drop you there if you want maybe you could help me take it down help me wheel it down off the road and into the culvert where my daddys waiting for you youll help me take it down because youre willing to help when youre asked could what almost there almost there cy wiped the back of his hand over his dry mouth it wasnt icy fear in his belly now it was a sick green fist of horror i just have to ask him and hell do it and cy caught the glint of light reflected off the lens of binoculars or perhaps a knife stop stop the car in panic he grabbed at the wheel and nearly sent them into the stream what the hell tucker wrestled the wheel back and left the car diagonally across the road you lost your senses turn the car around mr tucker turn around christ almighty go back sobbing cy leapt up and tried to turn the motionless car himself please god turn it around before he comes and kills us hell kill us both now just holdon the olds banked like a ship leaving port then shot down the road cy huddled on his knees sobbing against his clenched fists and staring out the rear window while the dead king sang about a hunk of burning love hes going to come i know hes going to come my eyes hes going to cut out my eyes he doubled over clutching his belly hysteria or not tucker veered to the shoulder he yanked the boy out and held cys head while his body shuddered when cy was down to dry heaves tucker pulled out a handkerchief and mopped the boys face try to breathe slow you think youre done cy nodded then began to cry they werent wild wailing sobs but soft quiet ones that broke the heart baffled tucker sat in the open car door and patted cys head get those out too i expect youll feel better for it i couldnt do it i just couldnt hell kill me now whos going to kill you cy turned his blotched miserable face to tuckers tucker thought he looked like a dog whod already been beaten half to death and was just waiting for the final blow its my daddy he told me to bring you down here he told me i had to on account of edda lou and if your eye offends you you have to cut it out ive been bringing him food every day and i brought him his belt and a fresh shirt the binoculars i had to and today i had to bring him the knife tucker lifted cy up by the shirtfront and shook some of the hysteria away your fathers back there in that culvert he was going to lay for you i was supposed to bring you but i couldnt cys eyes wheeled around he could be coming right now he could be coming hes got those guns too get in the car cy figured he was going to jail for sure hed been aiding a fugitive and was an accessory after the fact or something like it but jail was better than having that knife carve out his eyes whatre you going to do mr tucker im going to take you back to sweetwater take me back but but and youre going to go inside and youre going to call sheriff truesdale and tell him the whole thing he aimed a hard look at cy arent you yes sir cy wiped tears from his cheeks i swear i will ill tell him where daddy is ill tell him the whole thing and you tell him he better get out here quick fast and in a hurry he turned through the gates of sweetwater ill tell him im sorry mr tucker i was so scared well talk about that later gravel spewed as he swerved to a stop get on in there if you cant get him at the office you call him at home delias got the number you cant get burke you get carl yes sir whatre you going to do he watched wideeyed as tucker popped the hood tossed out the bike then pulled out the shotgun you going back after him are you going after him mr tucker tucker broke open the shotgun checked the load his eyes lifted and fastened on cys thats just what im doing youd best tell burke ive just deputized myself cy turned and raced into the house chapter eighteen tucker didnt care to picture himself in a shootout it just didnt sit right as he sped back to dead possum road it occurred to him that this was the second time austin had put him in the awkward position of carrying a gun it was damn irritating but he couldnt go back and sit on the porch waiting for burke and carl to handle it not when he still had the picture of cys terrified face in his mind not when the scent of a young boys fear was still hanging heavy in the car hell cut my eyes out where in christ had the boy come up with that from his crazy sick old man tucker concluded his face was set his eyes the color of burnished bronze as he swung the car to the shoulder he hefted the gun then using the car as a shield reached in the backseat for the binoculars delia and almost everyone else in innocence carried when he brought them up and focused the concrete hump of the culvert jumped in front of his eyes slowly he scanned but saw nothing at the entrance no movement along the slope of the little hope nothing in the field beyond he caught the glint of silver from the roofs of the mobile homes in the trailer park three miles away lowering his sights he clearly saw earleens sister laurilee step out of her trailor take a swing from a can of mountain dew and give a holler calling the kids in for supper tucker thought absently and slowly swung the binoculars away he saw pigs rooting in the pen at stokeys farm and the wash hanging on the line at the marches and a plume of dust toward town that might have been burke riding out but on the fields and flats nothing stirred and the silence hung heavy disturbed only by the stream croaking its way over rocks and mud and a few birds that sang disinterestedly in the hazy heat of the evening if austin was waiting he was waiting in the dim dirty shadows of the culvert there was only one way to find out tucker took time to shove a few extra shells in his pocket though he sincerely hoped he wouldnt have to use them keeping low his eyes trained on the shallow entrance he circled the culvert when he got within five feet he dropped down on his belly the shotgun nestled on his shoulder god if you want to do me one favor in this lifetime dont make me have to shoot this thing he took a deep breath exhaled slowly austin i reckon you know im out here it wouldnt occur to him until later that his skin was bone dry his hands rock steady you went to a lot of trouble to invite me out for a visit he bellied his way to the slope of the bank why dont you come on out and we can talk reasonable or we can wait awhile until burke comes along there was only silence from the culvert and the scream of a crow overhead youre going to make it hard on me austin im going to have to come in there seeing as how you tormented that boy i just cant swallow that then were going to start shooting at each other and one of us is likely to be dead with a little sigh tucker reached over and picked up a stone i sincerely dont want it to be me he tossed the rock down and waited for the ripping report of a gun silence shit on toast tucker muttered and slid down the slope into the stingy trickle of the little hope there was a roaring in his head now a steady wall of sound that was his heart and his fury he swung the shotgun around and charged the entrance fully expecting to be dodging bullets but the culvert was empty tucker stood there feeling more than a little foolish with his shotgun at the ready and his heart beating like a brass band he could hear his own rushing breaths bouncing off the concrete okay he said quietly okay there was nobody around to see you make an ass of yourself he started back toward the entrance then stopped short could austin be hiding somewhere somehow have found a hole just big enough to crouch in was he waiting just sitting out there for tucker to come back out so he could pick him off that was stupid tucker assured himself took another step then stopped and swore it was better to be stupid than dead he supposed and wondered what the hell to do now he had a ridiculous image of the final scene from mutch cassidy and the sundance kid where newman and redford had been freezeframed in that last hopeless gun battle the slick ending didnt fool beau longstreets son tucker no indeedy he knew just what had happened guns had fired and butch and the kid had been blown to glory he stood in the narrow culvert thinking he was neither outlaw nor hero but it was mighty hard on the pride just to huddle there and wait before he had to make the decision he heard the rumble of a car then the quick sharp slam of doors tucker tuck you all right down here burke tucker leaned the shotgun against the wall he aint here he heard burke give carl orders to look around then the light at the entrance was blocked by the sheriffs broad shoulders what the sweet fuck is going on here well son ill tell you tucker said and did couldnt understand half of what that boy was saying burke offered tucker a light for his half cigarette but he seemed damned sure you and his daddy were going to kill each other down here im not sure if im disappointed or relieved we didnt have the chance to try cys a good boy burke austin threatened him with some nasty shit but he did what was right he pulled in smoke let it out slowly im thinking it might be best if he stayed on at sweetwater for a while homes no place for him if austin didnt manage to get to him vernon will make him pay for this i swear to christ i dont see how that boy could be kin to either of them with any luck vernon wont hear about it for a day or two right now wed better concentrate on finding his father he nodded at tucker i guess we can say youre already deputized id just as soon you didnt tucker reached for the shotgun it was then he noticed the scrawl of writing on the wall what the hells this he leaned closer squinting youre in my light burke he said then swore when he made the letters out an eye for an eye christ almighty burke murmured as he rubbed his thumb against the first a looks like he wrote it in blood im going to call up some men well do a house to house well walk every inch of the county but were getting that crazy sonofabitch tonight hell cut my eyes out tucker pressed his fingers to his own eyes as cys terrified voice rang in his head i guess im going with you do i get one of those cheap tin stars within the hour burke had fifteen ablebodied and willing men it gave him some twinges of uneasiness to see billy t bonny and junior talbot both standing around with rifles he had to hope that the excitement of going after a fugitive would put personal feuds on the back burner for safetys sake he separated them sending junior off with carls group and keeping billy t with his own he took a chance and put jed larsson slow but sensible in charge of a third using a county map he diced up territories i dont want any hotdogging austins got himself two weapons and unless hes been taking potshots at rabbits hes only used one bullet id sure hate to end the day by having to go to somebodys wife or sweetheart and tell her that her man got himself shot by being stupid we got ourselves more sense than those lardass county deputies billy t was excited at the prospect of shooting something there was a lot of goodnatured whooping to relieve nerves burke waited until it died down the last time austin was seen was right down there in that culvert now hes got at least an hour on us and hes on foot but a man who knows this country could find a lot of places to hide we want him brought in all in one piece if you spot him you give a call on the twoway your weapons are for defense only several of the men slanted sly looks at one another austin wasnt a popular fellow if he ends up dead therell be plenty of questions some of you might not like answering he scanned faces holding gazes just long enough to make his point you boys arent going deer hunting you are duly deputized public servants now move out and watch your butts he turned away to gather his own group and god help us five of them piled into the cruiser burke tucker billy t singleton fuller and bucky koons singleton immediately lit up one of the cigars happy wouldnt let him smoke at home you aint called up the county boys burke he said casually burkes fingers flexed on the wheel no its our town there was a murmur of agreement through the curtain of foulsmelling smoke at the intersection of old cypress and longstreet which burke had designated as base a he pulled to the shoulder the spot had significance for tucker who flicked a glance in the rearview mirror billy t met the look with surly eyes they separated there three to go east with the cautious singleton in charge and burke and tucker to go west you want to tell me whats cooking between you and billy t burke asked as they started the wide circle that would bring them back as a group by mcnair pond oh thats already boiled over and been mopped up he sent an uneasy glance in the direction of carolines house you really figure hed have gotten this far cant figure he could be off in any direction and i could be making a mistake not calling in to county hell of a lot of good they did us last time well burke said and left it at that could be he headed off for home he worried a minute about carl and his group countys still got his house under surveillance and hed know it but it doesnt sound to me like the mans thinking right tucker figured the distance with some satisfaction i hope to hell thats just where he goes theyll snatch him on up and take him off our hands tucker turned his head and pondered on the glint of carolines secondstory windows its not just that hes not thinking right burke its like hes gone rabid or something that day we pounded on each other he got to thinking i was my old man he didnt want to kill me nearly so much as he wanted to kill old beau he felt a hankering for a cigarette and struggled it back ill tell you what i think it wasnt me he wanted cy to bring to that culvert either burke frowned he didnt know a hell of a lot about psychology unless you assumed that was the same as human nature but he did understand that a man could do desperate things when a woman pushed him to the edge like hanging himself in his own barn thats a long time to hold a grudge over a woman well around innocence we got a surplus of time my mama would get up and leave the room anytime his name came up she did that right up until the end of her life tucker stopped while burke scanned with binoculars it used to make me wonder i asked edda lou once if austin acted strange about her she laughed now he did pull out a cigarette she said that hed sometimes call her mama by my mamas name when he was slapping her around a chill raced up his spine see anything not a goddamn thing burke pulled out his walkietalkie to check in with the other groups tucker felt the chill again he puffed on his cigarette and told himself it was only natural to feel uneasy when you were out hunting a man yet he caught himself not looking over his shoulder or squinting in the distance but staring back at the glint of sun against carolines bedroom window something was wrong he could almost smell it like a trace of ozone on the air after a slash of lightning something was sure as hell wrong burke i want to cross over there to carolines i already told you susie called her and told her to come on into town theyre probably sitting around the kitchen table talking about flower arrangements and wedding cakes yeah tucker rolled his shoulders as if trying to ease an itch but i want to cross over he was already moving fast when they heard the shots caroline had corn bread in the oven happy fullers family recipe shed been finishing up the batter when susie called she wasnt fooled by the invitation to dinner or the request that she come help talk some sense into marvella over her color schemes austin hatinger had been spotted less than ten miles away and susie didnt want her to be alone she appreciated the concern and since shed started to jump at every creak and shadow since the call caroline was more than willing to oblige she didnt think austin was going to show up on her doorstep certainly not but as the sun dropped toward evening she liked the idea of spending some time in susies safe and noisy kitchen she took a sniff of the air and smiled the corn bread was nearly ready then shed pack it up along with useless and drive into town she took a look at the oven timer little more than five minutes she saw and pushed open the screen door to call her dog useless come on boy she clapped her hands as happy had done and tried a whistle useless come on useless were going for a ride hearing the whimper under her feet she got down on her hands and knees to look through the porch slats and there he was crouched back against the new brace whining dumb dog come on right now whats got you so spooked he let out two yips and cringed back against the new brace disgusted caroline sat back on her heels probably saw a garter snake she muttered she decided to lure him out with a milk bone useless had already proven to have no willpower when it came to milk bones and was pushing herself to her feet when she saw austin hatinger for an instant she thought it was her imagination there could be no man walking across her backyard with two guns hitched in his belt and a knife in his hand there could be no man crushing her newly planted pansies under his heel and smiling at her smiling through frozen lips smiling out of crazed redrimmed eyes she was still on her knees when he spoke god led me to you the smile seemed to tear his face like a rip through tattered burlap i understood his will you were with him i saw you with him and youre to be sacrificed he turned the knife blade in the sunlight as he approached the porch like edda lou it has to be just like edda lou like a runner coming off the mark caroline pushed herself from her knees and slammed through the back door she shoved it to turned the bolt the oven timer went off with a buzz that made her scream then austins weight rammed against the wood and set her numb legs free she didnt think fueled by instinct she snatched up her grandfathers colt on her flight from the kitchen she needed to get to the car but even as she raced through the house she heard the old kitchen door give way with a splinter of wood and she remembered that the gun she held in her slippery hand was empty sobbing she barreled through the front door digging in her pocket bullets sprayed out of her sweaty fingers and she nearly lost her footing on the steps she stumbled righted herself and saw that all four tires on her car had been slashed austin swung open the screen door you cant run from the will of god you are his instrument an eye for an eye saith the lord but caroline was already fleeing toward the swamp another bullet squirted out of her fingers like wet soap to be lost in the grass her scream was no more than a harsh breath of air stop it stop it she ordered her shaking hands as she fought to get one bullet then two into the chamber oh god please she was nearly to the trees nearly there and there was shelter and terror behind them one desperate look over her shoulder and he was less than two armspans behind her with tears blurring her vision she turned and fired the gun clicked on empty and he smiled today you are the lamb of god the knife arched up glistening silver death caroline saw more than madness in his eyes she saw a terrible glory then useless shot out like a small gold bullet and latched his puppy teeth into austins calf austin howled more in fury than pain it took only one kick to send the dog lying bonelessly on the grass dear god caroline prayed and with the gun braced in both hands fired again this time the kick knocked her limp body back she lay stunned staring at the horrible red stain that bloomed over austins dirty white shirt his smile was back a rictus of a grin he took another step toward her the knife held high please please please caroline whimpered as the gun jerked in her hand again with numbed horror she saw his face disappear his big brawny body twitched to her terrorfrozen brain it seemed he was still coming still walking implacably toward her she scrambled back screams hitching in her throat heels digging furrows in the grass the knife fell at her feet and austin followed it tucker skidded to a stop on the gravel drive while his heart slammed in his throat he watched caroline weaving across the lawn carrying the puppy beyond her he could see austin sprawled facedown and the blood staining the grass he kicked my dog was all she said and moved by him into the house jesus christ burke ill take care of this out here burke holstered his gun and exchanged it for his walkietalkie go on in with her see that she stays inside until this is done tucker found her in the parlor sitting in the rocker with the dazed dog across her lap honey he crouched down beside her stroking her face her hair honey did he hurt you he was going to kill me she kept rocking afraid if she stopped shed go mad with the knife he could have shot me but he had to do it with the knife like edda lou he said the dog began to stir and whine in her lap caroline lifted him up against her breast like a baby its all right now its all right caroline caroline look at me honey he waited until she turned her head her pupils were so dilated the irises were hardly more than a green aura around them im going to take you upstairs come on now ill carry you up and call the doctor no she let out a long breath as useless licked her chin im not going to be hysterical im not going to fall apart i fell apart in toronto all kinds of pieces not again she swallowed pressing her cheek against the dogs fur i was making corn bread id never made corn bread before happy gave me her recipe and i was going to take it over to susies it feels so good being a part of this place useless licked away a tear that trickled down her cheek you see i thought i was coming here just to be alone but i didnt know how much i needed to be a part of something its going to be all right he said helplessly i promise its going to be all right i was making corn bread in my grandmothers oven and i shot austin hatinger with my grandfathers gun do you think thats strange caroline he cupped her face she could see the streaks of violence and fury in his eyes that he so carefully filtered out of his voice im just going to hold you for a while is that all right all right she let her head rest on his shoulder when he picked her up saying nothing he carried both her and the pup to the couch and cradled them there they both ignored the phone when it rang im going to stay here tonight he told her down here on the couch im not falling apart tucker i know darlin she let out a sigh the oven timers still buzzing she bit her lip to try to steady her voice i guess i burned the corn bread she turned her face into his shoulder and wept chapter nineteen caroline came downstairs feeling hollowedout by the aftereffects of shock and sleeping pills she had no idea what time it was only that the sun was strong and her house was quiet as a tomb it was already sultry even the thin cotton robe seemed too heavy and hot against her skin she thought shed take her coffee iced in her car with the airconditioning running shed killed a man that single raw fact had her stopping at the base of the stairs her fist pressed against her heart like a runner catching her wind after a punishing sprint and like a runners her legs went rubbery so that she sat on the landing propping her head in her hands she had pumped two bullets into flesh exchanging her life for anothers oh she knew it was a matter of selfdefense even without burkes gentle questions and quiet support she knew that some circuit in austin hatingers brain had snapped and caused him to turn on her but circumstances didnt change the result shed taken a life she whose most violent act had been throwing a champagne flute against the wall in the hilton hotel in baltimore had ripped two slugs into a man shed never even had a conversation with it was a big leap she thought rubbing her hands over her face and maybe her legs were a little shaky after landing but shed discovered something else about herself she could live with it she would not search for a way to put the blame on herself she would not agonize over how she could have avoided prevented or changed the outcome that was the old carolines weakness that delusion of selfimportance that had made her believe she had the right the responsibility the power to bear all burdens whether it was a performance her mothers needs a lovers deceit or a madmans violent death no caroline waverly was not going to listen to that sneaky little voice that crept inside her brain to whisper about blame and fault and mistakes she rose turning toward the kitchen before the scratching at the front door had her heart doing a cartwheel even as the scream tickled the back of her throat she recognized uselesss whimpering the scream died to a puff of air as she stepped forward to open the door fevered with gratitude the dog rushed in to make desperate jumps around her his tail slicing the air in his delight and relief what were you doing out there she bent to scratch his ears and accept his loyal licks of affection howd you get outside he yipped scrambling around her legs feet skidding in a search for traction on the polished hardwood before he dashed off to the parlor is this like a lassie thing caroline asked as she followed him i hope youre not taking me to where timmys fallen down the well or she trailed off spotting useless sitting smugly on the floor beside the sofa and tucker barechested barefooted sprawled over it he didnt look innocent in sleep she noted there was simply too much wit and wickedness in his face for that but he did look decidedly uncomfortable his feet hung over one end of the twoseater sofa and his neck was crinked to accommodate the curve between cushion and arm his arms were folded across his belly less for dignity caroline decided than for the fact that he hadnt been able to find any other space for them despite the awkward position and the stream of sunlight falling directly in his eyes his chest rose and fell gently with deep even breathing shed forgotten hed stayed but it came flooding back to her now how kind hed been how tenderly hed held her while shed cried out her shock and the quiet strength hed offered just by holding her hand while burke questioned her tucker had been the one to take her up to bed sliding over her protests as patiently as a father guiding an overtired child hed sat with her while the sleeping pill had trickled through her bloodstream and to chase away those last shadows of fear hed remained on the side of the bed her hand in his and had told her some silly story about his cousin ham who ran a usedcar dealership in oxford the last thing she remembered was something about a pinto that had dropped its transmission five feet out of the lot and a dissatisfied customer with a fivegauge she felt the lock on her heart snick open and sighed youre just full of surprises arent you tucker useless perked up at the name then leapt up to bathe tuckers face tucker grunted shifted okay honey in a minute amused caroline stepped closer i hope its worth the wait tuckers lips curved as he reached out to cuddle the dog its always worth his hand slid down the dogs back to the gleefully swinging tail slowly his lashes fluttered up and he studied the furry face grinning into his youre not quite what i had in mind undiscouraged useless scrambled his hind legs until hed gained tuckers chest tucker gave the dogs head an absent scratch then closed his eyes again didnt i put you out once he wanted back in tuckers eyes opened again and pushing uselesss face out of his he focused on caroline the sleepy look was gone quickly she noted and understood she was being carefully measured hey good morning when he shifted his hip she accepted the invitation and sat im sorry we woke you i figured on getting up sometime today anyway he reached up to stroke a fingertip down her cheek how you doing im all right really i want to thank you for sticking around he winced a little as he straightened his neck i can sleep anywhere so i see touched she brushed the hair off his brow it was sweet of you tucker im grateful im supposed to say i was just being neighborly he caught her hand when she started to draw it back but the fact is you had me worried sick you didnt have a lick of color when you finally went off to sleep im steadier now she wished shed checked the mirror to see if she looked steadier you could have used the spare bed upstairs i thought about it but when hed checked on her for the fourth or fifth time during the night hed also thought about slipping into bed with her just to hold her just to keep her close and satisfy himself that she was safe that had shaken him enough that hed needed to have the full story laid out between them now he needed the simplicity of closeness come here she hesitated then gave in to the urge to curl up beside him with her head pillowed against his shoulder and the dog stretched across their legs she sighed im glad youre here im sorry i wasnt quicker no tucker he brushed his lips over her head i gotta get this out caroline it gave me some hard hours through the night he wouldnt have come after you if it werent for me it was me he wanted and me who put you in the middle she laid a hand over his heart wondering if shed ever felt more comforted more safe i used to think that way about things that i was at the center and whenever anything went wrong i was to blame for it its an indulgent kind of arrogance i think the kind that carves holes in you that you have to fill up with pills and therapy dont change on me tucker im starting to find your daytoday way of looking at things appealing it scared me when his arms tightened around her she curved into him to give comfort as well as take it nothings ever scared me more than hearing those shots and knowing i was too far away ive been scared before so many times as horrible as this is its really the first time ive done anything about my fear her hand fisted and she slowly deliberately relaxed it again im not glad it happened tucker and i guess ill always remember what it was like to pull that trigger but i can deal with it he stared at dust motes dancing in a sunbeam there were things hed never forget either like the numb terror of racing over a fallow field with shots echoing in his head like the glassyeyed shock on her face when shed walked by him to carry the limp dog into the house im no hero caroline christ knows i dont want to be one but im going to see to it that nothing bad happens to you again she smiled thats a broad and daring ambition she began and tilted her head back to look at him there was no answering smile in his eyes and when he took her chin his fingers were tense youre important to me he said the words slowly as if explaining them to himself nobodys ever been as important and thats hard the air was clogging in her lungs the way it often did when she stood on a darkened stage the moment before the spotlight found her i know i guess its hard for both of us he saw the shadow of fear in her eyes though she kept them steady and level on his and because she was important because everything about her had suddenly become vitally important he struggled to lighten his tone it sure is a new one for me his tensed fingers relaxed to stroke her jaw here i am all wrapped up in a woman and i havent even managed to get her clothes off yet this gets around my reputations going to suffer why dont you try it now his finger froze on her cheek whats that i said why dont you try it now with her eyes still full of fears and needs and doubts she lifted her lips to his he felt himself sink into her and that too was a change that slow lovely drift into sweetness there was no hot punch of lust that he had always accepted so easily instead there was a gentle shift of sensation as subtle as a sky lightening toward dawn as her body yielded against his as her breathy sigh slipped intimately from her mouth to his he understood that she was offering him more than passion she was giving him her trust it humbled him it disturbed him she was not the kind of woman to offer anything to a man casually and he he had always taken whatever a woman chose to give with an easy grin and no backward looks caroline he brushed his fingers over her cheeks combed them through her hair i want you his heart drummed fast and hard against hers the quiet seriousness of his statement made her smile even as his lips cruised over her face i know no i mean i really want you the robe had slipped off her shoulder and he let his lips wander to that warm sweet curve i guess ive been waiting for you to give me the goahead since about thirty seconds after i met you her body trembled and arched under his why were they talking why were there words when she wanted only to feel i know that too its just that her throat was so white so smooth it wasnt in him to resist it i havent been exactly discreet when it comes to women she skimmed her hands over his bare back exploring that intriguing ripple of muscle tell me something i dont know i dont want you to regret this he rubbed his cheek against hers before he drew away his eyes were dark with emotions she was afraid to consider i dont think i could stand it if you did youre the last person i expected to complicate this it surprises the hell out of me too his fingers curled tight in her hair its not simple with you caroline i figured i ought to try to explain that he didnt have to explain what she could see so clearly in his eyes and seeing it had the little licks of fear leaping higher i dont want any explanations desperate she dragged his mouth back to hers im alive i just need to feel alive her needs swallowed him pulled him under sucked him in she wanted from him what he had always looked for in other women simple mutual pleasure if there was a twinge of regret he ignored it responding to her urgency he tugged open her robe and feasted on flesh she was slim and pale and soft as velvet and if she was not just any woman not just another woman he blocked off those troubling thoughts and let himself take she streaked mindlessly into heat gobbling up his desire like a starving woman might devour a crust of bread hers was only a body seeking pleasure from another body no thoughts she swore no emotions she needed the sensations the liberation of good cleansing sex her cry of release when he drove her to a hard knifeedged orgasm left her trembling she could hear his harsh strained breathing even as his hands began to slow to gentle he murmured something to her and though she didnt understand the words the sweetness of the tone had her battling back an urge to wrap herself around him and weep the emotions sneaking through terrified her she wanted none of them and moved quickly even ruthlessly to block them off even as his lips whispered over hers she was dragging his jeans down over his hips his body went rigid as she touched him fisted him in a hot greedy hand the room tilted and while he struggled to right it again she locked herself around him caroline wait but she was already surrounding him already drawing him deep into that glorious velvet sheath already urging him to match her frantic rhythm he was trapped in her in his own bodys demands so he raced with her toward a release he already realized would be empty she lay very still her robe rucked up under her hips she did feel alive sore and swollen and trembly and alive if only she didnt feel so hollow with it if only he would say something if only he would lift his head and grin and make some silly joke to put this awkwardness behind them but the silence dragged on his heartbeat slowed to normal against hers and the silence dragged on he knew he was heavy but he put off shifting his body from hers put off the moment when he would have to face her and himself good sex he thought yes it had been good basic sex minus all those insidious and baffling emotions smart sex he thought with some disgust there was no reason for him to feel used was the word he realized and wished he could laugh it off was this why edda lou had been so bitter at the end he wondered with a sigh he opened his eyes and stared out at the empty room no edda lou hadnt cared about him about his money his name his position but not about him sex had been a means to an end for her that was something theyd had in common but surely there had been a woman someone between his first adolescent tussle and this final soulless bout with caroline who had cared who had wanted more and settled for less someone who had lain in hurt silence after the storm his just deserts he supposed the first time he had wanted more he had run up against a woman who refused to give it or take it well he still had pride however cold that comfort was it was better than crawling he did shift then hitching up his pants as he sat back you caught me off guard sugar the smile curved his lips but left his eyes flat didnt give me a chance to well dress for the party it took her a moment to understand that he was talking about the lack of a condom she made herself shrug i suppose this was more of a surprise party avoiding his eyes she sat up and drew her robe around her i take the pill well then he wanted to reach out to smooth her touseled hair but rose instead looks like we bored that pup of yours right to sleep he gestured to where useless was curled under a chair snoring tucker thrust his hands in his pockets caroline i think ill go make some coffee she popped off the couch as though tuckers voice had flicked a lever and breakfast i owe you breakfast he studied her the way she gnawed on her bottom lip the way her eyes shadowed with strain kept slipping over his shoulder if thats the way you want it mind if i grab a shower no go ahead she wasnt sure if her sigh was one of relief or disappointment and covered it over with a flow of words upstairs second door on the right there are fresh towels on the shelf the water takes a while to heat up im not in a hurry he told her and strolled out of the room washing with her soap put him in a better frame of mind using her toothbrush he couldnt find a spare left a lingering taste of her in his mouth physical things it was much more comfortable to concentrate on physical things hed had no business brooding over the deeper meaning of a nice nostrings session of morning sex hed shrugged his shirt over his shoulders by the time he reached the bottom landing he caught the scents of coffee and bacon everyday aromas that shouldnt have had him quivering for her he was scowling down the hallway toward the kitchen when he heard the sound of a car in the lane shirt open thumbs tucked in his pockets he walked to the screen and watched special agent matthew burns park they studied each other one blacksuited and silktied the other unshaven and barely dressed animosity leapt up like a large rabid dog tucker shoved open the screen door and leaned on it early for visiting isnt it burns locked his car door pocketed the keys official business he scanned tuckers bare chest and damp hair the homey breakfast scents drifting outside had him thinning his lips the interruption is quite necessary youre too later to interrupt tucker said placidly what can we do for you you take a lot of pride in this dont you longstreet tucker lifted a brow in what in your southernfried womanizing is that why youre here looking for pointers his smile wasnt charming this time but wolfish if thats the case its going to take a while you need a lot of work burns burnss jaw clenched the simple fact that a woman like caroline preferred tucker over him burned in his gut like an ulcer i find your style i suppose well call it pathetic if that was an insult youre off target im not looking to impress you no helpless females are more your style you know tucker rubbed a hand over the stubble of his chin ive never once in my life met a female id consider helpless carolines not thats for damn sure right now she might be a little shaky she might need somebody to lean on until she gets her feet back under her again shes got me as long as she wants youd better understand that what i understand is that you have no compunction about using a womans vulnerabilities to your own end youre a user longstreet and youve got the emotional maturity of a mushroom edda lou hatinger was just the last in a long line of your discards as for caroline caroline can speak for herself she stepped forward laying a hand on tuckers arm whether it was in support or restraint none of them could tell do you need to talk to me matthew he struggled against a wave of black unreasonable anger she was wearing nothing but a robe and the way she ranged herself beside tucker spoke not only of preference but of intimacy it galled destroying his elegant image of her however brilliant her talent however delicate her beauty she had lowered herself to trollop by her choice i thought it would be more comfortable for you to give me your statement here rather than coming into town yes it would i appreciate it she would have offered him coffee in the parlor but she had no intention of leaving him and tucker alone again if we could go back in the kitchen ive just finished fixing breakfast id intended to get mr longstreets statement later burns said stiffly now you can save some time caroline kept a wary watch on both of them as they walked down the hall would you like some eggs matthew thank you ive already eaten he took a seat at the table as out of place in the country kitchen as a tuxedo at a hoedown coffee would be nice if you dont mind caroline brought the pot to the table setting it on an iron trivet in the shape of a rooster odd she thought as she dished up bacon and eggs until that moment she hadnt imagined herself racing through that room snatching a gun from the counter screaming as fists beat against the door she looked over now only the screen remained either burke or tucker had taken the broken door away but there were still a few splinters of wood on the floor you want a statement about what happened yesterday caroline busied herself adding cream to her coffee ive already given one to burke yes i read it tucker noticed her hands were steady but her gaze shifted back to the door several times he lifted a hand to her shoulder for a gentle rub i dont know much about the law he began but isnt what happened here yesterday a local problem ordinarily if youd indulge me caroline id very much appreciate your going over everything that happened he switched on his recorder for my records it wasnt very difficult not when it all seemed so dreamlike and distant she played it back as if it were a tape in her head he let her run it through without interruption making only a few cursory notes on his pad its odd dont you think that hatinger didnt use either of the guns he carried his tone was conversational as he poured a second cup of coffee they were both loaded and from my information he was considered an excellent shot when you describe your flight from the rear porch through this room and out the front it would appear that he could have fired at you at any time but he didnt even draw a weapon he had the knife she said and didnt notice the catch in her voice tucker did i dont see the point in this burns hed snapped obviously maybe he didnt even remember he had the guns maybe he added a miserly dab of cream to his coffee would you say caroline that he was aware you had a gun he lifted the cup sipped then went on without waiting for her answer you say you grabbed it on the run while he was still outside yes id been target practicing i always unloaded it when id finished sometimes i stuck the bullets in my pockets i remember thinking it was a bad habit and i should break it she set down her fork clattering it against her plate the scent of eggs and bacon grease were nauseating i guess im lucky i didnt you were lucky you had the presence of mind to load the gun at all she gave burns a wan smile you could say im used to performing under pressure he merely nodded if we recreate those last moments outside when you turned and fired can you hazard an opinion as to whether he realized you were armed did he make any move to reach for one of the guns he carried it happened very quickly it hadnt seemed so it had seemed as though shed been running through syrup it didnt take any effort to rerun the scene that slowmotion film of nightmares and dark fantasies the wall of heat that made you fight for every gasping breath the terrifying feeling that the grass had gone boggy and was sucking you down the silver glint of the knife under the merciless sun and that grin that wide hungry grin i she pressed her lips together and bore down on the last nasty remnants of fear i tried to shoot but nothing happened he just kept coming holding the knife and smiling at me just smiling i think i was crying or screaming or praying i dont know but he kept coming and kept smiling i had the gun out in front of me and he was saying that i was the lamb of god a sacrifice that it was going to be like edda lou that it had to be like edda lou youre sure of that burns held his cup two inches above the saucer youre sure he said it had to be like edda lou yes she gave in to a shudder then pushed her uneaten breakfast aside im not likely to forget anything he said wait a minute tucker put a hand on carolines arm his fingers taut as wire hed been doing more than listening hed been watching burns looked like a man whod just drawn to an inside straight youre not here getting a statement about the shooting of some escaped lunatic thats small shit the kind of local dirt that wouldnt interest a federal agent you sonofabitch tucker please no his eyes were fierce as he turned to caroline dont you see its about edda lou about edda lou and the others it doesnt have diddly to do with you except you managed not to be the next victim the next she began then stopped the blood drained from her face oh god the knife he didnt shoot me because because it had to be like edda lou it had to be the knife yeah the knife tuckers hand slid down her arm so that she could grip it there are users and users arent there burns tuckers voice had lost its lazy drawl sharpening to an icy point youre using caroline to help you gather evidence on hatinger using her to solve your case but you dont bother to let her know burns set his cup meticulously back in the saucer im conducting a federal investigation on a series of murders im not required to make my views known to the public fuck that you know what shes been through easing her mind by telling her this might be over wouldnt have cost you regulations and procedure burns said caroline squeezed tuckers hand before he could speak again i can talk for myself she inhaled and exhaled twice slowly i didnt even know edda lou but ill see her floating in the pond for the rest of my life ive never performed a violent act in my life oh i threw a champagne glass at someone once but i missed so it hardly counts yesterday i killed a man her hand fluttered to her stomach to press against the slow familiar burn that may not seem so terrible to you matthew considering your line of work and taking into account that i was saving my own life but i killed a man now you come in here and ask me to bring it all back and you dont even grant me the courtesy of the truth its simply speculation caroline and for your own good he fumbled to a stop when her head snapped up do you know she said slowly i once threatened to kill a man if he ever ever used that particular phrase to me again i didnt mean it literally at the time it was just one of those typical statements people make before they realize what its like to kill but i should warn you not to use that phrase it tends to set me off delighted tucker kicked back in his chair and grinned shes got a hot streak its a pure pleasure seeing it aimed at somebody else for a change i apologize if ive upset you burns said stiffly but im doing my job as i think best it is not a foregone conclusion that austin hatinger was responsible for the three deaths in this community or the one in nashville however given yesterdays incident we are focusing our investigation on him will you be able to tell if it was his knife caroline asked after certain tests are completed we should be able to determine if it was that style of knife off the record bums continued grudgingly i can say that hatinger fit certain psychological points in this kind of killing he had a deepseated anger toward women as evidenced by his frequent abuse of his wife a religious mania which he may have figured absolved him of guilt or accorded him a mission we could speculate that his use of water to dispose of the bodies was more than an attempt to wash away evidence but a kind of baptism unfortunately he cant be questioned about his motives as it stands ill be backtracking trying to place his whereabouts at the time of all three murders and while he is my focus ill continue along other avenues of investigation his gaze lighted on tucker and tucker merely smiled then youve got your work cut out for you dont you son we wouldnt want to hold you up ill want to talk to the boy cy hatinger tuckers smile faded hes at sweetwater well then he rose but couldnt resist a parting shot odd how hatinger went from gunning for you straight to caroline isnt it some people have a knack for turning bad luck onto others he was an expert at recognizing guilt it gave him pleasure to watch it shadow tuckers face if you think of anything else that might help caroline you know where to reach me thanks for the coffee i can see myself out tucker caroline began the moment they were alone but he shook his head and rose ive got some thinking to do he ran a hand through his hair it was dry now but he caught a whiff of her shampoo even so small a thing had his gut tightening will you be all right want me to call josie or susie or someone no no ill be fine but she wondered if he would matthews a rigid sort of man tucker that kind always sees the logic of placing blame theres blame enough listen i need to get back i dont want cy having to talk to him on his own his hands dug into his pockets again hes just a kid go ahead it would be better she thought to be alone to put off talking about what had happened between them that morning ill be fine really she lifted their plates thinking useless was going to breakfast like a king he put a hand on her shoulder as she turned to the sink im coming back i know she waited until he was at the doorway before speaking again tucker thanks for telling matthew i wasnt helpless when youre used to people seeing you that way it means a lot her back was to him her shoulders straight he knew she was looking out to where the blood had dried on the grass were going to have to talk you and me about a lot of things when she didnt answer he left her alone chapter twenty his daddy was dead miss delia had told him his daddy was dead there would be no more snapping belts or merciless fists no more shouts to a fevereyed god to punish the sinners for their transgressions their laziness their filthy thoughts miss delia had sat him down in the bright kitchen and told him and there had been kindness in her eyes he was afraid so afraid that there would be no end for him but hell the fiery screaming black pool of hell his father had often gleefully described how could he expect forgiveness or a place at the lords table when he harbored such an evil secret in his soul the secret whispered through his brain with the devils rusty chuckle his daddy was dead and he was glad when his tears had come the tears miss delia patiently waited out then wiped away they werent tears of sorrow or grief they were tears of relief a river of joy and gratitude and hope and it was that cy thought as he watered the kitchen garden that which would consign him to hell for all eternity he had been responsible for the death of his father and he wasnt sorry miss delia had told him he could stay at sweetwater just as long as he wanted mr tucker had said so he didnt have to go home he didnt have to go back to that house of fear and hopelessness he didnt have to face vernon see his father in his brothers eyes feel his fathers wrath in his brothers fists by a single act of cowardice he had wiped out four years of waiting his father was dead and he was free cy hunkered down the hose soaking grass until it gurgled in a puddle rubbing his knuckles in to his eyes he wept in joy for his life and in terror for his soul cy the sound of his name had the boy jerking to his feet it was only quick reflexes that had burns nipping out of range of the garden hose they stood facing each other a moment the water squirting between them a young boy with a puffy face and frightened eyes and a man who wanted to prove that cys father had carved up women in his spare time burns tried his most ingratiating smile which put cy immediately on edge id like to talk with you for a few minutes ive got to water these plants burns glanced at the soaked greens you seem to have done that already ive got other work burns reached down to turn off the water himself authority was something he wore as habitually as his tie this wont take long perhaps we could go inside out of the blistering heat no sir i cant track all over miss delias clean floor burns glanced down any trace of white on cys sneakers had been obliterated with grass and dirt stains no i suppose not the terrace then around the side before cy could protest burns took him by the arm and led him around the flower beds you enjoy working at sweetwater yes sir i wouldnt want to lose my job cause i got caught sitting around talking burns stepped onto the slate terrace and gestured toward one of the padded chairs under a striped umbrella is mr longstreet that hard a taskmaster oh no sir reluctantly cy sat he never has enough for me to do to my way of thinking and hes always telling me to slow it down and take it easy real considerate like sometimes if hes around late in the afternoon at quitting time he brings me out a coca cola himself a liberal employer burns took out his pad and recorder then im sure he wouldnt mind you taking a short break to answer some questions you can ask him yourself tucker suggested he strolled out of the kitchen door with a chilled bottle of coke here you go cy he set the bottle down in front of the boy wet your whistle mr burns he said how i had to come on out here and talk cy began his eyes were as panicked as a rabbits caught in the white stream of headlights thats all right tucker touched a hand to his shoulder briefly before scraping back a chair for himself nobody expected you to work today cy with his lips pressed tight together cy stared down at the white table i didnt know what else to do well for the next few days you do what suits you tucker pulled out his cigarettes he figured he was down to a half pack a day by his current method and ruthlessly tore off half the tobacco now agent burns heres having himself a busy morning his eyes stayed on burnss over the flare of his match there was a warning there as clear as the message hatinger had written in blood so why dont you tell him what you can then maybe youd like to drop a line with me for an hour or two burns curled his lip at the idea of taking the boy fishing the day after his father had been killed ill let you know when were finished if youd like to go tie some flies tucker helped himself to a swig of cys coke no as i figure it since the boys working here and staying here for the time being im a kind of guardian ill stay unless cy wants me to go cy lifted those panicdazed eyes to tuckers id be obliged if youd stay mr tucker i might get something wrong all you have to do is tell the truth isnt that right agent burns thats exactly right now he broke off as josie walked out wearing a paperthin pink robe well now its not often a woman strolls out of her kitchen and finds three men waiting for her she moved closer to ruffle cys hair but her eyes were all for burns special agent i was beginning to think youd taken a dislike to me why you havent been around to talk but one time she eased a hip onto the arm of tuckers chair when she reached over to pluck up one of tuckers cigarettes she afforded burns the best view in the house i was about to make something up just so you could investigate me he was stuffy but he wasnt dead burns found his throat clogged and his tie too tight im afraid i have little time for socializing while on a case miss longstreet now that surely is a shame her voice was as rich and heady as the scent of magnolias with a flutter of her lashes she handed burns the pack of matches then steadied his hand with her own when he touched the flame to the tip and here ive been pining away hoping youd find time to tell me all about your adventures i bet youve had scads of them actually ive had a few interesting moments im going to have to hear all about them or ill just explode from curiosity she trailed a finger down her throat to where her robe met loosely over her breasts if his eyes had been tied by a string to her hand burns couldnt have followed the movement more closely teddy told me you were the very best he managed to swallow teddy dr rubenstein she sent him a sultry look under heavy lashes he was telling me you were the absolute expert on serial killings i just love talking to brainy men with dangerous jobs josie tucker sent her an arch look werent you going to get your nails done or something this morning why yes honey i was she shifted to hold out her hands her robe crept up another inch i dont think a woman can be really attractive if she lets her hands go she rose then satisfied that shed broken burnss concentration maybe ill see you in town later special agent im fond of stopping for a cold drink at the chat n chew after my manicure she left him with the distracting image of her hips swaying beneath that thin pink robe tucker tossed his cigarette into a brass bucket filled with sand you going to turn that recorder on burns gave him a blank look then shot to attention ill be asking cy questions he began but his gaze drifted to the kitchen door i have no objection to you being present but ill tolerate no prompting tucker gestured with his open hands and sat back burns switched on the recorder entered the appropriate data then turned to cy with a solemn smile i know this is a difficult time for you cy and im sorry for your recent loss cy started to thank him then realized he wasnt talking about edda lou but his father he took refuge in staring at the table again i realize you spoke with sheriff truesdale last night and your information was very helpful well have to talk about that again but i think well start with a few other things did your father ever mention miss caroline waverly to you he didnt hardly know her so he never spoke of her to you or in your hearing cy darted a look at tucker he mighta said something on one of the days i brought him breakfast some days he said lots of things like when his mood came on him mood burns prompted those hard moods he had when he said god was talking to him and did he have these moods regularly pretty much cy chugged down coke to ease his dry throat aj used to say that he just liked to beat up on people and used god as an excuse he was often violent with you and other members of your family he cy remembered tuckers phrase he had a heavy hand that didnt sound so bad somehow it was almost like saying he had a head cold he didnt tolerate no sass the bible says how youre to honor your father tucker said nothing but he noted that cy hadnt said father and mother he didnt imagine austin had drilled that part of the scripture into his sons brain and he used this heavy hand when he had his moods cy shrugged his thin shoulders he used his hands most all the time it was just worse during the moods i see even burns wasnt unaffected by the casual way the boy described brutality and when you were bringing him food and supplies in the culvert he had these moods i had to do it cys knuckles whitened on the glass bottle hedve killed me if id gone against him i had to do it agent burns isnt blaming you cy again tucker laid a hand that soothing comforting hand on his shoulder nobody is you didnt do anything wrong no im not blaming you burnss voice roughened and he coughed to clear it the stark fear on the boys face appalled him no one would i only want you to tell me if your father spoke of miss waverly he said some things cy blinked his eyes fast to close off tears he said how she was full of sin how all women were like lots wife she got turned into a pillar of salt yes burns folded his hands i know did he tell you why miss waverly was full of sin he said how he shot tucker a miserable look do i have to say itd be best tucker told him you take your time cy took it by gulping down coke wiping his hand across his mouth squirming in his chair he said how she was spreading her legs for mr tucker his face went beetred and how she was no bettern a whore for it it was time to cast the first stone im sorry mr tucker its not your fault cy i didnt know he meant he was going to hurt her i swear i didnt he said stuff all the time it got so you didnt pay much mind to it as long as he wasnt hitting you i didnt know he was going after her mr burns i swear i didnt no im sure you didnt your father hit your mother didnt he the frantic color in cys cheeks ebbed away we couldnt do nothing about it she wouldnt do nothing she wouldnt let the sheriff help cause a womans supposed to cleave to her husband the sheriffd come by sometimes and shed just tell him how shed fallen off the porch or something his head dropped shame weighed almost as heavy as fear ruthanne says how she likes it she likes getting beat on but that dont seem right burns decided there was no use trying to explain the psychology and the cycle of abuse that was a job for social workers and shrinks no it doesnt did he hit ruthanne too he smirked the way brothers do over their sisters shes pretty good at getting out of the way how about vernon theyd whip up on each other sometimes cy made a quick dismissive move of the shoulders mostly they hung together vernon was daddys favorite he took the most after daddy inside and out my ma said they were alike inside and out how about edda lou did your father hit her she was always butting him daring him like she hit back at him once she split his head with a bottle when he used the belt on her thats when she moved out she moved into town and never came around the house anymore did he say things about edda lou too the way he did about miss waverly a wasp circled down to investigate cys coke and was batted away we werent supposed to say her name sometimes he got worked up and said how she was a whore of babylon vernon would try to get daddy riled up about her he wanted to go fetch her from town and bring her home so they could punish her vernon would say how it was their duty as her family and as christians but i dont think he believed in that like daddy did vernon just likes to hit people he said it simply as if hed just commented that vernon liked ice cream sundaes then daddy found out she was seeing mr tucker and he said how shed be better off dead and he beat ma tucker pressed his fingers against his eyes and wondered if the guilt would ever pass cy do you remember when your father and mr longstreet argued tucker dropped his hands he nearly laughed the euphemistic argument still showed in fading bruises on his ribs i guess i do daddy came home with his face all busted up and what about two nights before that the night edda lou was murdered do you recall if he had one of his moods it was the first question cy had to think about his eyes lost some of their glassy fear as he considered absently he took another swipe at the persistent wasp i cant recollect for sure when he got wind that edda lou was supposed to be pregnant he was real fired up but i dont know which night that was burns prodded for a few minutes trying to jog the boys memory without tipping him off to the reason in the end he backed off he still had ruthanne and mavis hatinger their memories might be keener all right cy just a few more questions the knife you took to your father did he often carry it only when he was going hunting and such a bucks too big to carry as a rule could you estimate how many times he might have carried it in say the last six or seven months four or five times maybe more he was partial to squirrel meat did he ever threaten you or any member of your family with the knife did he ever boast about punishing someone with it he was going to gut mr tucker cy covered his face with his hands muffling his voice he said how i had to bring mr tucker back down to the culvert and he told me he was going to gut him like a rabbit he was going to carve off his privates cause it was divine justice he was going to cut him up like edda lou and if i went against him if i didnt honor my father then hed cut out my eyes because the eye offended him and the lord says youre supposed to please mr tucker he didnt weep but kept his hands over his face like a kid in a horror movie trying to block out the monster please i dont want to think about it no more its all right cy tucker rose to stand behind him leave him be burns burns turned off the recorder put that and his pad in his pocket im not heartless longstreet as he pushed back from the table he looked from the trembling boy to the man who stood as his protector and im very aware that there are more victims here than are buried in your cemetery he wished fleetingly that he was capable of offering compassion as easily as tucker with the touch of a hand instead he nodded at the boy and though his voice was stiff the words were sincere you did everything that was right cy theres nothing more any man can do you remember that tucker laid his hands on the boys shoulders and watched burns walk away for the first time since hed set eyes on the fbi agent tucker felt a tug of respect im going to get us a couple of poles cy were taking the rest of the day off now fishing tucker said as he balanced his pole between his knees and settled back against a cypress stump is the thinking mans sport i never used this kind of stuff for bait before cy sniffed again at the foilwrapped package in tuckers bait box whats it called again pate tucker grinned and pulled his cap farther down over his eyes duck liver in this case and wasnt delia going to raise holy hell when she saw it was gone duck liver cy screwed up his face and looked exactly the way a fourteenyearold boy should thats gross an acquired taste my man the catsre crazy for it tucker smeared some on a cracker for himself popped it into his mouth and washed it down with lemonade they had settled on the far side of sweetwater pond under the dappled shade of a willow tuckers mother had planted before hed been born the cotton looks fine mr tucker hmmm from under the shadow of his cap tucker looked at the fields he spotted his overseer and several hands checking the rows for growth for weevils weve got a good crop this year the cotton runs this place he sighed a little and running cottons what spoiled this water here so well have to toss back whatever fish we catch ive been thinking about getting some of those bugs bugs mr tucker they got these bugs scientists figured it out they eat poison and pollution and the godknowswhat that seeps into water and ruins it poison eating bugs cy gave a snort of laughter youre joaning on me mr tucker the boys chuckle however weak lightened tuckers heart its the gods truth they put those bugs into the potomac river and they ate it clean he looked wistfully out over the dark deadly water of the lake ill tell you cy it sure would mean something to me to see this water sweet again my mama used to talk about having a bridge built over it you know one of those pretty arching things like they have in japan we never got around to it im sorry for that cause shedve liked it cy didnt know about japan or arching bridges but he liked listening to tucker talk as far as cy could tell he could talk about just anything and make it seem fine they fished for a while drowsily with tuckers voice soothing the air like breeze cy caught a fish whooped over it then tossed it back in i always wanted to go off to places tucker said while cy baited his hook with delias prize pate i had a scrapbook when i was your age filled it with pictures out of magazines places like rome and paris and moscow im thinking it was a shame i never worked up the energy to go see them for myself he waited a moment you got yourself a wish cy something you thought about doing i wish i could go to college he turned red waiting for the laughter when it didnt come he let the rest out in a flood i like school im good at it and all mr baker thats my history teacher he says i got a curious brain and good study habits that so its kind of embarrassing when he says it in front of the class and all but it feels good too he even said how maybe i could apply for a scholarship to the state university but daddy said i had to quit as soon as the law allowed and work on the farm he said they taught godlessness in those colleges and that i wasnt he trailed off remembering his father was gone in silence tucker yanked a fish out of the water he held it there a moment watching it flop and struggle against the inevitable a boy could feel like that as well he thought bringing the catch in gently removing the hook he tossed it back in the pond with a splash it wasnt often that a fish or a young boy was given a second chance it wasnt often that a man was given the opportunity to offer that chance cy was going to college he decided hed damn well see to it mr tucker cy felt the tears rising again and hated them they made him feel like a whining girl yeah do you figure i killed him tucker bit back a sharp denial he took a careful breath then pulled out a cigarette howd you come up with that i didnt do like he told me i didnt do it and he ran off he probably got crazy mad at me and he went after miss waverly now hes dead i didnt honor my father and now hes dead tucker struck a match as if considering that may be the how and why of it and it may not but youve got to ask yourself one question do you think that particular commandment means youve got to honor your father by helping him kill an unarmed man no sir but you saved my life yesterday cy he waited until the boys gaze lifted to his thats a plain fact if youd done what he told you to do maybe hed be alive or maybe hed have gone off after caroline just the same but id be dead theres no way around that one is there no sir i guess not austin killed himself theres no way around that either cy wanted to believe that was desperate to he fought to keep his voice from breaking im not sorry hes dead im not sorry now im going to hell and burn through all eternity because when the sheriff told me he was dead i was glad christ tucker thought as he dragged on the cigarette this was getting touchy and when it came to the realms of heaven and hell he would make a poor teacher but the boy needed something more than platitudes im not much on religion myself that was a big disappointment to my mama maybe theres a hell all right christ knows theres plenty of people who deserve to do time there but when i think about it when i sit down and think real hard about it i cant see people getting sent to hell for feelings they cant help how you act how you are with other people what you make of yourself all that counts for more i think but sinful thoughts this time tucker laughed and tipping back his cap grinned at cy son if you went to hell for thoughts heaven would be a mighty lonely place to spend eternity he sobered and brushed at the boys hair i cant say why your father did the things he did but he was wrong hurting you and your ma those things werent right cy no matter how much he quoted scripture while he was at it theres no sin in feeling glad thats behind you the raw lump in cys gut began to shrink my ma shes not going to be glad you cant take on her feelings youve got your own theres something i want to put to you something i want you to think about yes sir i know delia told you you could stay on here as long as you want panic widened the boys eyes i wont be any trouble mr tucker i wont eat much i promise and ill work hard i can hold on nobodys pushing you out wondering how best to phrase it tucker tamped out his cigarette i figure vernon will take over the farm and see to your mas needs ruthannes nearly grown shes saving up to leave cy bit his lip thats a secret nothing i like better than keeping a ladys secrets now im thinking you could keep working for me parttime when school starts up again part of your pay could go to your ma to help her out and i could add room and board something swelled in his throat he didnt even recognize it as hope you mean i could move in to sweetwater for good until theres somewhere else youd rather go if its something you want cy ill do what i can to make it happen your ma would have to agree to it and thered probably be some kind of legal work to make me a kind of guardian over you youd have to want it though cy only stared afraid to hope for so much id do anything you told me i wouldnt cause you trouble well look into it i guess id better come up with some rules so you can see what youre getting into to give cy time to compose himself he heaped more pate on a cracker if hed done nothing else right this day hed taken the boys mind off his misery no drinking till youre of age no sir no wild parties unless you invite me a chuckle escaped cy and the sound had him blinking no sir no flirting with my woman women he corrected himself silently hed meant women hadnt he but he was thinking of caroline cys color rose again no sir and i wont flirt with yours he winked at the boy and grinned got yourself a girl do you cy no sir not exactly i just look sometimes is all youve got plenty of time to do more than look any girl in particular cy wet his lips there was no way he could lie to tucker it wasnt fear he realized not the way it had been with his father it was love i ah well i kind of look at leeanne hardesty she grew breasts last year it sure does make a difference tucker choked on the pate by christ it does he agreed he tiptoed onto boggy ground youre just looking well face burning cy ducked his head once in the lunch line she was behind me and somebody shoved her her breasts pushed right into my back they sure were soft and she put her arms around my waist a minute just to get her balance back and i he swallowed the shame i couldnt help it mr tucker i just couldnt stop it no matter what tucker had an image of cy tossing leeanne hardesty down on the tiles of the cafeteria and tearing in what was it that you couldnt stop well you know it just happens sometimes no matter how i try to stop it it just gets you know the tool of satan the tool of satan tucker repeated slowly he would have laughed in fact he was damn sure hed have rolled on the ground and laughed fit to kill if cy hadnt had that guiltstricken look in his eyes austin hatinger strikes again tucker thought and blew out a long breath i never heard it called that to hide the grin tucker spent a lot of time stroking his chin it seems to me since the good lord put it between your legs it has more to do with him than the other one evil thoughts and wicked women make it hard and thank god for it tucker poured more lemonade and wished it were bourbon listen son there isnt a man alive who hasnt had his pecker stiffen up on him at an inopportune moment its natural he took a slug and said a quick prayer you know ah about how babies get hatched and all that dont you yeah jim had told him all about it and he had it from his dad shes got the egg and youve got the sperm its best if youre in love and all right tucker felt a wave of sweet relief its better too if you wait till youre responsible and wasnt he a fine one to talk looking at leeanne and thinking about her breasts and doing something about it those are two different things i guess i know it was fascinating to cy to say forbidden things right out loud and not get walloped he edged in a little deeper but sometimes especially at night i even do all the states and capitals to keep my mind clear of it but it dont always work and it gets you know it feels like if i dont do something about it ill just explode he shot tucker a quick look sometimes i do its evil isnt it to work on yourself that way tucker scratched his head seems to me a mans got to take matters into his own hand so to speak now and again i dont know that id recommend it as a habit but when an itch just wont go away it makes sense to scratch it but dont things happen to you if you do you dont go blind or grow hair on your palms if thats what you mean you sure this time tucker had to grin he lifted his hands examined the palms with care positive he said and was gratified when cy grinned back burnss room in innocence was small and spartan as accommodations went it was merely adequate he was pleased that nancy koons kept it spotless though and since he always left a few telltales he was satisfied that no one came in without his knowledge or went through his things everything pertinent to the case was locked in his briefcase unless he was actively working he had a twinsize bed a chest of drawers and a chifforobe it had taken him three days to convince nancy koons to find him a desk and a sturdy chair the ceiling fan puffed at the hot air this inadequate system had prompted burns to procure an electric fan from larssonss since hed been fortunate enough to be given one of the two rooms with an adjoining bath he concluded that he had everything necessary for his stay he hadnt expected the bonus stretched beneath him on the iron bed was josie longstreet burns was still shuddering from their second bout for the life of him he wasnt sure how theyd gone from sharing a lemonade at the diner to bouncing on the squeaky mattress but he wasnt complaining he hadnt had that kind of wild ripping sex since actually he supposed hed never had that kind of sex the women he dated were cool and composed in bed and out five seconds after josie had dashed up the back stairs ahead of him shed been pawing at his clothes over his head josie held up her newly painted nails scarlet sin this time she found it wonderfully appropriate experimentally she raked her nails down his back watching the red enamel flow over his white skin like blood honey she said you just about wore me out i knew there was a tiger inside that suit you were fabulous burns knew women expected compliments at such times but words nearly failed him incredible ive had my eye on you special agent something about a man with a badge turns me on fierce she thought of burke and frowned at the ceiling you think im sexy i think he lifted his head youre the sexiest woman alive that made her smile and grant him a nibbling kiss and pretty too no not pretty he said too busy playing with her hair to see the flash in her eyes gorgeous like some wild gypsy the flash died into pleasure youre just saying that because im stark naked and your peckers twitching normally his sensibilities would have been offended but she was quite right about the state of his tool of satan im saying it because its true youre dazzling josie i sure like the way you talk she sighed as he began to nuzzle her breasts sweat and sex made her skin sticky though the fan was aimed directly at the bed still josie had always figured the best way to beat the heat was to lie down naked and if you were going to lie down naked you might as well do something about it not all men know how to say what women like to hear you take my first husband franklin after wed been married a month or two and the bloom had worn off so to speak hed finish up grunt then start snoring lots of men are like that they just take what they want then pass on his response was muffled against her breast she let him enjoy himself a womans entitled to pretty words course all women dont care about that somere just after the same thing some men are after appreciating pretty words is the difference between a tramp and a lady i think youre an incredible lady her smile glowed and youre a real gentleman smart too i love hearing you talk about your cases lazily she stroked his flanks but i guess youll be going back north soon she snuggled down to find his lips with hers its an awful shame that you and i got together right before you have to leave actually things do seem to be winding up i knew it the first time i saw you i knew youd solve everything i could just see how smart you were i said to myself now that hes here we womenll be safe again she danced her tongue over his youre a hero matthew im just doing my job he preened as she rolled over on top of him its all been very standard really catching a murderer she skimmed her lips over his chest though he was white as a fish she thought he had a nice build why nobody had figured out anything before you came along its simply a matter of having the experience the proper equipment i just love your equipment she purred wrapping her fingers around him tell me how you did it matthew it just makes me shiver his breath started to catch as she guided those clever fingers over him first you have to understand the psychology of a serial killer their patterns the stages statistics most murders are committed on impulse and for a few standard reasons tell me she pressed her lips to his belly it makes me so hot passion he managed as a red haze coated his vision greed revenge those arent the motives of the serial killer for him its control power the hunt the kill itself isnt as important as the anticipation the stalking yes she licked gently along his inner thigh she was doing some stalking of her own and the anticipation was rising like a hot river in a summer flood dont stop he plans feeds on the plan he chooses and he hunts all the time he does he may lead a perfectly normal life have a family a career friendships but the need to kill drives him after he destroys his victim the need to kill begins to build again and the desire for control of course his hand fisted in her hair as she took him into her mouth taunting the authorities even using them burns began to pant as she sucked him deep he may want to be caught he may even suffer from guilt but his hunger outweighs everything she slid sinuously up his body straddling him so he kills again until you stop him yes and youre going to stop him this time hes already been stopped she lifted her hands to her hair combing it back arching her breasts to him how unless other evidence comes to the surface ill report this case closed with austin hatingers death josie shuddered as she lifted her hips and took him deep inside her youre a hero special agent my hero she threw back her head and started the hard ride to paradise chapter twentyone a storm was moving in the evening was cooling as it approached and for the first time in days a real breeze ruffled leaves and brought the sweet scent of rain to the air dusk came early as the sun hid behind rough pewter clouds in the west heat lightning popped and fizzled even knowing the storm might be a nasty one knocking down power lines and swelling riverbanks the delta sighed with relief darleen fuller talbot left her mothers in a foul temper happy had smiled and cuddled scooter even as shed raked darleen to the bone over billy t her father was no better she thought as she slammed her car door shut all he could do was shake his head and leave the room darleen had suffered through twenty minutes of listening to her mother ramble on about how junior was a decent man who hadnt deserved to be betrayed in his own home well it was her home too and her signature on the mortage she pouted wiping away angry tears before she started the car nobody gave any thought to that no it was poor junior this and poor junior that nobody cared that poor junior was treating her worse than the dirt you brushed under the rug was it any wonder she was beginning to miss billy t to distraction her own husband wouldnt even sleep in the same bed with her anymore not that hed done much but sleep in it even before the trouble started but now she was going to bed every night as dry and frustrated as an old maiden aunt she was going to fix that all right as the first fat drops of rain splattered the windshield she set her chin happy would have recognized the look and though it might have surprised darleen would have wholeheartedly approved scooter was going to stay with his grandma overnight and she was going to see to it that her husband did her duty by her if things didnt turn around soon she might as well become one of those papist nuns and go live in a convent going without was making her jumpy darleen thought switching on the wipers as the rain began to batter her car junior had interrupted billy t before hed come close to finishing her off by her calculations darleen had been celibate for more than a week it wasnt healthy thats why she was so nervous and irritable she was sure for days shed had the edgy feeling someone was watching her it was more than the smug looks shed been getting from some of the town biddies as the story made the rounds it was more like someone was keeping a bead on her and there were the phone calls too the calls when nobody was there after you picked up probably junior keeping tabs on her she thought he probably had one of his buddies watching the house too in case billy t came around as if billy t would speak to her now it didnt seem fair that she lost her boyfriend her husband and had to listen to her mothers lectures all because shed wanted to have a little fun she skidded on the wet road and slowed to a crawl she wasnt going to put up with it anymore crying hadnt worked and shed cried buckets keeping the house nice and putting a hot meal on the table every night hadnt done much good either junior just ate whatever she put in front of him and went off to play with scooter tonight he was going to play with his wife she knew just how to set the stage there was that new nightgown shed mailordered for billy ts benefit but that didnt matter shed spent the best part of the afternoon in the style rite getting her hair washed and set shed even suffered through having betty pruett wax her eyebrows and the little fuzz over her top lip all that was left was to set the stage she had that bayberryscented candle left over from christmas a randy travis album and a bottle of cold duck junior got positively romantic after a couple of glasses of cold duck once she got him back in bed hed forget all about billy t and his manly pride shed be his devoted wife and if she ever took on a boyfriend again shed be a damn sight more careful she almost didnt hit the brakes in time the curtain of rain obscured the road so that she didnt see the car sitting across it until it was nearly too late her tires slipped and skidded she gave a quick squeal as she fishtailed sideways when the bumpers barely kissed she sat back one hand over her speeding heart goddamn she squinted through the windshield but could see no one just the abandoned car stretched diagonally across the road well isnt this just fine and dandy shakily she pushed open her door and stepped out into the storm instantly her hair was plastered over her eyes so that she had to scrape it back twentytwo seventyfive shot to hell she shouted to the rain chrissakes howm i supposed to get my husband back if i go home looking like a drowned cat she thought that over decided it might work to her advantage on the sympathy scale but if she wanted junior to fuss and pet because shed got caught in the rain she had to get home first hands on hips she kicked the tire of the car blocking the road how the hells anybody supposed to get around that the prospect of turning around and going back to her mothers was so daunting she ignored the rain and walked around the car to find a solution she was looking through the window hoping to see keys in the ignition when she heard the sound behind her her heart leapt into her throat then settled again when she recognized the familiar form coming through the rain thought this was your car she shouted these roads are so wet i nearly plowed right through juniord have skinned me alive if idve wrecked this car ill save him the trouble darleen never saw the tire iron that smashed over her head the power flickered on and off before finally wheezing out during a particularly robust clap of thunder caroline had prepared by setting emergency candles and oil lamps in every room she didnt mind the dark or the storm in fact she relished them she was hoping the phone lines would go as well so that she could stop having to answer the sympathetic and curious calls that had hounded her throughout the day but if the power stayed off through the night she didnt want to have to stumble blindly through the house taking a chance on meeting austin hatingers grinning ghost she watched the rain and the wind from the cover of the porch while useless cowered inside whimpering it was a powerful show with barely a tree to stop it the wind roared across the flats and rattled shingles jiggled windows hooted through grass she didnt know whether this violent a rain was good or bad for the crops though she was certain shed be told all about it when she drove into town for now it was enough just to watch to be awed to know there was a dry candlelit house behind her waiting to offer sanctuary shelter she corrected herself and smiled what would the good doctor palamo have to say about her use of the word sanctuary a reflex reaction she decided she was no longer running or hiding for the first time in her life she was just living or trying to shed certainly hidden from tucker that morning shed accepted sex but turned away intimacy because shed needed to prove she was alive and had been afraid to feel surprised by the chill she rubbed her arms it had been enough for both of them he had wanted her she had wanted him it wasnt worth worrying about closing her eyes she took a deep gulp of air there was a trace of ozone from the last spear of lightning exhilarating the puppy yelped at the ensuing blast of thunder and she laughed all right useless ill save you she found him in the parlor with his nose peeking out from the skirt of the couch murmuring to him she gathered him up and walked him like a baby while he shivered it wont last long storms never do they just come along to shake us up and make us appreciate the quiet times how about some music huh i feel like music she set him in a chair then picked up her violin passionate i think she ran the bow experimentally across the strings pausing to tune by ear passionate to match the mood she started with tchaikovsky flowed into a movement from beethovens ninth then tried out one of the tunes jim had taught her before ending with her own rousing interpretation of lady madonna dusk had fallen into full dark when she stopped the knock on the door had her jumping but it sent useless streaking out of the room up the stairs and under her bed maybe i should send him into combat training after setting the violin aside she walked out in the hall tucker stared back at her through the screen she found her competent hands suddenly restless and linked them together to keep them still its a rough night to be out i know arent you going to come in not yet she stepped closer his hair was dripping it reminded her how hed looked after his shower that morning how long have you been out there i drove up right before you went from that longhair music into salty dog that was salty dog wasnt it her smile came and went quickly jim taught me were exchanging techniques i heard about that tobys real pleased hes looking into getting the boy a secondhand fiddle hes talented she said and felt foolish why were they discussing jim with the screen door between them the ah power went out i know come outside a minute caroline she hesitated he seemed so serious so deliberate has anything happened not that ive heard he pulled open the screen come outside all right she stepped through nerves jumping i was wondering before if this rain is good or bad for the crops i mean i didnt come by to talk about planting or about music if it comes to that he dipped his hands in his pockets and together they watched lightning stalk the sky i have to ask you about this morning why dont you let me get you a beer she stepped back one hand reaching for the screen i picked some up the other day caroline his eyes glowed against the dark stopping her cold why didnt you let me touch you i dont know what you mean she pushed a nervous hand through her hair i did let you we made love right in there on that couch you let me have you but you didnt let me touch you theres a difference a great big difference she stiffened the regal look she sent him nearly made him smile if youve come out here to criticize my performance im not criticizing im asking he moved toward her but didnt reach out but i think you just said it it was a performance maybe you needed to act out something that told you you were alive god knows you had cause to im asking you if thats all you want ive got more and i need to give you more if youll take it i dont know not just if i want to but if i can i can leave you alone if you need to think about it otherwise you only have to ask me in he lifted a hand to her cheek just ask me in caroline not just into the house she realized into her physically emotionally she closed her eyes for a moment when she opened them again he was still standing waiting im not a good bet a smile softened his lips hell sugar neither am i she took a deep breath then stepped aside to open the screen id like you to come in he let out the air hed been holding the moment he was over the threshold he turned and swept her off her feet tucker it was good enough for rhett butler he kissed her into silence before starting up the steps he might not have had ashley to worry about but by god tonight she wasnt going to think of luis or anyone else youre wet she told him then rested her head on his shoulder ill give you a chance to get me out of my clothes she laughed how easy it was she thought if you let it be youre so good to me i can be better he stopped in the doorway to indulge in another long lingering kiss i cant wait to see how this time youll have to wait shadows and candlelight danced over the walls heat trapped throughout the day settled into the room like an old friend smugly overriding the wind that whipped the old lace curtains there was the smell of candle wax of lavender sachet of the rain that dampened the screens and rapped fitfully against the tin roof with his mouth teasing hers he laid her on the bed his fingertips traced lightly over her face followed by his lips coaxing the tension away then there was only the sound of the rain of her sigh of the grumble of thunder as the storm moved east her arms rose up to welcome him he lingered there mouth pressed to mouth the scrape of teeth the sultry mating of tongues until she was sunk deep in the peace and pleasure he offered there was no choice now but to feel he was subtly slowly nudging her emotions to the surface they were battering at her making her pulse tremble her muscles go limp her heart stutter a quick flash of panic had her turning her head away he contented himself with the column of her throat and his hands as skillful as any musicians began to move over her he soothed even as he enticed he could feel the war between need and doubt being waged through her he could see the same conflict in her face keeping his own desire at bay he patiently even compassionately seduced long stirring kisses lazy languid caresses as her body melted against his as his name tumbled from her lips he realized he wasnt blocking his desire at all this was exactly what he wanted their eyes met held as he undressed her naked vulnerable they both understood the two words were interchangeable and that this single act took what was happening beyond that frantic halfdressed coupling on the couch with unsteady hands she pulled off his damp shirt let her fingertips trail over his chest down to his belly she felt the warm glow of triumph when his muscles quivered under that hesitant touch after one sharp breath she unsnapped his jeans sitting up so that she could peel them over his hips and away then they were kneeling in the center of the bed the mattress groaning as it sagged the heat pouring back as the wind died and the rain slowed to a patter her hands linked around his waist his dived into her hair surprise and a flicker of fear flashed into her eyes as he dragged her head back the look darkened to passion as he crushed her lips with his this was the beast that prowled beneath his veneer of lazy affability she could all but feel it roar through him snapping at its leash threatening to devour both of them in one savage gulp her fingers dug into his hips then went limp as he molded her to him he was telling her something but his harsh whisper was lost in the beat of her blood yes this was what he wanted everything he wanted to feel her go pliant with pleasure to taste the hot need on her mouth to hear that soft helpless sound she made deep in her throat as she lost herself in him to know that she thought of nothing and no one but him caroline he steadied himself by pressing his lips to her shoulder letting his teeth run over that scented curve theres something i need to do yes she reached for him but he caught her wrists no not that not yet with his eyes on her he pressed her back so that his body covered hers he nipped at her lips tormenting rather than satisfying what i need to do now he caught her chin lightly between his teeth then gently but purposefully captured her hands is drive you crazy tucker if i let you run those hands over me just now thisll all be over much too quickly he slid down circling her breasts with slow openmouthed kisses theres an old southern tradition he rolled his tongue lazily over her nipple and watched her eyes cloud over that if somethings worth doing its worth taking your sweet time her hands flexed desperately under his as he shifted to her other breast i cant sure you can darlin he drew her into his mouth until she cried out then gently released her im going to show you after if you decide you dont like it well try again she writhed her head turning restlessly on the pillow as the flood of sensation began to rise with lips and teeth and tongue he savored the air was too thick to breathe she fought it into her lungs hissed it out again through trembling lips but even as her mind struggled against total submission her body was betraying her it reveled in the hot primal glory of being taken it shuddered and strained toward the wild release he held just out of reach damp flesh slid over damp flesh as he glided down her as much a prisoner as she a moan dragged out of her seductive on the sultry air he rubbed his cheek on her belly the anticipation of intimacy swimming in his head like fine wine once he would have said he knew all there was to know about pleasure once he would have denied that the pleasure was much different with one woman than with another but it was carolines scent teasing his senses her sobbing breaths quickening his heartbeat her soft pale skin quivering under his lips and everything was different she arched and bucked when he slid his tongue over the sensitive crease of her thigh he lingered inches away from the core of heat torturing them both until he felt her body stiffen freeze then go lax the first ragged climax left her limp she was floating now weightless no longer aware of the room or the heat only of staggering relief her lips curved freed her hands stroked down her own dazzled body skimming over skin slicked with sweat until they brushed through his hair i guess i liked it after all she managed to say were not through yet he cupped his hands under her hips lifted them and devoured her he shot her from contentment back into the storm so quickly the breath strangled in her throat her groping hands slid off his damp shoulders to grip desperately at the sheets wave after wave of titanic sensations battered her until there was only greed his and her own he was done with the gentle teasing and the hands that had flowed over her like silk over velvet sought and demanded with a ruthlessness that was as arousing as it was unexpected there were dark pleasures here dark secret pleasures that were born on hot summer nights together they thrashed over the bed wallowing in them as freely as animals coupling in the grass he fought the tide back one last time dragging her with him with hands that shook look at me his chest heaved with each breath as he braced himself over her caroline look at me her eyes fluttered open the irises dark as midnight this is more he lowered his mouth to hers and the words were muffled against her lips as he plunged into her this is more spent she lay drowsing content with tuckers weight there were a few aches beginning to make themselves known but even that made her smile shed always considered herself an adequate lover though at the end luis had certainly disagreed but shed never felt quite so smug before she gave a little sigh and stretched with a grunt tucker rolled to reverse positions better he asked when she lay on top of him her head on his chest it was fine before she smiled again just fine another sigh and she opened heavy eyes after a moments bafflement she realized they were sprawled over the foot of the bed how did we get down here dexterity give me a few minutes and we can work our way up to the other end hmm she pressed her lips to his chest the rain stopped only its even hotter than before we might have had something to do with that caroline roused herself to lift her head you know what i want honey once i get my energy back ill do my best to give you anything you want ill remember that but she lowered her mouth to his what i want right now what i really need right now is ice cream she grinned down at him want some ice cream tucker i might be able to choke some down now that you mention it he had an amusing little fantasy about licking strawberry surprise off some interesting parts of her anatomy you going to bring it up here that was my plan after indulging in another kiss she slid out of bed to root in the closet for her robe one scoop or two his teeth flashed as she crossed the robe over her breasts im a twoscoop man myself want some help i think i can manage good he tucked his hands behind his head and closed his eyes caroline walked out certain hed take advantage of the lull with a nap in the kitchen she scooped up ice cream by lamplight it occurred to her that this was a moment that would cling in her memory the sultry kitchen the smell of rain and lamp oil the strong healthy afterglow of loving spooning up ice cream to be eaten in bed she was humming to herself as she carried the bowls back down the hall even the shrill interruption of the phone couldnt dampen her mood she set down one bowl and cocking the receiver between her shoulder and ear dug into the other with her spoon hello caroline thank goodness the spoon stopped on its way to her lips caroline dropped it back in the bowl and put the bowl on the table apparently there was one thing that could dampen her mood her mothers voice hello mother ive been trying to reach you for over an hour they had trouble with the lines which is no surprise considering the kind of service down there we had a storm how are you and dad were both fine your fathers on a quick trip to new york but i had several engagements and couldnt accompany him georgia waverly spoke quickly without a trace of the delta shed worked so hard to rid from her voice and her heart its you im worried about she continued and caroline could imagine her at her rosewood desk in the immaculate and tasteful sitting room checking off her daughters name on one of her innumerable lists order flowers attend charity luncheon worry about caroline the image brought a nasty tug of guilt theres nothing to worry about nothing i was attending a dinner party at the fulbrights this evening and i had to hear from carter that my daughter was attacked i wasnt hurt caroline said quickly i know that georgia snapped back testy at the interruption carter explained everything which is more than you bothered to do i told you all along you had no business going down there but you refused to listen now im told and by the way i dont appreciate hearing about all of this over my soup that youre embroiled in some kind of murder investigation im sorry caroline closed her eyes apologies became the bill of fare when she dealt with her mother it all happened so fast and its over a movement on the stairs had her glancing up she saw tucker and wearily turned away carter made it quite clear thats simply not true you know he owns the local nbc affliliate here in philadelphia he said the story was already running and that several news crews were flying down to cover it at the scene naturally when your name was leaked it became hot news oh christ i beg your pardon nothing she passed a hand through her hair be reasonable she warned herself somehow she had to be reasonable i am sorry you heard about this from someone else and i know the publicity will annoy you i cant help the press mother any more than i can help the reason for it im sorry if this upsets you of course it upsets me wasnt it bad enough that we had to play down the scandal of you being hospitalized dropping your summer schedule your public estrangement from luis yes caroline said dryly that must have been very difficult for you it was inconsiderate of me to collapse that way dont use that tone with me if you hadnt let yourself become overwrought about a minor disagreement with luis none of it would have happened and now this business of going down there burying yourself in that place im not buried wasting your talent georgia plowed over carolines protests like a blade through soft dirt humiliating yourself and your family do you think ive had a single restful night knowing youre there alone unprotected caroline began to rub at the ache in her temple ive been alone for years georgia never heard the statement or the wistfulness behind it and now well you might have been raped or murdered oh yes and that would have been dreadful publicity there was a brief pause that was uncalled for caroline yes it was she pressed her thumb and forefinger against her eyes and repeated the usual litany im sorry perhaps im still shaken by what happened are you going to ask what happened mother are you going to ask how i feel what i need or only how i behaved i understand and i expect you to understand my feelings as well i insist that you come home immediately i am home dont be ridiculous you dont belong there any more than i did i raised you better than that caroline your father and i gave you every advantage i wont see you throw it all away over some sort of pique pique well thats an interesting way of putting it mother i can only say im sorry i cant do what you want or be what you want i dont know how this strain of stubbornness developed but its very unattractive no doubt luis found it equally so but hes more tolerant than i hes terribly concerned hes are you telling me you called him that you went against my express wishes and called him a childs wishes arent always the same as that childs best interests in any case i wanted to speak to him about your white house performance in september caroline pressed a hand to her stomach where the knot was tightening i stopped being a child the first time you pushed me out onstage and i dont need his opinion on my performance im not surprised by your attitude ive come to expect this kind of ingratitude georgias voice tightened caroline could picture her drumming her carefully manicured nails on the polished surface of the desk i can only hope that when luis contacts you youll display better manners you and i are both well aware that he was the best thing that could have happened to you he understood your artistic temperament he understood my pitiful naïveté i suppose it makes no difference to you that i found him boffing the flutist in his dressing room your language is as crude as your surroundings it can get cruder ive had enough of this nonsense i insist you come home we have no more than a matter of weeks as it is to prepare for your appearance at the white house and of course you gave no thought at all to your dress ive had to find the time to consult with your designer now this new publicity its very detrimental sos a knife through the heart caroline thought it isnt necessary for you to take on any work she said carefully ive already spoken to frances and finalized the plans ill be flying into dc for the performance and flying out again the next day as for my costume my wardrobe is more than adequate already have you lost your senses this is one of the most important steps of your career ive already started arranging interviews photo sessions then youll have to unarrange caroline said briefly and let me assure you mother that im alive and well the man who attacked me is dead i killed him myself so i should know caroline please give dad my love good night delicately she set the receiver back on the hook she waited a full minute wanting to be sure she could speak without screaming the ice creams melted picking up the bowls she walked back into the kitchen to dump them in the sink chapter twentytwo it seemed to be his day for soothing feelings and easing guilt tucker wondered how a man could get through most of his life riding just above the surface of troubled waters then find himself neckdeep in the swirl carolines emotions still sizzled in the air it was as if someone had tossed a live wire into those churning waters where it would snap and spark he wished he had a cigarette but the pack was upstairs probably drenched by his wet shirt he looked up those shadowy stairs not without longing for the peace and solitude of the bedroom then back toward the kitchen where the lamplight flickered and tension brewed when he went into the kitchen she was standing at the sink looking out the window much as she had the morning after burnss visit only this time she was facing the dark tucker didnt want her to face it alone he walked up behind her felt a wave of frustration when her shoulders stiffened at his touch you know my usual routine on finding myself with a broody woman would be to make some joke and talk her back into bed if that didnt work id find the quickest way to the door despite her resistance he began to knead her rigid shoulders the usual doesnt seem to have much to do with you i wouldnt mind a joke right now he laid his brow on the back of her head wasnt it a damn shame he couldnt think of one he mused or of anything except what was hurting her talk to me caroline with a restless movement she switched on the tap to wash the sink clear theres nothing to say as he lifted his head he could see the ghost of their reflection in the black window glass he knew she could see it too but he wondered if she knew how fragile it was how easily wiped away when you walked downstairs a few minutes ago i could still feel the way youd been lying there with me all soft and easy now youre all tied up in knots i dont like seeing you this way its nothing to do with you the speed with which he whirled her around surprised them both as did the barely restrained violence in his voice you want to use me for sex and leave out everything else then make it plain right now if what went on between us upstairs was just a tussle on hot sheets for you then say so and well play this your way but it was more for me he gave her a quick shake as if to rattle the wall shed thrown up between them dammit its never been like that before dont pressure me eyes blazing she shoved against his chest my whole life ive had to tolerate other people pressuring me im done with that youre not done with me if you think you can take a few swipes and send me out the door youre wrong im sticking to prove his point he pressed his lips to hers in a hard possessive kiss were both going to start to get used to it i dont have to get used to anything i can say yes or i can say no or i can she broke off squeezing her eyes shut oh why am i fighting with you its not you after a deep breath she slipped away from him its not you tucker its me shouting at you isnt going to make it go away i dont mind you shouting much if it makes you feel better she smiled rubbing absently at her temple i think one of dr palamos miracle pills would do a better job of it lets try something else catching her hands he drew her to a chair you sit here while i pour us a couple of glasses of that wine i brought you a while back then you tell me why that phone call got you all het up het up she sat closing her eyes again that expression covers a lot of ground doesnt it my mother would say overwrought but i like het up when she opened her eyes there was the faintest hint of amusement in them ive been het up quite a bit over the last months that was my mother on the phone i got the drift of that he drew the cork on the wine and that she was overwrought about what happened yesterday yes indeed particularly since it was a topic of conversation at a dinner party she attended gossips a habit of yankees too though my mothers crowd would call it socializing but she was most particularly upset since the press has picked up the scent and i have an important engagement pending shes afraid the president and the soviet premier might not want to hear mozarts violin concerto number five played by a woman who so recently shot someones face off she accepted the glass tucker held out and offered a quick toast georgia waverlys daughter caroline isnt supposed to attract unsavory publicity what would the womens league think could be she was scared for you could be oh to give her her due she wouldnt want anything to happen to me she does love me in her way its just that her way is so difficult to live up to she sipped her wine and it was cold and tart and bracing shes always wanted the best for me her idea of the best ive spent my entire life trying to give her that then i had to take a hard look and admit that i couldnt give her that anymore people get comfortable with the way things are he sat beside her with the oil lamp flickering on the table between them it might take her a while longer to accept that youve changed the rules or she might never accept it thats something else i have to understand cradling the glass in both hands caroline looked around the room the old refrigerator thudded then began its whining hum rain was dripping musically from the gutter worn linoleum and faded curtains she thought the lamplight was kind to the room as it would have been to a tired woman caroline found that incredibly comforting i love this place she murmured despite everything thats happened i feel right here and i need what i need to belong somewhere i need the simplicity the continuity that doesnt sound like something you should apologize for so hed heard it she thought with a grim little smile it was still there that habitual tone of apology whenever she took something for herself no its not im working on that you see shed never understand what im saying to you what im feeling and she certainly cant understand what i need then i guess it comes down to pleasing her or pleasing yourself ive come to that conclusion myself but its difficult when pleasing myself alienates her so completely she grew up in this house tucker shes ashamed of that shes ashamed that her father chopped cotton for a living and that her mother canned jellies ashamed of where she came from and of the two people who gave her life and did the best they could to make that life a good one thats something for her to deal with not you but its because of that shame that im here at all it connects us i guess thats what families do and you dont really have any choice about your link in the chain maybe not but you can choose what comes after you and what comes after is still bound with what came before she never gave me a chance to know my grandparents they did without a lot of things so that she could go to college in philadelphia i didnt hear that from my mother she added and there was bitter regret in her voice i heard it from happy fuller my grandmother took in laundry sewing did what the ladies call fancy work to sell all to scrape together pennies for tuition they didnt have to pay it long which was a blessing i suppose she met my father during the first semester hes often told me how hed tried to weasel out of the blind date his roommate had hooked him into and how the moment he set eyes on my mother he fell in love do you ever picture your parents that way on their first date falling in love my father set his sights on mama when she was barely twelve years old she made him wait six years mine moved quicker they were married before my mother finished her first year of college the waverlys were an old established family in philadelphia my father was already destined for corporate law i know it must have been difficult for her trying to fit into that niche of society but for as long as i can remember shes been more of a snob than any of the waverlys a house in the best part of town clothes from the most exclusive designers the proper vacations at the proper resorts in the proper season most people tend to overcompensate when theyve got something to prove oh she had a lot to prove and in short order she produced a child to help her prove it i had a nanny to deal with the messier aspects of child rearing but mother took care of decorum behavior attitudes she used to send for me and id go into her sitting room it always smelled of hothouse roses and chanel she would instruct me patiently on what was expected of a waverly tucker reached out to touch her hair what was expected of a waverly perfection thats a tough one being a longstreet my daddy just expected me to be a man course that was in big tall capital letters and his ideas and mine veered apart after a while he didnt use the parlor either tucker remembered the woodshed was his style oh mother never raised a hand to me she didnt have to it was her idea that i take up the violin she thought it was classy i should be grateful for that caroline said with a sigh but then it wasnt enough that i play well i had to be the best fortunately for me i had talent a prodigy they called me by the time i was ten that word made me cringe she picked out my music my instructors my recital clothes the same way she picked out my friends then i began to tour just sporadically at first because of my age there were tutors and the touring increased by the time i was sixteen the path had been set for nearly twelve more years i kept to it did you want to the fact that he would ask made her smile no one else ever had whenever i began to think i had a choice she would be there in person by phone in a letter it was almost as if she could sense that little seed of rebellion beginning to take root shed just nip it off id let her why i wanted her to love me her eyes filled but she blinked the tears away and i was afraid she didnt i was sure she wouldnt if i wasnt perfect ashamed she brushed at a tear that had crept through her defenses that sounds pathetic no he wiped the tear away himself it only sounds sad for your mother she took a shaky breath like a swimmer struggling toward shore about three years ago i met luis in london he was the most brilliant maestro ive ever worked with he was young thirtytwo when i met him and hed built a flashy reputation in europe he conducted an orchestra the way a matador dominates a bull ring decisive arrogant sexual he was physically stunning and magnetic i get the picture she laughed a little i was twentyfive id never been with a man tucker had started to drink but set the glass down youd never rolled in the hay the stunned expression on his face had her lips quirking but the smile didnt last no when i was growing up my mother kept me on a very short leash and i didnt have the nerve to strain against it very often when i required an escort to some affair she chose him you could say that her taste and mine didnt mesh i wasnt particularly interested in the men she found suitable thats why you like me he leaned over to give her a kiss id turn her hair white actually i never thought about it another first for me pleased with the idea she tapped her wineglass against his later when i began to tour by myself my schedule was rugged and i was the terms repressed he thought about the woman whod just tumbled over the bed with him uhhuh she hadnt realized sarcasm could be soothing my sexuality was tied up in my music i certainly didnt believe i was the kind of woman whod just fall into bed with the first attractive man who crooked his finger my way she reached for the wine bottle within thirtysix hours of my first rehearsal with luis he proved me wrong she shrugged and drank he overwhelmed me flowers soulful looks desperate promises of undying love he couldnt exist without me his life had been meaningless before id come into it he gave me the works i should add that my mother adored him he came from spanish aristocracy suitable tucker said oh eminently when i had to leave london for paris he phoned me every day sent small charming gifts gorgeous flowers he rushed to berlin to join me for a weekend it continued that way for more than a year and if i heard rumors that he was romancing some actress or cuddling with a socialite i ignored it i thought it was vicious gossip oh maybe i suspected something but if i so much as hinted to him that id heard something he flew into a rage at my unwarranted jealousy my possessiveness my lack of selfesteem and my work kept me occupied id just signed a contract for a brutal sixmonth tour she lasped into silence thinking back the airports hotels rehearsals performances the flu shed picked up in sydney and hadnt shaken off until tokyo the strained conversations with luis the promises the disappointments and the news clipping someone had left on her dressing room table with the picture of luis embracing a gorgeous french actress theres no point in going into every miserable detail but the tour was relentless my relationship with luis began to unravel and my confidence my personal confidence hit the skids luis and i ended things with an ugly scene full of accusations and tears his accusations my tears at that point in my life i hadnt learned to fight well tucker laid a hand over hers then you learned fast once i make up my mind im a quick study too bad it took me nearly twentyeight years to make up my mind when luis and i parted ways i wanted to take some time off but id already been committed to all these guest appearances and a special for cable tv my healthit was difficult to admit it even now no matter how illogical it was she was still embarrassed by the illness well it deteriorated and i wait what do you mean deteriorated uncomfortable she shifted and began to toy with the stem of her glass headaches i was used to having headaches but they became more chronic and severe i lost some weight my appetite suffered because nothing seemed to settle well insomnia and the resulting fatigue why didnt you take care of yourself i thought i was just being indulgent temperamental and i had responsibilities people were depending on me to perform and to perform well i couldnt just she cut herself off with a short laugh excuses as the wise dr palamo would say truth i was hiding out using my work to escape the repression wasnt just sexual id been taught to behave properly to present a certain image and to live up to my potential and as my mother would say feeling unwell is no reason for a lady to act unwell it was easier to ignore the symptoms than to face them when i was taping the tv special in new york my mother came up escorted by luis i was so angry so hurt i walked off the set she smiled a little then the smile became a laugh id never done a thing like that in my life beneath the anger and hurt was this little nugget of triumph i had taken control id acted on impulse on pure emotion and the world hadnt come to a screeching halt it was a very heady five minutes she couldnt sit any longer simply couldnt and pushed away from the table to roam the room that was how long it took her to swirl into my dressing room and read me her version of the riot act i was behaving like a spoiled child an insufferable artist a prima donna i tried to tell her that i felt betrayed that shed brought him along but she just ran right over me i was rude foolish ungrateful luis was ready to forgive me for being willful and overly sensitive and mindlessly jealous and here i was turning up my nose of course i apologized for what for whatever she wanted me to apologize for caroline said with a wave of her hand after all she wanted only the best for me shed seen that i had the best shed worked and sacrificed so that i could have a brilliant career i guess your talent didnt count caroline let out a deep breath trying to expel some of the bitterness along with the air she cant help it tucker im still working on accepting that and im almost there there was a time i couldnt help it either luis came to my hotel suite that evening he was charming sweet full of regrets and explanations it had been the strain of being without me for so long not that that was an excuse for his unfaithfulness he assured me but hed been so lonely so vulnerable and my doubts and questions had only added to the strain the other women they had only been substitutes for me she snatched her glass off the table can you imagine a woman with a single working brain cell falling for that tucker took a chance and smiled at her yeah she stopped stared at him then began to laugh of course you would and of course i did he was still the only man whod ever made love to me maybe if id had a few flings myself i wouldnt have been so ready to fall back into the pattern maybe if id had the same confidence in myself as a woman that i had as a musician id have shown him the door but i agreed to put all the mistakes behind us to start fresh we even talked about marriage oh in a very distant diluted sort of way when the time was right he would say when things fell into place and because he asked me i committed to another tour a little surprised she looked down at her wine im getting drunk thats all right ill drive tell me the rest she leaned back against the counter luis would be the conductor i the featured artist it would be grueling of course but wed be together and wasnt that the important thing dr palamo i had just started to see him advised against it what i needed was rest and quiet i had this nasty little ulcer you see and the headaches insomnia fatigue it was all stress and he made it quite clear that going right back on the road would only make matters worse i didnt listen he should have tossed you into a hospital and chained you to a bed hed like you amused she sipped more wine my mother threw a party the night before we left she was in her element and had a grand time hinting that it was really an engagement party luis responded to that with a lot of winking and hearty laughter and off we went as i said luis is a brilliant conductor demanding moody but absolutely brilliant we started in europe triumphant after the first week he moved into his own suite my insomnia made it difficult for him to get much rest slimy bastard not slimy caroline corrected him meticulously slick very slick the rest ill go along with on a professional level he was a tremendous asset to me he pushed me musically he said i was the finest artist hed ever worked with but i could be better he would mold me sculpt me why didnt he buy himself some playdoh she chuckled i wish id asked to give him his due he never once stinted on his dedication to improving my performance he did start to slide when it came to treating me like a woman i started to feel like an instrument something he would tune and polish and restring i was so tired and sick and unsure it annoyed the hell out of him when id turn up for rehearsal looking exhausted and frail it annoyed me too it annoyed me to see those pitying glances from the other musicians the road crew i performed well really well most of the tour is just a haze of theaters and hotel rooms but i know i performed as well as i ever had perhaps better than i ever will again i picked up some sort of infection along the way and lived on antibiotics and fruit juice and music we stopped sleeping together completely he said i was simply not giving him my best and he was right then he assured me that when the tour was over wed go away so i lived on that the end of the tour the two of us lying on some warm beach together but i didnt make it to the end of the tour we were in toronto threequarters done i was awfully sick and i was afraid i wouldnt get through the nights performance id fainted in my dressing room it scared me to wake up and find myself lying on the floor jesus christ caroline he started to get up but she shook her head it sounds worse than it was i wasnt an invalid i was just so tired and i had one of those vicious headaches that make you want to curl up in a ball and cry i kept thinking it was only one performance only one and if i went to him if i explained hed understand so i went to him but he was also lying on his dressing room floor only he was lying on top of the flutist they never even saw me she said half to herself then shrugged just as well i wasnt strong enough to face a confrontation anyway i went on that night a stellar performance three encores standing ovations six curtain calls there might have been more but when the curtain came down the last time so did i the next thing i remember i was waking up in the hospital someone should have put him in the hospital it wasnt him he was just one more symptom it was me me and my pitiful need to do what was expected of me luis hadnt made me sick i had done it diagnosis exhaustion with a restless movement of her shoulders she walked back to the table to pour more wine carefully shaking out the last drops i found that humiliating somehow it wouldnt have been as bad if id had a tumor or some rare exotic disease they ran scads of tests poked and prodded and scanned but it all came down to plain old exhaustion complicated by stress dr palamo flew up to treat me himself no itoldyousos from him just competent compassionate care he actually booted luis out of the room once tucker lifted his glass heres to dr palamo he was good to me good for me if i needed to cry he just let me cry and when i needed to talk he listened he isnt a psychiatrist and though he recommended one i felt so comfortable talking just to him when he felt the time was right he had me transferred to a hospital in philadelphia it was really more like what they used to call a rest home my mother told everyone i was recuperating at a villa on the riviera so much more sophisticated caroline i have to tell you i dont think i like your mother thats all right she wouldnt like you either she did her duty though she came to see me three times a week my father would call every night even if hed been to visit the tour went on without me and the press played up the collapse and the fact that luis was now snuggled up tight with the flutist he did send flowers along with romantic little notes he didnt have any idea id seen him with her it took about three months before i was well enough to go home i guess i was still a little wobbly but i felt stronger than i ever had in my life i began to understand that id allowed myself to be treated like a victim that id permitted the exploitation of what should have been cherished as a gift my talent was mine my life was mine my feelings were mine god i cant tell you what an epiphany that was when the lawyers contacted me about my grandmother i knew what i wanted to do what i was going to do when i told my mother she was livid i didnt just stand up to her tucker which was really all id hoped for i stood in that damn prissy sitting room of hers and i shouted i raged i demanded naturally i apologized old habits die hard but i stuck with what i needed for myself and i headed south to innocence by way of baltimore i knew luis was there doing some guestconducting i called ahead so hed be expecting me oh he was thrilled delighted when i got to his suite he had an intimate dinner set up i threw a glass of champagne at him then i really cut loose it felt wonderful he was incensed enough to follow me out into the hall when i left the man in the room across the hall i never did get his name came out and saw luis trying to drag me back into the room he decked him with her eyes half closed she pantomimed a right jab one shot to that perfectly chiseled jaw and luis was down for the count buy that man a drink that would have been proper i suppose but i was still revving on instinct i did something else id never done in my life i grabbed him a complete stranger and kissed him full on the lips then i walked away and how did you feel free with a sigh she sat again there was no trace of the headache she realized her stomach wasnt knotted her muscles werent tense i still have moments like with that phone call when i lose that feeling you dont dump all your baggage at once but i know im never going back to the way i was good he lifted her hand to kiss her knuckles i like the way you are now so do i mostly her glass had sweated a ring on the table caroline traced patterns in the moisture i may never heal the rift with my mother and thats hard but ive found something here peace and quiet he said and made her smile right theres nothing like a few murders to calm things down roots she said glancing up i know that sounds silly since i spent only a few days here as a child but shallow roots are better than none they arent shallow things grow fast and deep in the delta even when people leave they cant pull those roots out my mother did no she only sprouted them in you caroline he said her name softly and reached out to frame her face in his hands i hate what you went through no look at me he insisted when she dropped her gaze part of you still wants to be ashamed of it and you dont want me or anybody feeling sorry for you but ive never made a habit of repressing my feelings so youll have to take them as they come i dont like thinking about you being hurt or sick or unhappy but if all those things brought you here right here where were sitting i cant be too sorry here right here she thought and smiled neither can i she looked so fragile those fine bones that pale skin fragile until you saw what was in her eyes there were depths there he realized strengths she hadnt even begun to tap and he very much wanted to be around while she continued her selfdiscovery there are some things i want to tell you im not sure how she brought her hands to his wrists maybe when im feeling more settled id like to hear them right now i think it might be better to let things stay as they are hed always been patient he reminded himself but it was hard to be patient when you felt as though you were standing on a narrow ledge with the ground crumbling from under your feet all right he leaned forward to touch his lips to hers let me stay with you tonight her lips curved under his i thought youd never ask she rose taking his hands in hers didnt you mention that if i didnt like it your way wed try again you didnt like it well im not quite sure maybe if you showed me again id be able to form a more definite opinion seems fair he eyed the kitchen table and grinned why dont we start right here he unknotted the belt of her robe and we can work our way shit the phone rang and caroline dropped her head on his shoulder id say dont answer it but shell just keep calling ill answer it no i he caught her hands before she could tie her robe again let me answer it if i cant charm her into cutting loose for the night you can take over she hesitated then decided there was some sense in the idea why not he gave her a brief kiss clear the table he called over his shoulder and made her laugh grandma caroline murmured as she picked up the rooster trivet i hope you wont be shocked she took the empty glasses and bottle to the sink and decided her grandmother might have liked the idea of love in her kitchen that was quick she said when she heard tucker come back in ive never known her to give up so easily what did you the words died as she turned and saw his face what is it whats happened it wasnt your mother it was burke he walked to her putting his arms around her as much to brace himself as caroline darleen talbots missing he stared at their reflections again in the shadowed window through a glass darkly he thought and shut his eyes well start the search at first light chapter twentythree i wish youd try to get some more sleep tucker stood by frustrated while caroline used a womans tools to disguise the results of a long restless night i couldnt she dabbed more concealer under her eyes and blended id just sit around and wait for the phone to ring go down to sweetwater he stood behind her watching her in the tiny bathroom mirror despite the circumstances he felt an odd and powerful sense of intimacy at sharing this private space being a witness to this ageless female ritual take a nap in my hammock tucker dont worry about me its darleen we all should be concerned about and the fullers junior that little baby god struggling to hold on she stabbed the mascara brush in and out of the tube how could this happen were not sure anything happened yet she might have just run off somewhere billy t said he hadnt seen her but after junior walloped him hed be apt to lie if he had then why did she leave her car on the side of the road theyd been over this again and again maybe she was going to meet somebody that stretch is pretty lonely she could have left her car and gone off with somebody else just to give junior a bad night or two i hope youre right she dragged a comb through her hair then turned i hope to god youre right because if youre not it might be like the others and if it is that would mean that dont take it any further until it has to go there gently he curled his fingers around her forearms day to day remember im trying she leaned against him a moment the tiny room was still steamy from their shower outside the single high window first light was blooming if my mothers right the press should be here before the days over i can deal with that on a long breath she pulled back i can but i feel i have to go to the fullers to offer happy some son of support im not sure i can deal with that therell be plenty of others there for her you dont have to go i do i can be an outsider or i can belong it comes down to how you treat others doesnt it hadnt he said something very similar to cy just the day before it was hard to argue with yourself ill come by when i can if i can she nodded glancing out the doorway when she heard the toot of a horn thats probably burke its nearly dawn id better go then tucker she took his shirtsleeve when he turned away then kissed him soft quiet comforting thats all he rested his cheek on hers for one last moment thats enough though it was still shy of eight am when caroline arrived at the fullers happy wasnt alone friends and family had closed ranks there was coffee brewing to replace the pots already consumed though no one thought of food women gathered in the kitchen that timehonored space of comfort caroline hesitated in the doorway beyond the murmur of conversation the circle of support and worry and reassurances she recognized the faces susie jiggling scooter on her hip josie standing restless by the back door tobys wife winnie rinsing out cups in the sink birdie shays stationed staunchly beside happy marvella quietly ripping apart a paper napkin the sense of intrusion was so great caroline nearly turned around and walked out again it was josie who saw her who offered her a tired smile of understanding caroline you look like a whipped dog come on in and well pump you full of coffee i just she looked helplessly from one woman to the other i wanted to stop by and see if there was anything i could do nothing but wait happy held out a hand reaching for it caroline stepped into the circle so they waited in a melding of perfumes and soft voices with talk about children and men and a babys restless crying delia joined them midmorning with jangling jewelry and a basket of sandwiches she bullied happy into eating half of one scolded josie for making the coffee too strong and quieted scooter by giving him one of her bright plastic bracelets to chew on that childs got muddy diapers she declared i can scent em a mile off ill change him susie picked him up off the floor where he was busy banging delias bracelet on the tile hes tired too arent you tired little man ill just put him down in the daybed happy he likes that little yellow teddy bear happy told her pressing her trembling lips together darleen left it for him yesterday why dont you find it for her happy delia shot birdie a warning look before the woman could protest she needs something to do delia said quietly when happy went out worryingll eat her up we all need something birdie see if you can find the makings for one of your jello parfaits thatll go down cool by afternoon marvella you stop wringing your hands and use em to squeeze some lemons well have lemonade instead of this goddamn coffee winnie i think you should mix up one of your potions for happy get her to sleep awhile i thought about it miss delia i didnt believe shed drink it delia smiled grimly she will if i tell her to that womans been going head to head with me for years but ive been holding back josie you and caroline clean up these dishes a woman as bossy as you ought to have a platoon of marines to order around even as she complained josie stacked dishes now there was purpose in the room as well as a sense of unity caroline found herself smiling at delia how can i get to be you when i grow up highly pleased delia fussed with the big gold buttons of her blouse why child you just learn how to use your mean we all got it but not everybody knows how to use it constructive like happys other girls ought to be here birdie said slamming cupboard doors they ought to you know theyll come if theres need marvella is that how your mama taught you to squeeze a lemon bear down girl satisfied delia began to rewrap uneaten sandwiches those girls got families birdie jobs and homes of their own wouldnt it be foolish of them to travel all this way if darleens just kicking up her heels miss delia winnie sprinkled herbs into a pot on the stove her hands were small and dainty she was a quiet women given more to doing than to talking but when she spoke her voice was cool and smooth like cream im going to brew this up like a tea i aint making it strong just enough to ease lets have a look delia joined her at the stove where they muttered and sniffed birdie ignored their conversation as a doctors wife she didnt think it quite proper for her to approve of folk medicines theres nothing more i can do here josie wiped her hands dry on a tea towel im going out to hunt around some myself theres more than a dozen men taking care of that birdie said her tone was sharp enough to have josie lift a brow but birdie had to put her frustration somewhere men dont always know best where to look for a woman josie picked up her purse im going to check on cousin lulu first delia then im going to ride over to see billy t if he knows anything hed be more likely to tell me than he would a man dont see as thats anything to brag on delia muttered josie shrugged facts a fact besides happys better off knowing whatever there is to know sooner rather than later shell make herself sick if this goes on too long no one could think of an argument to that she left by the back door moments later they heard the roar of her car engine springing to life if that billy t knows where darleen took off to birdie began if he does josiell find out sure as god made little green apples delia handed winnie a cup for the sedative shed brewed he went off to sleep just like an angel happy said as she walked back into the room her famous smile was ragged at the edges not a thing like his mama why she used to fight sleep like it was satan come to steal her soul i mustve walked a million miles of floor with rubbing at her eyes she trailed off you sit on down here priscilla delia ordered using happys given name to get her moving this is just making you sick is all using her big broad hands she pushed happy into a chair you let us do the worrying awhile nobody better at it than a room full of women winnie bring me that cup its a might hot miz fuller you gotta blow on it first winnie set the cup in front of her then stayed resting a hand on the back of the chair winnie had gone to school with happys eldest daughter and belle fuller had been the first white girl ever to invite winnie into her home to play with dolls what is it its whats good for you delia said and waved winnie aside i dont want one of winnies magic potions she said petulantly im not sick im just scared and miserable delia finished by the look of you you didnt get a wink of sleep last night you know winnie wouldnt give you anything wasnt helpful you drink up now and get some rest what i need is coffee when happy started to rise delia shoved her back now you listen to me being stubborns not gonna change a thing god willing your darleenll be back here preening herself over the ruckus she caused but right now youve got a child upstairs sleeping whos going to need you one way or the other what good can you do him if youre worn out i just want her back when the tears started she laid her head against delias cushioning breast i just want my girl back i was so hard on her delia you never gave her nothing she didnt need she was always so fretful even as a baby the minute she got one thing she wanted something else i wanted what was best for her but i never could seem to find it needing to help caroline stepped forward here happy she lifted the cup drink a little happy took a swallow then two before grabbing carolines hand she doesnt think i love her but i do somehow you always love in a special way the one who gives you the most grief all i can think is that when she was here yesterday wanting me to side with her about what happened with junior and that bonny boy i couldnt do it she was wrong darleen never could figure out what was right and what was wrong but she came here wanting her mother to stick up for her and i didnt we just ended up fighting like always with her stomping off i didnt even watch her drive away she began to sob then and delia rocked her and stroked her hair susie had come back in to put her arm around marvella those other girls happys fingers convulsed on carolines oh sweet jesus i keep thinking about those other girls hush now delia lifted the cup to happys lips arent they saying that was austin and hes dead as a doornail why caroline here shot him in the head and every woman in innocence is grateful to her except maybe mavis hatinger and she would be if she had a lick of sense now you come on with me darling im going to take you up for a nice liedown just for a little while with winnies brew making her eyelids heavy happy let delia lead her out of the kitchen oh mama marvella turned into susies shoulder to weep shush now dont you start but susie patted her back we dont know that any things happened we have to have faith winnie added and while were having it im going to fix some food in case others come by ill fry up some chicken good susie gave marvella a last pat honey you peel some potatoes and put them on to boil for potato salad no use anybody going hungry no telling how long well have to wait tucker stood on the banks of gooseneck creek and wiped his damp face with a bandanna the temperature had soared to a hundred and two with the air so thick it felt as if you could grab a fistful and wring it out the sky was a pale blue bleached by the merciless white sun he imagined himself taking a quick relieving dunk in the water the picture helped a little but he settled for soaking his bandanna in the creek and cooling his face and neck he remembered that arnette had been found here by darleens brother while he was hunkered down tucker took time to say a prayer please god dont let me find her someone would he was sure hed discounted the hopeful theory that shed taken off with someone it didnt make sense she hadnt had time to hook up with anyone but billy t and he along with all of her women friends insisted he hadnt heard from her tucker believed him male pride was at stake billy t wasnt likely to take up with a woman whose husband had bested him with a frying pan darleen hadnt been of particular importance to billy t one woman was the same as another to him the inevitable comparison with himself left tucker with a bad taste in his mouth darleen hadnt left her car on the side of the road during a thunderstorm to hop into another with some new lover or new friend not when junior claimed none of her clothes were missing and that the housekeeping money was still tucked away in the coffee can where shed kept it someone would find her tucker thought again and again he prayed it would be someone else he rose to move among the reeds his part of the search party was ranged along the banks slopping through the weeds and mud hoping tucker was sure that they found nothing but some old beer bottles and maybe a used condom they were all armed which made him a little edgy junior had already blasted away a water moccasin since it had seemed to make him feel better no one had commented the fact was there was very little conversation the men worked silently like soldiers setting up an ambush or walking into one one of the helicopters called up from county swept by now and again chopping at the hot air and the twoway radios each group leader carried on their belts would squawk and buzz with talk or static the fbi was holding back from taking over but then they didnt know innocence or its people burns was convinced darleen was just another dissatisfied wife whod taken off for greener pastures tucker figured he wasnt ready to admit another murder had taken place while he was in charge he swiped at mosquitoes finding himself testy enough to want to shoot at the whining bloodsuckers instead of slapping at them when he heard the long echoing whistle of the train he wished he were on it going anywhere when hed finished his assigned area he walked back to join burke junior toby and the others whod taken this side of the creek theyre nearly done on the other bank burke said he was keeping a wary eye on junior ready to move in if darleens husband started to relieve his anxiety by shooting at something more than a snake singleton and carl called in from mcnair swamp its all clear so far toby march laid his rifle in the bed of the pickup he thought of his own wife his own daughter and though it shamed him in his heart he was grateful whoever was killing was choosing white skin we still got about six hours of good daylight left he said to no one in particular i was thinking maybe some of us could ride down to rosedale and greenville and such ask around ive got barb hopkins calling all the motels hospitals the local police burke took juniors gun and laid it with his own in the truck countys sending her picture out there you go will shiver gave junior a hearty slap on the back theyll find her holed up in some motel sitting on the bed painting her toenails and watching tv saying nothing junior shrugged off the hand and walked away give him a minute burke murmured the men shifted their gazes politely away toby squinted adjusting the brim of his hat to cut the glare of the sun somebodys coming it took several seconds before anyone else could make out the plume of gravel dust or the faint glint of metal through the waves of heat rising from the road you black boys got eyes like hawks will shiver said goodnaturedly that car must be two miles away yet the eyesre organs toby returned with a sarcasm so subtle and smooth that tucker had to bite the inside of his cheek to keep from grinning you know what they say about our organs interested will cocked his head i heard tell that was a wives tale yes sir toby said blandly theres plenty of wives wholl attest to it tucker coughed and turned away to light a cigarette it didnt seem quite right to laugh out loud with junior suffering so close by but my it was good to smile for a minute he recognized the car a moment later by the color and the speed with which it was traveling its josie he shot a glance at burke looks like shes earning herself another speeding ticket she skidded to a halt spitting gravel and waving a hand out of the window barb told us wed find yall here earleen and i brought you boys some supper she slid out of the car looking cool and fresh in shorts and a halter that left her midriff bare her hair was tied back with a chiffon scarf reminding tucker of their mother thats real obliging of you ladies will slanted josie a smile that would have earned him a sharp slap from his fiancée we like to take care of our men dont we earleen after answering wills smile josie turned to burke honey you look worn out you come on and have a glass of this iced tea we brought two jugs got a pile of ham sandwiches too earleen hefted a hamper out of the backseat she set it on the shoulder and threw back the lid yall have to keep up your strength in this heat yes sir meals on wheels josie kept up a bright chatter as she dug into the hamper earleen and i got this together so fast were thinking we might go into the catering business junior you come on and get one of these now or youll hurt my feelings when he didnt even turn around she gestured to her brother tucker pour me a cup of that tea while she waited josie unwrapped a sandwich and laid it on a paper napkin earleen you see that these boys leave enough for our next stop you hear she rose took the cup tucker held out then skirted around the truck junior continued to stare down the road josie could see a muscle in his cheek twitch she set the sandwich on the hood of the truck then pressed the cup of tea into his hands now you drink that junior this heat steals all your fluids a man could drink a gallon and not piss an ounce come on gently she rubbed a hand up and down his back getting heat strokes not going to help we didnt find her i know honey take a drink she nudged the cup closer to his lips i was down at your motherinlaws before when i left you little boy was sleeping like an angel hes got a sweet disposition that boy and i do believe he has your eyes she paused when junior took two big gulps of tea she took the cup from him and passed him the sandwich he ate mechanically his eyes glazed with fatigue and worry josie slipped an arm around him knowing there were few things more comforting than human contact its going to be all right junior i promise everythings going to be just fine you wait and see his eyes filled spilled over running rivulets through the sweat and grime on his face but he kept eating i thought i fell out of love with her when i walked into the kitchen and found her with billy t seemed like my heart just closed off toward her it dont feel like that now moved by his grief she pressed a kiss to his cheek itll work out honey you trust josie he struggled to compose himself i dont want my son to grow up without a mother he wont have to josies eyes darkened as she wiped juniors tears with the paper napkin you believe that junior and itll all be fine they searched until it was too dark for the copters to fly or the men to see when tucker arrived home he was greeted by a weary buster who had tried and failed to avoid the puppy throughout the day ill take him off your hands tucker gave buster an absent pat before scooping up useless the pup wiggled and licked and barked as tucker carried him into the house if youve been like this all day im surprised you didnt give my old hound a stroke he headed for the kitchen dreaming of a beer a cold shower and caroline he found delia slicing roast beef and cousin lulu playing solitaire what do you think youre doing bringing that dog into my kitchen giving buster a break tucker set the dog down and he immediately scooted under lulus chair have you heard from caroline she called not ten minutes ago she was going to stay with happy until singleton or bobby lee got home delia arranged another slice of roast beef on the platter because she could see how tired tucker was she didnt slap at his hand when he stole it shes coming by here to pick up this fleabag tucker grunted over a mouthful of beef and pulled a beer out of the fridge ill have one of those lulu said without looking up cardsre thirsty work tucker popped the lid on a second bottle then scanned the hand shed dealt you cant put a black three on a black five you need a red four between ill put it there when i get one lulu tipped back the beer studying him over it you look like something thats been dragged through the swamp i guess i have been that youngest fuller girl still missing lulu cheated a red ten out of her pile and played it delias been half the day over at happys im reduced to solitaire i got a duty delia began but lulu waved her off nobodys criticizing idve gone myself but nobody thought to ask me i told you i was going delia thwacked the knife down on the cutting board not the same as being asked lulu did some more creative cheating people come and go so much around here it makes my blood tired josie in and out all hours of the day and night tucker here gone for a day at a stretch dwayne wasnt back five minutes before he takes a bottle of wild turkey and goes out again delia started to defend her brood then frowned when did dwayne get back half hour ago looked as muddy and wornout as tucker went out the same way he take his car dont see how he could lulu reached in her pocket and drew out a set of keys he took the bottle so i took these delia nodded in approval where do you think youre going she asked tucker as he tried to edge out of the room i need a shower youve lived with that sweat all day you can live with it awhile longer go on down and see if dwaynes at the pond shit delia ive already walked a hundred miles today then you can walk one more im not having him fall in and drown you bring him up here where he can get cleaned up and eat theyll want him out there tomorrow just like theyll want you grumbling tucker sat down his halffinished beer and started out the back door i hope to christ he hasnt had time to get drunk yet he was only half drunk which was exactly the way dwayne liked it best the fatigue of the day had faded into a nice friendly buzz slogging through mcnair swamp with bobby lee and carl and the others had been a miserable way to spend a day hed gone willingly enough and would go again in the morning he didnt begrudge the time or the effort and didnt see that anyone would begrudge him a little time with the bottle to wash the day away hed felt for bobby lee especially whenever hed looked into the boys face and seen the strain and fear hed wondered what it would be like to be searching for his own sister that thought had him burning his throat with more whiskey he wanted to think of pleasant things now of how nice the crickets sounded in counterpoint with the buzzing in his ears how soft the grass felt under his bare feet he thought he might spend the night there watching the moon rise and the stars come out when tucker sat down beside him dwayne obligingly passed him the bottle tucker took it but didnt drink this stuffll kill you son dwayne only smiled it takes its sweet time doing it though you know it worries delia when you do this im not doing it to worry her why are you doing it dwayne tucker expected no response and continued without one he gauged his brothers condition and knew he was sober enough to be coherent drunk enough to talk drunkenness is a voluntary madness cant think right off who said that but it rings true im not drunk yet or mad either dwayne said placidly just working on both wanting to choose his words carefully tucker took time to light half a cigarette its getting bad the past couple of years its been getting real bad first i thought it was because so many things went wrong so close together daddy dying then mama sissy taking off then i thought it was because daddy drank so heavy and you just picked up on whatever genes it takes to have you follow him along annoyed and not wanting to be dwayne took the bottle back you do your share of drinking yeah but im not making it my lifes work we do what we do best dwayne lifted the bottle and drank of all the things ive tried getting drunks the one thing i dont worry about screwing up thats bullshit the fury rushed out so quick and sharp it shocked them both he hadnt known it had been preying on him eating at him from the inside this reality of what his big brother had become layered over the image of the one tucker had once admired and envied thats just bullshit tucker snatched the bottle and springing to his feet flung it into the water im tired of this goddammit im fucking tired of carrying you home making up excuses for you in my head of watching you kill yourself one bottle at a time thats what he did flying that goddamn plane while he was shitfaced the old man killed himself sure as if hed put a gun in his mouth and pulled the trigger dwayne got shakily to his feet he weaved a little but his eyes were steady youve got no reason to talk to me like this youve got no right to talk about him either tucker grabbed dwayne by the shirtfront tearing seams who the hell has the right if not me when i grew up loving both of you being hurt by both of you a muscle in dwaynes cheek began to twitch im not daddy no youre not but he was a fucking drunk and so are you the only difference is he got mean with it and you just get pathetic who the hell are you his mouth moved into a snarl as he grabbed tuckers shirt in turn im the oldest it was always me he jumped on first i was supposed to take care of things to fucking carry on the longstreet legacy it was me who got shipped off to school me who got put in charge of the fields not you never you tuck i never wanted it but he wouldnt let me go my own way now hes dead and i can do what i want youre not doing anything but sliding into a bottle youve got two sons of your own at least he was here at least he acted like a father dwayne let out a howl and then they were wrestling on the grass grunting and growling like a pair of dogs looking for a soft spot to sink fangs into tucker took a short glancing blow to his stillsore ribs the fresh pain brought a burst of wild fury into his blood even as they went tumbling into the pond he was bloodying his brothers lip they went under grappling came up sputtering and cursing they kicked and shoved but the water softened the blows and began to make them both feel foolish tucker scissored his legs holding dwayne by his torn shirt one fist reared back dwayne mirrored his position so exactly the two of them stared panting shit tucker said warily eyed his brother as he lowered his fist you used to hit harder gingerly dwayne touched the back of his hand to his swollen lip you used to be slower they released each other to tread water i wanted a shower but this isnt half bad tucker swiped the hair out of his eyes though christ knows whats in this water a half pint of wild turkey for sure dwayne said and smiled remember when we used to swim here when we were kids yeah still think you can beat me to the other bank shit dwaynes smile widened to a grin he rolled over in the water and struck out too many years of the bottle had slowed him tucker streaked by like an eel in tacit agreement they raced back then floated awhile under the rising moon yeah dwayne said after theyd stopped panting you used be slower i guess thingsve changed lots of things i guess ive messed things up some things i get scared tuck dwayne fisted a hand in the water but there was nothing there to hold on to the drinking i know when i should stop but i get so i dont see the point in it sometimes i cant remember what ive been up to ill wake up sick and headachy and its like ive been dreaming i cant make it out we can do something about it dwayne theyve got places that take care of it i like how i feel right now through halfclosed eyes dwayne watched the stars wink into life just a nice little buzz on so nothing seems too goddamn important thing to do is to catch myself right here where i like it best it doesnt work that way sometimes i wish i could go back see where i turned off wrong so i could fix it you could always fix things dwayne remember that model airplane i got for my birthday i wracked it up the second time i used it i knew daddyd skin me when he found out but you fixed it all up mama always said you had a talent for putting things together i used to think id be an engineer surprised tucker shifted to treading again you never told me that dwayne merely stared up at the sky wasnt any point longstreets are planters and businessmen you could have done something different maybe but i was the oldest son he never gave me a choice no reason not to do what you want now hell tuck im thirtyfive years old thats no time to go back to school and learn a trade people do if they want it bad enough i wanted it bad enough ten fifteen years ago thats behind me a lot of things are behind me he tried to make out the stars but they were a hazy blur of light sissys going to marry that shoe salesman i guess we had to figure she would him or somebody says he wants to adopt my kids give them his name course shed forget that soon enough if i upped the support payments you dont have to take that dwayne those kids are yours theyre always going to be yours no matter what game shes playing nope dont have to take it dwayne said lazily and im not going to sissys going to have to learn that a man has his limits even me he sighed letting his gaze drift over sky and water i got comfortable tucker out of the corner of his eye dwayne saw something bob in the water an empty bottle he thought for an empty life drinking makes things that way the way youre doing it drinking makes you dead dont start on me again dammit dwayne he started to move closer when his legs brushed against something soft and slick that made him yelp damn cats he said scared the shit out of me he kicked away glancing over his shoulder he too saw something bob in the water but he didnt mistake it for a bottle as the spit dried to dust in his mouth as his blood slowed to a crawl he stared at the trailing white hand jesus oh my jesus catfish wont do any more than nibble dwayne said placidly he swore when tucker gripped his arm whats got into you now i think we found darleen he managed to say then closed his eyes some prayers he thought just werent meant to be answered chapter twentyfour sober and shaken dwayne dragged himself out of the water on his hands and knees he crouched on the grass fighting his rebellious stomach christ tuck jesus bleeding christ whatre we going to do tucker didnt answer he lay on his back staring up at heathazed stars it took enough effort just to concentrate on breathing when he was so cold so bitterly cold in the pond dwayne said his throat clicking as he swallowed somebody dropped her in our pond we were in there with her jesus we were swimming with her shes past being bothered by it he wanted to toss an arm over his eyes maybe that would help block out the image of that hand sticking out of the dark water its fingers curled as if it had been reaching for him as if it would grab hold and pull him under it had been worse because hed felt obliged to be certain to be certain it was darleen talbot and to assure himself that she was beyond help so hed gritted his teeth and had taken that stiff dead wrist tugging against the weight that held the body down and the head had bobbed up hed seen oh god hed seen what the knife had begun and what the fish were already ending the human form was so frail he thought now so vulnerable so easily whittled away into something hideous we cant just leave her in there tuck but dwayne shuddered at the prospect of going back into the water and touching what had once been darleen talbot its not decent i think we have to tucker thought regretfully of the bottle hed tossed away a few swallows of sour mash would do him some good just now at least until burke gets here you go in and call him dwayne one of us ought to stay here call burke and tell him what we found tell him agent burns better come along tucker sat up to drag off his wet shirt and bring me out some dry smokes will you i wouldnt say no to a beer either he began then swore when he caught sight of caroline walking toward them tucker scrambled up intercepting her after three long strides glad to see me caroline laughed and gave him a quick hard hug you two decide to take a swim delia sent me down to go on back up with dwayne tucker wanted her as far away from death and misery as possible go on up and wait for me ill wait for you drawing back she saw by his face that there was trouble cautious she looked from tucker to his brother dwaynes lip had opened up again and the blood was dark against his pale face have you been fighting dwayne youve got a split lip he ducked his head dellad give him hell about it ill call burke burke caroline grabbed tuckers arm when he tried to nudge her along why do you need burke her heart did a slow roll in her chest tucker shed know soon enough and it might as well come from him we found her caroline in the pond oh god instinctively she looked toward the water but tucker shifted to block her vision dwaynes going up to call burke you go with him ill stay with you she shook her head before he could protest ill stay tucker when tucker merely shrugged dwayne took off in a half run a whippoorwill began to call sweet and insistent for a mate are you sure even as she asked caroline knew the question was foolish yeah he blew out a long breath im sure god poor happy she had to ask the rest but it took a moment to force the words from her throat was it like the others caroline took his hand holding tight until his gaze shifted to hers i want to know it was like the others firmly he turned her away from the lake with his arm around her waist they listened to the night birds song and watched the lights of sweetwater glow against the dark the official process worked with callous efficiency men crowded around the pond their faces washed white by the harsh spotlights hooked to burkes truck pictures were taken to record the scene all right burns nodded toward the water lets pull her out for a moment no one spoke burke pressed his lips together and unhooked his gun belt ill do it surprising himself tucker stepped forward im already wet burke set his gun belt aside its not your job tuck its my land turning he took caroline by the shoulders go inside well go in together when its finished she kissed his cheek youre a good man tucker he didnt know about that but as he slipped into the water he was certain he was a stupid one burke was right it wasnt his job he didnt get paid to deal with this kind of horror he eased his way through the cool dark water toward the hand white as bone fingers curved beckoningly why did he feel it was his responsibility to drag a dead woman out of the water shed been nothing to him in life shouldnt she be less than nothing to him now because the pond was sweetwater he realized and he was a longstreet for the second time he curled his fingers around the lifeless wrist as the head rose he watched her hair float and spread toward the surface his stomach lurched he tasted acid in the back of his throat and ruthlessly forced it down using his feet to tread tucker hooked an arm around the torso there was silence on the bank the kind so deep you could hear your own heartbeat a graveyard silence he thought while he struggled against the weight that was trying to drag him and his burden down his grip slipped and when he shifted and tightened it her head lolled back on his shoulder tucker stiffened but it wasnt revulsion that filled him it was pity tucker looked toward the bank white faces stared back at him he saw dwayne with an arm around josie their eyes looked huge in the flood of light burke and carl already hunkered down ready to reach out and take the burden tucker was dragging over caroline her face wet stood with her hand resting on cys shoulder burns stood back observing as though it were a moderately interesting play somethings tied to her legs tucker called out i need a knife thats evidence longstreet burns stepped forward i want it intact you son of a bitch tucker managed to haul her another foot why dont you come on in and get your fucking evidence yourself ill help you mr tucker before anyone could stop him cy was running over and slipping into the water christ boy get back from here i can help slick as an otter cy paddled over im strong enough his face blanched when he swam close but he reached down to take part of the weight we can do it keep your eye on the bank tucker told him and try not to think cy scissored his feet im thinking about what an asshole that fbi man is even better it was a short and grisly swim when they reached the bank both carl and burke hooked hands under darleens arms look the other way tucker ordered cy theres no shame in it he would have done so himself but the angle was wrong so he saw what had been done to the body as it was dragged effortfully out and onto the grass he saw everything go on over with caroline now cy no he caught the boys head before cy could turn it dont look this way go over with caroline you did good yessir tucker hauled himself out he sat there a moment his feet dangling in the water dwayne give me a smoke it was josie who brought him a cigarette already lighted after that i figure you deserve a whole one she laid her cheek against his im sorry it had to be you tuck som i he took a greedy drag burke dont you have a blanket to put over her this isnt right if you civilians would go into the house burns began this area will remain off limits until the investigation is completed goddammit we knew her tucker said wearily you didnt least you can do for her is cover her go on tuck burke reached down to help tucker to his feet there are things we gotta do its best if you went on while we get to it well be as quick as we can i saw what was done to her burke tucker said in a raw voice you cant be quick enough you will stay available burns put in you and your brother ill need to question you shortly saying nothing tucker turned away to walk with caroline and cy back to the house caroline wasnt much of a cook but she heated up some soup to go with the roast beef delia had sliced soup it seemed to her was one of those nervesoothing foods by the way cy plowed through his she decided it worked dwayne scraped his bowl clean then seemed embarrassed by his appetite that was mighty tasty caroline i appreciate you putting a meal together delia did most of it before she left for the fullers we do appreciate it josie put in though i dont know how dwayne can eat with that fat lip run into a door honey tucker and i had a tussle he reached for his iced tea he didnt feel much like getting drunk tonight after all tucker hit you smiling a little josie rested her chin on her hand that mans been using his fists more these past few weeks than he has his whole life now what could yall be fighting about dont tell me youve taken a shine to caroline here josie winked at caroline to include her in the joke nothing like that uncomfortable dwayne shifted in his chair we just had a disagreement thats all thats how it happened we started wrestling and ended up in the pond guess we stirred up the water quite a bit between that and racing to the far bank and back then tucker he practically bumped right into her dont think about it josie rose to put her arms around his neck it was just bad luck bad luck all around thats a mighty cold way of putting it tucker said as he stepped into the kitchen josie kept her cheek against dwaynes hair its the truth sometimes the truths cold if you hadnt been wrestling around in the pond you wouldnt have found her shed still be dead but she mightve stayed down then the two of you wouldnt be looking so peaked tucker dropped into a chair he knew his temper was on edge but josies carelessness pushed a dangerous button we wont look peaked for long darleens going to be dead forever thats just my point finding her like that only made things hard on you christ josie youve got the sensitivity of a codfish she straightened at that eyes hot cheeks pale ive got plenty of sensitivity when it comes to my family maybe i dont give two hoots about what happened to that little slut josie wincing dwayne reached for her hand but she shook him off thats just what she was and her being dead doesnt change it im sorry for happy and the rest but im just sick about how you and dwayne came to be involved if you think that makes me cold tucker longstreet thats fine ill just save my sensitivity for someone who appreciates it she slammed out leaving the smoke of her temper lingering in the air maybe ill go after her dwayne rose awkwardly smooth her feathers tell her im sorry if you think itll help resigned tucker rubbed his hands over his face no use slicing at her for being what she is mr tucker you want a beer tucker lowered his hands and gave cy a wan smile about as much as i want to breathe right now but i think id do better with coffee ill get it caroline opened a cupboard for a cup were all on edge tucker shes just worried about you i know did delia go over to the fullers yes she and birdie were going to stay the night with happy help take care of the baby cousin lulus upstairs watching a movie she didnt add that the lady had commented that murders were much more interesting on tv than in real life and had settled back with a bowl of popcorn and a bottle of dixie beer why dont you go on up with her cy tucker suggested she likes company can i take the pup with me he hauled useless out from the dogs spot beneath the table sure caroline smiled dont let cousin lulu give him too much beer no maam night mr tucker night cy he touched the boys arm thanks for helping out id do anything for you mr tucker the words came out in a rush then cy colored deep and hurried from the room devotion like thats a precious gift caroline ladled out soup youll be careful with him wont you im going to try tucker rubbed a hand over his rough chin he hadnt shaved though hed showered twice i guess i wish he wouldnt look at me like i was hercules plato and clark kent all rolled into one caroline set the bowl in front of him brushed a hand through his hair its tough being a hero its tougher trying to be one when you havent got the makings oh i think youll surprise yourself smiling she sat beside him i made you soup so i see he took her hand you sure are handy to have around caroline ive been pretty busy surprising myself lately im glad you didnt know me before tucker before doesnt mean diddly this from a man wholl at the drop of a hat tell me stories about people whove been dead for a hundred years thats different he started to eat more to please her than because he was hungry after the first few spoonfuls he discovered he was ravenous what happened before matters because it shapes things but who you were a year ago isnt as important as who you are now i like the way you think tucker hmmm do you want me to stay tonight his gaze came back to hers fastened there with a wealth of feeling and need i want you to stay with a nod she rose let me fix you a sandwich teddy was back josie knew he was expected since shed spent the evening in burnss bed and the fbi agent had told her so the idea of having a pathologist and a special agent to juggle had eased her hurt and anger at tuckers words shed decided she wouldnt speak to her brother for a day or two at least until hed apologized in person rather than sending dwayne scrambling after her as proxy she was still brooding over it the following afternoon while the rest of innocence was reeling in shock over the latest murder josie sat at the counter of the chat n chew freshening her lipstick in her new purse mirror teddy had promised to join her for lunch as soon as hed finished his preliminary examination of the body earleen pouting josie tilted the mirror back to fluff at her hair do you think im a coldhearted woman coldhearted earleen leaned on the counter and flexed her aching feet kinda hard to be hotblooded and coldhearted all at once pleased josie smiled thats true being honest about things and not pretending otherwise doesnt make you cold why it makes you true to yourself dont you think thats a fact using the mirror josie scanned the diner without turning around several of the booths were occupied beneath the crooning of reba mclntire from the juke the conversation was all about darleen you know half the people in here didnt have a minutes use for darleen while she was alive josie snapped the mirror closed now that shes dead they cant say enough thats human nature earleen declared its like one of them artists whose paintings aint worth shit while hes alive to paint em then once he kills himself or gets hit by a truck people fall all over themselves to pay a fortune for them human nature josie appreciated the analogy so darleens worth more dead than she was alive while she might have agreed earleen was superstitious enough not to speak ill of the dead its junior im sorry for and that dear little boy with a sigh earleen reached back to take an order off the shelf and happy and singleton too the livings who suffers while earleen walked off to serve a customer josie murmured in agreement she dug through her purse for her atomizer of perfume then squirted scent liberally on her wrists and throat when carl walked in the conversation died then picked up again in murmurs josie patted the stool beside her come on over here and sit you look worn out thank you josie but i cant just come by to get some food to take back to the office what can i get for you carl earleen popped back behind the counter hoping to exchange food for news i need a half dozen hamburgers maybe a quart of your potato salad and some cole slaw make it a gallon of iced tea howre you going to want them burgers make them all medium earleen and load em josie picked up her diet coke yall must be busy as onearmed paperhangers down at the office if you cant even break for lunch we are that josie he was so tired himself he could have slept standing up belatedly he remembered to take off his hat county sheriff and a couple of his boysre down agent burns has had that fax machine clicking all morning its hot enough in that office to smoke a ham with all of you working so hard you must have some clues we got a thing or two he glanced over as earleen turned expectantly from the grill now i cant tell you what we got official like but yall know darleen was killed like the others we gotta figure it was the same person using the same weapon it aint right earleen said we got some psychopathic killer running loose and not a woman in the county can feel safe no it aint right but were going to stop him you can take that to the bank matthew says serial killersre different josie sucked on the straw he says they can look and act just like regular people it makes them hard to catch well catch this one he leaned closer i figure i should tell you josie since youll be finding out soon anyway looks like darleen was killed right there right by the pond sweet jesus earleen was torn between excitement and terror you mean to say he did it over to sweetwater we got reason to think so i dont mean to scare you josie but you want to be mighty careful she took a cigarette from the pack on the counter and her fingers shook lightly i will be carl you can take that to the bank slowly she blew out a stream of smoke and she intended to find out exactly what they knew the minute she could get teddy alone there were reporters camped out in her yard caroline had stopped answering the phone invariably it was another inquisitive newsman or woman on the other end to distract herself she took out the scrapbook shed found in her grandmothers trunk caroline could see most of her own life on those pages her parents wedding announcement clipped from the philadelphia and greenville papers the studied professional photographs taken at the wedding where her mother had worn an heirloom bridal gown from the waverly side the card announcing the birth of caroline louisa waverly shed been named for her paternal grandmother a few photographs again professionally done of the proud parents with their little bundle of joy then of caroline alone one studio portrait for each year of her life no snapshots she noted no outoffocus or candid shots except for the few her grandparents had taken themselves on her brief visit all those years ago newspaper clippings marking her musical career showing her at six and twelve and twenty and the years between and after it was one of the few things her grandparents had had of her caroline thought as she set the book back inside the trunk now it was one of the few things she had of her grandparents im so sorry she murmured and drew deeply of the scent of lavender and cedar that wafted from the trunk i wish id known you better she reached in and took out a cardboard box inside wrapped in tissue was a tiny christening gown trimmed with white ribbons and yellowing lace perhaps her grandmother or grandfather had worn it caroline thought as she ran her fingers over the soft white lawn surely her mother had you saved it for me touched she brushed her cheek over it i couldnt wear it when my turn came but you saved it for me carefully she wrapped it back into its bed of tissue one day she vowed her child would wear it useless raced out of the room to stand at the top of the steps then raced back again as someone hammered on the door caroline set the box back in the trunk then took out a pair of bronzed baby shoes she smiled over them dont bother useless its just one of the idiot reporters caroline dammit open up before i have to kill one of these jackasses tucker jumping up she ran downstairs with the dog at her heels sorry as she unlocked the door she could see the reporters crowding behind him thrusting out their mikes snapping pictures and shouting questions she dragged tucker in by the arm then planted herself in the doorway get off my porch ms waverly how does it feel to find yourself living a real life murder mystery ms waverly is it true you came to mississippi to mend a broken heart did you really collapse in is it true you killed were you acquainted with get off my porch she bellowed and get off my land while youre at it youre trespassing the lot of you and we have laws down here and if one of you so much as sets a toe over my boundary line without invitation ill shoot if off she slammed the door threw the bolt and started to turn when tucker scooped her up in a quick circle honey you sounded just like my mama did when she got her dander up he kissed her before setting her on her feet youre losing the yankee in your speech too pretty soon youll be saying yall and fixn to just like a native she laughed but shook her head i will not she touched a hand to his cheek he hadnt shaved but most of the fatigue had drained out of his eyes you look better than you did this morning thats not saying much seeing as i looked like death warmed over this morning felt like it too you didnt sleep i caught an hour in the hammock this afternoon felt like old times he drew her close again but this time when he kissed her it was slow and easy so does that i sure wish youd lowered your standards of respectability and shared my bed last night i still wouldnt have slept but idve felt better about being awake it didnt seem right with the house full of your family and and the police poking round the pond half the night he finished turning away he walked into the parlor and glanced out of the window do something for me caro ill try go up and pack what you need and come back to sweetwater with me tucker i told you you stayed last night you needed me to i still need you when she said nothing he spur around this isnt the time for poetry and romance and im not asking because i want you in bed with me id stay here with you if that was all stay anyway i cant dont ask me to choose between you and my family caroline because i cant i dont know what you mean if i go home without you ill be eaten up with worry over you if i stay itll be the same for josie and delia and the rest he pulled her back to him held her close then restless he yanked away to pace the room hes still out there somewhere caroline and he was at sweetwater i understand that tucker i know he left the body there he killed her there eyes filled with turmoil he turned back he killed her there in sight of my house by the trees where i fished with cy only days ago a tree my mother planted burke told me enough maybe too much im going to tell you i dont want to but im going to so you understand that ive got to go back there and im not going without you he took a long measuring breath he staked her out on the ground under the tree they found the holes where hed staked her hands and feet and the blood the rain didnt wash away i saw what he did to her im not likely to forget what she looked like when i helped pull her out of the water im not likely to forget it was done where my mother planted a willow tree where i used to play with my brother and sister across the water from where i kissed you the first time im not likely to forget any of that hes not going to touch anything else thats important to me now im asking you to get what you need and come with me she stepped forward to take the hands hed balled into fists i dont need much chapter twentyfive caroline was used to restless nights over the past few years shed developed a grudging envy for people who could climb into bed close their eyes and slip effortlessly into sleep since settling in innocence shed come close to joining the ranks of those privileged dreamers now it seemed she was back at square one facing long dark hours in the frustrating pursuit of sleep the tricks of the insomniac were routine to her hot baths warm brandy dull books the first two relaxed her body but when she tried reading her mind kept drifting away from the words on paper there was a television cleverly concealed in a cherrywood armoire but none of the late night shows caught her interest or bored her enough to trick her brain into sleep she couldnt complain about the heat not here in the lovely cool of her room at sweetwater and she was used to strange rooms and strange beds the one shed been given was as gracious as any shed found in the fine hotels of europe the bed was delicately feminine with its draping canopy and lacy pillows piled high if that didnt seduce sleep there was a plump daybed in misty blue satin that angled toward the french doors and offered a view of moonlight vases of flowers fresh from the garden sweetened the air charming watercolors were scattered over the warm rosetinted walls a ladys dressing table held elegant antique bottles that glistened in the lamplight there was a small fireplace of blue stone that would provide warmth and comfort on chill winter nights she could picture herself cuddled under thick handworked quilts on some windy february midnight watching the flames crackle and shoot shadows up the walls with tucker it seemed wrong to think of being nestled up against him in absolute peace when there was so much grief and heatbreak around them another woman was dead and she lay alone in some cold dark room while her family was left to weep and wonder it had to be wrong to feel this soft glow of happiness this insistent spring of hope when death hovered so close but she was in love sighing she curled on the window seat where she could see the moonlight stream into the garden the flowers were silveredged and still a touch of magic waiting to be plucked beyond far beyond was the glint of the pond that was sweetwater she couldnt see the willows and was glad if that was hiding from pain then for one night she would hide for now it was only a beautiful spot laced by moonlight and she was in love it wasnt possible to choose the time and the place to lose your heart caroline had come to believe it wasnt possible to choose the person who would take it surely if she could have chosen it wouldnt have been here and now it wouldnt have been tucker it was a mistake to fall in love now when she was just beginning to understand her own needs and capabilities now when she had only begun to learn she could stand on her own in charge of her life it was foolish to fall in love here in a place torn apart by tragedy and senseless violence a place she would have to leave in a matter of weeks it was ridiculous to fall in love with a man who had made a study of romance and seduction a charmingly lazy womanizer a murder suspect a poetryspouting wastrel hadnt she told herself he was just another luis with a southern twist and that by falling for him she was proving herself to be the kind of woman who always chooses poorly and lives to regret the results but she couldnt make herself believe it as much as shed once wanted to there was more to him than that more than he admitted to himself shed seen it in the way he cared for cy in his loyalty to family in the way he quietly held the reins of sweetwater and a dozen businesses without strutting his power or demanding gratitude with tucker it wasnt selfdeprecation it was simply his way here was a man who did what needed to be done and did what was right without thinking about it and who did it without stirring up the air with demands and worries and desperation about tomorrow no the air around tucker longstreet was as calm and placid as the naps he was so fond of taking in the summer shade as peaceful as a long lazy tale spoken in a drawl to the music of a porch rocker and as smooth as a cold beer savored on a hot night that was what she needed caroline thought as she rested her head against the window glass that basic acceptance that life was usually a joke and a person should be able to smile her way through it she needed to smile right now caroline thought she needed that island of serenity he so effortlessly carried with him she needed him so why was she sitting here searching for sleep when what she wanted was within reach on impulse she uncurled from the window seat on her way to the terrace doors she plucked a sprig of freesia from a vase she stopped by the giltframed mirror long enough to smooth her hair just as she touched her hand to the knob of the doors they opened to the sultry night and to tucker her heart gave a quick giddy leap that had her stepping back oh you startled me i saw your light he wore loose cotton pants and carried a blade of sweet peas figured you couldnt sleep either no i couldnt she looked down at the freesia in her hand then smiled and held it out to him i was coming to you the gold of his eyes deepened as he took her flower and offered caroline his isnt that something here i was thinking that since your notions of propriety wouldnt let you come to my room id have to come to yours he skimmed his fingers through her hair then cupped her neck against her cool skin his hand was hot and firm desire hath no rest she stepped forward into him i dont want rest reaching behind he pulled the door closed then i wont give you any he caught her against him and the first kiss was hungry as if it had been years rather than hours since theyd tasted the flavor of need was potent and addicting they fed on it enhancing appetites with murmurs and sighs breathless she pressed her lips to his throat clinging to him as they stumbled toward the bed he caught her hand as she reached for the lamp drew her fingers to his mouth to nibble and suck we dont need the dark then he smiled and covered her body with his while they made love in the light and most of innocence slept uneasily mcgreedys bar was hopping it was the beginning of a long weekend that would culminate in fourth of july celebrations the town council which consisted of jed larsson sonny talbot nancy koons and dwayne had after heated debate decided against canceling the annual parade carnival and fireworks display patriotism and economics had swayed the vote funtime inc had already been paid a hefty deposit for the carnivals twonight stand and the fireworks had cost the town treasury a pretty penny as nancy had pointed out the jefferson davis high school band and the twinkling batons majorettes had been practicing for weeks to cancel the celebration at this late date would disappoint the kids and lower everyones morale it was pointed out that it was unseemly and disrespectful to ride crack the whips and have pieeating contests with darleen talbot barely cold it was argued back that the fourth was a national holiday and that innocence had ordered up its own patriotic celebration for more than a hundred years it was finally decided that a short speech honoring darleen and the other victims would be given from the bandstand and a moment of silence would be observed so banners and bunting had been hung while teddy autopsied darleen in palmers embalming room in mcgreedys some of the patrons had already begun the celebration if the laughter was a bit wild or forced if tempers were edgy mcgreedy was content in the knowledge that his louisville slugger was handy behind the bar he kept an eye on dwayne who was drinking quietly and steadily at the end of the bar since he was sticking to beer tonight mcgreedy didnt worry overmuch it was whiskey that set dwayne off and at this point dwayne looked more unhappy than drunk he knew hed probably have to swing his bat and kick a few butts before the weekend was over tonight seemed friendly enough though there were a few hardcases huddled in the corner tossing them back and talking quiet whatever they were planning hed see that they took it elsewhere billy t bonny took a slug of house whiskey it pissed him off that mcgreedy watered it down but tonight he had other things on his mind every damn body in town knew hed been seeing darleen on the sly it was a matter of pride that he do something about her murder the more he drank the more it seemed to him that he and darleen had been in love he was among friends half a dozen likethinking men including his brother who were tanking up on liquor and hate they spoke in undertones wanting to keep their circle closed it aint right billy t muttered again were supposed to sit around with our fingers up our asses while some jerkoff from the fbi takes care of things well he sure as fuck didnt take care of darleen there was a general murmur of agreement cigarettes were lit deep thoughts were considered what the hell good did some yankee lawman do her billy t demanded him and burke and the rest of themre running around in circles while somebody hacks up our women oh were good enough to go out and look for bodies but were not supposed to do anything to protect whats ours probably raped em too will said to his beer probably raped the shit out of em before he sliced em you gotta figure it wood palmer cousin to the undertaking palmers nodded sagely them psychos always do its cause they hate their mothers and want to screw them all at the same time so they use other women thats bull billy t finished off his whiskey and signaled the waitress for another his blood was already so pumped with alcohol he could have opened a vein and fueled his gas tank its cause they hate women white women there aint been no black woman killed has there his brother piped up john thomas had been drinking shooters for the best part of two hours and was raring for hell four women dead and not one of them colored thats a fact billy t said and snatched up his whiskey the minute it was served and i guess that tells the tale wood scratched the stubble of his beard while the others grunted in agreement what billy t was saying made good sense to him especially filtered through a haze of tequila i heard tell their heads was nearly cut clean off and their sex organs was carved up thats psycho stuff the cops want us to think like that billy t struck a match watched it burn there was fire in his blood tonight and it needed someplace to spread like they wanted us to think it was austin hatinger killed his own daughter well we know it wasnt as the match fizzed out between his thumb and forefinger he shifted his gaze from face to face and what he saw pleased him we know it was a nigger but we got us a yankee fed a nigger deputy and a sheriff whod sooner lock up a white man than a colored will cracked a peanut he was drinking beer and drinking slow justine was already giving him grief about spending so much of his pay on drink and pool come on billy t sheriff truesdales okay if hes so okay how come we got four women dead and nobody paying for it as all eyes turned on him will sober enough to be prudent decided to keep his own counsel ill tell you why billy t continued cause they know who did it sure as christ they know but they dont want any trouble from the naacp or any of those other eggsucking groups its the niggers and the everfucking liberals responsible they aint hardly talked to no coloreds either wood muttered dont seem right thats cause it aint billy t said viciously but theres been one theyve talked to right enough he struck another match for the pleasure of watching it burn theyve been over to talk to toby march that special fucking agent asked plenty of questions about him talkings all they do wood mumbled and we got another woman dead talks all theyre gonna do billy t nodded as the others began to shift restlessly in their chairs he could feel it the hate the fear the frustration all melding together in a pot simmering with the summer heat and flavored by whiskey theyll keep talking and asking questions and hell do it again maybe one of our women next time we got a right to protect our own its time somebody put a stop to it one way or the other thats right billy t wet his lips and leaned in and i think we know what needs to be done its that march bastard doing it they homed right in on him then backed off they even know he has a taste for white meat he was sniffing around edda lou thats for sure john thomas put in somebody shoulda fixed him then fixed him good and you know what hes doing they all turned to listen to billy t hes laughing at them laughing at us he knows they dont want no race trouble down here in mississippi that those yankee papers can turn all inside out he knows theyre going to look the other way lest they catch him with a knife in some white womans throat its him all right his brother agreed didnt i see him standing at edda lous window he was working at the rooming house will began thats right billy t sneered working on how he was going to get edda lou out to the swamp so he could rape and kill her he done work for darleen too she told me how he came to patch her roof he done work out to the trailer court where arnette and francie lived too wood put in i seen him having a soda pop with francie and laughing thats how they tie all together billy t took a last drag on his cigarette he got around them that way and starting thinking how hed like to do it to them how he hated them for being women white women the cops dont want to see it but i do i see it plain and im not giving that black bastard the chance to kill another of our women he leaned forward sensing the moment was right i got me some nice strong rope in the back of my car every one of us heres got a rifle he knows how to use i say we kick off our independence day by ridding innocence of a killer he pushed back from the table and stood anybodys with me get your gun and meet at my place we got us a murderer to hang chairs scraped against the scarred wooden floor men started out with an air of purpose tinged with vengeance their pulses pounding with a sense of right sweetened by the anticipation of violence as they trooped out into the hot sweaty night mcgreedy noted that they looked as though they were hunting for trouble but as they were hunting it elsewhere he went back to drawing drafts at the door wood glanced back to will who was standing by the empty table you coming boy you bet will lifted his beer and sloshed it down his dry throat ill be right along with a nod that was as much warning as assent wood went off to fetch his remington oh jesus will gulped down more beer he didnt want the other men to think he was pussy that was the worst thing a man had to live down but he was thinking now maybe there was something worse yet hanging somebody he wasnt quite drunk enough to see it as justice nor was he sober enough to see it as murder what he saw was toby march twitching at the end of a robe eyes rolling and bulging face going purple feet kicking empty air he didnt have the stomach to watch and that was the sad truth and if he didnt hed lose the respect of the men he drank with most every week there was only one way to solve the problem as he saw it that was to stop it before it happened wiping his mouth dry he walked over to dwayne dwayne you gotta listen to me go on will i told you id wait another week on the rent its not about that you see those boys that just left annoyed with the interruption to his drinking dwayne scowled into his beer im making it a point not to see anything theyre going out to the march place theyre going out there with a rope slowly dwayne lifted his head and focused what do they want to do that for they mean to hang toby march theyre going to string him right up dwayne for killing all those women shit boy tobys never killed anything but a possum in his life maybe maybe not but they went off to get their guns billy ts dead certain toby done it and hes fired up for a lynching shit dwayne rubbed his hands hard over his face then i guess wed better stop them i cant do that shaking his head will backed up theyll ride me from now to next year if they think i chickened out ive done all im going to people had come to expect sudden outbursts from dwayne when a bottle was nearby that was why no one did more than glance his way when he shoved the table aside and grabbed will by the throat the fuck you have toby gets hurt tonight ill see that you pay for it same as the others do chrissakes dwayne i cant go against my own kind any more than i have you want to keep that roof over your head and the job thats paying for it dwayne lifted will up on his toes and shook you get your ass over to the sheriffs office you dont find burke or carl there you go find them at home and you tell them what you told me dwayne billy t finds out i did hell kill me bonny aint going to be killing anybody he tossed will toward the door do it half asleep and limp with pleasure caroline snuggled up to tucker she roused herself to trail a lazy line of kisses up his chest to his chin i always thought propriety was overrated stick with me darlin he curved a hand over her hip youll forget there ever was such a thing i think i already have her lips curved against his shoulder before she rested her cheek there can we sleep like this like babies he promised idly rubbing her back he didnt pay much attention to the roar of the car down the lane or the slamming of doors the pounding of feet up the stairs if dwayne was drunk or josie was peeved at whomever shed been sleeping with it could wait until morning but caroline stirred and started to speak even as dwayne began to shout tuckers name shitfire he does pick his times he kissed carolines shoulder as he rolled over and grabbed up his pants just wait right here and ill go quiet him down tucker listened to his brother banging on doors and swore he swung the door open and stepped out into the hall jesus h christ dwayne youre going to wake up the whole house already has cousin lulu said from her doorway she was wearing a redskins football jersey and a headful of purple curlers i was having a right good dream about mel gibson and frank sinatra too go back to sleep cousin lulu ill handle him wildeyed dwayne burst out of tuckers room doesnt anybody sleep in their own bed anymore get your gun boy weve got trouble the only trouble here is the beer youve been slopping down in mcgreedys delia grabbed his arm and tried to haul him to his own room what you needs a face full of ice to cool you off dwayne shook her off and rushed to tucker i dont know how much time we have theyre going to lynch toby march what the hell are you talking about im talking about the bonny boys and a bunch of their asshole friends going after toby right this holy minute with a rope oh christ tucker saw caroline come to the doorway clutching her robe at her throat wait for me he said im going with you delia was halfway down the hall in her redfeathered peignoir before tucker stopped her youre staying right here i dont have time to argue with you call burke tell him fireworks are starting ahead of schedule delia stood as they clattered down the steps she bristled until the feathers rustled there are only two of them caroline said from behind her if burke doesnt get there with help itll be only tucker and dwayne cousin lulu examined her nails i can still shoot lincolns face off a onecent piece at five yards delia turned back nodded get some pants on toby rolled over in bed when their old mutt custer began to bark damn dog he muttered s your turn winnie said sleepily how do you figure im the one who got up every night to nurse two babies she opened her eyes and smiled at him in the moonlight just like im going to get up with this next one in about six more months toby skimmed a hand over her stillflat tummy guess its only fair i deal with the dog get me a glass of that orange soda pop while youre up she patted his bare butt before he pulled on his undershorts a pregnant womans got cravings you sure did have them a couple hours ago that earned him a giggle and another slap toby stumbled yawning out of the room he saw the reflection of the fire in the front room window that glitter of gold and red on the glass that made his heart sink and his blood boil he bit back an oath hoping to get rid of the obscenity on the lawn before any of his family could be hurt by it he was a man of deep faith and did his best to love his fellow man but in his heart was a cold hate for whoever had lit the cross on his land he pushed open his door stepped out on his porch and found a gun poked into his naked belly its judgment day nigger billy ts lips spread in a grin we just come by to send you to hell enjoying the power he jabbed with the rifle barrel toby march youve been tried and convicted for the rape and murder of darleen talbot edda lou hatinger francie logan and arnette gantry youre crazy toby could barely get the words through his lips the dog was quiet now and he could see old custer crumpled on the grass dead or stunned rage came quickly then he saw the rope john thomas bonny and wood palmer were swinging over the branch of a gnarled oak fear followed i never killed nobody listen to this boys billy t gave a cackle while his eyes stayed dark and flat on tobys he says he didnt do it even through terror toby recognized that they were all pissyourself drunk that only made them more dangerous one of the others leaned on his shotgun and brought a pint of black velvet to his lips might as well hang him for a liar too his neckll stretch just the same you nigger boys can dance cant you billy t grinned until his eyes turned to slits youre going to do some dancing tonight why your feet aint even going to touch the ground when you finish dancing were going to burn your place to the ground fear turned tobys bowels to ice they would kill him he could see that in their eyes he would fight them and he would lose but he couldnt lose his family as well he shoved the rifle felt the bullet sear his rib cage as it exploded winnie he shouted in despair and terror run get the children and run as he clutched at his wounded side billy t brought the rifle butt down in his face coulda killed him on a nervous giggle billy t wiped the back of his hand over his mouth coulda blown a hole in his belly but thats not the way were gonna hang him he yelled to the others drag him on over he saw the woman rush out shotgun blasting in her terror winnie fired wide billy t backhanded her and knocked the gun clear lookie here he snatched the struggling woman around the waist shes going to protect her man when she clawed at him he struck her again so that she fell dazed to the porch hold on to her woody truss her up when that cocksucker wakes up well show him how it feels to have his woman raped i aint raping no woman wood muttered already having doubts about the whole nights work then you can watch too billy t reached down and yanked winnie down the steps by the hair take hold of her goddammit john thomas you go in and bring those nigger kids out here they got a lesson to learn winnie began to scream one keening wail after another she kicked and bit and clawed as wood bound her hands behind her back there was a shout from the house a curse and a crash john thomas staggered back out to the doorway his shoulder seeping blood he cut me holding out one bloody hand he stumbled to his knees the little fucker cut me christ almighty cant even handle a kid billy t walked over to examine his brothers wound youre bleeding like a stuck pig one of yall bind this up keep an eye on the house that boy comes out do what you have to do near where the cross burned toby began to groan and stir im going to do this myself for darleen he leaned over one of tobys eyes had swollen shut but there was fear in the other billy t fed on it it was power he tasted it and found it heady all his life hed been second rate now he was about to do something important even heroic no one would ever look at him the same way again im going to put this noose around your neck boy he reached up and snagged it dragging toby to a kneeling position he pulled the loop of rope around tobys neck im going to tug it nice and tight he slid the knot down until it pressed evilly against flesh but were not going to string you yet first im going to do to your wife what you did to those white women he grinned as toby fought against the rope and gag only i bet i can make her like it and when shes yelling for more were going to hang you i dont hold with raping no woman wood said firmly this time snarling billy t whirled bringing the gun up with him you just shut the fuck up then it aint rape its justice i cant stop this bleeding billy t glanced over to where one of the men tried to staunch the wound on his brothers shoulder well then let him bleed for a goddamn minute wont kill him he was losing them he could feel it in the way the men were shifting their feet shifting their eyes away from the woman who lay bleeding on the ground he set his gun down and unbuckled his belt he was already hard at the idea of taking a woman by force once they saw how it was what kind of man he was theyd be behind him again somebodys coming billy probably that will always was a day late and a dollar short he stepped over to winnie straddled her he hooked a hand in the bodice of her nightgown when the car fishtailed to a halt kicking dust as rifle fire split the air i got this pointed right at your balls billy t tucker stepped out of the car skin twitching at the idea of having guns aimed at him its got more of a kick than i do i guarantee this aint your concern billy t straightened cursing himself for setting his weapon aside we come out here to do what should have been done already yeah burning crosses is your style like killing an unarmed man he saw the blood on winnies face and was sickened hitting women it takes a lot of guts to come out here what six of you against one man a woman and a couple of kids this niggers been killing our women tucker merely lifted a brow for all i know youve been doing it were hanging us a killer tonight you think you can stop us you and your drunken brother he hauled winnie up in front of him and took two backward steps to reach his gun seems to me theres six of us and two of you another set of headlights sliced the dark and delias olds cruised to a halt three women stepped out with rifles remind me to give them all hell later tucker muttered to dwayne looks like the odds just changed he said to billy t evened up quite a bit you think were worried about a bunch of women to show her feelings about that delia let off a shot that plowed the earth between woods feet yall know i can shoot and these two ladies here well theyre liable to get lucky caroline you aim that winchester at that asshole bleeding by the porch he aint liable to be moving around too much so you should get a clean shot caroline swallowed then shouldered the rifle fuck this wood tossed down his gun i aint shooting at no women any more than id be raping one then you might want to step out of the line of fire tucker advised him looks like its five to five his lips curved as he heard the siren and thats about to change now if i were you billy t id set that woman down real gentle like otherwise my fingers going to slip and im going to blow a hole through your brother jesus christ billy put her down john thomas scrambled back against the steps billy t licked his lips maybe ill put one through you i expect you could but since you cant work that rifle onehanded youll have to put her down just the same then well take our chances put her down billy wood said quietly the gun too this is crazy business here he turned to the others this is crazy business in agreement they tossed down their guns youre standing alone now tucker pointed out you can die alone too doesnt make a damn bit of difference to me in disgust billy t dropped winnie to the ground where she began to sob and crawl toward her husband after tossing his gun aside he started to walk toward his car id stand where you are tucker said quietly you wont shoot me in the back tucker squeezed off a round that shattered the windshield the hell i wouldnt go ahead and do it cousin lulu suggested save the taxpayers money thats enough caroline wiped sweaty hands on her jeans and hurried over to winnie theres nothing to worry about now my babies ill go to them in just a minute she fought the knot loose from winnies wrists hoping to free her before the children saw it but they were already racing out of the house jim still carrying the butcher knife stained with john thomass blood and the little girl tripping over the hem of her nightgown here now caroline dragged the noose over tobys head her vision wavered with tears as she took the bloody knife to cut his bonds youre hurt her fingers came away wet as she touched his side somebody call the doctor well get him to the hospital tucker knelt down burke and carl were already reading billy t and the others their rights what do you say toby up to a ride he was holding his family his good eye leaking tears as he gathered them close guess i could stir myself he tried a wan smile while winnie wept against his chest you driving you bet well get there fast anyway there you go dwayne give me a hand here delia you take the kids on down to sweetwater caroline tucker looked around as she stood and walked away where are you going she didnt look back to get a hose and put out this obscenity chapter twentysix screams shimmied on the hot air high pitched howls echoed chased by shrieks of wild laughter colored lights flashed and blinked and whirled turning the fallow eustis field into a fantasy of motion the carnival had come to innocence people readily dug out their spare change to be caught by the octopus whirled by the zipper and scrambled by the roundup kids went racing by their shouts and squeals rising above the piping calliope music their fingers sticky with cotton candy their cheeks puffed out with corn dogs or stuffed with fried dough teenagers scrambled to impress one another by knocking down bottles ringing bells or in the words of one daredevil riding the scrambler till they puked many of the older set settled for bingo at a quarter a card others touched by gambling fever lost their paychecks trying to outsmart the wheel of fortune to anyone traveling over old longstreet bridge it would look like an ordinary summer carnival on the outskirts of an ordinary small southern town the lights and the echo of that calliope might bring a tug of nostalgia to the travelers as they passed by but for caroline the magic wasnt working i dont know why i let you talk me into coming here tucker swung his arm over her shoulders because you cant resist my fatal southern charm she stopped to watch hopefuls pitching coins at glassware that could be had at any respectable yard sale for half the price it doesnt seem right with everything thats happened i dont see what a night at a carnivals going to change unless its to make you smile a little darleens going to be buried on tuesday shes going to be buried tuesday whether youre here tonight or not everything that happened last night has been taken care of he finished billy t and his asshole friends are in jail doc says toby and winnie are doing just fine and look here he pointed to where cy and jim were squished together in a cup of the scrambler eyes wide mouths open in laughing howls as they were spun in mad circles those two are smart enough to grab a little fun when its offered tucker pressed a kiss to her hair and continued to walk you know why we call this eustis field no a smile ghosted around her lips but im sure youre about to tell me well cousin eustis actually hed have been an uncle but therere so many greats in there it gets confusing he wasnt what youd call a tolerant man he ran sweetwater from until and it prospered not just the cotton he had six children legitimately and about a dozen more on the other side of the sheets word was he liked to try out the female slaves when they came of age that age being about thirteen fourteen thats despicable you named a field for him im not finished he paused to light half a cigarette now eustis he wasnt what youd call an admirable man it didnt bother him at all to sell off his own children the darkskinned ones his wife was a papist a devoted one who used to beg him to repent his sins and save his soul from a fiery hell but eustis just kept doing what came naturally to him naturally to him tucker said behind him a bell clanged as some hotshot proved his strength and impressed his girl into rapturous squeals one day a young female slave took off she had the baby eustis had fathered with her eustis didnt tolerate runaways no indeed he set out the men and the dogs and rode out himself to hunt her down he was riding across this field when he shouted out that hed spotted her she wouldnt have had much of a chance with him on horseback and a whip in his hand then his horse reared nobody knows why mightve been spooked by a snake or rabbit or maybe it was that fiery hell reaching out to grab old eustis but he broke his neck tucker took a last drag on his cigarette then flung it away right about there where that ferris wheels standing seems fitting somehow dont you think that all these people black and white maybe some with a dribble or two of eustis longstreets blood should be kicking up their heels on this field where he met his maker she leaned her head against his shoulder what happened to the girl and her baby funny thing about that nobody else saw them not that day or any day after she took a deep breath of candyscented air id like a ride on the ferris wheel wouldnt mind it myself afterward howd you like me to win you one of those black velvet paintings of elvis laughing she hooked an arm around his waist words fail me dont you want to play some bingo cousin lulu ever hopeful dwayne pressed a hand to his jittery stomach what the hell do i want to sit around putting beans on a card for lulu stomped up to the ticket booth to buy another roll we only been on the roundup once and missed the scrambler altogether that crack the whips worth another go or two she stuffed the tickets in the pocket of her army surplus slacks youre looking a might green boy indigestion he swallowed gamely you could call it that shouldnt have eaten all that fried dough before we took a spin best thing to do is bring it up empty your stomach she grinned a round on the scramblerll take care of that which was exactly what he feared cousin lulu why dont we take a turn down the midway win some prizes suckers games whos a sucker josie strolled up carrying a huge purple elephant i shot twelve ducks ten rabbits four moose and a snarling grizzly bear to win this grand prize dont know what a grown womans going to do with a stuffed elephant lulu grumbled but she took a shine to the rhinestone collar around the purple pachyderms neck its a souvenir she said and shoved it into teddy rubensteins arms so she could light a cigarette whats the matter dwayne youre looking a little sickly weak stomach lulu announced and poked a finger into dwaynes midsection corn dogs and fried dough boys got all that grease floating around inside she narrowed her eyes at teddy i know you youre that yankee doctor who makes a living cutting dead people up do you keep the innards in bottles with a strangled sound dwayne shambled away one hand clamped over his mouth best thing for him lulu declared i guess id better go hold his head with a sigh josie turned back to teddy honey why dont you take cousin lulu for a ride ill catch up it would be my pleasure teddy held out his arm whats your poison cousin lulu pleased she hooked her arm through his i had my mind set on the scrambler allow me to escort you whats your given name boy she asked as they wound through the crowd i may as well call you by it as youre sleeping with my kin he gave a throatclearing cough its theodore maam my friends call me teddy all right teddy well take us a walk on the wild side here and you can tell me all you know about these murders graciously she handed him the tickets to pay their way through the gate that miss lulu slurping on a snowkone jim nodded in respect she sure is something cy wiped purple juice from his mouth and watched as lulu sat regally in the jerking spinning car of the scrambler i seen her standing on her head in her room what she do that for dont rightly know something about having the blood slosh into her brain so she dont go senile one day i found her lying on the lawn i thought shed had a spell or was dead or something she said she was pretending to be a cat for a day and gave me hell for disturbing her nap jim grinned and crunched ice my granny mostly sits in a rocker and knits they started to walk taking time to stop by some of the booths and watch balls being tossed darts being thrown wheels being spun they each spent a quarter at the duck pond where jim won a rubber spider and cy a plastic whistle they debated having their fortunes told by madame mystique then passed her up for a look at the amazing voltura who absorbed a thousand volts of electricity while miniature light bulbs fizzed and popped all over her curvaceous body pretty fakey cy decided and gave his whistle a toot yeah i bet they use batteries or something cy scuffed his shoe in the dirt can i ask you something sure i was wondering well how did it feel stabbing john thomas bonny frowning jim dangled his rubber spider by the string he figured he could get at least one good squeal out of little lucy with it it didnt feel at all i guess i was all numb and my ears were ringing i had lucy hiding in the closet like ma told me but i figured hed find her and i didnt know what they were going to do to my ma and my daddy were they cy wet his lips were they really going to string him up they had a rope and guns jim didnt say anything about the burning cross somehow that was the worst part of all they kept saying he killed them women but he didnt they were saying my daddy killed them too cy bent for something shiny but it was only a piece of foil from a pack of cigarettes i guess he didnt do it either somebody did jim said and the two boys gazed silently at the flow of people might even be somebody we know almost has to be if you think about it cy yeah when i stuck that knife into john thomas bonny made me feel sorta sick at my stomach watching it go in i dontsee how anybody could stick people again and again less they was crazy guess they are then cy remembered his fathers eyes and thought he knew all about crazy shaking off the sense of dread he dug in his pocket i still got three tickets left with a grin jim dug in his own the roundup last one there pukes on his shoes with a war cry both boys dashed off making a beeline for the whirling lights of the roundup both cy and his innocent pleasure came to a skidding halt when vernon stepped out in front of him having yourself a high old time aint you boy cy stared up at his brother into the face that was a ghost image of their father eyes glazed with anger as hard and cold as ice skimmed over a pond he hadnt seen vernon since austins funeral there his brother hadnt spoken to him at all only stared at him across the hole in the ground where their father would spend his eternity the lights of the midway suddenly seemed to brighten burning hot on cys face while the rest of innocence played in the dark im not doing anything youre always doing something vernon stepped forward from behind them loretta clutched one child to the mound made by another and made a small sound of distress that was ignored by all getting yourself a job over to sweetwater on the sly spending all your time with this kind he jerked his head toward jim dont matter to you that them coloreds plotting against white christians killing white women and your own sister among em you got bigger fish to fry jims my friend cy didnt take his eyes off his brothers face but he knew those big hands were fisted just as he knew they would pummel him to the ground and because they were blood there were many who would turn away rather than interfere we werent doing anything you got your colored friends vernons lips twisted as he snagged cys collar maybe you helped them get edda lou out there in the swamp where they could rape and kill her maybe you held the knife yourself and murdered her same as you murdered daddy i didnt kill anybody cy shoved at vernons hand even as he was dragged up to his toes i didnt daddy was going to hurt miss caroline and she had to shoot him thats a filthy lie vernon slammed his free hand against cys head and white stars exploded in front of the boys eyes you sent him out to die and they hunted him down like a dog used their godless money to cover it all up you think i dont know how it was you think i dont know how you fixed it so you could live in that fine big house trading your fathers life for a soft bed and a life of sin his eyes flattened like a snakes as he shook cy off his feet you got the evil inside you boy with daddy gone its up to me to crush it out his arm reared back even as cy was covering his face in defense jim was leaping he grabbed vernons arm with both hands and hung on kicking between the two of them they were still fifty pounds short of vernons weight but fear and loyalty added sinew vernon was forced to drop cy in a heap so that he could buck jim off the minute he dragged cy up jim was on him again agile as a ferret this time he hitched on to vernons back hooking an arm around the thick neck run cy jim clung like a leech while vernon struggled to yank him off run i got him but cy wasnt going anywhere after shaking his head clear he got back to his feet his nose was bleeding a little from his last fall and he swiped a hand under it he thought he understood now what jim had meant when hed said hed been numb cy was numb his ears were ringing either from the blow or from adrenaline inside his thin chest his heart was banging against his ribs like a spoon against a kettle the lights were all on him beyond the circle made by him his brother and jim all was shadowy to his vision the music of the calliope had slowed to a funeral dirge he swiped more blood away then fisted his smeared hands i aint going to run hed run from his father it felt as though hed been running all of his life and here and now was the time to take his stand what was left of his innocence had fled and he was a man i aint going to run he repeated and hefted his bloody fists vernon shook jim off and grinned think you can take me on you little shit i aint going to run cy said again quietly and you aint going to whip up on me anymore either still grinning vernon spread his arms take your best shot itll be your last cys fist snaked out he would think later that it had been as if hed had no control over it his arm his clenched hand and the fire behind it had been something apart and its aim was deadly keen blood spurted from vernons nose there was a roar from the crowd that had gathered that bloodlust roar that humans seem unable to prevent when one of their kind wars with another cy heard it as a tidal wave of satisfaction even as the power of the punch shot pain up his own arm well well tucker stepped out of the shadows misting cys vision and stepped between them yall putting on a side show whats the price of admission blood dripped down his face as vernon bared his teeth get the hell out of my way longstreet or ill cut right through you youll have to to get to him there was a trace of that lust in tuckers eyes as well the midway lights glinted on them turning them gold as a cats taking a page out of your fathers book vernon slapping down whats smaller than you hes my kin thatll always be a mystery to me tucker threw out an arm when cy started to move around him you just hold on son im not going to tell you twice he could feel the air tremble between him and cy not with fear fear had a different rhythm this was energy the boy would have gotten a few good shots in tucker mused before vernon broke him to pieces youre not laying another hand on him vernon and whos going to stop me the thought of having his face battered again made tucker sigh the last bruises had barely faded i reckon i am and me sweaty and far from steady dwayne stepped beside his brother one by one men moved out of the crowd and ranged themselves beside the longstreets cy had been wrong there were more than a few who would have come forward and they did now black and white forming a silent wall that spoke eloquently of justice vernon flexed frustrated fists he cant hide all the time he isnt hiding now tucker said i think hes proved that he may be half your size vernon but hes twice the man you are and hes under my protection your mother signed a paper that makes it so youd best leave it alone whatever you paid her to sign him away hes still my blood you got too much of my blood on your hands tucker stepped forward lowering his voice so only vernon could hear hes nothing to you we both know it kinships just an excuse you use to hurt and call it family business theres nobody standing with you on this vernon nobody going after hims only going to make it hard for you around here your familys had enough grief and you brought it on us he leaned his face close to tuckers this aint over i dont expect it is but its done for the night turning tucker walked through the line to where caroline was dealing calmly with cys bloody nose i sure do love a carnival he said the squeeze he gave cys shoulder transmitted both approval and reassurance i was going to fight him mr tucker you did what you had to do furious caroline balled bloody tissues in her hand men you always think the way to handle any problem is with your fists and women like to talk them away he winked at cy then pulled caroline close for a quick kiss now personally i prefer loving my way out of a problem but it takes all kinds dont it just josie strolled up snapping her purse shut she carried her pretty little pearlhandled derringer inside among her other necessities right now she was almost disappointed that she hadnt had cause to use it she kept her back to tucker whom shed yet to forgive cy honey youre going to be the talk of the annual innocence fourth of july carnival she kissed his cheek and made him blush you bleeding anywhere jim no maam i landed on my butt is all he was busy brushing himself off with hands that shook from excitement me and cy we coulda took him ill just bet you could josie squeezed jims bicep and rolled her eyes appreciatively we got us a couple of strapping young boys here caroline i wonder if i could impose on you two to accompany me to the lemonade stand it seems my gentleman escort has deserted me for another woman she nodded toward the scrambler where teddy and cousin lulu where taking another round men are such fickle creatures jim puffed out his chest well go with you miss josie wont we cy is it all right mr tucker its just fine he passed a hand over cys hair left it lie there a moment it is just fine cy cy took a deep breath and let it out slowly i know it i didnt run im not running from him or anybody anymore tucker let his hand slide off cys shoulder he thought it was a pity that youth and its simplicity were so soon and permanently lost running away and walking are two different things keeping clear of vernon wont change what you did for yourself tonight but it might keep your mama from any more grief you think about that i guess i will go on with josie he watched them walk away with some regret and something colder that was suspicion i guess im going home dwayne said narrowing his eyes against the spinning lights you sober enough to find the house tucker asked him i havent had much and tossed up what i did dwayne offered a weak smile i never did have the head for those whirly rides or the stomach tucker agreed you get sick every blessed year i dont like to mess with tradition delia and cousin lulu came with me but i dont think theyre ready to leave just yet caro and ill get them home thats fine then night caroline he sauntered off alone moving beyond the lights and music and into the shadows tucker nearly called him back it didnt seem right that his brother should look so lonely then dwayne was gone and the moment passed well caroline tossed the bloody tissues into a trash basket you certainly show a woman an interesting evening i do what i can hearing the strain in her voice he slipped an arm around her youre upset upset she countered you could say so it upsets me to see that boy have to fight his own brother hes lost two members of his family and is estranged from the rest of them just because hes different its hard to see him have to face those kinds of demands and pressures those choices when hes only half grown tucker drew her around to face him who are we talking about caro you or cy it has nothing to do with me maybe youre shifting things around looking at him and seeing yourself at his age facing something you couldnt fight with your fists i didnt fight at all you took your stand later and in a different way that doesnt make it any harder when what youre standing against is family he led her back a little where they could stand and watch the lights and the colors and the knots of people you want to make it up with your mother theres nothing you want to make it up he said again with a quiet assurance in his voice that stopped her from arguing i know what im saying i never settled things with my father i never let him know what i thought or felt or wanted i dont know if hed have given a damn and thats just it i dont know because i never worked up the gumption to say it all to his face she knows how i feel so you start from there on your terms i dont like to see you sad caroline and i know what kind of pull family brings ill think about it she tilted her head back to study him he was looking beyond the midway into the lights there was something in his eyes that had her moving closer what are you thinking about family he murmured and what runs through the blood deliberately he smiled but that glint in his eye remained lets go check out that ferris wheel tucker pulled her back into the crowd and the noise but he was thinking if austin had been capable of murder perhaps austins son was equally capable the sins of the father he mused it was a quotation that would have suited austin down to the ground perhaps vernon carried that same violent and twisted gene as the ferris wheel began its slow backward arch tucker draped an arm around carolines shoulders he was sure of one thing among the laughter and lights of the carnival a murderer hunted chapter twentyseven theres coffee on the stove tuck burke yawned over his bowl of raisin bran i dont believe ive seen you up and around this early in twenty years i wanted to catch you before you went into your office my office burkes lips twisted into a grimace as he held out his morning mug so that tucker could top it up with hot coffee dont you mean burnss office my butt hasnt felt the seat of my own chair in three days is he getting anywhere or is he just blowing smoke hes generated more paperwork than the bank of england faxes federal express packages conference calls to washington dc we got us a bulletin board with pictures of all the victims tacked to it vital statistics time and place of death hes got stuff referenced and crossreferenced till your head spins tucker sat down youre not telling me anything burke burke met tuckers gaze theres not much im free to tell you weve got a list of suspects nodding tucker took a sip of coffee am i still on it youve got an alibi for edda lou burke took a spoonful of cereal hesitated then set it down again i guess you know bums has taken a real dislike to you he doesnt think much of your sister saying you were up playing cards with her half the night im not too worried about that you should be burke broke off when he heard someone moving around in the living room a moment later the looney tunes theme warbled from the television eight oclock he said with a smile that kids got it down to a science he picked up his coffee ill tell you this tuck burns would like nothing better than to hang this whole thing around your neck he wont do anything thats not straight and legal but if he can find a way to reel you in it would give him a lot of pleasure what we got heres a personality clash tucker said with a thin smile they got a time of death on darleen yet teddys putting it at between nine pm and midnight since i was with caroline from about nine on the night darleen was killed that ought to ease me out of the running with a series of murders like this its not just a matter of motive and opportunity hes got a head doctor who worked up a psychiatric profile were looking for someone with a grudge against women especially women who might be a bit free with their favors someone who knew each victim well enough to get them alone burkes flakes were getting soggy he scooped them up more for fuel than enjoyment darleens a puzzle he went on maybe it was just chance that he came across her on the road that way could have been impulse but chance and impulse dont follow the pattern tucker let that settle for a minute there was a pattern he mused but he didnt think anybody had put all the lines and checks together just yet i want to get back to that psychiatric stuff youve got somebody with a grudge against women maybe because they hated their mama or some woman let them down along the way thats the idea before darleen youd pretty well settled on austin he fit the profile burke agreed and after he went after caroline with a buck knife it looked rock solid but unless austin came back from the dead he couldnt have killed darleen tucker shifted in his chair what do you think about heredity burke about blood and genes and bad seeds anybody with kids thinks about it some anybody with parents i should say he added and shoved his bowl aside i spent a lot of years wondering if id make all the wrong moves the way my father did push myself into corners or let myself get pushed there like him im sorry i should have thought before i asked no it was a long time ago almost twenty years now its better to look to your own kids that one out there he pointed a spoon toward the living room where his youngest watched bugs outwit elmer fudd he looks like me i got pictures of myself at his age and its almost spooky how much he looks like me vernon favors his daddy tucker said he waited while burke set his spoon aside it can go deeper than coloring and the shape of a nose burke it can go to personality and tendencies gestures habits ive had reason to think on this because of my own family it was something he didnt like to talk about not even with burke dwaynes got the same sickness that killed our father maybe hes got a better disposition but its there rooted inside all i have to do is look in the mirror or at dwayne and josie and i see our mother shes stamped right on our faces and she had a love of books poetry especially i got that too i didnt ask for it its just there i wont argue that marvellas got a way of tilting her head the same way the same angle as susie does and shes got susies stubborn streak i want it and ill find a way to get it we pass things on good and bad whether we aim to or not vernons not gentle with his wife any more than austin was gentle with his what brought this on tucker you heard about the ruckus at the carnival last night that young cy bloodied his brothers nose marvella and bobby lee were there nobody thought it was a shame vernons not a popular man his daddy wasnt either theyve got the same look about them in the eyes burke tucker kicked back in the chair to stretch his legs my mama bought me this picture book once a bible stories book i remember this one picture it was of isaiah or ezekiel or somebody one of those prophets who strolled off into the wasteland for forty days to fast and meet the lord this was supposed to be a picture of him after he came back spouting prophesies and speaking in tongues whatever the hell they did when theyd cooked their brains in the desert he had this look in his eyes this wild rolling look like a weasel gets when he smells chicken feathers i always wondered why the lord chose to speak through crazy people i expect it was because they wouldnt question whatever voice they heard inside their head seems to me they might hear something else inside there too something not so full of light and good will saying nothing burke rose to pour more coffee burns had said something about voices about how some serial killers claim to have been told what to do and how to do it the son of sam had claimed his neighbors dog had ordered him to kill for himself burke didnt go in for the mystical he figured david berkowitz had juggled psychiatry against the law to cop an insanity plea but tuckers theory made him uneasy are you trying to tell me you think vernon hears voices i dont know whats inside his head but i know what i saw in his eyes last night the same thing i saw in austins when he was choking me and calling me by my fathers name that prophet look if he could have broken cy in two he wouldve done it and id stake sweetwater against the fact that hed have considered it holy work i dont know that he had more than a passing acquaintance with any of the victims other than edda lou this is innocence nobody gets through their life without knowing what there is to know about everybody else whats that saying about the apple not falling far from the tree if austin had it in him to kill his son might have the same ill talk to him satisfied tucker nodded when the phone rang they both ignored it from upstairs susie answered it on the second ring youre going to be at sweetwater tonight for the fireworks unless i want my wife and kids to leave me carl too no reason for him to stay in town when everybodyll be out at your place why tucker moved his shoulders restlessly a lot of people a lot of noise and confusion im worried especially about josie and caroline id feel better knowing you and carl are close burke susie came in she was still in her robe smelling of her shower with carnationscented soap studying her burke thought she looked no more than twenty was that the office he asked her no it was delia she laid her hand over tuckers matthew burns had dwayne brought in for questioning if he hadnt been so infuriated tucker would have been amused the idea of dwayne softhearted blearyeyed dwayne as a murder suspect was certainly laughable the fact that his brother had been yanked out of bed and driven into town to be questioned by some smugfaced fbi agent was not struggling with his temper tucker walked into the sheriffs office with burke he wouldnt lose it he promised himself it would suit burns too well to kick him out instead he flipped his brother a cigarette then lighted one for himself you getting an early start today burns tucker said mildly guess you forgot todays a national holiday im aware of the date burns stretched his legs behind burkes desk and kept his hands folded on top im also aware that you have a parade scheduled for noon my business wont interfere with your towns celebrations sheriff im told youll be blocking off the main drag by ten thats right id like my car moved where ill be able to get in and out of town as necessary taking out his keys he set them on the edge of the desk carl saw the flare in burkes eyes and stepped forward ill move it on down to magnolia jingling the keys in his hand he stopped by tucker im sorry tuck i had orders to bring him in its all right carl it shouldnt take long to straighten this out heard your girls going to be twirling today shes been practicing day and night her grandpappy bought one of those video recorders so he can shoot her whole routine as she marches im sure thats fascinating deputy burns put in but we have business to conduct here his gaze shifted to tucker official business ill be sure to watch for her myself carl tucker said he waited until the deputy went out before taking another drag dwayne did they read you your rights mr longstreet isnt under arrest yet burns interrupted hes merely being questioned hes got a right to a lawyer doesnt he naturally burns spread his hands if youre concerned that your rights might be abused mr longstreet or that you may incriminate yourself please feel free to call your attorney well be happy to wait id just as soon get it done dwayne looked miserably at tucker sure could use some coffee though and a bottle of aspirin well fix you up burke patted his shoulder as he walked into the bathroom this is official business longstreet burns inclined his head in dismissal you have no place here burke deputized me tuckers lips spread in a slow smile though burke paused lifting his brows as he came back in with the aspirin he said nothing to contradict the statement he can always use some extra help on the fourth thats the truth burke commented as he shook tablets from the plastic bottle and seeing as my youngest has a birthday today on top of it id be obliged if we could get things moving very well burns punched in his recorder mr longstreet you reside at the property known as sweetwater in the county of bolivar mississippi thats right dwayne accepted the mug of coffee and the aspirin the longstreets have been at sweetwater nearly two hundred years yes history and family legacies didnt interest burns you live there with your brother and your sister and delia shes been housekeeper at sweetwater for more than thirty years and right now cousin lulus visiting dwayne singed his tongue with the hot coffee but the aspirin went down shes a cousin on my mamas side no telling how long shell stay cousin lulus been coming and going as she pleases as long as anyone can remember i recollect once if youll save the homeboy routine burns said id like to finish before the brass bands and batons dwayne caught tuckers grin and shrugged just answering your question oh and weve got cy and caroline with us now too that what you want to know your marital status im divorced two years come october thats when the papers came through wasnt it tucker thats right and your exwife now lives where up in nashville rosebank avenue shes got a nice little house there close enough to school that the boys can walk and she is the former adalaide koons sissy dwayne corrected him her little brother never could say adalaide so she was sissy and mrs longstreet was pregnant with your first son when you married dwayne frowned into his coffee i dont see that its any of your business but its no secret i guess you married her to give the child a name we got married cause we figured it was best with a murmur of agreement burns steepled his hands and shortly after the birth of your second child you wife left you dwayne drained his coffee over the rim his bloodshot eyes hardened thats no secret either youll agree it was an unpleasant scene burns shifted forward to read some notes your wife locked you out of the house after a violent argument i believe youd been drinking heavily and threw your belongings out of an upstairs window she then took your children to nashville where she took up residence with a shoe salesman who moonlighted as a musician dwayne examined the cigarette tucker had tossed him i guess thats about right how did it make you feel mr longstreet when the woman you had married under duress left you taking your children and turned to a secondrate guitar player dwayne took his time lighting the cigarette i guess she had to do what suited her best so you were amenable to the situation i didnt try to stop her if thats what you mean didnt seem like i was much good at being married anyway the divorce suit she filed against you accused you of emotional cruelty violence erratic and unstable behavior and stated you were a physical risk to both her and your children did that seem harsh dwayne dragged deep on tobacco and wished desperately for whiskey i expect she was feeling harsh i cant say i did right by her or the boys either you dont have to do this dwayne when his control broke tucker stepped forward to take his brothers arm you dont have to answer this fuckers questions about a marriage thats over or your feelings about it burns inclined his head is there a reason your brother shouldnt confirm what i already know tucker let go of dwayne to slap his hands on the desk i cant think of one just like i cant think of a reason i shouldnt kick your skinny butt all the way back to dc we can discuss that on our own time longstreet right now youre interfering with a federal investigation if you persist youll do your complaining from one of those cells tucker grabbed burnss pinstriped tie and yanked upward why dont i show you how we handle things down here in the delta leave him alone dwayne stirred himself to snag tuckers wrist the hell i will i said leave him alone dwayne stuck his face close to tuckers ive got nothing to hide this yankee sonofabitch can ask questions from now to doomsday and that wont change leave him be so we can get it done reluctantly tucker loosened his grip were going to finish this you and me stonefaced burns straightened his tie itll be a pleasure he remained standing turning to the bulletin board at his back mr longstreet were you acquainted with arnette gantrey burns tapped a finger against the space between a photo of a smiling blond woman and a blackandwhite police photo taken at gooseneck creek i knew arnette we went to school together dated a few times and francie logan burns slid his finger to the next set of photos i knew francie dwayne averted his eyes everybody knew francie she grew up here lived in jackson for a while then came back after getting divorced and you were acquainted with edda lou hatinger dwayne forced himself to look back but focused on the tip of burnss finger yeah i knew darleen too if thats what youre getting at did you know a woman named barbara kinsdale i dont think so dwaynes brow creased as he tried out the name in his head nobody around here named kinsdale are you quite sure burns unpinned a photo from the board take a look dwayne picked up the photo from the desk grateful it was a shot of a live woman she was a pretty brunette perhaps thirty with straight hair sweeping slight shoulders ive never seen her before havent you burns picked up his notes barbara kinsdale five foot two a hundred three pounds brown hair blue eyes age thirtyone does that description sound familiar i cant say you should be able to say burns continued its almost a perfect description of your exwife mrs kinsdale was a cocktail waitress at the stars and bars club in nashville residence eastland avenue thats about three blocks away from your exwifes home emmett cotrain your exwifes fiance performed at the stars and bars on weekends an interesting coincidence isnt it a thin bead of sweat dripped down dwaynes back i guess it is its more interesting that mrs kinsdale was found floating in the percy priest lake outside of nashville late this spring she was naked her throat had been slit and her body mutilated burns tossed another photo across the desk but in this one barbara kinsdale was very dead where were you on the night of may of this year mr longstreet oh jesus dwayne shut his eyes the body hadnt been covered in the police shot but had been laid out gray and tortured for the cold camera lens i should tell you that my information places you in nashville from the twentyfirst to the twentythird i took my boys to the zoo dwayne rubbed shaking hands over his eyes it did look like sissy god almighty especially dead it looked like sissy i took them to the zoo and to a pizza parlor they stayed with me at the hotel on the night of the twentysecond you were seen in the hotel bar at approximately tenthirty your children werent with you they were asleep i left them in the room and went down and had a drink couple drinks he said with a sigh sissyd been on me about doing more for them and wanting a bigger house once she and the guy she was with got married i didnt have more than two drinks because i didnt want to forget the boys were asleep upstairs and didnt you call your wife from the bar just before midnight burns continued you argued with her threatened her i called her i was sitting there in the room while the boys slept my boys it didnt seem right that i was to help her buy a new house so she could live in it with another man my sons would think of as a father pale shaken dwayne looked over at tucker it wasnt the money it was the humiliation burns suggested the humiliation at the hands of a woman shed already made you a laughingstock by locking you out of your own house leaving you for another man now she was demanding more money so she could live a better life with that man i didnt care who she lived with it just didnt seem right no it didnt seem right burns agreed so you told her thered be no more money and that youd take her to court if she didnt watch her step that youd pay her back i dont know what i said exactly she does oh despite your estrangement shes loyal enough to add that you were always full of bluster when youd been drinking she didnt take anything you said seriously and went back to listen to the next set at the bar even stayed on after it closed since she didnt have the boys to get home to but barbara kinsdale left about two she walked out into a deserted parking lot a dark parking lot where she was knocked unconscious and dragged to a waiting car she was driven to the lake and slaughtered burns waited a beat do you own a knife mr longstreet a longbladed hunting knife this is crazy dwayne dropped his hands into his lap i didnt kill anybody where were you on the night of june thirtieth between nine pm and midnight for chrissakes he stumbled to his feet burke for chrissakes i think he should have a lawyer strain had etched lines around burkes mouth when he turned to burns i dont think he should answer any more questions without a lawyer well satisfied burns spread his hands thats his right of course i was just driving around dwayne blurted out it was raining and i didnt want to go home i had a flask in the car and i just drove around and on the night of june twelfth burns asked working back to the night of edda lous murder i dont know how the fuck is a man supposed to remember where he is every night of the year dont say anything else tucker stepped

one id never seen before she looked like sissy christ she did look like sissy were going to call our lawyer tucker said calmly even as his knuckles whitened on the wheel and youre going to keep your head clear so you can think back think back real carefully until you find out what you were doing who you were with when arnette francie and edda lou were killed ones all you need one of those nights

tucker swerved to the shoulder dwayne opened his runny eyes as the car jerked to a halt he stared under the seat stared and stared until tucker jerked him upright thats fucking bullshit and i dont want to hear any more of it he shoved dwayne back pushing his livid face into his brothers pale one you didnt kill anybody and you get that plain in your head right now i got an idea who did dwayne swallowed his head was reeling along with his stomach but he tried to grip on to that one sentence you know i said i have an idea im going to check into it as soon as we call the lawyer and get him doing whatever the hell lawyers do he kept his grip tight on dwaynes shirt now you listen to me youre not going to go home and upset delia and josie and everybody with talk about this youre going to

responsibility to the family were going to stay whole dwayne to the family dwayne repeated and shuddered i wont let you down all right he let dwayne go then sat back a minute to calm his jittery stomach well show that yankee bastard what longstreets can do once theyre riled ill call the governor that ought to rattle burnss cage a bit well see how quick he gets his fucking warrant i want to go home dwayne closed his eyes again when tucker started the car ill be all right when i get home a few minutes later they turned through the gates of sweetwater you just tell them burns asked you a bunch of stupid questions and thats that tucker advised dont say anything about sissy or that business in nashville i wont dwayne stared at the house white and lovely and graceful as a woman in the morning sunlight im going to figure it out tucker and ill fix it like i used to this time you let me do the fixing as tucker parked by the steps josie came out she was still in her robe and her hair was tousled about the shoulders it didnt take tucker longer than ten seconds to measure her mood as dangerous she strutted down the steps to greet them slapping a hairbrush against her palm looks like im going to have to start locking my car and taking my keys inside with me with a shrug tucker pulled her keys out and tossed them to her i had business in town you were asleep youll notice mr longstreet its my name on the registration of this vehicle i dont appreciate you commandeering it whenever you have the whim she poked the brush into his chest its common courtesy to ask for the use of someone elses property i said you were asleep fluttering her lashes she scanned the driveway mine is not the only car here it was the first one i came to he checked his temper and tried a smile you sure did wake up on the wrong side of the bed darling she met charm with a haughty look i might suggest you consider getting yourself alternate transportation until that toy of yours is repaired yes maam he kissed her cheek you sound just like mama josie sniffed and stepped back what are you staring at dwayne automatically she fluffed at her hair then her eyes changed why honey you look just awful whatve you boys been up to so early just some business in town tucker repeated before dwayne could answer youd better get yourself prettied up if youre going to the parade course im going the longstreets never miss a fourth of july parade dwayne you come inside and get yourself something to eat youre green around the gills he hasnt recovered from the carnival aw instantly solicitous josie took her brothers arm you go in and have delia fix you up something cousin lulu shouldnt have teased you into going on that roundup im all right he put his arms around her holding her close josie its going to be all right of course it is honey she patted his back its a fine day for a parade and itll be a finer night for fireworks go on now so i can paint my face she waved him inside but held up a hand to stop tucker she forgot all about being annoyed with him whats wrong with dwayne they had him in for questioning this morning her eyes lit dwayne theyll call us all in i imagine its just standard she began to tap the brush against her palm again why i might have to give matthew burns a piece of my mind let it go jose its nothing to worry about hell feel better once we get this holiday started all right but im going to keep an eye on him she patted the keys in her pocket as she started into the house next time you ask you hear she passed caroline in the doorway you watch out for that one caro hes a scoundrel i already know caroline stepped out on the porch then to please herself turned a showy circle the skirt of her pale blue sundress swirled out then settled softly around her legs tucker stayed on the step below and took her hands the dress had flirty laces at the bodice and a back cut to the waist you sure do look a picture i heard i was going on a picnic after the parade thats a fact he kissed the palm of her hand then held it against his cheek a moment they said you didnt know what you had until youd lost it tucker thought hed discovered something that was equally true you didnt know what had been missing from your life until you found it caroline she turned her hands to link her fingers with his what is it ive got a lot of things to say to you he moved up the steps until their mouths were level and the kiss could be sweet i sure as hell hope youre ready to hear them when i do right now ive got some business to see to you mind riding to the parade with delia ill meet you there i could wait he shook his head and kissed her again id rather you went on all right then ill pile in with delia and cy and cousin lulu whos going to be the hit of the day shes wearing trousers with the confederate flag on one leg and the american flag on the other the flag of the revolution i should say you can always count on cousin lulu tucker caroline cupped his face in her hands if you have trouble i wish youd share it with me i will soon enough you look just right here caroline standing on the porch with your blue dress the door open behind you and bees buzzing in the flowers you look just right he wrapped his arms around her held her there a moment while he wished the world would stay like this pretty and peaceful and as gracious as a lovely woman dressed in blue you be ready for those fireworks tonight he told her and for what i want to say to you after his arms tightened caroline i want god sakes lulu muttered from the doorway tucker are you going to stand around all day smooching with that yankee we got to get on or we wont get a decent spot to watch the parade theres time yet but tucker released caroline you keep an eye on this yankee till i get there he began then his face split with a grin i declare cousin lulu you look good enough to run up the flagpole whered you get those pants had em made special she spread her scrawny flagbedecked legs got me a jacket to match but its too cursed hot to wear it she stuck an eagle feather into her hair where it drooped over one ear im ready to go then youd better get he gave caroline a quick kiss before heading inside ill send the others out cousin lulu you make sure caroline doesnt go wandering off with some smooth talker lulu snorted shes not about to go far caroline smiled no im not chapter twentyeight just how many of these lunatics you figurell drop from heat stroke before two oclock cousin lulu posed the question from the comfort of her personalized directors chair a red white and blue umbrella was hooked to the back and tilted to a jaunty angle while a thermos of mint juleps snuggled between her feet we never have more than five or six faint on us delia said placidly from the web chair beside her she didnt think she could outdo lulus pants but shed stuck a miniature american flag in her bushy hair in an attempt most of them are young as a marching band strutted by blaring sousa lulu played along on a plastic zither she enjoyed the wall of sound the glint of brass in bright sun but she couldnt help but think that a couple of swooning piccolo players would add some zip that tuba blower there the husky one with the pimples he looks a bit glassyeyed to me ten bucks says he drops in the next block delias natural competitive instinct had her studying the boy he was sweating freely and she imagined his natty uniform was going to smell like wet goat before the day was up but he looked hardy enough youre on i dearly love a parade lulu tucked her zither behind her ear like a pencil so she could pour another drink next to weddings funerals and poker games i cant think of anything more entertaining delia snorted and cooled her face with a palmsized batteryoperated fan you can have yourself a funeral tomorrow if you want weve been having us a regular plague of funerals lately sighing delia helped herself to some of the contents of lulus thermos i reckon this is the first time in fifteen years that happy hasnt marched on by with the ladies garden club why aint she marching her daughters going in the ground tomorrow lulu watched the pompom division of jefferson davis high shake by to the tune of its a grand old flag a good whopping funeralll set her to rights lulu predicted whatre you making for after the burying my coconut ambrosia delia shaded her eyes and grinned why look there cousin lulu look at carl johnsons baby twirl that baton shes a regular whirling dervish shes a pistol all right lulu enjoyed a cackle and another sip of julep you know delia lifes like one of them batons you can spin it around your fingers if youve got the talent for it you can toss it right up in the air and snatch it back if youre quick or you can let it fly and conk somebody on the head she smiled and plucked the zither from behind her ear i do dearly love a parade from behind lulu caroline thought over the analogy and shook her head it made a spooky kind of sense she wasnt sure if shed ever conked anyone on the head with the baton of life but shed certainly dropped it a few times right now she was doing her best to make it spin that theres the cotton princess and her court cy told caroline the whole high school votes on her every year she was supposed to ride in back of mr tuckers car but since it got banged up they rented that convertible from avis in greenville shes lovely caroline smiled at the girl in her puffysleeved white dress and sweatsheened face shes kerry sue hardesty watching her made cy think of kerrys younger sister leeanne she of the soft fascinating breasts as the car cruised by cy scanned the crowd hoping for a glimpse he didnt spot leeanne but he did spot jim and waved desperately why dont you go over and see your friend cy you can meet us at the car when the parades finished he yearned but shook his head and stood firm mr tucker was counting on him to stay close to miss caroline theyd had a real mantoman talk about it no maam im fine right here theres miss josie and that fbi doctor hes got one of those lapel flowers that squirts water in your face he sure is a caution he certainly is caroline was scanning the crowd herself i wonder whats keeping tucker nothing from behind tucker slipped his arms around her waist you didnt think id miss watching a parade with a pretty woman did you content she leaned back against him no you want me to fetch you and miss caroline cold drinks mr tucker i got pocket money thats all right cy i think cousin lulus got what the doctor ordered in that jug down there cy jumped forward to take the cup lulu poured and pass it back that fbi mans watching from in front of the sheriffs office so i see tucker sipped savored and handed the cup to caroline caroline took her first taste of mint julep and let it slide sweet down her throat he doesnt look as though he thinks much of the parade looks more like he smells dead skunk cy commented he just doesnt understand tucker kept one arm around carolines waist set his other hand on cys shoulder here comes jed larsson and his boys when the fife and drum corps led by larsson marched by playing dixie the crowd roared those seated rose to their feet and cheered caroline smiled and laid her head on tuckers shoulder she understood the fourth of july meant fried chicken potato salad and smoking barbecues it was a day for flag waving and pie eating and drinking cold beer in the shade there were those gathered close in mourning and the law continued its grinding quest but on this bright summer day innocence tossed a cloak of red white and blue over murder and celebrated after the parade there were contests along market street and over in the town square pie eating target shooting foot racing egg tossing and always a favorite watermelonseed spitting in silent amazement caroline gawked at the junior division pieeating contest where seven to fourteenyearolds buried their faces in blueberry slurping and swallowing to the cheers of the crowd pie after pie was consumed and more glistening tins shoved under purplestained faces encouragement and gastronomic advice were shouted out as one by one the young entrants fell by the wayside groaning look at cy caroline pressed a hand to her own stomach in sympathy he must have eaten a dozen by now nine and a half tucker corrected her but hes leading come on boy dont chew just let it slide on down i dont see how he can breathe she murmured as cy buried his face in number ten hes going to be sick course he is thats the way cy dont hold back now hes got himself a nice rhythm tucker said to caroline he doesnt just smash his face into it and hope for the best he works in a nice steady circle from the outside in she didnt know how tucker could tell all she saw was a boy buried to the neck in blueberries while the crowd cheered and stomped she told herself it was a silly game messy and certainly undignified but she was rocking back and forth from toes to heels pulled in to the simple excitement come on cy swallow it whole leave them in the dust look hes going for twelve oh jesus hes got it sewed up now just she glanced up at tucker and found him grinning at her what im crazy about you he kissed her hard and long as cy a little green beneath the purple splotches was declared champion plum crazy good she brushed her fingers over his cheeks and into his hair thats good now maybe i should help the winner scrub blueberry juice off his face let him get his own girl tucker decided and pulled her along to the next event theyd cleared the parking lot of the lutheran church for the target shoot mcgreedys had supplied the beer bottles and hunters friend the ammo the elimination rounds went quickly with frustrated hopefuls unloading their weapons and taking a place on the sidelines tucker was pleased to see dwayne preparing for the second round it had taken a lot of fast hard talk to convince his brother to participate in the days events he didnt want any gossip until it was impossible to avoid it and he wanted dwayne to continue acting normally in tuckers mind normal equaled innocent both dwayne and josie are entered caroline commented we were all taught to shoot early old beau insisted on it what about you youre not after the grand prize of a smoked ham and a blue ribbon he shrugged i never cared much for guns there goes susie he waited until shed blasted away three bottles with three shots lordy shes a cool hand good thing she married a lawman with that aim she couldve taken up a life of crime cousin lulu concerned caroline put a hand on tuckers arm lulu swaggered up with a pair of colts snug in a leather holster riding low on her bony hips do you really think she should she broke off as the old lady drew and fired the three bottles seemed to explode as one oh my she can handle anything from a to an ak he watched entertained as lulu twirled a colt around her finger in three fast circles then shot it back home but if she asks you to stand with an apple on your head id decline shes not as young as she once was it ended with lulu edging out susie and a very annoyed will shiver the crowd began to gather back on the street for foot races sweetwaters doing well for itself caroline accepted the cold bottle of coke tucker passed her arent you going to run run tucker lighted a cigarette and flipped away the match darlin why would i want to get all tired and sweaty just to get from one point to another of course she smiled to herself i dont know what got into me sighing she settled back against his chest while the first runners took their marks so you dont enter any event well now there is one i usually go for she turned her head to look back at him which wait and see greased pigs caroline had thought shed gotten into the spirit of things but when she stood behind the temporary paddock in the town square listening to the porcine squeals she realized she hadnt come close tucker had bowed off from eating pies he didnt choose to shoot and he yawned at the thought of racing but he was standing in the paddock stripped to the waist waiting for the signal to go catch a lardcoated pig baffled caroline rested an elbow on cys shoulder how are you feeling oh just fine now he assured her i chucked most of it up and the rest is settling all right he fingered the blue ribbon pinned proudly to his tshirt mr tuckers going to win is that right always does he can move real quick when hes a mind to he let out a whoop with the rest of the crowd here they go the shouts and laughter from the onlookers were as wild as the squeaks from the pigs and the curses from the men pursuing them as an extra incentive the ground had been watered and churned to mud men slipped and sloshed in it bellyflopped and backflipped pigs squirted out of questing hands oh why dont i have a camera caroline let out a crow of laughter when tucker skidded on his backside he twisted when a pig raced across his knees but came up empty that fbi doctors good cy shouted cheering when teddy tackled a pig and nearly held on mightve had it if bobby lee hadnt tripped over him mr tuckers going for the big one come on mr tucker haul em up an interesting contest burns said as he stopped beside them i suppose dignity is sacrificed for the thrill of the hunt caroline nearly shot him an impatient look but she didnt want to miss anything youre keeping your dignity i see im afraid i dont see the point in wallowing in mud and chasing pigs you wouldnt its called fun oh i agree in fact ive never been more entertained he smiled down at tucker who was currently sprawled facefirst in the dirt longstreet looks quite natural dont you think ill tell you what i think she began but cy grabbed her arm look hes got him hes got him miss caroline and there was tucker slicked with mud and grease holding a squirming pig over his head when he grinned up at caroline she wished shed had a dozen roses to throw no spanglesuited matador had ever looked more charming to the victor go the spoils burns noted tell me does he get to keep the pig caroline tucked her tongue in her cheek until the butchering and pot luck supper next winter excuse me i want to go congratulate the winner one moment he blocked her way are you still staying at sweetwater for the time being you might want to reconsider it isnt wise sleeping under the same roof with a murderer what are you talking about burns glanced over to where dwayne and tucker were washing down mud with a beer perhaps you should ask your host i can tell you that ill be making an arrest tomorrow and the longstreets wont have much to cheer about enjoy the rest of the festivities saying nothing caroline latched on to cy and pushed by him what did he mean miss caroline i dont know but im going to find out by the time shed worked her way through the crowd tucker was gone where did he go he probably went down to mcgreedys to hose off with the others most everybodyll be packing up to go down to sweetwater for picnics before the fireworks theyll be opening the carnival too frustrated caroline stopped she couldnt talk to him surrounded by a bunch of wet backslapping men she needed him alone rising on her toes she scanned heads and faces theres delia why dont you catch up with her ride back to sweetwater ill wait for tucker nom mr tucker said i was to stay with you when he wasnt around thats not necessary cy i donta look at the boys set jaw and she swallowed a sigh all right then well park ourselves somewhere and wait sitting on the stoop in front of larssons they watched the exodus from town you shouldnt let that fbi man worry you miss caroline he doesnt im just concerned cy tugged his ribbon around so he could read it again hes like vernon surprised caroline turned to study cy agent burns is like your brother i dont mean he goes around starting fights or hitting women but he thinks hes smarter and better than everyone else figures his ways the only way and he likes having his foot on your throat caroline rested her chin on her hand and considered burns would detest the comparison but it was eerily apt with vernon it was scripture his interpretation with burns it was the law his interpretation in either case it was the using of something right and just for personal power theyre the ones who lose in the end she thought of her mother as well a great wielder of power a master of carving out her own will because no one who doesnt have to stays with them thats sad its better if people care about you even if you arent always smarter even if you arent always sure youre right she stood tucker was strolling down the street his shirt flung over his shoulder his hair dripping his jeans soaking wet looks like were going home she crossed the street to slip her arms around him laughing he tried to nudge her back honey im not as clean as i might be doesnt matter she turned her head to murmur in his ear i need to talk to you alone he would have liked to have interpreted the demand as romantic but he heard the tension felt the nerves in the line of her body all right soon as we can he kept one arm around her as they began to walk lets get a move on cy i heard delias cooked up a regular feast probably baked a few pies too cy grinned goodnaturedly i aint looking at another pie till next fourth of july got to keep in practice boy tucker flipped a finger down the boys blue ribbon you know why im so good at latching on to those slippery critters he swung caroline off her feet cause im always grabbing some wriggly female caroline relaxed enough to smile are you comparing me with a sow why no indeed darlin im just saying if a man puts his mind to it he can keep what he wants from slipping out of his hold back at sweetwater there were blankets spread on the grass and the calliope was piping its siren song from over in eustis field near the pond where death had so recently floated music twanged out from a fiddle a banjo and a guitar here and there exhausted children napped many of them sprawled where theyd dropped an impromptu softball game was under way and now and then the crack of the bat set up a cheer old men sat in folding chairs to root and gossip and wish for strong young legs that could pump toward home young people drifted toward the carnival where the rides were half price until six is it like this every year caroline asked she was close enough to the music to appreciate far enough from the carnival not to dwell on how tawdry it looked in the daylight just about tucker lay on his back debating if he had room for one more drumstick what do you usually do on the fourth it depends if im out of the country the day goes by like any other when im in the states we usually tie the concert to a fireworks display the fiddler took up little brown jug and caroline began playing it in her head tucker i have to ask you about something matthew said to me earlier the agents name had tucker deciding against another drumstick i should have figured hed find a way to ruin things he said he was going to make an arrest tomorrow she closed her hand over his tucker are you in trouble he shut his eyes briefly then rolled folding his legs under him to sit its dwayne caro dwayne stunned she shook her head hes going to arrest dwayne i dont know that he can tucker said slowly the lawyer thinks burns is blustering that maybe he was trying to get dwayne to say something he shouldnt all hes got is speculation no physical evidence what kind of speculation he can put dwayne in the same area as the killings without any alibis so far and hes using dwaynes trouble with sissy as a kind of motive divorce as a motive for killing other women caroline arched her brows that gives about half the adult male population of the country a motive seems pretty thin doesnt it then why do you look so worried because burns may be a firstclass asshole but hes not stupid he knows dwayne drinks he knows how he was embarrassed by sissy and he knows dwayne had an acquaintance with the victims the one up in nashvilles the kicker nashville letting out a long breath she nodded tell me hed hoped to keep it all from her for at least one day but once he began the words streamed out under them she could sense the anger and a very real fear what did your lawyer advise that we just go on as usual wait and see of course if dwayne could come up with an alibi for one of the nights that would cool things off he popped open a beer frowned into it i got a call in to the governor hes a little hard to reach today but i expect hell call me back tomorrow she tried a smile hoping to coax one from tucker hes a cousin i suppose the governor he did smile fleetingly no but his wife is odds are burns is going to need a lot more to put the cuffs on dwayne i can talk to my father if you like hes corporate but he knows some excellent criminal attorneys tucker tilted back the beer lets hope i dont have to take you up on it the worst of it is caro dwaynes so scared hes doubting himself what do you mean hes worried that maybe when he was drunk when he wasnt thinking straight he might have her heartbeat skipped my god tucker you dont think no i dont he said with a barely restrained fury jesus caroline dwaynes harmless as a puppy he may flap around and scuffle when hes drunk but he hurts only himself and think he added because he had been and hed been thinking hard the way those women were killed it was vicious yeah and sort of primal and wild but it was also planned thought out clean and clever a mans not clever with a head full of whiskey he gets sloppy and stupid you dont have to convince me tucker she said quietly but she wondered if he was trying to convince himself hes my brother for tucker that said it all he could see dwayne now sitting with old mr ohara tucker figured the jug they were passing was of oharas own brew and it wasnt lemonade hell be drunk as a skunk before nightfall i havent got the heart to cut him off sooner or later youll have to wont you she put a hand on his cheek otherwise youll just be cutting him out ive been thinking about what you said about families not just about taking a stand but about making things right im going to call my mother i guess what youre telling me is if my advice is good enough for you it ought to be good enough for me she smiled something like that with a nod he looked back toward dwayne theres a place up in memphis it has a good reputation for helping people shake themselves loose of the bottle i think if i work it right i could talk him into giving it a try darling she said easing into a delta drawl with your talent you could talk a starving man out of his last crust of bread that so thats so he leaned over to touch his lips to hers that being the case maybe i could talk you into doing something for me something ive had a hankering for caroline thought of the cool empty house behind them of the big canopied bed i imagine you could persuade me more than willing she melted into the kiss what did you have in mind well you see ive had this craving he turned his head to nip at her ear im delighted to hear it i dont want to offend you she chuckled against his throat please do i thought you might be a little shy doing it out here in front of all these people i can what with a half laugh she pulled away do what in front of all these people why play a few tunes darlin his lips curved what did you think i was talking about as his smile spread wickedly he lifted a brow why caroline im going to start thinking you have a onetrack mind yours certainly takes some interesting curves blowing out a breath she combed fingers through her hair you want me to play probably nearly as much as youd like to be playing she started to speak then stopped and shook her head youre right i would like to tucker gave her a quick kiss ill go fetch your fiddle chapter twentynine she was welcomed into the little band but dubiously people settled back politely very much caroline thought as a class might when they were about to listen to a boring but respected lecturer it occurred to her that shed grown accustomed to ovations when she took the stage obviously too accustomed she thought now as her nerves began to jump this little patch of grass beside sweetwater pond wasnt carnegie hall but it was a stage of sorts and her current audience was reserving judgment she felt ridiculous absurdly out of place with her gleaming stradivarius and juilliard training she was ready to babble an excuse and crawl away when she saw young jim grinning at her well now little lady old mr koons ran his fingers down his banjo strings and made them twang he couldnt see more than three feet in front of himself but he could still pick with the best of them whats your pleasure how about whiskey for breakfast thatll do her he tapped his foot for time well get her going missy and you just come on in when youve a mind to caroline let the first few bars roll by it was a good sound full and cluttered when the rhythm had caught she tucked the violin on her shoulder sucked in a deep breath and cut loose and the feeling was good full and cluttered as fun was supposed to be the hand clapping from the audience kept time sharply there was plenty of hooting and when someone picked up the lyrics they were given a shout of approval i do believe that fiddle of yours is smoking koons told her then took a moment to spit out a chaw lets keep her going i know only a few caroline began but koons waved her protest aside youll pick her up lets try rolling in my sweet babys arms she did pick it up her ear and instinct were keen enough when the trio segued into the blues then bounced back with a raucous rendition of the orange blossom special she was right there with them she lost herself in the pleasure of it even so she noted burns watching her and watching dwayne she saw bobby lee cuddle marvella into a dance when they slowed things down with the tennessee waltz the music poured through her but she noted that tucker had his head together with burke in what looked like a private and very serious discussion and she saw dwayne sitting gloomily a bottle at his feet and his eyes on the ground things were happening caroline mused even as the sun was lowering the carnival rides whirling the shadows lengthening things were happening beneath the whistles and the laughter nerves were jangling as fast as koonss banjo strings and she was just another player after all just one more player in the odd uneasy game fate had dropped her down into this messy stew of heat and murder and madness she was surviving more she was doing the summer was half over and she was whole she was even beginning to believe she was healed if she left innocence with only that it would be enough her gaze shifted back to tucker it would be enough she thought again with a slow smile but it didnt hurt to hope for more well kick me in the head and call me addled with a wheezy laugh koons laid his banjo over his lap you sure can make that fiddle dance little girl you aint no ladida neither why thank you mr koons its time we went and had ourselves a beer he got creakily to his feet you sure youre a yankee she smiled taking it for the compliment it was meant as no sir im not im not sure at all he slapped his knee at that then hobbled off shouting for his daughter to get him a beer that sure was some pretty playing miss caroline jim hurried over to get a peek at the violin before she closed it in the case then ill have to thank my teacher he stared then dropped his gaze to the ground but even with his head down caroline could see his grin spread from ear to ear shoot i didnt do nothing its us want to thank you toby said cupping an arm around his wifes shoulders he held himself stiffly favoring his bandaged side you stood up for us the other night i know you were a comfort to winnie im ashamed i havent thanked you properly caroline winnie added i mightve gone crazy if i hadnt known you and miss delia were looking after my kids while toby was being patched up at the hospital im obliged to you dont be im told thats what neighbors are for miss caroline lucy tugged on carolines skirt my daddys going to sing the national anthem before the fireworks mr tucker asked him special thats wonderful ill look forward to it come on now toby hitched his daughter onto his hip if i know tuck hes going to be looking for this lady here and wed better get ourselves situated for those fireworks its getting on toward dark how much longer lucy wanted to know oh no moren a half hour but ive waited all day caroline chuckled over the universal complaint as toby and winnie toted lucy away shes such a baby jim said with a superior smirk caroline sighed at the derision in his voice she knew hed defended his sister at the risk of his own life but that was forgotten now you know what occurs to me jim no maam that im an only child she laughed at his puzzled look then picked up her case go along with your family if you see tucker tell him ill be right back i might could take that inside for you miss caroline it wouldnt be no trouble thats all right i have to make a quick phone call before it gets dark and wouldnt her mother be surprised caroline thought as she started across the green lawn through the green shadows toward the white columns of the house she would wish her mother a happy independence day for both of them im free of you mother and you can be free of me maybe maybe if we face each other without all those thin taut strings between us we can find something caroline turned around to take a last sweep of the fields of sweetwater though it was barely dusk the lights on the midway and on the rides were winking in the distance they didnt look tawdry now but hopeful if she listened carefully she could just hear the piping music and laughter as the crack the whip whirled its latest passengers before long night would fall then the sky would explode with light and the air would shake from the cracking booms turning back to sweetwater she quickened her pace she didnt want to miss a moment of it her mind was so full of what was to come she paid little attention to the voices it wasnt until she heard the fury in them that she stopped wondering how she could avoid walking in on an argument when she saw josie and dwayne standing in the front drive beside josies car caroline automatically stepped back thinking she could hurry around the side terrace she hesitated just long enough to see the knife dwayne held she froze where she was beside the end column on the graceful front porch watching stunned as brother and sister faced each other over the blade across the lawn beyond the cotton field revelers waited impatiently for full dark and celebration here where the crickets were just beginning their chorus in the grass and a whippoorwill perched in a magnolia and called for a mate the two were unaware of being observed you just cant do it you just cant josie said furiously you have to see that dwayne i see the knife jesus josie he turned it in his hand staring at the dull glint as if hypnotized give it to me she struggled to keep her voice calm and even just give it to me and ill take care of everything i cant name of god josie you have to see that i cant its gone too far now sweet jesus arnette francie i can see them i can see them josie its like some sort of awful dream but it isnt a dream stop it leaning her face close to his she closed her fingers around the wrist of his knife hand you stop it right now what youre talking about doing is crazy just crazy im not going to allow it i have to you have to listen to me and thats goddamn all you have to do look at me dwayne i want you to look at me when his gaze locked on hers she spoke quietly again were family dwayne that means we stick together his sweaty fingers loosened on the hasp of the knife id do anything for you josie you know that but this is thats good smiling a little she eased the knife away from her stance by the column caroline nearly groaned with relief heres what youre going to do for me now youre going to trust me to take care of things shaking his head dwayne covered his face how can you just leave it to me you trust josie dwayne you go on back down to the field and watch those fireworks put this all right out of your mind thats important you just put it aside and ill take care of the knife he let his hands drop uncovered his face was gray and stricken id never hurt you josie you know i wouldnt but im scared if it happens again it wont after dropping the knife into her voluminous purse she looked back at him its not going to happen again gently she laid her hands on his shoulders were going to put it all behind us i want to believe that maybe we should tell tucker and he no impatient josie gave him a quick shake i dont want him to know and telling him isnt going to clean your conscience dwayne so leave it be just leave it be she repeated go on back down and ill do what needs to be done he pressed the heels of his hands against his eyes as if trying to block out the horror i cant think i just cant think straight then dont think just do what i say go on ill be along soon as i can he took two steps away before turning then stopped his head down his shoulders bowed josie why did it happen she reached out but her fingers stopped short of touching him well talk about it dwayne dont worry anymore he didnt see caroline as he walked away but she could see the devastation and torment on his face the shadows swallowed him for another moment she stood still as a statue her heart throbbing hard and slow in her throat the scent of roses and fear swimming in her head dwayne was responsible for the brutal deaths of five women the brother of the man she loved was a murderer a brother caroline knew whom tucker was deeply devoted to and she ached for them ached for them all for the pain that was already felt and the pain yet to come with all of her heart she wished she could turn and walk away pretend she had never heard never seen never knew but josie was wrong tucker had to be told no matter how deep and strong the family ties this was not something to be handled by a loving sister tucker had to be told and prepared for what must happen next josie needed to be there they would all need to be there quietly caroline moved to the porch and up through the door and into the house the silence was already oppressive as she climbed the stairs to the second floor no matter how she tried she couldnt find the right words she stopped at josies doorway and looked in the chaos of the room was in marked opposition to the stillness of the woman who stood at the open french doors the cheerful clash of scents and mixed colors was overpowered by the encroaching dark and the sense of gloom josie though caroline spoke softly she saw josie stiffen before she turned in the shadows her face was pale as a ghosts theyll be shooting off those fireworks in a minute caroline you dont want to miss them im sorry when she realized she was still carrying her violin case she set it aside and gestured helplessly with her hands josie im so sorry i dont know if i can help but ill do what i can what are you sorry about caroline i heard you and dwayne alter one shuddering breath she stepped into the room i heard you i saw him with the knife josie oh god on a moan of despair josie sunk into a chair to cover her face with her hands oh god why im sorry caroline crossed the room to crouch at josies feet i cant even imagine how you must be feeling but i do want to help just stay out of it voice edgy josie dropped her hands to her lap though her eyes were wet the heat behind them would dry tears quickly if you want to help stay out of it you know i cant not just because of tucker and the way i feel about him thats just why you should stay out of it josie grabbed her hands the slim tense fingers wrapping like wires around carolines i know you care about him you dont want him hurt youve got to leave this to me if i did what then then itll be done with itll be forgotten josie those women are dead no matter how ill dwayne is that cant be ignored it cant be forgotten bringing it all out tearing the family apart isnt going to make them any less dead its a matter of right josie and of helping dwayne help her voice rose as she pushed herself out of the chair going to prison wont help his mind isnt right wearily caroline rose it was growing too dark to see she turned on josies bedside lamp and chased away some of the shadows with a rosy glow loving hims a start but hes going to need professional help not only to find out why but to prevent him from doing it again maybe they deserved to die as she paced josie rubbed hard at her pounding temples people do and it isnt cold to say so you didnt know any of them the way i did so who are you to judge im not judging but i dont think you believe anyone deserved to die that way if something isnt done someone else might die you cant stop it josie i think youre right about that she passed her hand over her eyes id hoped with dwayne so miserable but i guess i knew all along its blood she murmured lifting her head to stare at her own face in the mirror like a wild dog once youve tasted it theres no going back theres just no going back caro caroline moved over to her so that their eyes met in the glass well find good doctors for him i know one wholl help doctors josie tugged the chiffon scarf out of her hair and gave a short laugh what bullshit did you hate your mother love your father its never that simple sometimes it is listen to that smiling a little she closed her eyes thats toby march singing they mustve hooked him up to a mike down at the carnival thats a sound that carries nice on a hot summer night josie we have to go tell tucker and we have to see that dwayne turns himself in im sorry its the only way i know youre sorry with a sigh josie reached into her bag im sorry too sorrier than i can say turning she aimed her derringer at caroline its you or the family caroline you or the longstreets so theres really only one way after all josie do you see this gun she interrupted my daddy gave it to me for my sixteenth birthday sweet sixteen he called me he was a great believer in taking care of your own i did love him i hated my father but i did love my daddy caroline moistened her lips she wasnt afraid yet her brain was too scrambled with shock for fear to take hold josie put it down you cant help dwayne this way its not just dwayne its all of us all the fine upstanding longstreets miss caroline cys voice echoed up the stairs and had both women jolting miss caroline you in here caroline saw the panic shoot into josies eyes you tell him to go on tell him caro see that he goes outside again i dont want to hurt that boy im up here cy caroline called out her gaze fastened to the short shiny gun barrel you go on out ill be along in a minute mr tucker said i should stay with you she could almost see him hesitating at the foot of the steps torn between manners and loyalties i said id be along she repeated the first true licks of fear sharpening her voice now go on out yes maam the fireworks are going to start any minute thats fine you go watch she waited hardly breathing until she heard the door shut i wouldnt want to hurt that boy josie said again ive got a real fondness for him her lips twisted in a mockery of a smile a real family feeling josie caroline struggled to keep her voice calm you know this isnt the way to solve things and you know i dont want to hurt dwayne no but youll do what you have to do just like me she slipped a hand into her purse again and pulled out the knife this was my daddys he dearly loved to hunt dressed the kill himself daddy wasnt afraid to get a little blood and guts on his hands no sir i used to go with him when hed let me i got quite a taste for hunting myself josie please put the knife away now tucker josie went on lips pursed as she turned the blade in the light he never cared much for killing things so he mostly missed on purpose as if baffled by the waste she shook her head lordy did daddy wail into him for it dwayne he didnt have any problem bringing down a deer or a rabbit but when it came time to dress em hed go green squeamish thats what daddy used to say josie you come on over here and show this boy how its done she laughed a little so i would blood never turned my stomach its got a smell to it kind of wild kind of sweet with her skin going clammy caroline inched back josie the word came out in a cracked whisper as their eyes met again when daddy died the knife came to me she held it up so it glinted in the lamplight again the knife came to me caroline stared at the glint of silver behind her the first fiery lights exploded in a black sky chapter thirty the pretty little gun seemed like a joke now beside the longbladed knife it was more of an annoyance something to be swatted away like a fly but caroline made no move toward it all of her attention and all of her fear was focused on the slick gleam of silver josie you cant protect dwayne this way you dont believe me josie nearly laughed there was a part of her the part she had no longer been able to control that capered with glee who would no one even considered a woman least of all our fine special agent look for someone who hates women i told him but he didnt understand you and i know that no one can hate the way a woman can hate a jolt shook caroline as the fireworks rocketed and boomed why would you i have reasons i have plenty of reasons she moved closer until she was framed in the terrace doorway her eyes were as brilliant as the lights that studded the sky behind her i had to protect the family i had to protect myself just as i will now but its different with you caroline i wont enjoy it with you because i like you i respect you and i know how much its going to hurt tucker dont she said as caroline edged away i dont want to have to shoot you but i will no one will hear no no one would hear she could scream just as edda lou had screamed and no one would notice the derringer was pointed at her throat a tiny bullet she thought a small death i dont want you to suffer josie told her not like the others youre not like the others think caroline ordered herself she had to think the key to this was family if she could only find a way to use it tucker and dwayne will suffer josie i know ill make it up to them her eyes shifted for a moment as gold lights flashed bloomed and faded in the sky isnt that a pretty sight the longstreets have had fireworks here at sweetwater for more than a hundred years that means something i remember daddy carrying me on his shoulders so i could get closer to the sky i was his firecracker hed say and mama would just watch and say nothing she didnt want me you know talk to me josie how much longer could the fireworks go on how much longer before tucker or someone came to look for them tell me josie so i can understand why you had to do it i can talk to you theres time itll be easier if you see maybe easier for both of us she took a long deep breath austin hatinger was my father her lips twisted at the shock on carolines face thats right that biblethumping snakemean bastard was my blood father he raped my mother and while he was raping her he planted me inside her she didnt want me but when she found she was pregnant she had to go through with it how can you be sure she was sure i heard her talking to delia in the kitchen delia knew only delia satisfied with the knife josie slipped the derringer into her pocket she hadnt told daddy i guess she was afraid to and she would have wanted to protect him and the family and sweetwater so she had me and she tolerated me and she watched me to see how much like him id be josie i was a grown woman when i found out she lied to me all my life my beautiful mother that great lady the woman i wanted to be like more than anything was just a liar she was only trying to keep you from being hurt she hated me the words ripped out of her as she slashed the air with the knife every time she looked at me shed see the way i was conceived in the dirt planted in the dirt while she cried for help and wouldnt she have to ask herself how much was her own doing why did she go there did she really care so much about austin and his pitiful wife you cant blame your mother josie i can blame her for giving me a lie to live with for looking at me out of the corner of her eye and thinking i was less than her or any other woman she said to delia that day that maybe i wasnt meant to be happy to have a home of my own and a family because of my blood my tainted blood she spat out the words while outside the sky rocked with color id come back here after my second divorce and she had that look in her eye that look that blamed me for it and she said to delia that maybe i wasnt meant to have a home and children maybe it was the lords way of punishing her for keeping the secret for holding the lie inside her she was feeling poorly had been feeling poorly for some time when she went out to her roses i went too i wanted her to tell me facetoface we had a terrible argument and i left her there standing in the roses and crying a little later tucker went out and found her dead so i guess i killed her no no of course you didnt it wasnt your fault or hers josie that doesnt change anything i had something growing inside me it wasnt a child the doctors had already told me id never have a child but what was growing was real and it was hot it started with arnette she wanted to get her hooks into dwayne just like sissy had she thought she could use me and i played along i thought about it and thought about it id spend whole nights lying in bed and thinking wondering mama had kept a secret by giving life i was going to keep one by taking it there was a roar from outside as rocket after rocket shot up in the grand finale there had to be a reason though i wasnt an animal it had to make sense so i figured it would be those women who teased and strutted and lied to get men ive had myself plenty of men josie said with a smile but i never lied to get them arnette i thought she was your friend she was a slut josie shrugged her shoulders carelessly not that she was my first choice i thought about susie id always figured if burke and i could get together well anyway susie didnt fit she never in her life looked at another man but burke so killing her wouldnt have been right it had to be right josie murmured while iciness spread in carolines stomach so there was arnette it was so easy to get her a little drunk drive out to gooseneck creek i hit her with a rock then i took off her clothes and tied her up it was cold jesus it was cold but i waited until she came around then i pretended i was my father and she was my mother and i did things to her until it wasnt cold anymore it was better for a while she said dreamily i felt so much better then it started growing in me again so there was francie she was dangling for tucker i knew it then it was supposed to be sissy but i made a mistake there but each time it was better when they called in the fbi i wanted to laugh and laugh no one was going to look at me teddy even took me to the morgue so i could see edda lou at first it was awful but then i realized that i had done that i had done it and nobody was ever going to know it was my secret just like mama and i wanted to do it again again while everybody was looking around darken was so perfect it was like it was meant you were right there with happy when they were looking for her i was sorry happy had to suffer it seemed right that i comfort her some darleen isnt worth her crying over not one of them was worth a tear but you are caro if only youd let it be i was going to try to keep my promise to dwayne and stop since it seemed so important to him but now i have to break that promise at least this one last time this time theyll know maybe if they do ill take care of it always figured id have to end it one day my own way the last of the rockets went off like machinegun fire i wont go to jail or to one of those places they put people who do things other people dont understand she gestured with the gun turn around now ill have to tie you up first i promise ill make it quick tucker moved restlessly through the crowd as the colorful bombs burst overhead he hadnt seen caroline for the past half hour women as if he didnt have enough on his mind with dwayne and the fbi shed pick this time to wander off he shook his head at the offer of a beer and continued to wend his way through the clutches of people its a right good display cousin lulu said from her directors chair ummhmm how would you know youve hardly looked at it to please her he looked skyward and admired an umbrella of red white and blue lights have you seen caroline lost your yankee lulu cackled and lit a sparkler looks that way he raised his voice to be heard over the cheers of the crowd i havent seen her since she finished playing a while back plays right well lulu wrote her name in the air with the sparkler guess shell be going along soon to play for the crowned heads of europe something like that with his hands in his pockets he scanned faces i dont see how you can find anybody out here in the dark aint going to find her here anyway lulu pouted a moment when her sparkler fizzled out she wanted to wait until things quieted down before she set off her pocketful of firecrackers i saw her heading for the house around twilight why would she oh probably wanted to put her violin away but she should have been back he turned to study the white ghost of the house in the distance hed always thought the best way to figure a woman was not to figure at all ill go take a look youll miss the finale ill be back he started off at a lope annoyed at having to hurry for the life of him he couldnt figure out why shed be holed up in the house it nagged at him that maybe hed pressured her into playing she could be upset or the whole business might have brought on one of those headaches on an oath he quickened his pace and nearly ran over dwayne jesus christ whatre you doing sitting back here in the dark i dont know what to do dwayne kept his head pressed to his knees and rocked i have to clear my mind and figure out what to do i said i was going to take care of it burns is just blowing hot air i could say i did it dwayne mumbled that might be the best way for everyone goddammit tucker reached down to shake dwaynes shoulder dont start that shit on me now well talk about it later when ive got time ive got to go up and see if carolines in the house come on with me itll be better if you dont talk to anybody tonight i told her i wouldnt dwayne dragged himself to his feet but somethings got to be done tuck somethings got to be done sure it does resigned tucker put his arm around dwayne and took his weight well do it too i know all about it you know dwayne staggered to a halt that had tucker cursing and pulling she said you didnt when i said that we had to tell you she said not to tell me what about the knife daddys old buck i saw it under the seat of her car christ tuck how could she do it how could she do all those things whats going to happen to her now tucker felt his blood slow he felt it slow and stop until it seemed to hum in his veins what the hell are you talking about josie oh jesus josie dwayne began to weep as the weight of it pounded at him she killed them tuck she killed them all i dont know how i can live with turning my own sister over to the law slowly tucker backed up leaving dwayne swaying youre out of your fucking mind we have to do it i know we have to chrissakes she meant it to be sissy shut up with rage and fear blinding him tucker plowed his fist into dwaynes face youre drunk and stupid if i hear you say another word ill mr tucker eyes wide cy stood on the verge of the driveway hed heard heard all that they said but he didnt know what to believe what the hell are you doing there tucker demanded why arent you down watching the fireworks i you said as i should keep close to her cys insides were shaking with the kind of fear he hadnt known he could feel again she went on in but she told me to stay outside she said i shouldnt come upstairs caroline tucker said blankly the blow had shocked dwayne back to reality as cys words sunk in he grabbed tucker by the shirt josie she took the knife with her she took the knife and went into the house tuckers breath came in pants he wanted to fight wanted to fight out the horror that was settling inside him but even as he balled his fists he saw the truth in dwaynes eyes let go of me with a strength born of fear he shoved dwayne back to his knees carolines in the house he began to run hurtling toward sweetwater chased by the roar of the crowd and the cold breath of terror i wont make it easy for you josie she wasnt afraid of the gun wouldnt let herself be afraid but she had a deep primal fear of that sharp length of steel you know it has to stop no matter what you feel no matter what your mother did you cant fix it by killing i wanted to be like her but people always said i was like my father they were right her voice took on a curious almost musical calm they didnt know how right and they wont its my secret caroline ill kill you to protect it i know and after you do dwayne and tucker will suffer for it dwayne because hell know and itll eat him alive tucker because he has feelings for me and because you love them youll suffer too theres no choice here now turn around caroline turn around or itll be so much worse with the last echoes of celebration ringing in her ears she started to turn she didnt dare close her eyes didnt dare but she offered one quick and fervent prayer when her body was threequarters turned from josie caroline threw out a hand to smash the lamp to the floor blessing the dark she tucked up her legs and rolled across the bed it wont matter excitement sharpened josies voice now there was a hunt and with a hunt there was hunger itll only be easier for me now i wont have to look at you and i can think of you like the others her feet whispered across the carpet as caroline hunched beside the bed and strained to see if she could only get to the door if she could only get quickly and soundlessly to the door i like the dark holding her breath caroline inched away from the bed feeling her way with her fingers i never minded hunting in the dark daddy used to say i had cat eyes and i can hear your heart beat quick as a snake she pounced on the spot where caroline had crouched only seconds before caroline bit her lip to hold back a scream as she tasted blood she forced herself not to move her eyes were adjusting and in the pale moonlight she could see josies silhouette and the edge of the death she held in her hand only a turn of her head and they would be facetoface and she did turn it slowly the moonlight glinted in her eyes her lips curved caroline remembered how austin had looked when he had loomed over her filled with murder and madness it wont take long josie promised as she lifted the blade in a last plunge to cheat death caroline rolled away the blade caught the skirt of her dress pinning it to the floor on a cry of terror she ripped it free and stumbled to her feet she raced toward the doorway waiting to hear the whistle of steel through the air the heat of the blade as it cut into her back the light in the hall flashed on blindingly bright after the dark caroline tucker pounded down the hall grabbing her as she fell through the doorway youre all right tell me youre all right he dragged her close and holding her there stared at his sister she had the knife in her hand and in her eyes was a wildness that gripped him with horror josie in the name of god josie what have you done the wildness faded as her eyes filled i couldnt help it as tears spilled onto her cheeks she turned and ran to the terrace dont let her go tucker you cant let her go he saw his brother hesitate at the top of the steps take care of her he said to dwayne and pushed caroline toward him before he raced after josie he called her name some of the revelers who were heading home stopped at the shouts and looked up with much the same curiosity and expectation with which theyd watched the fireworks tucker sped along the terrace dragging open doors switching on lights when he tugged on the doors that led into their parents bedroom he found them locked josie after a few frantic yanks he pounded on the door josie open up i want you to let me in you know i can break it down if i have to he laid his brow against the glass and tried to reason out what his mind simply couldnt grasp his sister was inside and his sister was mad he pounded again cracking the glass and bloodying his fingers open the goddamn door he heard a sound behind him and whirled when he saw burke come toward him he shook his head get away get the hell away shes my sister tuck cy didnt tell me what this is all about but just get the hell away on a scream of rage tucker threw his weight against the door the tickle of breaking glass was lost under the blast of a single gunshot no tucker went down to his knees she was lying on the bed their parents had shared blood was spreading onto the white satin spread oh josie no already grieving he dragged himself up sitting on the bed he gathered her into his arms and rocked im glad you came to see me caroline poured coffee into two cups before she sat at her kitchen table across from delia i wanted to talk to you but i thought it best to wait until after the funeral the preacher said she was resting now delia pressed her lips together hard then lifted her cup i hope hes right its the living that suffer caroline its going to take some doing for tucker and dwayne to put this behind them and the others too happy and junior arnette and francies folks and you caroline reached out to take delias hand i know you loved her i did her voice was rough with the tears she blinked away always will no matter what she did there was a sickness inside her in the end she did the only thing she knew to cure it if shed have hurt you her hand shook then steadied i thank god she didnt tucker wouldnt have been able to get beyond it i came here today to tell you that and to say that i hope you wont turn away from the brother because of the sister tucker and i will settle things ourselves delia i feel you have a right to know josie told me about her mother about how she was conceived under carolines delias hand convulsed she knew yes she knew but how she found out from her mother inadvertently i know it must have been hard on you and on mrs longstreet holding on to that secret we thought it best she came home that day after he hurt her her dress was torn and dirty and her face was pale as spring water and her eyes her eyes caroline were like a sleepwalkers all dazed and dull she went right on up and got in the tub kept changing the water and scrubbing and scrubbing till her skin was raw i saw the bruises on her i knew i just knew and because i knew where shed gone i knew who you dont have to talk about it caroline said but delia shook her head i wanted to go over and take a whip to him myself but i couldnt leave her i held her while she sat in the water and she cried and cried and cried when shed cried out she said we werent to tell mr beau nor anybody else she was afraid the two of them would kill each other and i expect she was right there was nothing i could say to her that could get the idea out of her head that she was responsible it was always mr beau for her caroline she was a pretty girl and young and she saw a bit of austin now and again but she never promised to marry him that was an idea he got fixed in that hateful brain of his he had no right to do what he did delia no one could think otherwise she did she sniffled and wiped a tear away with her knuckle not that he had the right but that somehow shed pushed him to it then she found out she was carrying and mr beau had been up in richmond the whole two weeks during her fertile time so she had to figure austin had gotten her pregnant there was no question of telling anybody then she didnt want the child hurt she did her best to forget but she worried and when josie would go off wild she worried more she had her mamas looks josie did just like her brothers but i guess because we knew we could see something of him in her so could she caroline thought but said nothing she wasnt to know not ever but since she did i wish shed come to me so i could have told her how her mother tried to protect her delia sighed and dabbed at her eyes then she went very still but she knew lord help us she knew is that why she oh my baby my poor baby dont caroline cupped delias hand between both of her own and leaned close to comfort there was much that had been said in that shadowy bedroom that would remain there in the dark she was ill delia thats all we know theyre all dead now josie her parents austin theres no one to blame i think because of the living because of the ones we love the secret should be buried with them struggling for control delia nodded maybe josiell rest easier that way maybe we all will shed hoped he would come caroline had wanted to give him time but it had been a week since josies funeral and shed hardly seen him never alone innocence was doing its best to lick its wounds and go on from susie caroline had learned that tucker had been to see the family members of each victim what had been said behind those closed doors remained private but she hoped it had brought a kind of healing the summer was passing the delta had a short respite from the heat when the temperatures dropped to the eighties it wouldnt last but shed learned to appreciate each moment after hooking the pups bright red collar to his leash she started down the lane the flowers her grandmother had planted years before were thriving it took only a little care and patience useless tugged at his leash and she quickened her pace perhaps they would walk all the way down to sweetwater perhaps it was time to try she turned at the end of her lane and saw tuckers car almost instantly it looked as snazzy and arrogant as it had the first time shed seen it barreling toward her the sight of it made her smile a heart wasnt as easily healed as mangled metal but it could be done with care and patience with a cluck of her tongue she pulled useless back onto the lawn she knew where to find tucker he was fond of water of still quiet water he hadnt been sure he could sit here again coming back had been a kind of test but the deep green shade and the dark placid pond were working their magic contentment was still out of reach but hed gotten a grip on acceptance the dog raced out of the bush barking and plopped his forelegs on tuckers knees hey there boy hey fella youre getting some size on you arent you i believe youre trespassing caroline said as she moved into the clearing tucker offered a halfhearted smile as he scratched the dogs ears your grandmother let me come and sit here a spell from time to time well then she sat on the log beside him i wouldnt want to break tradition she watched the dog lick tuckers hands and wrists hes missed you so have i ive been hard to be around lately he tossed a twig for the dog to chase heats let up he said lamely i noticed i expect itll be back before long she linked her hands in her lap i expect he stared at the water awhile longer then went on staring at it when he spoke again caroline we havent talked about that night and we dont have to he shook his head as she reached for his hand and stood to move away she was my sister his voice was strained and as he continued to study the water caroline saw how tired he looked she wondered if shed ever see that carefree grin again and hoped she was ill tucker im trying to see that the same as if shed had cancer i loved her caroline i love her now too and its hard remembering her and how full of life and spit she was its hard remembering all those graves shes responsible for but its hardest closing my eyes and seeing you running out of that room and josie just behind you with a knife in her hand i cant tell you itll go away not for either of us but ive learned not to look back he bent down for a pebble and tossed it into the water i wasnt sure youd want to see me you should have been she rose as agitated as the pup who ran in circles with a twig in his mouth you started this between us tucker you wouldnt let it alone you wouldnt listen when i said i didnt want to be involved he threw another stone i guess thats true ive been wondering if it wouldnt be best if i just let you go on your way pick up where you were before i got messed up in your life she watched the pebble plop and shoot out its spreading ripples sometimes you accomplished more by stirring things up she decided than by letting them run smooth oh thats fine thats just like you isnt it head for the door when things get complicated with a woman she grabbed his arm and shoved him around to face her well im not like the others i didnt mean ill tell you what you mean she tossed back giving him a hard thump on the chest that had his mouth falling open in surprise its been nice caro see you around well forget it youre not going to stroll in and change my life then walk away whistling im in love with you and i want to know what youre going to do about it its not that i he broke off his eyes closed as if on a pain then he laid his hands on her shoulders rested his brow against hers oh god caro i want you to shh just hush a minute i need to hold you he drew her closer his grip tightening until she felt his muscles tremble ive needed to hold you so much these past few days i was afraid youd back away you were wrong i was going to try and be noble and let you go he buried his face in her hair im not much good at being noble thank god for that smiling she tilted her head back you havent answered me i was thinking more of kissing you nope she put a hand on his chest to hold him off i want an answer i said i loved you and i want to know what youre going to do about it well his hands slid away from her he found the best thing to do with them was to jam them in his pockets i had it pretty well worked out before before everything happened she shook her head there is no before try now i guess i was thinking about you going on this next tour you do want to go i want to go on this one for myself yeah i was
