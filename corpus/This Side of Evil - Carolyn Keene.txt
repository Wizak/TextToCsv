carolyn keene this side of evil chapter one вђњhey this isnвђt badвђќ george fayne exclaimed looking around the nicely furnished apartment вђњnot bad at allвђќ she sat down on the floor in front of the stereo and began to fiddle with the knobs tuning in a rock music station вђњlookвђthereвђs even a vcrвђќ she added вђњif we get bored we can always rent a movieвђќ nancy drew shrugged out of her black linen jacket and walked into the bedroom twin bedsвђroom for both her and george ned nickerson nancyвђs longtime boyfriend could sleep on the living room sofa вђњyouвђre rightвђќ she agreed happily as she walked back into the living room вђњpretty neat thereвђs even a kitchen so we can fix our own meals if we want toвђќ the apartment where they were to stay during their trip to montreal canada was small it was on the sixth floor though and had a terrific view of the saint lawrence river nancy went to the window and looked out across the wide and gray river which was crowded with ships in the distance was a green island dotted with oddly shaped buildings вђњthatвђs saintehгleneвђs islandвђќ ned said coming up behind nancy вђњwhere expo sixtyseven was heldвђќ he slipped his arm around nancyвђs shoulders affectionately вђњmaybe the worldfamous detective could take a couple of hours off work to go sightseeing over thereвђќ he suggested nancy returned his hug вђњi hope soвђќ she murmured leaning against him it was great to have ned with her on this case theyвђd been apart so often in the past few months that just being with him was like being on vacationвђeven if she did have to work she thought back to her last case wings of fear which had taken bess and her to seattle without ned nancy was in montreal at the request of ashley amberton executive secretary at cherbourg industries to investigate a blackmailing operation within the company it shouldnвђt be a big job ashley amberton had told her and it should leave some time for fun first only george was going to accompany nancy but since ned was on a break from emerson college he decided to come along as well to give nancy a hand andвђhe saidвђto make sure she took some time off this couldnвђt have made nancy happier it was spring and spring in montreal was beautiful and could be very romantic вђњcan you see olympic stadiumвђќ george asked eagerly coming to the window she ran her fingers through her short curly dark hair вђњi canвђt wait to go running thereвђќ вђњaccording to the map the stadiumвђs over that wayвђќ nancy pointed upriver вђњbut i told you george i donвђt think thereвђs a track in olympic stadium any longer iвђve seen the montreal expos playing baseball on tv there and iвђve never seen a trackвђќ вђњthereвђs got to be a track in there somewhereвђќ george argued вђњi mean you donвђt just destroy a place like thatвђќ she laughed her dark eyes sparkling вђњthe case of the missing trackвђi guess thatвђs the first mystery we have to solveвђќ nancy tossed her shoulderlength reddish gold hair вђњthatвђs your mysteryвђќ she told george glancing at her watch вђњiвђve got my own to solve iвђd better get goingвђќ вђњlet me get my camera and iвђll walk with you part of the wayвђќ ned said picking up his tan windbreaker вђњiвђm going sightseeingвђќ cherbourg industries ltd occupied a tall chromeandglass building on saintantoine street in downtown montreal only a short walk from their apartment nancy took the elevator to ashley ambertonвђs office on the fifteenth floor the office was wonderfully luxurious ms amberton must be a powerful person at cherbourg industries nancy thought looking around there was a balcony overlooking the river velvety carpet on the floor even a television set a large telescope stood beside the window curious nancy bent over to peer through it all she could see though was a large gray cargo ship with cherbourg on the side it was docked beside a mountain of crates on the wharf not a very inspiring view вђњand have you deduced the purpose of the telescope nancy drewвђќ a woman asked coolly her clipped speech emphasizing her air of efficient authority the woman who had come into the room was tall and attractive in a tailored navy suit her black hair was pulled back into a french braid behind her blackrimmed glasses her eyes were a pale icy blue she appeared to be around thirty nancy straightened up it was definitely the woman she had spoken to on the telephone ashley amberton вђњi supposeвђќ nancy said with a smile вђњthat youвђre checking out the cherbourg dockingsвђќ вђњexactlyвђќ ms amberton said sitting down in the black leather chair behind the massive desk вђњi report the exact time of each shipвђs arrival directly to mr cherbourgвђќ she gave nancy a measuring look вђњi must say iвђm surprised from all iвђve read about you and your successes i expected someone olderвђќ nancy grinned and took the chair in front of the desk it was a comment she was used to hearing from her clients вђњyouth doesnвђt necessarily mean inexperience does itвђќ she replied meaningfully as she glanced around the elegant office ashley amberton had obviously come a long way in a short time herself ms amberton raised her thinly plucked eyebrows and gave a crisp nod вђњi trust youвђre getting settled into the suiteвђyou and your friendsвђќ she said вђњyou did bring your friendsвђќ nancy nodded вђњnedвђs gone sightseeing and george is trying to find out what theyвђve done with the track in olympic stadium she wants to run thereвђќ вђњgood i hope they find montreal interesting for the short while youвђre hereвђќ ms amberton said with a smile вђњi mean this should be a very easy case for a detective of your spectacular talents ms drew iвђm sure youвђll wrap it up in no timeвђќ вђњi hope soвђќ nancy took out her notebook вђњwhy donвђt you tell me what you know about these blackmail schemesвђќ вђњvery well there are three cases so far as i knowвђќ ms amberton said leaning back in her chair and removing her glasses вђњthe first involves my secretary monique levereвђќ she nodded toward a glass window nancy could see a secretary at work in the adjacent office вђњmonique usually sits there but sheвђs at home with the flu todayвђќ nancy raised her pencil вђњwould it be possible for me to interview her at home this afternoonвђќ вђњof course iвђll have cynthia phone and tell her to expect youвђќ ms amberton picked up the telephone and spoke into it briefly she sounded like someone who was used to being obeyed in the outer office the secretary hung up the phone and made a note on her pad вђњthe second victimвђќ ms amberton continued looking back at nancy вђњis one of our file clerks becky evans she works down at the end of the hallвђќ вђњand the thirdвђќ вђњthe thirdвђќ ms amberton said вђњis mr cherbourgвђs chauffeur jacques olivier i will arrange for you to interview both of themвђќ she leaned forward and put her glasses back on speaking in clipped syllables вђњeven though this is a minor matter ms drewвђnothing similar to the major crimes you are used to dealing withвђit must be cleared up immediately mr cherbourg is concerned about his employees heвђs also worried that if people find out about this it may reflect badly on the company thatвђs why we havenвђt called the police itвђs a matter of the companyвђs reputationвђќ вђњof courseвђќ nancy said soothingly вђњi understand how important it is to get to the bottom of this quicklyвђќ вђњand thereвђs one more thingвђќ ms amberton added вђњitвђs imperative that i know everything you discover no matter how inconsequential so that i can keep mr cherbourg informedвђќ she tapped her long redpolished nails against the desk вђњis that clearвђќ вђњyes of courseвђќ nancy said with an inward sigh it was always better to have free rein on a case but she could understand that ms amberton needed to be on top of things вђњnow can you tell me how you learned about the blackmail did the victims come and tell you about it voluntarilyвђќ nancy couldnвђt imagine wanting to tell her troubles to anyone with such cold eyes ms amberton lifted her chin вђњof course notвђќ she said вђњi found a blackmail letter in moniqueвђs desk drawer when i confronted her with it she told me that it was the third one sheвђd receivedвђќ вђњwhat about the other twoвђќ вђњa few days later i found becky in tears in the washroom when i pressed her she confessed that she was also being threatened i noticed jacques acting strangely that same day and he finally told me what was going on like monique they both received letters demanding money or their crimes would be revealedвђќ вђњhow much were the paymentsвђќ вђњsmall amountsвђfifty or a hundred dollars at a time of course none of the victims have much money to spareвђќ nancy looked at her ms ambertonвђs stare was chilly вђњand their crimesвђќ the woman shrugged вђњpetty of course little things out of their pasts that they donвђt want anyone to know about a few years ago monique forged a check she paid the money back and the case was dismissed since it was her first offense the file clerk stole some jewelry and was sent to jail for six months and jacques the chauffeurвђwell his crime was a good deal more serious in fact i havenвђt even told mr cherbourg about it for fear that he would dismiss jacquesвђќ nancy frowned вђњwhat is itвђќ вђњthe man was involved with drugs iвђm afraidвђќ ms amberton tapped her fingers briskly on the desk вђњmr cherbourg is adamant about not employing drug usersвђќ nancy closed her notebook and stood up вђњiвђd like to see both the file clerk and the chauffeur please and could you give me monique levereвђs home addressвђќ at that moment the door opened and a young woman stumbled in looking dazed it was the same woman who had been sitting at moniqueвђs desk вђњoh ms ambertonвђќ she gasped вђњthe most awful thing has happenedвђќ she began to cry вђњstop that sniffling cynthiaвђќ ms amberton snapped вђњand speak up what is itвђќ the young woman gulped back a sob вђњitвђs monique she tried to commit suicide this morning and her roommate who answered the phone in her apartment said she will probably dieвђќ chapter two monique had been taken to the hospital in an ambulance nancy learned after cynthia quieted a little ms amberton arranged for mr cherbourgвђs chauffeur to drive nancy to the hospital and he was waiting downstairs when she hurried out вђњbonjour mademoiselleвђќ he said opening the door of the long black limousine вђњbonjourвђќ nancy said climbing into the backseat she remembered that in montreal most people spoke french вђњcould i ask you a few questionsвђќ she began as they rushed toward the hospital in french nancy asked the chauffeur about the blackmail demands he had received but he couldnвђt tell her much more than she already knew вђњouiвђќ he said вђњthere were letters two of them they wanted money more money than i haveвђќ вђњbut you paidвђќ nancy asked he nodded looking straight ahead вђњwhen ms amberton found out that i was in trouble she lent me the money i cannot pay her back but at least i am no longer afraid of losing my job because i cannot meet the demands of the blackmailerвђќ nancy frowned sheвђd almost rather risk the wrath of a blackmailer than borrow money from someone like ashley amberton вђњdid you save the blackmail lettersвђќ he pulled some papers out of his uniform pocket and handed them to her вђњhere they areвђќ he said with what sounded like relief вђњi hope you catch this crook it is a horrible thing to be blackmailed i live in fear every day of losing my jobвђќ вђњi understandвђќ nancy told him вђњi canвђt promise you anything but iвђll do my best to get this straightened out as soon as possibleвђќ she got out of the limousine in front of the hospital hurrying up the steps she glanced quickly at the two letters the chauffeur had handed her the message typed in french was identical in each one вђњput in a red plastic bag and drop it into the trash can at nelsonвђs column on monday at noon if you donвђt your employer will learn about the drugsвђќ monique levere was alive nancy discovered but pale and groggy after her narrow escape from an overdose of sleeping pills there was a frightened look in her eyes as she lay in the hospital bed nancy introduced herself and asked monique what had happened in a small voice the young woman told nancy that sheвђd been sick for a few days she had taken a sleeping pill in the middle of the night and the next thing she knew she was in the emergency room having her stomach pumped вђњi told the police a million times that i took only one pill to help me sleepвђќ monique said вђњthey donвђt believe me though they say i got sleepy and took the whole bottle by mistakeвђor that i tried to kill myselfвђќ вђњdid you keep the bottle beside your bedвђќ nancy asked calmly monique nodded obviously fighting hysteria вђњi think somebody put something into that pill i think somebody tried to kill meвђќ nancy sat down beside the bed вђњcan you think of a reason why someone might want to kill youвђќ she asked monique shook her head вђњnot unless it was the blackmailerвђќ she gulped вђњi canвђt pay any more maybe he got tired of waiting for me to pay and decided to kill meвђќ вђњhow much have you paid altogetherвђќ nancy asked вђњhundreds of dollarsвђќ monique moaned вђњmaybe as much as five hundredвђќ nancy shook her head five hundred dollars was not that much really and there was no reason to believe the blackmailer would gain anything from moniqueвђs death вђњwhat did the letters sayвђќ вђњthey all said the same thing tut the money into a red plastic bag and throw it in the trash can at nelsonвђs column if you donвђt your mother will find out that you are a forger and a thiefвђ it was so long agoвђќ she added вђњand in another city even i never dreamed anyone would find out about it i thought i was safeвђќ вђњwhy your motherвђќ nancy probed monique broke into tears вђњmy mother is old and sick news like that could kill herвђќ she looked up imploringly tears streaming down her face вђњyouвђve got to find the blackmailer ms drew my motherвђs life depends on it and so does mineвђќ вђњhave you still got the lettersвђќ вђњtheyвђre at homeвђќ she turned her head away sniffling loudly вђњyou can have them if you wantвђќ вђњwhat about the bottle of sleeping pillsвђќ nancy stood up to go вђњthe police took it but i know it was emptyвђќ she turned back toward nancy and smiled weakly вђњif you see ms amberton today please tell her that iвђll be back at work very soon and thank her for coming to my apartment yesterday and bringing me flowers theyвђre beautifulвђќ i guess iвђll have to revise my opinion of ashley amberton nancy thought as she left the room lending money to one of the blackmail victims bringing flowers to a sick employee maybe she wasnвђt really as unfeeling as she appeared nancy walked down the front stairs biting her lip with a puzzled frown it hardly seemed possible that a blackmailerвђany blackmailerвђwould run the risk of discovery over such small amounts of money and was it only hysteria or did monique have reason to believe that she had narrowly escaped being a murder victim the chauffeur was waiting outside the hospital to drive nancy back to the cherbourg building she was silent most of the way thinking through what she had learned so far moniqueвђs story seemed convincing nancy was sure she honestly thought she hadnвђt taken enough of the sedative to cause any harm had someone slipped something else into the bottle вђњi have one more questionвђќ she said leaning forward to talk to the chauffeur as they wove through the heavy lateafternoon traffic on universitг avenue вђњdo you have any idea how the blackmailer could have learned about your drug useвђќ jacques shook his head вђњnoвђќ he replied вђњbut i did spend two years in prison so i suppose it is a matter of public recordвђќ he hesitated glancing nervously at nancy вђњi even changed my name from xavier to olivier on my application for this jobвђjust to make sure my past was not found out i donвђt know how the blackmailer has managed to trace meвђќ вђњmerciвђќ nancy replied вђњoh and one more thing jacques please be carefulвђќ вђњbut whyвђќ вђњbecause at least one personвђќ nancy said slowly вђњbelieves that our blackmailer may also be trying his hand at murderвђќ in the lunchroom at the cherbourg building nancy met with the file clerk becky evans becky was a nervous little blonde with large frightened eyes she kept glancing over her shoulder to make sure nobody was listening вђњiвђve heard about moniqueвђќ becky whispered вђњisвђis she going to be all rightвђќ nancy nodded вђњsheвђs still a little groggy but sheвђll be fine in a day or two i must tell you though that monique suspects that the medication she took was poisonedвђќ nancy said stirring her coffee becky was staring at her her eyes dark with fear вђњpoisonвђќ she whispered nancy nodded вђњthereвђs no way to be sure at least not yet but you should be carefulвђќ she took out her notebook вђњnow what can you tell me about the blackmail letters youвђve receivedвђќ вђњiвђve gotten three of them over the last six monthsвђќ becky said swallowing hard reaching into her shoulder bag she pulled out an unopened envelope вђњand hereвђs the fourthвђќ she thrust it into nancyвђs hands вђњthis was in my mailbox when i went home for lunch todayвђќ nancy examined it closely it was a plain white envelope postmarked in montreal вђњhow do you know itвђs from the blackmailerвђќ becky pointed at the typed address вђњbecause it looks just like the others itвђs addressed to rebecca veronica evans and i never use my full name besides it doesnвђt have a return address you open it i just canвђt lookвђќ nancy opened the envelope and carefully unfolded the single sheet of paper it was a blackmail letter all right but it wasnвђt for becky it was for somebody named annette lebeau вђњjust a reminder that itвђs almost time for the third installmentвђќ the letter said вђњso you can start getting the together if you donвђt pay all your fans will know that you kept dutch medina out of jail where he belongsвђќ nancy quickly folded the letter she hoped her face didnвђt betray her surprise as she turned back toward becky вђњi suppose youвђve kept the lettersвђќ she remarked in a deliberately casual voice the girl nodded вђњiвђll bring them in tomorrow and leave them with ms ambertonвђќ вђњone more questionвђќ nancy said вђњdo you have any idea how the blackmailer found out about the theft and the sentence you servedвђќ вђњi donвђt have a clueвђќ she replied bitterly вђњbut iвђll tell you one thing this last letterвђand moniqueвђs poisoningвђare the last straw when this is over iвђm going to quit my job and get out of montreal for goodвђќ after becky had left nancy sat for a few moments thinking she had her first real lead now the blackmailer had made a careless mistake in mixing up the letters it proved that ashley amberton had been right when she said there might be other victims but who was annette lebeau and how could she afford to hand over sixty thousand dollars nancy read the letter again the blackmailer mentioned her fans was she a movie star on the way back to ms ambertonвђs office nancy looked at her watch it was only four oвђclock plenty of time she stopped at a pay phone and called the apartment ned answered вђњi hope youвђve had enough sightseeingвђќ nancy told him вђњbecause thereвђs work to be done i need you to run over to the journal morgue and find out everything you can about annette lebeau and dutch medinaвђќ вђњno problemвђќ ned agreed вђњare you on to something alreadyвђќ вђњi think so it looks like our blackmailer has expanded his territoryвђќ nancy explained вђњhe might even be getting into murder iвђll tell you about it tonightвђќ вђњspeaking of tonightвђќ ned said teasing her by speaking in an exaggerated french accent вђњiвђve found a great little place for dinnerвђa romantic dinner just for twoвђќ nancy giggled вђњsounds terrific nickersonвђќ she said вђњbut donвђt forget about georgeвђќ вђњrightвђќ ned said with a resigned sigh вђњdinner for threeвђќ in ms ambertonвђs office nancy reported what she had learned from the blackmail victims вђњdo you think monique really tried to kill herselfвђќ ashley amberton asked nancy shook her head вђњyouвђd know that better than i would but iвђd say that her fear is genuine she really thinks somebody tried to kill her of course it is possible that she just got sleepy and forgot how many pills sheвђd takenвђќ ms amberton sat down in her leather chair вђњi donвђt like itвђќ she said tapping her red nails on the desk вђњthis is getting seriousвђќ вђњthereвђs moreвђќ nancy went on she opened her purse and took out the letter she had gotten from becky вђњdo you know somebody named annette lebeauвђќ taking the letter ms amberton scanned it quickly her face became clouded with concern then she picked up a remote control and snapped on the tv вђњthis isnвђt smalltime blackmail anymoreвђќ she said flicking across the channels вђњthis is the big timeвђќ just then the face of an attractive vivacious blonde filled the screen the camera zoomed back to show that the woman was holding a microphone in her hand with her was a man whom nancy recognized as the prime minister of canada вђњthatвђќ ashley amberton said putting down the remote control вђњis annette lebeauвђќ chapter three вђњi thought this was going to be a quick simple caseвђќ george said at dinner that night nancy had just told her and ned about her afternoonвђs work george stabbed a bite of cafe renoirвђs famous spinach salad вђњand here we are up to our eyebrows in crime already four blackmailings one attempted murderвђвђќ вђњhey not so fastвђќ nancy warned finishing the last of her shrimp george loved to solve mysteries almost as much as she didвђthe more the merrier but it never hurt to be careful вђњletвђs not leap to any conclusions we donвђt know for sure that somebody actually tried to kill monique she claims itвђs true but it may not beвђќ вђњyeahвђќ ned agreed in his usual cautious way вђњmaybe she actually was sleepy and just lost count of her pillsвђќ nancy turned to ned вђњwhatвђd you dig up at the journal this afternoonвђќ вђњ вђdig upвђ is rightвђќ ned said pulling out a notebook вђњit looks like thereвђs plenty of dirt in this caseвђќ he tore out a couple of pages and handed them to nancy вђњannette lebeau as you already know is a prominent tv personality up here sort of a cross between a gossip columnist and an investigative reporter she makes a lot of money finding out whoвђs up to something dirty and then tattling on themвђќ george grinned вђњsounds to me like an ideal blackmail victim poetic justice you might sayвђќ вђњwhat about dutch medinaвђќ nancy asked вђњthe plot thickens medina it turns out is a bigtime mobster a real creep the police have been after him for years but heвђs slick and theyвђve never been able to pin anything on himвђќ вђњaccording to the blackmail noteвђќ nancy said thoughtfully вђњannette lebeau kept dutch medina out of jailвђќ вђњsoвђќ ned said вђњthings are getting a little more complicated looks like weвђve jumped from bargainbasement blackmail up to the real thingвђќ he took a bite of his broiled fish вђњi wonder what annette lebeau is likeвђќ вђњwell weвђll know tomorrowвђќ nancy told them вђњiвђve got an appointment with her at elevenвђcourtesy of our notsofriendly client ashley ambertonвђќ вђњwhy вђnotsofriendlyвђ whatвђs she likeвђќ george asked eagerly вђњbrisk and businesslikeвђќ nancy replied вђњif it werenвђt for the flowers she took to monique and the money sheвђs lent jacques iвђd say she was as warm as an arctic glacier now who knowsвђќ she grinned and pulled out the typewritten blackmail notes she had collected вђњhow about an assignment for the two of youвђќ вђњsureвђќ george agreed with a shrug вђњit doesnвђt look like iвђm going to get to run in olympic stadium anyway the trackвђs there but it turns out that itвђs covered with astroturf most of the time they only uncover it for track meets so what do you have in mind nancyвђќ вђњtyping detailвђќ nancy said spreading the notes on the table in front of them вђњoh i get itвђќ ned picked up one of the notes and studied it вђњyou want us to check out the typewriters and letterquality printers at cherbourg industries to see if the blackmail notes were typed thereвђќ вђњyou got itвђќ nancy replied вђњiвђd say that these notes were all typed on a typewriter rather than done on a word processor anyway itвђs possible that the blackmailer is connected with cherbourg since three of the victims are company employees we need samples from all the machines in the buildingвђand thatвђs going to take quite a while youвђd better polish up your typing skillsвђќ вђњ вђnow is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their partyвђ вђќ ned murmured flexing his fingers george gave ned a disdainful glance and laughed вђњspeaking of partiesвђќ she said leaning toward nancy and ned вђњhow about trying out that club down the street chez soda itвђs calledвђќ вђњsounds like a winner to meвђќ ned said enthusiastically he carefully refolded the notes and put them in his pocket вђњespecially if thereвђs dancingвђќ he added вђњmaybe iвђll even get to put my arms around my favorite girl for a whileвђќ ned flashed nancy a grin вђњsureвђќ she said a little absently she was already preoccupied with thoughts of her interview with annette lebeau the next morning how would annette feel being the target of somebody elseвђs questions for a change but after an hour at chez soda nedвђs arms tight around her and his lips against her cheek nancy had nearly forgotten annetteвђand the case too and george had discovered that she could get along fine in montreal without speaking french вђњall i have to know how to say is ouiвђќ she said when she got back to the table after a slow dance with a cute french guy nancy shook her head laughing вђњdidnвђt anybody ever tell you that saying oui too much could get you into troubleвђќ george flushed вђњyes momвђќ she said teasingly chuckling ned reached out to squeeze nancyвђs hand вђњhow about another danceвђќ and nancy was delighted to say вђњouiвђќ at the television studio the next day nancy met annette lebeau the newswoman was in her dressing room getting ready to film an interview with a suburban chief of police on the problem of crime in his area she was just putting the final touches on her makeup вђњso youвђre nancy drewвђќ she said turning away from the mirror to look at nancy curiously вђњiвђve heard about you youвђre supposed to be some sort of hotshot supersleuth arenвђt youвђќ nancy smiled вђњiвђve had a few successesвђќ she said modestly annette turned back to the mirror and began to brush on mascara with expert strokes вђњso what do you want with meвђќ she asked вђњashley amberton said it was urgentвђќ вђњit isвђќ nancy said she sat down at the makeup table so she could see annetteвђs face in the mirror вђњitвђs about blackmailвђќ annetteвђs hand jerked and she smudged the black mascara on her cheek but she recovered immediately вђњblackmailвђќ she asked in an innocent voice as she wiped away the smear вђњi donвђt know what youвђre talking aboutвђќ вђњoh i think you doвђќ nancy replied casually вђњiвђm talking about you and dutch medinaвђќ annette swiveled her chair around her eyes narrowed вђњlistenвђќ she hissed вђњif you think you can come in here and threaten meвђвђќ вђњiвђm not threatening youвђќ nancy assured her вђњi want to help if i canвђќ she took out the letter becky evans had given her вђњi think this was meant for youвђќ annette paled under her makeup as she read the letter вђњhow did you get thisвђќ вђњthe blackmailer sent it to one of his other victims by mistakeвђќ nancy said she leaned forward вђњhow did you help dutch medinaвђќ annetteвђs face became a mask with her mouth pressed into a tight line вђњi donвђt have to tell you anythingвђќ she said in a hard voice nancy stood up вђњnoвђќ she replied pleasantly вђњyou donвђt have to say a word to meвђќ she picked up her blazer which she had put on the back of her chair вђњyou can go on making blackmail payments until the money runs out or you can go to the police and tell themвђвђќ вђњbut i canвђtвђќ annette burst out her composure was beginning to unravel вђњi canвђt go to the police if i did everyone would find out that i was involved with medinaвђthat i faked his alibiвђќ вђњso thatвђs what the blackmailer meant when he said that you kept medina out of jailвђќ the woman slumped in her chair вђњit was a long time ago more than ten years the prosecutor couldnвђt convict him because i swore that dutch and i were together when a shooting occurred i was such a fool i was so sure he was innocentвђќ вђњand now you canвђt afford to have people know about thisвђќ nancy went on annette bit her lip вђњit would mean the end of my careerвђќ she turned to nancy her eyes pleading вђњlisten nancy drew youвђve got to catch this blackmailer heвђs making my life absolutely miserableвђand not just my life eitherвђќ nancy looked at her вђњyou know about other victimsвђќ of course annette had probably gotten becky evansвђs blackmail letter but she hadnвђt instead annette explained вђњher name is lake sinclair she was involved in a hitandrun accident a year or so ago sheвђs been paying the bills for the victimвђs plastic surgery not to mention whatever it cost to fix her own fancy yellow mercedes and now sheвђs paying a blackmailer tooвђќ вђњhowвђd you find out about thisвђќ nancy asked вђњa few days ago lake tried to sell me a piece of her family jewelry i asked her what was going on and she broke down and told me why she had to have the moneyвђќ annette shivered nervously вђњi assumed that we were dealing with the same blackmailer but maybe weвђre not it could be someone elseвђќ вђњthereвђs no way of knowing until i check it outвђќ nancy said she stood up вђњthanks for being straight with me ms lebeau i hope we can get to the bottom of this quicklyвђќ вђњcuriouser and curiouserвђќ george said the girls were in their bedroom at the apartment george pulled her red lambвђs wool sweater over her head and threw it on the bed then she stepped out of her black jeans вђњanother blackmail victimвђќ she counted on her fingers вђњthat makes five doesnвђt itвђќ nancy nodded вђњour blackmailerвђs been busy no wonder heвђs making mistakesвђlike sending his demands to the wrong personвђќ she scratched her head вђњand i wonder what became of becky evansвђs letter i thought maybe it would turn up in annette lebeauвђs mail but so far it hasnвђtвђќ вђњi think this guy needs a computerвђќ george said вђњmight help him keep his victims straightвђќ she pulled on her bathrobe вђњno kiddingвђќ nancy took off her khakicolored corduroy blazer and hung it up in the closet вђњso how did you and ned do todayвђќ she asked slipping off her loafers she wriggled her toes вђњany luck with the typewritersвђќ george went over to the dresser and took the blackmail notes out of her purse handing them to nancy вђњi donвђt think so it doesnвђt look like these were typed at cherbourg industriesвђќ вђњof courseвђќ nancy said thoughtfully вђњthe blackmailer could still work there and have typed these at homeвђќ she pulled out the notes and began to examine them with the small magnifying glass she always carried in her purse shaking her head she looked up вђњi donвђt see anything special oh by the way whereвђd ned goвђќ before george could answer a knock interrupted them george hurried into the living room to answer the door вђњwho is itвђќ nancy asked вђњjust the bellman from downstairsвђќ george called back вђњhe brought the newspaper upвђќ she came back into the bedroom unfolding it her face went suddenly white вђњnancyвђќ she gasped вђњlookвђќ nancy looked at the paper in georgeвђs hands across the front page in big black letters the headline screamed вђњnancy drew dies in montrealвђќ chapter four nancy dropped her magnifying glass and snatched the paper away from george she looked at it closely вђњlook georgeвђќ she said pointing вђњthe letters are all pasted up and my picture has been cut out of another newspaperвђќ вђњreally slickвђќ george said sarcastically staring at the paper вђњwhoever did this is so creativeвђќ вђњyeahвђќ nancy said biting her lip вђњand evil tooвђќ she picked up the phone from the bedside table вђњwho are you callingвђќ george asked вђњthe bellmanвђќ nancy replied вђњi want to find out how he got this paperвђќ the bellman couldnвђt tell nancy anything specific he said heвђd found the paper downstairs on the desk just inside the door of the apartment building somebody must have put it there when he was away the room number was scrawled on it so heвђd brought it upstairs immediately вђњno leads thereвђќ nancy said with a sigh hanging up вђњthe street door is only locked at night anybody could have walked in and left itвђќ just then ned came home he popped his head into the bedroom вђњwhatвђs going onвђќ without a word nancy handed him the paper вђњuhohвђќ he said taking it from her вђњ вђuhohвђ is rightвђќ nancy agreed soberly вђњlooks like weвђve spooked our blackmailerвђќ ned sat down on the bed staring at the paper вђњwhereвђd this picture come from nan i donвђt recognize itвђќ nancy frowned вђњiвђve been trying to remember it could give us a clue about whoвђs behind all thisвђќ ned looked at nancy вђњwell no matter who the blackmailer is this case is getting serious weвђre not dealing with somebody whoвђs just shooting off interoffice memos for spare change this is a death threatвђќ george frowned вђњi wonder how many peopleвђbesides ms amberton that isвђknow that weвђre staying in this apartmentвђќ вђњthatвђs a good questionвђќ nancy said grimly вђњiвђll ask ashley amberton tomorrowвђќ вђњcorrectionвђќ ned said вђњweвђll ask ashley amberton i donвђt think you ought to work alone on this one nanвђќ he reached for her hand вђњtwo will be safer than oneвђќ george gave them a quick glance and picked up her cosmetic case вђњwell if you two donвђt mindвђќ she informed them lightly вђњiвђve got a date tonightвђfor a french lessonвђќ she tossed her head and smiled devilishly вђњiвђm going to learn to say more than just ouiвђќ she disappeared into the bathroom humming to herself nancy sighed it didnвђt take a detective to see that george had found a new friendвђa very cute very male friend who was this guy ned squeezed her hand вђњiвђm ready for a romantic evening with my favorite girl want to try that chinese restaurant we saw maybe go dancing again laterвђќ nancy threw a questioning look in the direction of the bathroom she hadnвђt seen george acting so crazy in months вђњnickerson calling drewвђќ ned said into a pretend microphone вђњhow about a date tonightвђќ вђњaffirmativeвђќ nancy said turning back to ned george would tell her everything laterвђif there was anything to tell that is вђњi suppose anyone couldвђve known where youвђre stayingвђќ ashley amberton said the following morning вђњeveryone here at cherbourg has access to the company apartment all they have to do is reserve itвђќ вђњwho handles thatвђќ ned asked вђњa secretary down the hallвђќ вђњweвђd like to speak to her pleaseвђќ nancy said the secretary showed nancy and ned the schedule of bookings for the apartment usually they learned the book hung on the wall beside the door after nancy questioned the secretary it was clear that ms amberton was rightвђanyone could have looked at the schedule back in ms ambertonвђs office nancy shook her head вђњno leads in that directionвђќ she said вђњiвђm becoming quite concernedвђќ ashley amberton went to the balcony door to look out across the river вђњthis thing seems to be getting bigger every day first that business with monique now the threat against your lifeвђќ she threw nancy a troubled glance вђњwhere is it going to endвђќ вђњdo you know somebody named lake sinclairвђќ nancy asked ms amberton turned around sharply surprise written across her face вђњlake sinclair why of course i know her her father is one of mr cherbourgвђs closest friendsвђќ she studied nancy her brows drawn together in confusion вђњwhy do you askвђќ вђњbecauseвђќ nancy said вђњit looks like she might be another one of our blackmailerвђs victimsвђќ вђњlakeвђќ ms amberton exclaimed вђњhow did you find that outвђќ nancy told her what she had learned from annette lebeau вђњa hitandrunвђќ ms amberton dropped heavily into her desk chair вђњyou canвђt be serious lakeвђs always been a little on the wild side but sheвђd never do anything like thatвђќ вђњmaybe notвђќ nancy replied вђњbut we canвђt be sure about that can we and i have to follow every single lead no matter where it takes meвђќ the woman nodded watching nancy with a look of grudging respect вђњi seeвђќ she said softly вђњthat you are a very professional detective nancy drewвђќ she reached for the phone вђњiвђll set up a meeting with lakeвђќ lake sinclairвђs condominium nancy learned from ms amberton was located in a restored section of old montreal near the wharves вђњyou know what we could doвђќ ned asked later that morning as they left the cherbourg building вђњwe could get a calecheвђyou know a horsedrawn carriageвђand ride in style but only if youвђll promise not to say one word about business while weвђre on the wayвђќ вђњoh ned it sounds so romanticвђќ nancy cried вђњbut what about georgeвђќ she pushed up the sleeves of her royal blue cotton sweater вђњshouldnвђt we call the apartment to see if sheвђs back from her jogging maybe sheвђd like to go tooвђќ вђњsure but i think she has a dateвђќ he said ned reached in his pocket and pulled out a handful of canadian coins вђњneed changeвђќ вђњyesвђќ nancy said and grinned вђњthank youвђќ nancy let the phone ring a dozen times but george didnвђt answer вђњi guess she did go outвђќ she said regretfully hanging up the phone вђњso what do you say about that carriage rideвђќ ned asked вђњwhat are we waiting forвђќ nancy answered with a happy smile they walked over to the plaza where ned hailed a shiny black caleche which was pulled by a large gray horse nancy climbed in and just as ned was about to get in beside her he held up his hand asking the driver to wait for a minute he disappeared in the direction of a flower stand when he came back he was carrying a tiny bouquet of violets and lilies of the valley he handed them to nancy with a grand flourish вђњoh nedвђќ she said touched вђњhow sweetвђќ she held the violets against her blue sweater they looked even more fragile and exotic against the bold color of her top вђњit wouldnвђt be a spring day in montreal without flowersвђќ ned said climbing in beside her nancy leaned back in the seat breathing in the rich fragrance of the flowers the bright spring sunshine warmed her as the horse pulled the caleche away from the curb вђњthis was a great ideaвђќ she said ned was rightвђfor the next few minutes nancy would forget all about the case and just enjoy the montreal sunshine and ned there beside her ned pulled his guidebook out of his pocket and looked through it вђњhere on the left ladies and gentlemenвђќ he intoned glancing up вђњis the famous nelson column dedicated to the british commander whoвђвђќ nancy sat straight up вђњthe nelson whatвђќ вђњthe nelson column right over thereвђќ nancy looked where ned was pointing at one end of the open square stood a tall stone column with a statue on the top вђњthatвђs the placeвђќ nancy exclaimed вђњhey youвђre rightвђќ ned said вђњthe place our blackmail victims leave their payoffsвђќ nancy stared at the column there was a trash can a few yards from it probably the very one where the victims made their drops she thought for a moment вђњyou know nedвђќ she said вђњmaybe the quickest way to wrap up this case would be to wait until thereвђs another letter then stake out the drop and wait for the blackmailer toвђвђќ ned began to laugh вђњdo you realize what weвђre doingвђќ he asked guiltily nancy nodded вђњyesвђќ she said with a sigh вђњweвђre talking business againвђќ ned squeezed her hand вђњi understandвђќ he said softly вђњitвђs just so much a part of you that you canвђt really put it out of your mind can youвђќ nancy shook her head вђњyes i canвђќ she said stubbornly вђњstarting right nowвђќ after a while the caleche turned down a side street the horseвђs hooves clipclopping steadily on the pavement the brick and fieldstone houses and small shops were built close to the street they had steeply pitched copper roofs with dormer windows and brightly colored shutters some of the buildings also had wroughtiron balconies and every now and then nancy glimpsed a shaded courtyard hidden between buildings there were oldfashioned street lamps on every corner and pots of flowers beside the doorways nancy sighed вђњit looks just the way it must have looked a hundred years agoвђќ вђњyeahвђќ ned replied as a car zipped around them вђњif you ignore the carsвђќ he slipped his arm around nancy and she dropped her head against his shoulder вђњheyвђќ he said nudging her вђњthereвђs notre dame isnвђt it beautifulвђќ she turned and saw the pretty stone church with its central spire and two side pinnacles in front of them and then she imagined her wedding day in a church just like that what would her dress look like and what would nedвђ вђњhey drewвђќ ned said вђњyou got something on your mindвђќ nancy blushed вђњnot at all nickersonвђќ she said smiling вђњnot at allвђќ nedвђs arm tightened around her and he bent toward her his lips close to hers вђњnancyвђќ he said softly вђњiвђвђќ just at that moment a car careened recklessly around them grazing the wheel of the caleche the frightened horse neighed rearing up on his hind legs as the driver fought to control him the horse raced off at breakneck speed the carriage bouncing down a narrow cobblestone alley and around a corner where its wheels ran up over the high curb the carriage began to tilt dangerously вђњhang on nancyвђќ ned cried holding her tight вђњweвђre going overвђќ chapter five the bouncing caleche teetered on two wheels as the driver yanked desperately on the reins pulling with all his strength and shouting вђњwhoa whoaвђќ nancy found herself thrown into one corner with nedвђs arms tight around her she held her breath as the carriage rocketed over the curb and into the crowded street but it stayed upright after a moment the driver managed to bring the terrified horse under control amazingly no pedestrians had been injured вђњare you okayвђќ ned asked breathlessly when they finally came to a stop вђњiвђi guess soвђќ nancy answered her voice shaky as she tried to sit up straight she rubbed her throbbing temple where she had bumped it ned climbed out of the carriage and turned back to help nancy down she got out and began to dust herself off вђњmonsieur mademoiselle a thousand pardons please donвђt goвђќ the driver cried climbing down from his perch вђњmy horse was frightened by the car thatвђs allвђќ nancy nodded вђњi knowвђќ she said rubbing her head вђњbut i think iвђve had enough of caleches for one dayвђќ she reached into the carriage to pick up her flowers and looked at ned вђњhow about if we walk the rest of the wayвђќ вђњgood ideaвђќ ned said he tried to pay the driver but his money was refused lake sinclair lived in one of the restored brickandstone buildings on saintdenis street on the outside the building looked as if it were untouched by modern technology it appeared hundreds of years old with its quaint iron railings and graygreen slate roof even the parking area had been cleverly disguised to look like an old brick courtyard but inside lake sinclairвђs house was ultramodern filled with sophisticated contemporary furniture and a few pieces of exceptional art lake herself was a beautiful young woman only a few years older than nancy she was dressed in a chic white jogging suit her bright auburn hair had curled in damp tendrils around her face which was flushed with color вђњyouвђll have to forgive meвђќ she said tossing her long hair carelessly вђњiвђve just gotten back from a run in the stadium and i havenвђt had time to changeвђќ she led them down a softly lit hallway off to one side nancy could see what looked like an athletic training room it was full of exercise machines and weights george would love this nancy thought вђњin the stadiumвђќ nancy asked eagerly вђњmy friend george is dying for a chance to run in olympic stadium but weвђve been told itвђs closed to the publicвђќ вђњiвђm sure my dad would be glad to arrange somethingвђќ lake replied showing them into the living room she sank down onto the plush sofa and a white angora cat jumped up on her lap purring loudly вђњheвђs on the board of directors at the stadiumвђќ вђњthat would be greatвђќ nancy said as she and ned took the chairs opposite the sofa вђњgeorge will be delightedвђќ lake looked at nancy вђњashley said that youвђre a private detective and she asked me toвђto cooperate with you whatever that meansвђќ she hesitated her eyes flickering from nancy to ned вђњwhat can i do for youвђќ nancy leaned forward sometimes it was better to start out with small talk in this case though she had the feeling that she would get more out of lake if she took the direct approach вђњyou can tell us about the blackmail demands youвђve been gettingвђќ nancy said lakeвђs face paled suddenly вђњblackmailвђќ her voice cracked вђњi donвђt know anything about blackmailвђќ вђњwe think you doвђќ ned replied sternly вђњwe think you know a great deal about itвђќ lake took a deep breath вђњand what makes you so sure of thatвђќ she asked in a challenging voice her eyes darted from one to the other вђњi talked with annette lebeau yesterdayвђќ nancy replied вђњshe told me that you offered to sell her some of your familyвђs jewelry she also told me whyвђќ lake gasped her fingers tightening in the fur of the angora cat giving her a direct look nancy explained вђњi was asked to come to montreal to break up a blackmailing scheme that appears to be centered at cherbourg industries we know of four victims already the same person could be blackmailing you weвђll have an even better chance of finding out who it is if youвђll help usвђќ lake looked at nancy for a minute her mouth tight then her lips began to tremble and tears gathered in her eyes and her cat ran and hid under the sofa вђњitвђs not just the blackmail thatвђs been tearing me apartвђќ she whispered her voice breaking вђњitвђs knowing what i did to that poor little girl every night i dream about itвђabout the awful crash and the bloodвђќ she buried her face in her hands and began to sob вђњthe girl you hit with your carвђyour yellow mercedesвђќ nancy asked softly lake nodded she looked up her eyes filled with tears вђњit was dark and rainy and i was driving very fast the child ran out in front of me and i hit herвђќ вђњyou didnвђt stop did youвђќ nancy said wordlessly lake shook her head after a moment she said in a shaky voice вђњthe next day i called the hospital pretending to be a friend i found out who she was then i promised her parents i would pay all of the hospital bills and find her the best plastic surgeon in the city if only they wouldnвђt tell the police who had done it it cost a fortune but i had to do itвђќ вђњbut whyвђќ ned asked вђњif she ran out in front of you it wasnвђt your faultвђќ вђњmaybe notвђќ lake bit her lip so savagely that it started bleeding вђњbut i couldnвђt take that chance if my father ever found out what happened he would have taken away my allowance my carвђќ she turned to look at the room around them вђњi would have lost this house and all my beautiful thingsвђќ вђњbut now youвђre about to lose everything to a blackmailerвђќ nancy said lake sighed and pointed to an empty spot on the wall вђњthe painting that was hanging there was my favorite i sold it last month for nearly fifty thousand dollars and every penny went to the blackmailer iвђve sold nearly all the jewelry i inherited from my grandmother there isnвђt much leftвђќ she shrugged sadly вђњhow does the blackmailer contact youвђќ nancy asked вђњlettersвђќ lake said вђњthen i put the moneyвђusually ten thousand at a timeвђin a red plastic sack and drop it in the trash can beside nelsonвђs columnвђќ she laughed shortly вђњi suppose the blackmailer hangs around and watches then picks it up after iвђve gone pretty expensive trashвђќ nancy flashed a look at ned it was the same modus operandi or mode of operation it must be the same blackmailer ned nodded вђњwho could have found out about the accidentвђќ he asked lake she shrugged вђњsomebody at the hospital i guess i went to visit the girl there once i didnвђt give my name though and i wore a scarf and an old coat so i couldnвђt be recognized вђњyou said something about plastic surgeryвђќ nancy observed taking out her notebook вђњare you paying the bills for the girlвђs surgery by checkвђќ frowning she said вђњof course but emile dandridge is the best plastic surgeon in the cityвђќ she tried to explain вђњi mean he does cosmetic surgery and lots of his patients donвђt want anybody to know about their tucks and lifts his work is always very confidential i canвђt imagine that anybody in his office could be a blackmailerвђќ вђњwell somebody isвђќ nancy said pointedly she wrote down emile dandridgeвђs name and the address and phone number that lake gave her then lake went upstairs and brought down the blackmail letters all carefully locked in a heavy metal box nancy scanned them quickly she couldnвђt be sure without a closer examination but they looked exactly like the others вђњiвђi hope you can find out whoвђs doing this and make him stopвђќ lake said the cat came out from under the sofa and rubbed against her she picked it up burying her face in its soft fur вђњi donвђt know how much longer i can go on this wayвђќ outside nancy and ned hailed a cab and went back to the apartment on the coffee table there was a scrawled note from george вђњgone for a ride with pierreвђќ it read вђњback at sixвђќ вђњpierreвђќ nancy said reading the note вђњi guess heвђs the guy she met at chez sodaвђќ вђњi supposeвђќ ned answered he pulled the drapes open and the lateafternoon sunlight flooded the living room ned ran his fingers through his brown hair вђњso whatвђs nextвђќ вђњhow about if i make us some lemonade i saw a mix in the cupboard in the kitchenвђќ вђњsounds goodвђќ ned agreed he followed her into the kitchen and leaned against the door jamb watching as she took down a pitcher and some cups the kitchen looked almost new obviously it hadnвђt been used very much вђњletвђs seeвђќ she said going over to the cabinet above the stove вђњi think the mix was up hereвђќ she reached up over her head and tugged on the door вђњthatвђs funnyвђќ she said вђњi donвђt remember this cabinet being so hard to openвђќ she yanked again and the door popped open as nancy struggled to keep her balance she saw the metal thermos that was perched on the very edge of the top begin to wobble it was going to fall instinctively nancy put up a hand to shield her face but she was too late a dense white mist poured out of the thermos whatever it was it was steamingвђand it was about to splash into her eyes chapter six wham nancy was hit ned had just knocked her out of the way of the steaming waterfall the two of them landed on the floor next to the sink and a moment later nancy sat up dazed for a second she just sat still with nedвђs arms wrapped protectively around her she sank back against him as she watched the cloud of white vapor spilling from the stove onto the floor вђњletвђs get out of here nedвђќ she cried struggling to her feet вђњsomebody rigged that cannister to fall when the door was opened it could be poisonousвђќ вђњwaitвђќ ned said calmly вђњif somebody had wanted to poison us he wouldnвђt have tried anything so complicated or so messyвђќ he shook his head frowning вђњno this isnвђt poisonвђќ вђњthen what is itвђќ nancy asked she stepped closer and looked at the puddle on the floor it was already beginning to evaporate into clouds of steam вђњitвђs steamingвђis it hotвђќ ned disappeared into the living room in a minute he came back with a floppy green leaf from a philodendron plant carefully he dipped the leaf into what was left of the puddle when he pulled it out seconds later it was covered with frost and when he tapped it gently on the counter it shattered into a dozen pieces of what looked like green ice вђњitвђs frozenвђќ nancy exclaimed she looked at ned вђњwow where did you learn that trickвђќ вђњfreshman chemistryвђќ ned replied staring at the shattered leaf вђњthis stuff is probably some sort of a liquefied gasвђќ вђњbut what kindвђќ nancy asked вђњi donвђt knowвђyetвђќ ned said thoughtfully вђњactually the possibilities are pretty limited when most substances get this cold they freeze solidвђќ вђњlike the leafвђќ nancy said вђњyeah like the leafвђќ ned leaned closer вђњletвђs see thereвђs no colorвђthat white steam is probably just the water vapor in the air freezing when it comes in contact with the gasвђќ nancy sniffed вђњi donвђt smell anything eitherвђќ вђњneither do iвђќ ned said reaching for the box of matches on the stove вђњi wonder if it burnsвђќ nancy grabbed his arm вђњare you crazy nickerson the air is filled with the stuff if itвђs flammable this place could go up like a box of fireworksвђќ вђњmy bet is that it isnвђtвђќ ned argued вђњbut youвђre right we need to be on the safe sideвђќ he got out a longhandled spoon and carefully scooped up a spoonful of the fuming liquid carrying the spoon into the other room he touched a match to it the flame died immediately вђњmy bet is that this stuff is liquid nitrogenвђit doesnвђt burnвђќ вђњokay enough with the chemistry lessonвђќ nancy said impatiently вђњwhat would have happened if this stuff had gotten in my eyes a few minutes agoвђќ ned looked at her seriously вђњyouвђd probably be blindвђќ he said вђњand youвђd need plastic surgery youвђd be badly scarredвђќ nancy shuddered thinking how narrowly she had escaped if it hadnвђt been for nedвђs quick action вђњwho would have access to liquid nitrogenвђќ she asked pushing the thought of danger away вђњitвђs not the kind of stuff youвђd find on the drugstore shelf is itвђќ ned shook his head вђњonly chemists physicists people who work with lowtemperature materialsвђtheyвђre the ones whoвђd be likely to have itвђќ he said вђњlike astronomers making artificial comets or doctors and medical technicians who freeze tissue for microscopic slides or manufacturersвђвђќ вђњdoctorsвђќ nancy interrupted him excitedly вђњplastic surgery emile dandridge is a plastic surgeonвђќ вђњhey yeahвђќ ned said вђњin fact up until a few years ago doctors used liquid nitrogen to burn off wartsвђќ вђњthen heвђor somebody in his officeвђcould have access to itвђќ nancy pointed out thoughtfully вђњand the same person could have known about lake sinclair making those payments for the girlвђќ she looked at ned вђњletвђs go see how the booby trap was set up maybe thatвђll give us a clueвђќ in the kitchen the puddles of liquid nitrogen were almost completely gone it had evaporated into the air above the stove the cabinet door was still open lying on the top shelf was a large metal thermosвђempty the thermos stopper hung suspended from a short string that was fastened to the inside of the cabinet door with a thumbtack nancy climbed up on a chair so she could see onto the top shelf вђњthereвђs a short loop of string around the bottom of the thermosвђќ she reported to ned вђњand the loop is tacked to the shelf when i opened the cabinet door the string on the lid pulled the stopper out while the loop around the bottom held the thermos in place thatвђs why it tipped over but didnвђt fallвђќ вђњpretty ingeniousвђќ ned agreed вђњhe used the thermos to make sure that the stuff stayed cold until the stopper was pulled outвђќ вђњyeahвђќ nancy replied climbing down and brushing off her hands вђњthe evidence goes up in smoke and all weвђre left with is an empty thermos and a couple of pieces of stringвђќ вђњand someone hoped a blind detectiveвђќ ned reminded her tenderly he put his arms around nancy вђњiвђm so glad nothing happenedвђќ he whispered he touched nancyвђs cheek вђњi like your face just the way it isвђќ вђњso do iвђќ nancy said leaning against nedвђs chest at just that moment george walked into the kitchen вђњwhoopsвђќ she said sounding flustered she backed out of the door вђњi didnвђt mean to interruptвђќ вђњyouвђre not interruptingвђќ nancy said as ned gave her one more quick hug she followed george into the living room and told her what had happened george stared at her friend dumbstruck вђњoh nanвђќ she whispered вђњthatвђs awful somebody tried to blind youвђright here in the apartmentвђќ вђњit wasnвђt just meвђќ nancy said with a shake of her head вђњi mean either one of you could have opened that cabinet door the person who set that trap couldnвђt have guessed who would stumble on it first no whoever set this up wasnвђt particular he was out to get any one of usвђќ вђњso what do we do nextвђќ ned asked crossing his arms nancy looked at george вђњtomorrowвђќ she declared вђњgeorge is going to visit a certain prominent plastic surgeonвђabout a nose jobвђќ georgeвђs hand flew to her nose вђњa nose job no way thereвђs nothing wrong with my noseвђќ nancy laughed вђњthatвђs just the ploy weвђre going to use to get us into emile dandridgeвђs officeвђќ she said reaching for the phone вђњiвђll explain everything later oh maybe i should ask ms amberton to set up the appointment she could get you in for sureвђќ as nancy dialed there was a knock on the door ned started toward it but stopped when he saw a piece of folded paper being slipped under the closed door ned picked it up and read it his eyes narrowing he handed it to nancy without a word nancy put down the phone and opened the note вђњ вђif youвђre not concerned for your own safety nancy drewвђ вђќ she read out loud вђњ вђperhaps you should worry about your two friends how would you feel if one of them suddenly disappearedвђ вђќ chapter seven clutching the note in her hand nancy leapt to the door and jerked it open she looked up and down the corridor the hallway was empty there was no one in sight вђњtoo lateвђќ nancy said coming back into the room вђњhe got awayвђќ she sat down on the sofa and held the note under the lamp beside her examining it closely it was typewritten on a piece of plain creamcolored notepaper with a thin blue line printed down the left marginвђnothing very significant there but as nancy turned it sideways against the light she noticed what seemed to be indentations in the paper вђњlookвђќ she said pulling out her magnifying glass вђњi think this paper was under another piece of paper when somebody wrote on it whatever was written on that top sheet left an impression hereвђќ вђњohвђќ ned asked leaning over her shoulder вђњwhat does it sayвђќ вђњi donвђt knowвђќ nancy said вђњi canвђt quite make it outвђќ she glanced up вђњwe need some tissue paperвђќ вђњi bought a blouse todayвђќ george said вђњthe salesclerk wrapped it in tissue paper what are you going to do with itвђќ вђњan old detective trickвђќ nancy said вђњletвђs try a little scrapвђќ george got the tissue paper while ned found a pencil then nancy put the note down on the coffee table carefully she laid the tissue paper on top of the impressions in the note and rubbed with the side of the pencil lead as if by magic the white shapes of letters emerged from a pencilsmudged background вђњhey thatвђs neatвђќ george exclaimed вђњbut what does it sayвђќ ned asked вђњthereвђre numbersвђќ nancy replied peering closer вђњlooks like five hundred and then the letters mg then there are some letters i canвђt make out and then mycinвђќ george frowned вђњsounds like a chemicalвђќ suddenly nancy looked up smiling вђњthatвђs it five hundred milligrams of somethingmycin itвђs a prescription for some sort of antibioticвђќ вђњthe doctorвђs office againвђќ ned cried snapping his fingers вђњexactlyвђќ nancy agreed вђњanother lead i think weвђre on the right track donвђt you the sooner we talk to that doctor the betterвђќ george touched her nose again вђњas long as he doesnвђt do anything to my noseвђќ she said defensively she shot nancy a pleading look вђњdonвђt worry george he wonвђt get anywhere near your nose honestвђќ nancy glanced again at the threatening note what would she do if anything happened to either one of her friends the thought was too frightening вђњlook this blackmailer is obviously determined to cause some damageвђand he doesnвђt care who gets hurtвђќ вђњweвђre not worried nancyвђќ ned said playfully вђњif anything happens youвђll protect usвђќ вђњthanks a lotвђќ nancy rolled her eyes but she knew ned and george understood вђњnow maybe we should get to workвђќ she reached for the phone and dialed ms ambertonвђs number вђњyou nearly missed meвђќ ashley amberton said when nancy reached her вђњi was going to leave a little earlyвђќ вђњiвђm sorry to call so lateвђќ nancy apologized вђњbut i need to ask you to set up an appointment for meвђќ вђњohвђќ вђњyes with a man named emile dandridgeвђdr emile dandridgeвђќ there was a short silence вђњdr dandridge the plastic surgeonвђќ ms amberton replied there was an odd note in her voice вђњwhy do you want to see himвђќ nancy told her about the conversation she and ned had had with lake sinclair she also mentioned that she was beginning to suspect someone in the doctorвђs office was blackmailing lake вђњand when we got back to the apartmentвђќ nancy went on вђњi opened a cabinet door and narrowly missed getting a splash of liquid nitrogen in my faceвђќ вђњyouвђre all right arenвђt youвђќ ms amberton asked quickly вђњyouвђre not hurtвђќ вђњoh noвђќ nancy reassured her вђњif it hadnвђt been for ned though i might have been blinded or badly burnedвђќ вђњwas there any damage to the stoveвђќ ms amberton asked hurriedly she cleared her throat and added вђњor to the rest of the kitchen shall i get the locks changedвђќ вђњno everythingвђs okayвђќ nancy said вђњalthough you might want to change the locks thereвђs more tooвђќ when she finished telling her about the note and the impression of the prescription she had discovered ms amberton gave a loud exclamation of surprise вђњi must admit nancy drewвђќ she said with grudging admiration вђњthat you are a very perceptive young woman i didnвђt expectвђi mean itвђs quite amazing that you were able to trace down the connection to dr dandridge with such slim clues iвђm quite impressedвђќ вђњhow about that appointment you could tell him that george wants to see him about getting her nose fixedвђќ вђњiвђll do it immediatelyвђќ ms amberton promised вђњand nancy congratulationsвђќ вђњfor whatвђќ nancy asked surprised вђњwhy on your narrow escape of courseвђќ ms amberton said nancy hung up a puzzled frown on her face вђњwhatвђs wrongвђќ george asked вђњisnвђt she going to make the appointmentвђќ nancy nodded still frowning вђњthen what is itвђќ ned demanded nancy shook her head вђњnothing i supposeвђќ there was something some tiny thing that seemed out of place but nancy couldnвђt think of what it was вђњwell then wouldnвђt you say itвђs time for dinnerвђќ he asked he turned to george вђњand i think itвђs georgeвђs turn to pick the place to eatвђќ dr dandridgeвђs office was in a low modern building that was secluded behind a high brick wall in the most fashionable part of town the receptionist was sitting beside a bank of tall palms and exotic flowers at one end of a teakpaneled room furnished with elegant chairs and sofas and luxurious persian rugs several people were already waiting to see the doctor when nancy and george arrived for georgeвђs tenthirty appointment george gave her name to the receptionist and she nodded immediately вђњyes of courseвђќ she said вђњms amberton called late yesterday afternoon if youвђll just have a seat iвђll let the doctor know youвђre hereвђќ she came back less than a minute later вђњdr dandridge will see you nowвђќ she said the other patients all glared at nancy and george as the receptionist led them down a carpeted hallway вђњoh by the wayвђќ she said вђњplease tell ms amberton that the staff enjoyed the candy she brought over last week it was very kind of her to think of usвђand so unexpected tooвђќ nancy shot george a questioning look as they entered the doctorвђs office it was even more luxurious than the waiting room the two girls sat down in plush upholstered chairs as soon as the nurse left nancy turned to george вђњi never would have imagined that ms amberton was the kind of person who would bring candy to a doctorвђs staffвђor flowers to a sick employeeвђќ вђњwell maybe sheвђs not the coldhearted career woman she seems to beвђќ george suggested she got up and wandered over to look at the framed diplomas that hung on one wall there were lots of them вђњhow does anybody ever have time enough to study for all those final examsвђќ she asked amazed вђњthis guy must really be smartвђќ nancy came to stand behind george вђњand fast tooвђќ she said looking at the certificates вђњaccording to these diplomas he completed his residency six months after he got his medical degree usually it takes yearsвђќ вђњgood afternoonвђќ a short dapperlooking man said coming through the door into the office he was wearing a conservative navy blue suit instead of the usual white doctorвђs coat nancy thought he looked more like one of her fatherвђs lawyer friends than a doctor вђњi understand you wanted to see me about the possibility of undergoing a rhinoplastyвђќ he said adjusting his goldrimmed glasses вђњwhich one of you is the patientвђќ вђњa rhinoвђrhinoplastyвђќ george repeated in dismay вђњoh itвђs nothing like that i just want a nose job thatвђs allвђќ she felt her nose вђњyou see itвђs always been a little too long and thereвђs a hump in the middle where i got hit by a softball when i was tenвђќ dr dandridge laughed вђњmy dear young womanвђќ he said вђњa rhinoplasty is a вђnose jobвђ as you put itвђќ he sat down behind his desk вђњohвђќ george walked back to the desk and sat down too flushing with embarrassment nancy joined her вђњactually dr dandridgeвђќ she said вђњiвђve been having trouble with my nose too latelyвђќ solicitously the doctor leaned forward вђњwhat kind of troubleвђќ вђњi keep smelling somethingвђќ nancy replied вђњsomething terribly wrongвђќ вђњwell we can examine you too young lady sometimes the sinus passages become blocked andвђвђќ вђњiвђm not sure an examination would do any good doctorвђќ nancy explained watching him closely вђњbecause what i keep smelling is blackmailвђќ вђњbbblackmailвђќ he stuttered staring at nancy вђњthatвђs rightвђќ nancy said вђњyou see iвђm a private detective iвђve been hired by cherbourg industries to investigate a blackmailing ring i have reasonвђvery good reasonвђto believe that somebody in your office is the blackmailerвђќ вђњin my officeвђќ dr dandridge gulped his face was white now вђњwhat makes you think thatвђќ вђњone of the blackmail victims is a young woman named lake sinclair sheвђs been paying the bills for the plastic surgery youвђve been doing on a young girl lake claims that no one knows about her involvement with your patient except the staff in your officeвђand you of courseвђќ вђњlake sinclair is being blackmailed but thatвђs not possibleвђќ he picked up a small gold keychain and began to turn it over nervously in his fingers in front of him in a filigreed silver holder was a stack of creamcolored notepaper with a thin blue line down the left margin вђњno no i simply donвђt believe itвђќ he said вђњwell consider this thenвђќ nancy told him standing вђњyesterday there was an accident in the apartment where weвђre staying i was nearly burned with liquid nitrogen that spilled out of a thermos bottle in a cabinet over my head it was a frighteningly clever booby trap and it was set up by somebody with access to liquid nitrogenвђќ вђњyes but any chemist could have providedвђвђќ dr dandridge began his voice was thin and panicky вђњwaitвђќ nancy cautioned вђњthereвђs more a few minutes after that i received a threatening note it was typed on creamcolored paperвђpaper identical to that pad right in front of youвђќ she picked up a piece of the paper folded it carefully and put it in her skirt pocket вђњi submit dr dandridge that there is very good reason to believe that you or one of your staff is deeply involved with blackmailвђќ вђњwell it isnвђt meвђќ the doctor exclaimed the keys still in his hand he stood up вђњi have what you detectives call an airtight alibi for the last two days iвђve been in new york i just got back this morningвђќ nancy frowned all the clues pointed to dandridge if it wasnвђt him then it had to be one of his staff the doctor bent over and picked up an expensivelooking leather briefcase he put it down flat on his desk вђњanywayвђќ he said wearily вђњthereвђs another reason i canвђt be your blackmailerвђќ he inserted one of the keys into the briefcase lock and began to open the lid nancy tensed and behind her george gasped out loud what did he have in the briefcase a gun slowly the briefcase was opened chapter eight вђњmoneyвђќ george exclaimed вђњthereвђs fifty thousand dollars hereвђќ dr dandridge said grimly вђњitвђs the third installmentвђand i donвђt know how many more thereвђll beвђќ nancy whistled softly вђњfifty thousand dollarsвђќ annette lebeau lake sinclair emile dandridgeвђeach of them paying tens of thousands of dollars there was no question about it nancy had stumbled onto a bigtime criminal operation that was netting somebody lots of money вђњsee all this fine furnitureвђќ dr dandridge said waving his arm вђњwell none of it belongs to me anymore iвђve had to mortgage it my office equipment too if it doesnвђt stop pretty soon iвђm going to be totally ruinedвђќ nancy turned around and glanced at the diplomas on the wall вђњthe blackmailer found out about your phony medical degrees didnвђt heвђќ emile dandridge stared at her вђњhow did you knowвђќ he whispered nancy shrugged and pointed to a diploma вђњit wasnвђt hard to figure outвђќ she said вђњnobody finishes a residency in six monthsвђќ dr dandridge seemed to shrivel nancy thought like a balloon after the air had been let out of it вђњso thatвђs how the blackmailer discovered itвђќ he said wearily вђњwhy didnвђt i ever noticeвђќ he went to the wall and took the diploma down shaking his head вђњi just never paid any attention to the datesвђќ вђњyou donвђt even have a medical degree do youвђќ nancy asked вђњthatвђs not true i did graduate from medical schoolвђin mexico my grades werenвђt good enough to get me into a canadian schoolвђќ nancy looked at him вђњand you figured that a mexican degree would turn off your wealthy clients so instead you had someone forge a diploma from a prestigious american medical schoolвђќ dr dandridge sank into the leather chair behind his desk вђњthe blackmailer must have seen the diplomas just the way you did and then checked it out iвђm sure thereвђs no other way it could have been discovered i was very carefulвђќ вђњthat means that the blackmailer has been in this officeвђќ nancy said вђњiвђll need to question your staff members but firstвђќвђshe looked at the briefcase filled with wrapped packets of billsвђвђњyouвђve been told to leave this money at nelsonвђs column rightвђќ dr dandridge stared at her вђњexactly i put the money into a red plastic bag and dump it in a trash can how did you knowвђќ вђњitвђs the blackmailerвђs methodвђќ nancy said she glanced at the money again вђњis the drop scheduled for todayвђќ the doctor nodded вђњat five oвђclockвђќ he said вђњgeorge this is itвђќ nancy told her friend excitedly вђњitвђs just what weвђve been waiting forвђa real breakвђќ вђњwhat do you want me to doвђќ dr dandridge asked вђњgo ahead with the drop exactly as youвђve been instructed but our blackmailerвђs going to have some company when he picks up the money weвђll be there to pick him upвђќ вђњif the blackmailer is one of dr dandridgeвђs staff it wonвђt be a вђhimвђ вђќ george reminded her вђњoh thatвђs rightвђќ nancy said вђњthe blackmailer could be a womanвђќ she turned to the doctor вђњiвђd like to talk to your staff now one at a time pleaseвђќ nancy and george didnвђt learn a thing from the doctorвђs staffвђa receptionist and two nurses it was hard to picture any of them as the blackmailer nancy decided the receptionist was barely out of her teens one of the nurses was a grandmother in her sixties and the other had worked in the office for only a few days they hardly seemed like killers either they were all genuinely surprised by nancyвђs questions and georgeвђs careful check of the office typewriters revealed nothing вђњwhat about the person your new nurse replacedвђќ nancy asked the doctor when she was finished вђњiвђve just expanded the staffвђќ he explained вђњiвђve had to take on more patients in order to meet the blackmailerвђs demands so i had to hire another nurseвђќ nancy frowned in frustration as she and george left the office вђњi just donвђt understand itвђќ she said вђњall of the cluesвђthe liquid nitrogen the notepaper the blackmailing of lake sinclairвђled to dandridgeвђs office iвђm afraid weвђve reached a dead endвђќ вђњnot quiteвђќ george said her voice full of anticipation вђњthereвђs still the drop this afternoonвђќ she was obviously looking forward to the action вђњrightвђќ nancy said вђњweвђd better tell ned and iвђve got to call ashley amberton to let her know about this new developmentвђќ ms amberton sounded very impressed with nancyвђs detective work вђњyou mean you actually spotted the discrepancies in his diplomas yourselfвђќ she asked in disbelief вђњthatвђs rightвђќ nancy said вђњhe admitted it of course but now we know that the blackmailer must have had access to dr dandridgeвђs office otherwise he couldnвђt have known about the fake diplomaвђќ вђњyou are an incredibly astute young woman nancyвђќ ms amberton said вђњiвђll report your progress to mr cherbourg when i see him this afternoonвђќ вђњwell maybe iвђll have an even better report this eveningвђќ nancy said вђњby then we might even know who our blackmailer isвђќ at five oвђclock the rushhour traffic was heavy and the plaza around nelsonвђs column was crowded with tourists and people on their way home from work it was beginning to drizzle and lights were coming on in the late afternoon вђњletвђs wait across the street behind those brick pillarsвђќ nancy told george and ned she pointed to a large building on the other side of the street вђњthat way we can watch whatвђs going on in the plaza without being seenвђќ вђњthereвђs dr dandridgeвђќ george said excitedly as soon as they crossed the street carrying a red plastic bag the collar of his tan raincoat pulled up the doctor was walking quickly across the plaza he ducked around a knot of people standing in front of the column вђњlookвђќ ned exclaimed вђњheвђs making the dropвђќ glancing quickly around the square the doctor dropped the bag into the open trash can and hurried away вђњokayвђќ nancy said вђњeverybody watch closely our blackmailerвђs bound to be here soon he wouldnвђt risk leaving that money in the trash can for very longвђќ while they were watching a large green bus pulled up just across the street blocking their view вђњcome onвђќ nancy exclaimed вђњweвђre going to have to get back across the street so we can seeвђќ together they started to cross the crowded street slick now from the rain they wove through the traffic single file at the end of the line george looked over her shoulder вђњnancy nedвђќ she screamed вђњlook outвђќ nancy who was at the bus turned and looked behind her ned gave a shout a bright yellow mercedes had just rounded the corner its headlights glaring in the gathering dusk it was headed straight for them chapter nine sucking in her breath nancy grabbed ned and pulled him flat against the bus with herself she felt a swoosh as the mercedes brushed past them frighteningly close a moment later it was gone its taillights flickering around the corner george who had moved in the opposite direction asked вђњare you guys all rightвђќ вђњiвђll liveвђќ ned croaked вђњnancy you okayвђќ вђњaside from being slightly squashedвђќ nancy said brushing a damp curl away from her face вђњiвђm fine but that was too closeвђќ вђњyeahвђќ george cried angrily вђњwhat did that idiot woman think she was doing anyway driving like that in rushhour traffic she could have killed usвђќ вђњthatвђќ ned growled as they stepped onto the curb вђњis exactly what she was trying to doвђќ nancy nodded вђњi can see youвђre thinking the same thing i amвђќ george brightened вђњthe yellow mercedes lake sinclair sheвђs no victimвђsheвђs our blackmailer she came to get the money and decided to get us as wellвђќ вђњcould beвђќ nancy agreed вђњfrom the glimpse i got of the driver it looked as if she had long auburn hairвђќ suddenly her head snapped up вђњthe moneyвђќ nancy exclaimed and darted toward the trash can but it was too late while nancy ned and george had been escaping from the yellow mercedes the money had vanished the red plastic bag was nowhere in sight вђњoh noвђќ nancy exclaimed dejected she dropped down on a bench beside the trash can disappointment rushing through her вђњthis was our big chance to catch the blackmailer and we blew itвђќ вђњi donвђt know about thatвђќ ned remarked shoving his hands into his pockets вђњit looks to me as if the whole thing was pretty carefully planned and it went off just like clockwork i have to admitвђќ he added with admiration вђњthat lake sinclair is a lot smarter than i thought she wasвђќ вђњyeahвђќ nancy said nodding вђњthat brush with the car was timed exactly to keep us busy while the money was picked up but weвђre forgetting one important thingвђќ george frowned вђњwhatвђs thatвђќ вђњif the blackmailer was driving the car that nearly ran us down who picked up the moneyвђќ вђњyou meanвђќ george said pushing a wet brown curl out of her face вђњthat lake sinclair isnвђt our blackmailerвђќ вђњi didnвђt say thatвђќ nancy said cautiously вђњmaybe weвђre up against a teamвђќ she stood up вђњcome on you guys weвђve got work to doвђќ вђњwhere toвђќ ned asked falling in step beside her as george hurried to catch up to them вђњto lake sinclairвђs placeвђќ nancy said determinedly she quickened her pace вђњshe may not be our blackmailer but that yellow mercedes is the hottest lead weвђve gotвђќ through the wroughtiron gate nancy could see the yellow mercedes parked in the shadowy brick courtyard beside lake sinclairвђs вђњhow do we get inвђќ george asked she craned her neck to see through the gate the courtyard was surrounded by a sixfoot brick wall вђњeasyвђќ nancy said taking her lockpick kit from her shoulder bag вђњthis is a pretty simple lockвђќ she looked in both directions the nowdark street was empty the reflections of the streetlights shimmering silver in the puddles from the earlier rain a moment later she pushed the gate open вђњcome onвђќ in seconds the three of them were inside the courtyard ned felt the hood of the car then got down on his hands and knees and reached up inside the front вђњthereвђs no way this car could have been driven in the last few hoursвђќ he reported shaking his head вђњthe radiatorвђs coldвђќ вђњi donвђt understand itвђќ george said with a frown she went around to the driverвђs side and peered in cupping her hands around her face вђњthis has to be the carвђќ she reached down for the door handle вђњdonвђt touch that handleвђќ nancy exclaimedвђbut not in time the alarm on the car had begun to emit short sharp blasts george gasped and leaped back вђњthe door handle was wired with an alarmвђќ nancy whispered urgently вђњcome on letвђs get out of here before somebody finds usвђќ but at that moment a door opened in the house and light spilled out a shadowy figure stood outlined against the light вђњdonвђt moveвђќ lake sinclair cried viciously вђњor iвђll blow your heads offвђќ a gun glinted in her hand вђњline up against the car and put your hands on the topвђќ cautiously nancy turned вђњitвђs me lakeвђќ she said вђњnancy drewвђќ вђњi donвђt care if youвђre the queen herselfвђќ lake said gesturing with the gun вђњline up this is the second time today that somebodyвђs tried to steal my carвђand this time iвђve got youвђќ вђњwhat do you mean youвђve got usвђќ george exclaimed indignantly putting both hands against the car вђњweвђve got you is more like it you nearly killed us a little while agoвђќ вђњthatвђs ridiculousвђќ lake snapped coming a little closer вђњi havenвђt been out of this house all dayвђќ вђњsheвђs not lyingвђќ ned reminded george вђњthe carвђs cold remember it couldnвђt have been this mercedes that nearly ran us downвђќ вђњran you downвђќ lake asked lowering her gun nancy told her what had happened in front of the plaza after they turned around to face lake вђњwe came over hereвђќ she added вђњto check out your car after all the driver did have auburn hairвђjust like yoursвђќ вђњthe blackmailer tried to kill youвђќ lake repeated nancy shrugged вђњsomebody did and not for the first time eitherвђќ she looked at lake вђњdid you say this was the second time today that somebody tried to steal your carвђќ вђњthatвђs rightвђќ lake slipped the gun into her pocket вђњi heard the alarm go off around three this afternoon by the time i got out here the thief was goneвђќ she nodded toward the gate вђњfirst thing in the morning iвђm having a better lock put on that gateвђќ вђњit certainly was a surpriseвђќ george said with relief вђњwhen your car alarm went offвђќ lake looked at george вђњyouвђre the one who wants to run in olympic stadiumвђќ she asked george nodded vigorously вђњi sure doвђќ вђњlistenвђќ lake said with an embarrassed shake of her head вђњiвђm sorry about what happened just now iвђll see if i can arrange a passвђќ вђњthatвђd be terrificвђќ george replied with a wide grin lake turned toward the door вђњwell good night and good luck i hope you find this guy before i have to make another paymentвђi donвђt have much left to sellвђќ back at the apartment nancy was just unlocking the door as the telephone began to ring it was ashley amberton вђњi just thought iвђd checkвђќ she said вђњwhat happened when you went to nelsonвђs column this afternoonвђќ nancy sketched out the events of the afternoon and evening вђњnow that we know it wasnвђt lakeвђs mercedes that nearly ran us downвђќ she said finishing her story вђњweвђll try to find out just who the car really belonged to it shouldnвђt be hard there canвђt be that many yellow mercedes in montrealвђќ вђњhow do you even know the car came from montrealвђќ ms amberton asked quickly вђњmaybe you shouldnвђt waste valuable time trying to trace itвђќ вђњall our other leads have dried upвђќ nancy pointed out вђњthe car is the only thing we have to go on right nowвђќ вђњstillвђќ ms amberton persisted вђњitвђll be like looking for a needle in a haystackвђќ вђњdonвђt worryвђweвђll find itвђќ nancy promised вђњthere are three of us to work on itвђќ ms amberton sighed вђњwell if you think you mustвђќ she said вђњbut be careful remember that last warning you wouldnвђt want anything to happen to your friends would youвђќ finding the yellow mercedes wasnвђt as easy as nancy had thought it would be reasoning that the most obvious way to get a specific type of car would be to rent one they started calling rental agencies the next day it was one dead end after another not a single agency had a yellow mercedes to rent even worse nobody had any idea where one could be found it was already the middle of the afternoon and they had called all the agencies in the phone book george plopped down on the sofa and sighed dejectedly вђњthis is nothing but a wildgoose chaseвђќ she said nancy thumbed through the yellow pages thinking вђњwaitвђќ she said вђњthereвђs something we havenвђt thought ofвђќ вђњwhatвђs thatвђќ ned asked coming from the kitchen with three glasses of lemonade вђњwhat else a mercedes dealerвђќ nancy exclaimed вђњmaybe heвђd knowвђќ george shrugged вђњof course and there seems to be only one dealer for this whole areaвђќ she said handing the phone to nancy вђњa yellow mercedesвђќ the manager of the mercedes dealership said when nancy reached him вђњactually it just so happens that i do have one on the lot itвђs probably the only one for sale in montrealвђќ he laughed вђњyellow must be a very popular color this yearвђќ вђњreallyвђќ nancy asked suddenly even more interested вђњwhat makes you say thatвђќ вђњwell yesterday a man wanted to testdrive a mercedesвђbut it had to be yellow he brought it right back after the drive and he said he didnвђt want it itвђs still here and still as beautiful as everвђќ вђњhmmmвђќ nancy said вђњwho was this man i wonder if i know himвђќ вђњyou mightвђќ the dealer replied вђњheвђs a very influential man in montrealвђќ вђњohвђќ nancy sat tensed on the edge of the sofa вђњwhatвђs his nameвђќ вђњi really shouldnвђt sayвђќ said the dealer вђњbut oh well he was pierre cherbourgвђќ chapter ten вђњpierre cherbourgвђќ nancy exclaimed вђњwell not mr cherbourg himself of courseвђќ the dealer added hurriedly вђњi didnвђt deal with him directly just his chauffeurвђjacques olivierвђlate yesterday afternoon now when can i arrange a testdrive for youвђќ the dealer asked smoothly вђњwould today be convenientвђќ вђњno not todayвђќ nancy replied вђњi have some other pressing business to attend to iвђll call later to make the appointmentвђќ she hung up вђњmr cherbourgвђќ ned and george asked in unison nancy shook her head and reached for the lemonade ned had brought вђњit was the chauffeurвђќ she said вђњthe dealer lent the car to jacques olivierвђќ вђњbut wait the driver had long auburn hairвђќ ned reminded them вђњit could have been a wigвђќ nancy replied with a shrug вђњof courseвђќ ned exclaimed вђњthe chauffeur tried to steal lakeвђs carвђand when he got scared off by the alarm he borrowed one and then he dressed up like lake to fool us into thinking it was her behind the wheelвђќ george shook her head вђњthis whole thing is too confusingвђќ she said frowning вђњitвђs giving me a headacheвђќ вђњwant to know the best cure for a headacheвђќ nancy asked getting up вђњactionвђќ georgeвђs frown turned suspicious вђњwhat kind of actionвђќ вђњcome on gang weвђre going to question a certain chauffeurвђќ jacques olivier nancy learned from the personnel department at cherbourg industries lived in a small white cottage behind the cherbourg mansion it was late afternoon by the time they got there nancy with ned and george right behind her walked up the brick path that led to the doorstep of the cottage to her left nancy could see the large garage inside was the cherbourg limousine вђњi donвђt hear anythingвђќ george whispered after nancy had knocked twice she knocked harder вђњthe carвђs hereвђќ she said вђњi think heвђs hiding outвђќ finally after nancy had knocked a fourth time the door opened a tiny crack вђњwho is itвђќ jacques asked his voice was fearful вђњitвђs nancy drewвђќ nancy told him вђњi need to talk to youвђќ the door slammed shut вђњgo awayвђќ jacques called his voice muffled through the door вђњiвђm sick i donвђt want to see anybodyвђќ вђњbut itвђs importantвђќ nancy insisted she hesitated вђњif i canвђt talk to you i suppose iвђll have to go see ms ambertonвђor maybe even mr cherbourgвђќ вђњnancyвђќ george hissed вђњthatвђs blackmailвђќ вђњyou betвђќ nancy agreed grimly вђњfight fire with fire i always sayвђќ the door opened again a little wider this time вђњyou wouldnвђt do that would youвђќ jacques whispered вђњi will if i donвђt get some answersвђќ nancy replied in a firm voice he backed up and let them in all the curtains and shades had been drawn jacques was obviously hiding out what was he afraid of the chauffeur closed the door behind them вђњwhat do you want to knowвђќ he asked nervously вђњwe want to know why you borrowed the yellow mercedes from the mercedes dealerвђќ nancy said jacquesвђs face paled вђњbut i didnвђtвђвђќ вђњthereвђs no use denying itвђќ nancy told him вђњweвђve already talked to the dealer heвђll swear that you borrowed itвђќ she looked around вђњwhereвђs the wig you wore when you nearly ran us downвђќ jacques sagged weakly into a chair вђњi threw it awayвђќ he said in a broken voice вђњinto the trash canвђќ вђњspeaking of trash cansвђќ george said вђњwho took the money out of the trash can at nelsonвђs column yesterday afternoonвђќ вђњmoneyвђќ jacques shook his head frantically his eyes wide with fear вђњi didnвђt take any moneyвђќ вђњwell thenвђќ nancy responded вђњtell us what you do knowвђќ вђњsomebody called me on the telephone yesterday at around noonвђќ the chauffeur said вђњi couldnвђt recognize the voice i couldnвђt even tell whether it was a man or a woman i was instructed toвђвђќ he swallowed hard вђњi was instructed toвђto borrow the yellow mercedes belonging to mademoiselle sinclairвђќ вђњyou mean steal it donвђt youвђќ jacques shifted uneasily вђњi didnвђt want to do it mademoiselleвђќ he said вђњbut the person said that if i followed his instructions i would be free there would be no more blackmail paymentsвђeverвђќ вђњso when you couldnвђt steal lake sinclairвђs car you went to the mercedes dealerвђќ nancy supplied вђњand then you came after usвђќ вђњi was told youвђd be in the plaza at five i was told not to let you walk awayвђќ he thought for a moment and then repeated miserably вђњi didnвђt want to do it even though i wanted to be free of the blackmail i couldnвђt bring myself to kill youвђќ вђњyou mean you missed us on purposeвђќ ned asked вђњat the last moment i swervedвђќ вђњitвђs a good thing you did tooвђќ nancy said вђњif youвђd hit us it would have been a cinch for the police to track you down in that car the blackmailer knew what he was doing you were a sitting duckвђќ jacques nodded вђњi am sorryвђќ he whispered again in the taxi on their way back to the apartment nancy stared out the window thinking вђњyou knowвђќ she said after they had climbed out and ned paid the driver вђњmaybe we were trickedвђќ вђњhowвђќ ned asked pocketing the change вђњmaybe last nightвђs drop was a phonyвђset up to lure us to the plaza maybe we were the sitting ducks and the blackmail money was just a decoyвђќ вђњyou might have something thereвђќ george said they got into the elevator and pushed the button for the sixth floor вђњif thatвђs trueвђќ ned remarked вђњthen dandridge would have to be in on itвђќ вђњmaybe dandridge is in on itвђќ nancy said вђњmaybe he set the whole thing up when we confronted him in his office he could have shown us that money just to throw us offвђto convince us that he was a victim tooвђќ вђњsureвђќ george exclaimed вђњthen he could have called jacques olivier and arranged to have him run us downвђќ вђњthat makes senseвђќ ned said slowly вђњin fact dandridge is the only one who knew that we were going to be there at five oвђclockвђќ he pulled out his key to the apartment and opened the door nancy frowned вђњit does make sense butвђвђќ something was nagging at the back of her mind what was it вђњlisten you guysвђќ george said dropping wearily onto a chair вђњiвђm ready to stop exercising my brain for a few hours and exercise my stomach what do you say to some dinnerвђќ вђњyeah iвђm starvingвђќ ned grinned вђњdo you have somewhere in mindвђќ he asked вђњwell it just so happensвђќ george said airily вђњthat pierre works in a great restaurantвђќ вђњbut weвђve already had so much french foodвђќ nancy objected вђњactually itвђs a greek restaurant over on prince arthur streetвђќ вђњwhatвђs a guy named pierre doing working in a greek restaurantвђќ ned asked with a laugh вђњbeats meвђќ george shrugged вђњanyway we had lunch there the other day and the food is terrificвђќ she kissed the tips of her fingers вђњwhat do you sayвђќ nancy giggled and turned to ned вђњhow do you say yes in greekвђќ she asked вђњyou got meвђќ ned confessed вђњwell then i guess iвђll just have to say ouiвђќ nancy replied and they all laughed the food was terrific nancy agreed after she had finished her dolmas greek salad and slice of rich sweet baklava for dessert afterward there was live bouzouki music then pierre who nancy decided was really cute joined them for dancing yawning nancy and ned said their good nights early leaving george in the arms of her frenchman they held hands as they walked back to the apartment in the soft spring night talking quietly and admiring the lighted shop windows вђњit really was a terrific eveningвђќ nancy said when they got back to the apartment вђњyeahвђќ ned agreed softly вђњand you know iвђm not tired anymore letвђs see if we can find some good music to dance toвђќ nancy smiled вђњgood ideaвђќ she said ned fiddled with the tuning knob for a moment the station he got was playing one of their favorite love songs nancy nodded to ned and when he stood back up she went into his arms the two of them danced slowly around the living room вђњyouвђre so wonderfulвђќ ned whispered into nancyвђs hair his arms tightened around her nancy felt herself growing breathless as she leaned against nedвђs chest вђњso are you nickersonвђќ gently ned leaned down and touched his lips to hers вђњoh nancyвђќ he whispered вђњiвђвђќ just then there was a knock on the door nancy pulled away and started for it вђњsomebodyвђs got an absolutely rotten sense of timingвђќ ned shook his head вђњitвђs pretty late for anybody to stop byвђќ he told her putting his hand on nancyвђs arm вђњlet me handle thisвђќ вђњbutвђвђќ she started to protest вђњlisten after all the things that have happened in the past few daysвђќ ned whispered firmly вђњiвђm not taking any chancesвђќ he stepped in front of nancy вђњwho is itвђќ he called loudly there was no answer вђњwho is itвђќ ned called again more sharply вђњthe porterвђќ came the muffled reply вђњstand backвђќ ned ordered nancy вђњthis could be dangerousвђќ then slowly cautiously making sure that the chain was hooked he began to open the door chapter eleven вђњhere you are sirвђќ the man said вђњthis arrived for you just nowвђќ вђњdonвђt tell meвђќ nancy groaned вђњitвђs another threatening letterвђќ вђњi donвђt think soвђќ ned said looking at the white envelope he had been handed вђњthis one has a return address on it itвђs from lake sinclairвђto all three of usвђќ вђњwell then open itвђќ nancy commanded ned opened the envelope and took out two red tickets and a green one вђњhey theyвђre passesвђќ he exclaimed вђњto get into olympic stadiumвђќ nancy took the passes from him вђњthe green one is for georgeвђќ she said reading the fine print вђњit lets her onto the track and the red ones get us into the press box but theyвђre only good from eleven to twelve tomorrow thatвђs weirdвђќ вђњand hereвђs a noteвђќ ned said reaching back into the envelope вђњ вђhere are your passesвђ вђќ he read вђњ вђnancy and ned can watch from the press box while george makes her debut appearance in olympic stadiumвђ itвђs signed вђlakeвђ вђќ the door opened as george let herself into the apartment she looked dreamy and starry eyed вђњhiвђќ she said vaguely hardly noticing them she drifted toward the bedroom nancy reached out and grabbed the sleeve of georgeвђs sweater вђњhey george weвђve got something for youвђќ she said вђњthatвђs niceвђќ she said stopping nancy waved the pass in front of her friendвђs eyes вђњdrew calling fayneвђќ she said вђњdrew calling fayne come in pleaseвђќ вђњhuhвђќ georgeвђs eyes refocused вђњwhatвђd you sayвђќ ned laughed вђњwe said that lake got us those passes youвђll get your chance to run in olympic stadiumвђќ george squealed and grabbed the pass jumping up and down with excitement вђњi canвђt believe itвђќ вђњand weвђll be there to watchвђќ nancy said вђњweвђve got passes to the press boxвђќ вђњspeaking of tomorrowвђќ ned said looking at nancy вђњwhatвђs on the agendaвђќ nancy sat down on the sofa and pulled her knees up under her chin вђњwell iвђve been thinkingвђќ she said вђњabout dandridge that isвђќ вђњwhat about himвђќ george asked вђњwe definitely canвђt strike him off our list of suspects thereвђs every possibility that yesterdayвђs drop was a dummyвђќ вђњso what do you want to doвђќ ned asked sitting down beside nancy вђњweвђre going to question him againвђќ nancy said вђњfirst thing in the morning if heвђs been telling us the truth his bank account should show some very large cash withdrawalsвђand no substantial depositsвђќ вђњwhile youвђre doing thatвђќ george broke in вђњi hope you donвђt mind if i go out with pierre tomorrowвђs his day off and he wants to show me the view from montroyal i could go to the stadium from there and meet you after my runвђќ nancy stared at her friend in mock anger вђњyou know itвђs a good thing i donвђt have to depend on you to solve this case fayneвђќ вђњwell you canвђt blame a girl for falling in love can youвђќ george said dreamily вђњso you donвђt believe what iвђve told youвђќ dr dandridge growled he had agreed to meet nancy and ned in his office the next morning even though it was saturday вђњyou still insist that iвђve got something to do with this blackmail businessвђќ nancy smiled pleasantly вђњright now there are just too many loose ends to permit me to draw any conclusions dr dandridge however there is a way you could help us tie some of them upвђќ the doctor frowned вђњjust what did you have in mind ms drewвђќ вђњyour bank account should be a complete record of your dealings with the blackmailer weвђd like to see itвђќ dr dandridge looked shocked вђњmy bank account you want my personal recordsвђќ вђњactually it would be easier if you just called an officer at your bankвђќ nancy told him вђњi could review the account there and save you the inconvenience of digging out your statementsвђќ dr dandridge sighed and reached for the phone вђњif this is the only way to convince youвђќ he said вђњthen itвђs worth it fortunately my bank is open on saturday morningsвђќ on the way to the bank nancy stopped to call ms amberton at her home to bring her up to date on what theyвђd done the day before and on their talk with the doctor but she wasnвђt home вђњit was okayвђќ nancy told ned вђњi just left a message telling her that we found out who was driving the yellow mercedes that should interest herвђќ вђњyou understand of course that this is extremely irregularвђќ the bank manager said he was dressed in a conservative black suit and vest and his hair was thinning on top вђњit is highly unusual to give out information on other peopleвђs accountsвђќ вђњbut you had dr dandridgeвђs phone callвђќ nancy assured him smoothly вђњand iвђve also brought you a signed requestвђќ вђњyes of courseвђќ the manager said with a sigh he cleared his throat вђњwell then here is a summary of the activity in the accountвђќ he handed a computer printout to nancy вђњi must say i have been puzzled by the recent large cash withdrawals from this accountвђќ nancy scanned the printout she spotted the withdrawals right away they exactly corresponded to what dr dandridge had told them вђњthis is the only account the doctor has with this bankвђќ she asked just to be sure вђњthe only oneвђќ the manager said вђњwith the exception of his loan account of courseвђќ he shifted uneasily вђњa rather large loan as a matter of factвђќ вђњwell then i think weвђve found what we came forвђќ she told the manager and stood up вђњso we can scratch dandridge as a suspectвђќ ned remarked as they threaded their way through the crowd of afternoon shoppers on saintantoine street вђњi suppose soвђќ nancy said stopping to eye a fashionable flowered sundress in a shop window вђњhis bank account confirms what heвђs already told us too badвђhe was such a promising suspect i mean just look at the cluesвђќ вђњyeahвђќ ned said linking his arm in hers as they started to walk again вђњfirst the liquid nitrogen then the impression of the prescription written on notepaper from his deskвђќ вђњand donвђt forget that he knew weвђd be in the plaza at fiveвђќ nancy added вђњeverything definitely points to dandridge itвђs almost as if somebody wanted us to suspect him but here we are up against a stone wallвђќ she shook her head gloomily вђњand we thought this was going to be such an easy caseвђќ a clock in a nearby church struck the half hour вђњhey itвђs tenthirtyвђќ ned said вђњweвђd better hurry if we want to see george run in the stadiumвђќ he tugged at nancyвђs arm вђњi want to stop by the apartment and get my camera we have to get pictures of thisвђќ nancy and ned got out of the taxi at the edge of olympic park before them loomed a huge oval stadium it was made of concrete and steel and supported by vshaped concrete ribs вђњitвђs hugeвђќ nancy exclaimed staring up at the gigantic building standing beside one of the massive supporting ribs she felt tiny вђњover hereвђќ ned said pointing to a sign that said press entrance he slid his camera case higher on his shoulder вђњthe press box must be this wayвђќ they presented their passes to the guard at the gate who looked at them curiously вђњwhereвђd you get these passesвђќ he demanded вђњfrom lake sinclairвђќ nancy told him вђњoh thatвђs fine thenвђќ he said his face relaxing вђњwe donвђt usually let people into the building except on guided toursвђќ he shrugged вђњsomeone else with a pass came through here a few minutes ago she a friend of yoursвђќ вђњthat must be georgeвђќ ned said вђњcome on nancy i want to see the inside of this thingвђќ the stadium seemed even larger inside than it had from the outsideвђmaybe because it was absolutely empty the press box was a long glass booth along one side of the openroofed structure from there they had a birdвђseye view of the track far below the far side of the track was over a hundred yards away nancy sat down at the table along the window holding an imaginary microphone in her hand вђњladies and gentlemenвђќ she said вђњweвђre here in worldfamous olympic stadium to watch the running debut of ms georgia fayne international champion jogger beneath us is the track where ms fayne will perform above us we can see the sky all around us are empty seatsвђrows and rows of empty seatsвђќ ned laughed вђњalmost sixty thousand empty seatsвђќ he said he opened his camera bag and carefully removed a long lens fitting it onto his camera вђњthis is a great place to try out my new telephoto lensвђќ he said enthusiastically вђњoh look nedвђќ nancy exclaimed pushing up the sleeves of her red blouse вђњthereвђs george doesnвђt she look tiny down thereвђќ george came into view far below moving swiftly from left to right around the track she was wearing an olympic running shirt and red white and blue shorts nancy waved as her friend passed in front of the press box but george didnвђt look up as nancy turned back to ned who was still busy with his camera she noticed a second person coming down the ramp at the far end of the stadium apparently george was going to have company on the track because the person was dressed in a white jogging jacket with the hood pulled up ned stopped fiddling with his lens and raised the camera to his eye вђњhey neatвђќ he said looking around the track вђњjust like a telescopeвђќ вђњwhat do you seeвђќ nancy wanted to know вђњwell george certainly has great legsвђќ ned replied a hint of teasing laughter in his voice nancy grinned and gave him a playful shove вђњhey what about my legsвђќ she asked pouting ned turned pointing his camera at nancyвђs legs he whistled вђњwowвђќ he said admiringly вђњsome legsвђќ вђњwhat i really want to know about is that other runnerвђќ nancy said directing his attention back to the track ned swiveled his camera вђњi canвђt tell about her legs or maybe hisвђќ he reported with a grin the other runner was almost opposite them then on the far side of the track george was catching up fast вђњthatвђs strangeвђќ ned remarked вђњwhat whatвђs strangeвђќ nancy asked watching george who was now almost on the heels of the other runner ned shrugged вђњthat runnerвђs wearing white gloves and carrying a can of hair spray or somethingвђќ вђњgloves hair sprayвђќ nancy exclaimed alarmed вђњlet me seeвђќ she jerked the camera away from ned and looked through the viewfinder just as nancy got the camera focused george flashed into view on the right side of the frame right behind the runner вђњnedвђќ nancy exclaimed вђњthatвђs no can of hairspray itвђsвђвђќ nancy and ned watched helplessly as the gloved runner whirled around grabbed georgeвђs arm with one hand and pushed the can toward georgeвђs face stumbling george raised her hands and rubbed her eyes then she took two steps and collapsed chapter twelve вђњit looks like tear gas or somethingвђќ nancy yelled on the track george was gasping frantically and tearing at her eyes ned jumped up knocking his chair over and bolted for the door in an instant he was clattering down the long steep stairway toward the field far below nancy followed as fast as she could ned was a superfast runner though and he was rapidly outdistancing her already he had reached the lowest tier of seats down on the track george was struggling to sit up the attacker bent over her for a moment and then george fell back not moving the runner bent over and hoisted the nowlimp george into a firemanвђs carry straightening up with difficulty once the attacker was standing upright georgeвђs weight seemed to be an easier burden carrying george the whitejacketed figure shuffled to a nearby tunnel and disappeared ned finally reached the end of the aisle and vaulted over the rail and onto the track at a dead run he raced across the field toward the exit where george and her attacker had vanished but just as ned reached the mouth of the tunnel nancy heard the echoing screech of car tires and her heart sank running was no use anymoreвђgeorge was gone george was gone suddenly the reality of it hit nancy george had been kidnapped where was she being taken who had taken her her heart pounding painfully nancy jogged down the track to the spot where george had fallen there was something on the track the empty can and a syringe nancy shook her head there was no use looking for fingerprints on the can or the syringeвђthe white gloves would have taken care of that like everything else in this case the kidnapping had been carefully planned and beautifully executed there was no doubt about it they were dealing with a firstrate criminal mind and so far it had defeated them at every turn it was almost as if they were playing some sort of game but it was a deadly game now there was a life at stake georgeвђs life ned ran back to nancy panting from the look on his face nancy knew he hadnвђt seen a thing вђњitвђs no useвђќ he gasped out of breath вђњwhoever it wasвђhad everything planned perfectly all i could see was a pair of taillights disappearing around the corner i didnвђt even see the car the garage was too darkвђќ вђњwell we know one thingвђќ nancy said вђњthe kidnapper had to be a man george is no featherweightвђќ вђњnot so fastвђќ ned cautioned вђњa woman could have managed to carry her with that firemanвђs carry all the weight is over your back and legs you could carry me if you had toвђќ he shook his head вђњno it still could be a woman nancyвђќ вђњwhoever it is heвђor sheвђis a proвђќ nancy said picking up the syringe carefully вђњthis was probably loaded with some kind of quickacting sedative once george was blinded by the tear gas she was knocked out with thisвђќ вђњnow whatвђќ ned asked as they made their way back up to the press box to pick up nedвђs camera вђњdo we call the police and report a kidnappingвђќ вђњonly if we have toвђќ nancy replied grimly вђњwe know more about this case than the police could find out in a week but there is one person we have to check out and on the doubleвђќ вђњohвђќ ned asked вђњwhoвђs thatвђќ soberly nancy looked at ned вђњwho knew we were going to be here this afternoonвђќ ned shook his head вђњnobody except lake sinclair that is she had to because she arranged the passes for usвђќ вђњright and remember the first time we met her she was wearing a white jogging suit just like the top the attacker had on there was a weight room in her condo too if it was a woman who kidnapped george it could have been lakeвђќ вђњpassesвђќ lake gasped in surprise she was standing in the middle of her kitchen surrounded by trays and platters of food вђњi didnвђt arrange any passes for you i meant to but i didnвђt have time iвђve been too busy getting ready for my party tonightвђќ вђњif you didnвђt then who didвђќ ned asked вђњthe blackmailer of courseвђќ nancy said wearily вђњremember the letter i got obviously heвђs made good on his threat to hurt you or georgeвђќ вђњif you need proof that i wasnвђt involvedвђќ lake added picking up a tray of tiny sandwiches вђњask anyone hereвђќ she turned to a whiteaproned caterer who was working behind her at the stove вђњtell these people where iвђve been all morning philippeвђќ вђњsheвђs been right here in the kitchen mademoiselleвђќ philippe answered in surprise вђњof courseвђќ вђњwell thatвђs thatвђќ nancy said it was nearly two and she and ned had just gotten back to the apartment вђњitвђs obvious that lake really didnвђt have anything to do with georgeвђs disappearanceвђќ she looked around the apartment it seemed so empty without george nancy picked up the phone вђњiвђd better let ms amberton know whatвђs happenedвђќ she was still out so nancy left another message to tell her that george had disappeared nancy put the phone down with a sigh вђњi guess thereвђs nothing to do now but waitвђќ she stretched wearily out on the sofa her hands behind her head вђњthe kidnapperвђs bound to get in touch with us sooner or laterвђќ вђњwell while weвђre waitingвђќ ned said вђњi vote for a sandwich we never even ate lunch how about itвђќ вђњi think there are some cold cuts in the refrigeratorвђќ nancy said вђњand some sodaвђќ they had just settled down to the salami sandwiches ned had made when there was a knock on the door вђњdelivery serviceвђќ someone called вђњweвђre not expecting anythingвђќ nancy said to ned in a low voice cautiously ned went to the door and opened it as far as the chain would allow вђњit is a deliveryвђќ he reported вђњa plastic boxвђќ вђњwhereвђd you get thisвђќ nancy asked coming up behind ned the boy shrugged вђњdonвђt knowвђќ he replied вђњit came to the office just a little while ago with instructions to deliver immediatelyвђќ he thrust a clipboard at ned вђњsign here pleaseвђќ nancy looked at the box ned held in his hand вђњthat looks like a videocassetteвђќ she exclaimed ned opened the box вђњit is a tapeвђќ he looked at the vcr sitting on top of the television set вђњiвђll put it inвђќ nancy adjusted the television set as ned put the tape on they both sat down on the sofa with the remote control and ned flicked it on for a moment the screen was filled with silvery snow then the image cleared and nancy could see george she was seated tied to a chair she was pale and obviously groggy but her eyes were open and filled with terror there was a smear of blood on her cheek вђњoh noвђќ nancy moaned вђњpoor georgeвђќ she wanted to look away but she couldnвђt it was hypnotizing ned stared at the screen his fists clenched trying to speak no words would come out on the tape a thickly muffled voice said вђњwell nancy drew did you enjoy the view from the press boxвђќ nancy couldnвђt tell whether it was a man or a woman but there was no disguising the triumph in it the kidnapper chuckled вђњwasnвђt that an interesting show of course now that i have your friend i have to decide what to do with her i have lots of choices but i havenвђt made up my mindвђyet but if youвђll go out to saintehгleneвђs island now to the museum at the old fort iвђll get in touch with you wait there to hear from meвђќ there was a moment of silence and then the chuckle came again the screen went black shakily nancy got to her feet вђњoh nedвђќ she whispered вђњthis is so awful and i feel responsibleвђќ ned put his arm around her shoulders вђњi feel pretty awful tooвђќ he said in a low voice вђњbut you canвђt blame yourselfвђќ for a few moments nancy let nedвђs comforting arms surround her then she pulled back вђњwell we canвђt think about that nowвђќ she said in a determined voice вђњweвђve got to think about george and how to get her back come on letвђs go to the old fortвђќ the old fort wasnвђt a fort at all nancy and ned discovered instead it was a protected grassy area on sainthгleneвђs island that was used as an arsenal back in also on the island were some of the pavilions left over from expo вђ theyвђd been turned into shops and restaurants and cafes along with swimming pools gardensвђeven an aquarium but nancy and ned didnвђt care to shop or to see the sights they hurried directly to the museum a twostory building that housed displays tracing the history of new france and canada through the early days it was filled with weapons brightly colored military uniforms and a large model of what montreal was like in nancy paced nervously back and forth in the lobby вђњwhatвђs the kidnapper going to do with herвђќ вђњi donвђt knowвђќ ned said sympathetically and glanced at the phone at the information desk вђњdo you suppose the kidnapper will callвђќ вђњthatвђs a possibilityвђќ nancy said вђњbut with this guy you canвђt tell he might try anything or sheвђќ she added remembering that the kidnapper could be a woman it was nearly five oвђclock and nancy was beginning to feel desperate what would happen if the museum closed and the kidnapper hadnвђt contacted them yet but just then the telephone on the desk rang the woman who answered it looked around at the few people left in the lobby вђњis there someone here named nancy drewвђќ she asked in a thick french accent nancy jumped for the phone with ned right beside her the kidnapper laughed a grating sound that echoed in nancyвђs ear вђњare you and your friend enjoying the museumвђќ the voice asked вђњwhat have you done with georgeвђќ nancy demanded вђњwhere is sheвђќ вђњah so the famous detective is stumped at lastвђќ the voice exclaimed obviously pleased вђњwell nancy drew youвђll just have to wait until iвђm ready to tell you where she isвђand iвђm not ready yetвђќ the voice dropped and there was an edge to it that made nancyвђs blood run cold вђњbut you can be sure of one thing my dear detectiveвђќ вђњwhatвђs thatвђќ nancy whispered вђњgeorge fayne is going to die and you and ned are too the game is mine my friend and i get to make up the rulesвђќ chapter thirteen there was nothing for nancy and ned to do but go back to the apartment they didnвђt dare go out to dinner in case the kidnapper called instead they ordered a pizza and ate it without really tasting it they watched television without really seeing it and neither of them said a word the phone startled them both when it rang nancy jumped to answer it while ned turned down the tv but it wasnвђt the kidnapperвђit was annette lebeau nancy sighed nervously she didnвђt want to tie up the line вђњiвђve been out of town for a few daysвђќ annette said вђњand when i got back this evening i received the strangest phone callвђќ вђњa phone callвђќ nancy asked вђњyes someoneвђiвђm not sure whether it was a man or a womanвђwanted me to call you with a messageвђќ nancy heard a rustling of paper вђњi wrote it down so i could give it to you exactlyвђќ with growing excitement nancy reached for a pencil the message had to be from the kidnapper вђњokayвђќ she said eagerly вђњletвђs hear itвђќ вђњ вђnancy and ned are going to have a lovely day sightseeing tomorrowвђ вђќ annette read вђњ вђthe view from montroyal is the best in the city the chalet is the place to waitвђ вђќ she cleared her throat вђњdo you mind if i ask you what this is all aboutвђќ she added curiously nancyвђs jaw tightened вђњour blackmailer has added a new crime to his repertoireвђќ she said grimly вђњkidnappingвђќ вђњkidnappingвђќ вђњour friend george fayne was kidnapped this morning from olympic stadiumвђќ вђњhave you called the policeвђќ вђњno not yetвђќ nancy replied вђњbut if we donвђt have any leads by tomorrow we may have toвђќ вђњwell if i can help in any way just let me knowвђќ annette said вђњthe resources of the station are at your disposal if they would helpвђќ nancy thanked annette and put down the telephone then she remembered to call ms amberton to update her after hanging up she said to ned slowly вђњyou know this whole thing feels like some sort of scavenger hunt itвђs as if weвђve been following a trail of clues that somebody deliberately laid out for us and george is the grand prizeвђќ she looked down at her notes вђњtomorrow weвђre supposed to look for clues at the top of montroyalвђќ nancy and ned spent most of the next day sunday in the mountaintop park in the center of the city but it was as fruitless as the afternoon they spent on saintehгleneвђs island no call nothing the view was stunning though they could pick out the cherbourg building in the middle of the other skyscrapers in downtown montreal to their left was the oval of olympic stadium the distance made it look tiny but nancy and ned spent the entire endless day sitting on the terrace in the chalet near the pay phone they kept going over and over the details of the case вђњi feel so helplessвђќ nancy told ned it was fivethirty in the afternoon and getting cool she pulled her yellow cardigan closer around her вђњi feel like a puppet on a string jumping whenever the kidnapper says jump iвђm sure this creep is our blackmailer tooвђќ she added bitterly ned shaded his eyes from the lateafternoon sun as he looked toward the river he pointed to the wharves вђњyou know whatвђќ he said вђњthose big warehouses along the river would make a great hiding place i wonder if george is in one of those buildings along the docksвђќ nancy leaned both elbows on the table shrugging вђњiвђve decidedвђќ she said вђњthat the kidnapperblackmailer is sending us on these wildgoose chases just to keep us busyвђќ вђњmaybe we were getting too closeвђќ ned suggested вђњmaybe the blackmailer got nervousвђќ вђњexactly where are weвђќ nancy asked thoughtfully вђњweвђve eliminated emile dandridge and lake sinclair as suspects weвђve established thatвђвђќ the telephone on the wall rang interrupting her вђњitвђs the kidnapperвђќ nancy exclaimed dashing for it вђњiвђm sure of itвђќ but when she picked up the phone she was greeted by ashley ambertonвђs voice вђњi just received a telephone message instructing me to call you at this numberвђќ ms amberton said вђњweвђre supposed to be in my office in exactly thirty minutesвђќ she said вђњiвђm at home now but iвђll meet you there in a half hour youвђll receive another message when we get to the officeвђќ nancy looked at her watch вђњweвђre on our wayвђќ she said вђњoh and nancyвђthereвђs more to the message something very oddвђќ вђњwhat is itвђќ nancy asked вђњit says вђplaying blindmanвђs buff has been fun but the gameвђs getting boring isnвђt it time you cried uncleвђ вђќ the sunday afternoon traffic was heavier than nancy had expected and it was nearly sixthirty when nancy and ned finally got to ashley ambertonвђs office вђњyou just missed the callвђќ she told them greeting nancy and shaking hands with ned nancy noticed that her left hand was bandaged she wondered what had happened вђњwhat did the kidnapper sayвђќ nancy asked eagerly вђњhereвђs the messageвђќ ms amberton said giving it to nancy with a chilly smile вђњi copied it down exactlyвђќ вђњwhat does it say nanвђќ ned asked вђњ вђyour friend is all packed up and ready to go at the cherbourg wharfвђ вђќ nancy read out loud вђњ вђif you donвђt find her by midnight sheвђs going to be taking a short ocean tripвђstraight downвђ вђќ ashley amberton glanced at her watch вђњiвђve taken the libertyвђќ she said вђњof arranging for the company helicopter to fly you over to the wharf itвђs waiting for you on the roof right now traffic is heavy at this hour and the helicopter will have you on the wharf in no time at all since youвђll be flying in you wonвђt have to worry about the gates which are locked of course itвђs a highsecurity areaвђќ вђњwhat about the warehouseвђќ nancy asked вђњis it locked tooвђќ ms amberton opened her desk drawer вђњthis should do the trickвђќ she handed nancy a ring of keys one was marked warehouse nancy thrust the keys into the pocket of her flowerprinted skirt вђњthanksвђќ she said she and ned followed ms amberton to the elevator up on the roof the helicopter was ready to go its rotor blades turned lazily as the pilot warmed the engine when he saw them coming he gunned the engine and the rotors began to spin more quickly the stiff wind almost blew nancy over as she ran across the roof ned right behind her вђњone more thingвђќ ashley amberton said as the pilot reached down to give nancy a hand вђњas soon as you find her i want you to bring your friend here so that i know sheвђs safe iвђll stay here and workвђќ вђњwe willвђќ nancy promised вђњwill you please call the police and have them meet us at the warehouse weвђll need help searchingвђќ the older woman nodded вђњand thanks again for everything youвђve doneвђќ вђњyouвђve got nothing to thank me forвђќ ms amberton said with a smile вђњnow hurry youвђve got to get over to the wharf fast before your friend is murderedвђќ chapter fourteen the helicopter flew out over the choppy surface of the saint lawrence river carrying nancy and ned to the cherbourg wharf darkness was falling and the lights of montreal were flickering on like a web of sparkling diamonds far below it was like riding a magic carpet nancy thought it might have even been fun if she hadnвђt kept thinking about the kidnapperвђs ominous message at midnight george would be killed but at least thanks to ms amberton they werenвђt wasting time just trying to get to the wharf that left more time to look for george she checked her watch it was just after seven in the seat beside her ned was looking out the window вђњthatвђs the cherbourg warehouse down thereвђќ the pilot yelled into her ear over the deafening clatter of the copterвђs rotors below nancy could just make out the dim outline of a very long narrow building it took up at least three acres of dock space beside it were dozens of huge cargo containers each the size of a semi trailer with smaller wooden crates and black metal drums stacked between them all of it was waiting to be loaded onto the ship tied up at the dock her heart sank if george was stuck in one of those containers how would they ever find her even with police help вђњiвђll put down at the end of the building by the main doorвђќ the pilot said expertly handling the controls the helicopter banked hovered briefly over the dock and then touched down with a gentle thump nancy looked at the pilot вђњyouвђre going to wait for us arenвђt youвђќ the man nodded and began turning off switches over his head cutting the engine вђњiвђll stay right hereвђќ he said вђњthat way iвђll be ready to go when you get backвђќ he gave nancy and ned a curious look вђњwhatвђs going on anywayвђќ he asked вђњms amberton wouldnвђt tell me a thingвђќ вђњweвђll explain everything when we get backвђќ nancy promised opening the door and jumping down onto the pavement it felt very solid under her feet after the ride вђњready nedвђќ вђњas ready as iвђll ever beвђќ ned answered вђњcome onвђќ nancy said вђњweвђll find herвђќ although the security floodlights on the building werenвђt bright nancy could see the outlines of a twentyfoot door in the end of the metal building it was big enough to drive a freight train through beside it there was a smaller door over it hung a sign вђњauthorized personnel only guard dogs on patrolвђќ nancy shuddered вђњguard dogsвђќ she whispered вђњi donвђt like the sound of thatвђќ вђњweвђre authorized personnelвђќ ned reminded her as she put the key carefully into the lock вђњthe dogs donвђt know thatвђќ nancy said grimly вђњi suppose ms amberton called to alert any guards on duty maybe theyвђll help usвђќ inside the lights were even dimmer than the ones outside most of the vast space was in mysterious shadow as nancyвђs eyes got accustomed to the dark she was able to make out a long center aisle it ran the full length of the building the rest of the warehouse was stacked with containers and crates вђњnow that weвђre in here where do we startвђќ ned wondered out loud his voice was almost lost in the enormous silence вђњmaybe we ought to yell if george hears usвђвђќ вђњgeorge will be bound and gaggedвђќ nancy pointed out вђњletвђs split up weвђll cover more ground that wayвђќ вђњnot on your lifeвђќ ned objected вђњi donвђt want to have to search for both of you in here this place is so big that we should have a compass and a map just to find our way aroundвђќ he frowned and stuck his hands in the pockets of his pants вђњbesides how do we even know sheвђs hereвђќ вђњsomehow iвђm sure of itвђќ nancy replied вђњyou were right this afternoon when you said you thought george was being held in the wharf areaвђќ she pulled out her flashlight вђњbut thereвђs something i donвђt understand i mean why would the kidnapper let us walk in and just pick her up do you supposeвђвђќ вђњlookвђќ ned interrupted вђњitвђs nearly seventhirty letвђs find george first then we can worry about the kidnapperвђќ вђњrightвђќ nancy said flicking on her flashlight вђњi wonder where the police are thoughвђќ she shined it at the huge trucklike containers that were parked along the wall вђњmost of these containers are sealed they may have been here waiting for a ship for months if we assume that george is still alive and the kidnapper wants to keep her that wayвђat least for the momentвђit stands to reason that sheвђs probably not sealed in one of these letвђs start checking all the loose cratesвђќ with ned behind her nancy started down the long center aisle it was like walking down a narrow canyon between two mountains вђњmy guess is that the crate weвђre looking for wonвђt be nailed shutвђќ nancy went on вђњthe kidnapper would need to get at her in a hurryвђќ nancyвђs small flashlight barely lit up the first group of wooden crates but it appeared that they were all nailed solidly shut between the cracks of the crates nancy could see the glint of polished steel the crates must be full of heavy equipment there were black letters stenciled on the side вђњwhat does it sayвђќ ned asked вђњitвђs french for this side upвђ вђќ nancy replied stepping backward suddenly the silence was broken by a piercing squeal nancy saw a huge black shape dart along the top of one of the crates and disappear behind it instinctively she pressed against ned вђњwhat was thatвђќ she asked breathlessly вђњitвђs just a ratвђќ ned said reassuringly вђњjust a ratвђќ nancy hissed вђњdid you see the size of that thing it was as big as a catвђќ вђњcome onвђќ ned said вђњit doesnвђt look like thereвђs anything back thereвђќ вђњwaitвђќ nancy said grabbing the sleeve of his sweater вђњwhatвђs that rat doing hereвђќ ned frowned вђњthis place must be full of themвђќ he replied вђњwarehouses always areвђќ вђњmaybe but most of this stuff is heavy machinery ned rats canвђt eat cold steelвђќ вђњmaybe not but if george is here sheвђs got to have foodвђќ ned exclaimed вђњthe smell of the food could have attracted the ratsвђќ nancy flicked her light over the tenfoothigh stack of crates вђњlookвђќ she exclaimed вђњlook at thatвђќ behind the stack along the wall was a large black chemical drum marked toxic waste вђњwhat do you suppose that stuff is doing hereвђќ ned asked вђњit doesnвђt fit in with the rest of this cargoвђќ вђњletвђs take a look at itвђќ nancy said together they climbed over a half dozen crates to get to the mysterious black drum вђњhey this is really weirdвђќ ned said examining the drum вђњitвђs got holes in the top whoвђd punch holes in a barrel of chemicalsвђќ вђњair holesвђќ nancy cried she leaned down listening a dull moan sounded from inside the drum вђњgeorge itвђs georgeвђќ nancy exclaimed вђњhow do we get her outвђќ вђњi think we can pry the lid offвђќ ned said вђњitвђs pressed on like the top of an orange juice canвђќ вђњlook thereвђs a crowbarвђќ nancy said reaching for a heavy tool that was leaning against a crate вђњiвђll bet thatвђs what the kidnapperвђs been using to open the drumвђќ nancy handed the crowbar to ned who began to pry the lid loose finally it popped off and crashed to the cement floor with a loud clang that echoed eerily down the length of the warehouse nancy shined her flashlight down into the drum george was there hands bound tightly behind her a dirty gag in her mouth at her feet were the remains of a halfeaten sandwich she was still wearing the shorts and running shirt sheвђd been wearing when she was kidnapped вђњquickвђќ nancy said вђњletвђs get her out of here the guards probably heard the noiseвђќ ned pulled george out her eyes were halfclosed as she slumped against him nancy pulled out the gag вђњgeorgeвђќ she whispered urgently вђњgeorge are you all rightвђќ groggily george opened her eyes and managed a nod she closed her eyes again and it looked as if sheвђd fainted вђњmy guess is that sheвђs doped upвђќ ned said untying her hands вђњshe canвђt even standвђќ вђњsheвђs shiveringвђќ nancy pulled off her sweater and pushed georgeвђs arms into it вђњcome on weвђve got to get her out of hereвђќ suddenly along the wall overhead a little to their right a light flickered on in an office window then another light came on this time on the catwalk that crossed the center of the building about twenty feet up a door opened and somebody came out onto the catwalk вђњssshshвђќ nancy said crouching into the shadows вђњit must be a guardвђќ beside her ned made sure george was hunched down too вђњi wonder if ms amberton thought to call them and tell them weвђre hereвђќ the silence was eerie then nancy heard two loud distinct chinks like pieces of metal coming together ned put his hand on her arm вђњthat sounded like somebody loading a gunвђќ he whispered cautiously nancy raised her head over the drum to see what was happening the silence was broken by a loud kaboom a bullet thudded into the wooden crate beside her someone was shooting at them chapter fifteen вђњhey whatвђs going on up there peteвђќ the startled shout came from the far end of the warehouse вђњthere must be two guardsвђќ nancy whispered to ned george let out a faint moan вђњi thought i heard something charlieвђќ the guard on the catwalk yelled back вђњi was just trying to scare вђem out into the openвђќ вђњdo you see anything nowвђќ the guard craned his neck to look around вђњnoвђќ he admitted вђњbut i did hear something sounded like a piece of metal rolling around on the floorвђќ вђњiвђll bring the dog down and we can check it outвђќ a door slammed and there was silence george moaned again she was propped weakly against nedвђs shoulder вђњlistenвђќ ned whispered вђњwith george in this condition weвђre no match for a dog why donвђt we just tell them who we are and why weвђre here they could call ms amberton to confirm that itвђs okayвђќ вђњno wayвђќ nancy retorted вђњthey might be working with the kidnapper you take george and sneak to the exit iвђll cover you guys by getting the guardsвђ and the dogвђs attentionвђќ вђњthatвђs too dangerousвђќ ned objected вђњletвђs think of something elseвђќ another door slammed a dog began to bark loudly вђњgo get them spikeвђќ the man yelled вђњthereвђs no time to argueвђќ nancy said jumping to her feet вђњget goingвђќ as ned grabbed george and started toward the exit nancy dashed out into the center aisle she ran down it until she was sure she had been spotted then she ducked behind another pile of crates вђњhey itвђs a girlвђќ shouted pete the first guard вђњthere she goesвђќ quickly he climbed down a ladder from the catwalk вђњsheвђs heading your way charlie weвђve got her between usвђќ good nancy thought it was just what she wanted with pete down from the catwalk and coming in her direction ned and george would be able to slip past him and out the door at the end gingerly she began to work her way among the crates toward the outside wall but once she was against the wall nancy realized that she was in trouble where were the police pete was coming from one direction with his gun charlie was coming from the other with spike ned and george must be safely outside by now but she was trapped вђњall right little ladyвђќ charlie yelled вђњweвђve got you come on out nowвђќ frantically nancy looked around she noticed a large pile of wood shavings that were probably used for packing material she reached in the pocket of her skirt yes luckily they were still thereвђthe book of matches she had picked up at the greek restaurant a few nights before working fast nancy pushed a large pile of shavings up against the sheetmetal wall she added an oily sack that had been draped over a barrel then she bent over and struck a match to the pile there on the cement floor the fire would do no real damage but if her scheme worked it would distract the guards long enough to let her get away the yellow flames began to spread through the shavings seconds later the entire pile was blazing eerie shadows flickering against the ceiling a cloud of black oily smoke spewed out of the flames as the sack caught fire вђњfireвђќ pete yelled frantically вђњshe must be trying to burn the place downвђќ вђњforget the girl get a fire extinguisherвђќ charlie yelled back вђњlet the dog take care of her heвђll never let her get awayвђќ spike began to barkвђshort vicious yips that made the hair prickle on the back of nancyвђs neck the dog sounded as if he meant business could she get past him silently nancy edged along the wall behind the crates she was careful not to make any noise that might attract the dogвђs attention halfway to the door she saw that the two guards were totally preoccupied with fighting the fire maybe she was close enough to make a run for it cautiously she stepped into the center aisle but there was another loud bark she threw a quick look back over her shoulder a large black form about waist high emerged from the shadows it charged after her with incredible speed its teeth bared it was a police dog the largest one she had ever seen and sheвђd never get to the door before it got to her nancy dived behind several cardboard boxes and crates pulling three or four down around her the dog stopped and glared at her with slits for eyes growling low in his throat there was nothing between her and the dog but a half dozen flimsy boxes would they hold him back the dog bared his teeth and growled again the hair rising along his neck still it didnвђt move toward her as long as she stayed perfectly still spike must be trained she thought as she watched him to corner people until his master arrived nancy took a deep breath the palms of her hands were clammy with sweat she was safe from the dog as long as she didnвђt moveвђfor a few moments at least until the guards put the fire out but if she tried to make a break the dog would attack her for sure and from the looks of those sharp teeth sheвђd be cut to ribbons in minutes what could she do just as nancy was beginning to feel truly frightened the silence was broken by the hum of a large electric motor from overhead came the creaking sound of something it sounded like a piece of machinery moving along a rail nancy looked up above her she could see a heavy rail suspended like the track for a monorail train it ran the full length of the center aisle all the way down to the huge double doors at the end attached to the rail was what looked like a small cab in the dim light nancy could still see that ned was inside the cab and from the bottom of the cab swung a large hook ned had come to rescue her вђњhey whatвђs thatвђќ one of the guards shouted spike bared his teeth and began to growl again вђњitвђs the craneвђќ the other one yelled вђњcome on weвђve got to cut the powerвђќ nancy fixed her eyes on the hook as it swung down the aisle toward her about four feet above her head could she reach it she pushed over a wooden crate and stood up on it the hook was coming within reach now and she grabbed itвђjust as spike lunged toward her to her relief the hook began to pull her up out of the dogвђs reach until she dangled just above his head and ned was taking them straight for the door shouting loudly the guards were running down the center aisle they were too far away to get off an accurate shot but the crane also seemed to be moving incredibly slowly then nancy turned to see the huge double doors just ahead they were closed tight she and ned were going to crash into the doors then a warning horn began to blare loudly slowly just as the crane reached the opening the enormous doors slid open just wide enough for the crane to pass through a blast of cold wet night wind hit nancy in the face nearly taking her breath away the rush of air came from the helicopter which was hovering noisily just outside the building its landing lights were on and its marker beacon flashed bright against the darkness it was raining lightly вђњwhat in the world is thatвђќ nancy heard one of the astonished guards shout she saw them duck behind one of the containers вђњnancy get in the helicopterвђќ ned shouted as he slid down the ladder from the cabin of the crane вђњiвђll take care of the dogвђќ nancy let go of the hook and dropped to the ground with a thump as she raced toward safety ned wrapped his jacket around his arm holding it bent in front of him like a shield crouching low he ran straight at spike вђњlook out nedвђќ nancy yelled she ran toward the helicopter hovering three feet above the dock and hoisted herself into the copilotвђs seat george was slumped in a backseat breathing in great gulps growling ferociously the dog charged ned it sunk its teeth into the jacket he had wrapped around his arm stubbornly the dog held on as ned began to back toward the helicopter dragging the fighting dog with him one of the guards ran to the open door вђњstopвђќ he shouted вђњstop or iвђll shootвђќ вђњnoвђќ the other one yelled вђњitвђs a company helicopter donвђt shootвђќ вђњhold on kidsвђќ the pilot commanded вђњweвђre getting out of hereвђќ вђњwait for nedвђќ nancy shrieked as the pilot began to rev up the engine the helicopter rose another couple of feet as the copter began to rise higher ned lunged for it and hooked his free arm over the landing skid just as his feet were dragged free of the ground he straightened out his other arm his jacket peeled off his arm and the dog dropped with a splashy thud into a puddle on the dock below ned crawled over the skid and into the backseat of the helicopter as the dumbfounded guards stared at him their pistols hanging at their sides leaning over the back of the front seat nancy cheered and flung her arms around ned вђњoh nedвђќ she cried вђњyouвђre safeвђќ вђњare you all rightвђќ ned asked anxiously gently brushing her cheek with his hand nancy kissed him quickly вђњiвђm fineвђќ she said вђњwhat about georgeвђќ george looked up dazed вђњwhere are weвђќ she asked вђњwhat happenedвђќ вђњweвђre on our way back to the cherbourg buildingвђќ ned told her pointing to the lights on the rainslicked streets below the wiper blades on the helicopter made a comfortable thunk thunk вђњyouвђre safe nowвђќ nancy looked at george вђњdid you see the person who kidnapped youвђќ she asked eagerly george frowned вђњno i didnвђt see herвђќ she said slowly вђњbut iвђвђќ вђњherвђќ ned broke in george nodded looking pleased with herself вђњi couldnвђt see her face but it was a woman iвђm sure of it i could tell by her voiceвђќ she grinned вђњi got even tooвђat least a littleвђќ she added smugly вђњi bit her right on the handвђќ вђњyou bit herвђќ nancy repeated in a wondering tone something was nagging at the back of her mind but she still wasnвђt sure what it was вђњyesвђќ george said вђњshe came to bring me something to eat and when she took the gag out of my mouth iвђвђќ but george didnвђt get to finish her sentence the helicopter engine had begun to sound funny as if it had to work harder to keep going then suddenly there was just silenceвђa terrifying silence george grabbed nedвђs arm вђњwhatвђs going onвђќ she cried вђњengine failureвђќ the pilot said tersely snapping switches on the control panel in front of him nancy stared at the panel the gauges were all falling toward zeroвђall except the altimeter it was spinning counterclockwise faster and faster nancyвђs stomach felt the way it did in an elevator when it went down too fast and then from behind her she heard georgeвђs thin highpitched scream вђњweвђre going to crash weвђre all going to dieвђќ chapter sixteen вђњweвђve got to find a clear spot to put downвђand fastвђќ the pilot told nancy вђњiвђm going to have my hands full get on the radioвђќ nancy looked at the radio doubtfully вђњhow does it workвђќ she asked вђњpick up the mike when you want to talk press the button on the side iвђll tell you what to sayвђќ nancy picked up the large black microphone clipped to the instrument panel the flexible cord dangling beneath it вђњnow press the button and say вђmayday mayday this is bell whiskey seven seven one zero three alpha overвђ вђќ the pilot directed the copter lurched to the left and he righted it but with difficulty nancy pressed the button and blurted out вђњmayday mayday this is bell whiskey seven seven one zero three alpha overвђќ вђњnow let go of the buttonвђќ the pilot commanded вђњthey canвђt answer while youвђre on the airвђќ there was a long silence nancy wondered if anyone had heard them then she heard a crackle of static and a calm voice came through вђњroger seven seven one zero three alpha this is montreal air traffic control center what is the nature of your emergencyвђќ nancy took a deep breath and tried to keep her voice as calm as the radio voice вђњweвђre having engine failureвђќ she said вђњroger seven seven one zero three alphaвђќ the voice responded вђњwhat is your location can you return to base overвђќ вђњnegativeвђќ the pilot replied вђњwe have total engine failure weвђre at twelve hundred descending at seven hundred feet per minuteвђќ вђњthe pilot says weвђre going in fastвђќ nancy said glancing down вђњweвђre somewhere just north of the riverвђќ вђњhey isnвђt that city hallвђќ ned asked as he leaned forward pointing over nancyвђs shoulder вђњweвђre just southwest of city hallвђќ nancy added вђњroger seven seven one zero three alpha we have you on the screen suggest you try an emergency landing in place jacquescartier wind northwest at fifteen gusting to twentyfive emergency equipment is on the way good luckвђќ вђњroger outвђќ responded the pilot вђњroger outвђќ nancy repeated вђњokay everybodyвђќ the pilot said вђњhang on iвђm going to autorotateвђќ he began to turn the rotor control вђњwhatвђs thatвђќ george gasped вђњheвђs changing the angle on the rotorsвђќ ned told her вђњitвђll slow our fall a bitвђќ as if an invisible hand had lifted them nancy felt the copterвђs descent slowing but they were already over the plaza and she could tell that they were still falling too fast they were going to crash feverishly the pilot began to flip switches suddenly the lights went out the cabin was pitch dark a second later with a sickening crunch the helicopter slammed into the concrete there was silence вђњnanвђќ ned asked вђњare you okayвђќ nancy took a deep breath she was jammed into her seat at a crazy angle and her blouse was torn where she had caught it on something but other than that she was fine вђњiвђm okay what about georgeвђќ she asked unbuckling her seat belt beside her the pilot was struggling to get his door open вђњiвђm still aliveвђќ george said in a dazed voice вђњi canвђt believe it but iвђm still aliveвђќ nancy pushed the door open and jumped out onto the pavement the force of the impact had crushed one of the skids and the copter was tilted over the tip of one rotor had ripped through a bed of pansies scattering wet flowers all over the sidewalk вђњeverybody outвђќ the pilot shouted вђњthis thing could blow skyhigh any secondвђќ working quickly nancy helped ned pull george out and take her to a nearby bench fire trucks their sirens wailing pulled up at the curb police cars were right behind them nancy turned to the pilot вђњcan we find out what happened to the engineвђќ вђњnot now i wouldnвђt want to risk being near it if it blows upвђќ the pilot said cautiously вђњbut if it goes up weвђll never knowвђќ nancy pointed out вђњand i have the feeling that this is importantвђќ nancy and the pilot ran to the rear of the helicopter something black and gooey was oozing out from under it вђњlooks like an oil problem to meвђќ he took a look at the engine black goop was everywhere вђњincredibleвђќ the pilot exclaimed he stared uncomprehendingly at the mess then he bent over and began to explore underneath the engine with his fingers вђњwhat is itвђќ ned asked coming up behind nancy and the pilot вђњlooks like the oil drain plug fell outвђќ he said вђњif that happened the pressure in the system would blow all the oil out in secondsвђќ he wiped his hands on his pants a puzzled look on his face вђњfunny thing though the warning light never came onвђќ ned disappeared around the helicopter as she watched him go nancy became aware of a new sharper smell mixing with the heavy oily smell of the engine вђњwhatвђs that smellвђќ she asked вђњaviation gasвђќ the pilot exclaimed he grabbed her arm and yanked her away вђњthe fuel line mustвђve broken letвђs get out of hereвђќ the fire chief ran up вђњweвђve evacuated the entire areaвђќ he said вђњnow you get back tooвђќ вђњnedвђќ nancy yelled looking around a tiny blue flame was licking up at the engine compartment вђњned where are youвђќ then to her horror she saw him he was on his back on the floor of the cockpit legs dangling out the door he was examining something under the instrument panel вђњnedвђќ nancy screamed вђњget out itвђs going to explodeвђќ ned worked for an instant longer and then slid out from under the instrument panel and bolted toward them behind him the blue flame suddenly burst into bright yellow and rapidly enveloped the rear of the disabled copter it exploded with a tremendous bang nancy felt a whoosh of superheated air rush over her head just as ned crashed into her and they both went down above them large pieces of metal sailed up in a column of yellow flame and thick black smoke вђњnedвђќ nancy pushed nedвђs heavy weight off her and sat up bits of metal were raining down onto the wet pavement the helicopter was burning out of control вђњiвђm okayвђќ ned grunted вђњare youвђќ вђњyesвђќ she said rubbing her knee where sheвђd skinned it on the pavement as she fell вђњwhat were you doing in the cockpit one more second and youвђd have been killedвђќ вђњi was looking for a broken wireвђќ ned said grimly вђњthe wire to the oil warning lightвђќ вђњdid you find itвђќ вђњyeah but it wasnвђt broken it was cutвђќ the pilot came up behind them вђњyou mean somebody sabotaged usвђќ nancy turned вђњsomeone must have loosened the drain plug and cut the wireвђќ вђњrightвђќ ned put in вђњand if weвђd crashed into the river nobody could ever have figured out whyвђќ nancy stared at him вђњnedвђќ she said вђњi think i know who it wasвђќ chapter seventeen вђњnancy drew what are you doing hereвђќ nancy turned quickly it was annette lebeau wearing a raincoat she had an umbrella in one hand and a microphone in the other behind her were two guys with lights and tv cameras shooting the burning helicopter вђњannetteвђќ nancy exclaimed вђњwhatвђвђќ вђњwe heard the police bulletin about the

shook her head violently and pulled annette over to the side вђњlistenвђќ she said in a low voice вђњcan you kill the survivor angleвђќ annette nearly dropped her mike вђњwhat do you mean kill it youвђre all alive arenвђt you i mean everybody walked away from the crash rightвђќ вђњrightвђќ nancy said вђњbut a certain person needs to believe that this was a fatal crashвђthat there were no

crossedвђќ вђњyou betвђќ annette said вђњgood luckвђќ she stood up and raised her voice вђњhey max letвђs get over to the helicopter weвђve got some filming to do if weвђre going to be on the air at tenвђќ max looked at nancy and her friends вђњwhat about themвђќ he asked вђњwhoвђќ annette asked blandly вђњcome on get that camera rolling lights where are the lightsвђќ вђњokay gangвђќ nancy said to george and ned вђњletвђs get out of hereвђќ вђњboy iвђm readyвђќ george said with a sigh she pulled nancyвђs sweater closer around her shivering вђњhot shower here i comeвђќ ned laughed вђњi think nancy has something else in mindвђќ he said вђњyeah something like wrapping up a caseвђќ nancy replied вђњwe promised ashley amberton that weвђd let her know when we got back so sheвђd know weвђre safe letвђs go pay her a visitвђќ in the taxi nancy told ned and george what she had figured out and what she wanted them to do вђњthe important thing here is the timingвђќ she said вђњsurprise is absolutely necessary so itвђll all have to run like clockworkвђќ ned picked up nancyвђs hand and squeezed it вђњdonвђt worryвђќ he assured her вђњit willвђќ вђњi certainly hope soвђќ george said she was shivering so hard that her teeth were rattling вђњi want to get out of these clothes iвђm freezing and i must smell like a locker roomвђќ nancy grinned вђњiвђve got to admit that you are pretty ripeвђќ she said вђњbut what can you expect from somebody whoвђs been living in a barrelвђќ she ducked the punch that george aimed at her at the cherbourg building they signed in with the guard at the lobby desk and went up in the elevator the deserted building was dark and spooky but when they got to the fifteenth floor nancy could see the light at the end of the hall ashley amberton must still be there working late just as sheвђd promised quietly with ned and george right behind her nancy tiptoed down to the end of the hall and pushed open the door to ms ambertonвђs outer office it was dark and empty but through the glass window over the secretaryвђs desk they could see into the inner office ms amberton was there sitting behind her desk signing papers with her bandaged left hand the door to the outer office hung slightly ajar and nancy could hear the scratchscratch of the womanвђs pen on the paper вђњitвђs dark in hereвђќ nancy whispered вђњso she canвђt see usвђќ she gave ned a little push вђњokay nedвђќ she said вђњget going and be careful out thereвђќ ned touched her cheek affectionately вђњi will you too nanвђќ he said вђњwatch yourselfвђќ he disappeared into the darkness вђњwhat time is itвђќ george whispered nancy looked at her watch вђњthree minutes to tenвђќ she said quietly вђњthat phone should ring just about nowвђќ as if on cue the telephone on ashley ambertonвђs desk rang she reached for it вђњhelloвђќ she said curtly and then with a little surprise added вђњoh hello ms lebeauвђќ she listened intently for a moment her lips tightening вђњa cherbourg helicopterвђќ she asked a deep note of concern in her voice вђњyes of course iвђll turn it on right now thank you for callingвђќ she put down the phone and picked up the television remote control and flicked it on a few minutes later the news came on it was the usual scene nancy sawвђtwo anchorpeople sitting beside each other behind a desk вђњand nowвђќ one of them said in a deep voice вђњwe take you to annette lebeau at the scene of the crash annetteвђќ the scene shifted to the dark rainswept plaza in the background was nelsonвђs column and beside it the blazing wreckage of the helicopter the camera was focused on annette lebeauвђs somber face as she stood in front of the fire behind her were a half dozen firemen and policemen the pavement around her was strewn with bits of metal вђњthank you carlвђќ annette said into the microphone the rain was dripping off the black umbrella she held вђњweвђre at the scene of a tragedy that apparently took four lives in downtown montreal just moments ago a cherbourg industries helicopter crashed on place jacquescartier directly in front of nelsonвђs column narrowly missing the few evening strollers braving the rain as it lost power and crashed the helicopter burst into flames almost immediately first reports are that there were four people on board but there appear to have been no survivors weвђll get back to you as soon as we have more detailsвђќ the camera left annette and zoomed in on an ambulance parked at the curb вђњa terrible tragedy in downtown montrealвђќ annette concluded вђњand now back to you carlвђќ ashley amberton turned off the television set then as nancy and george watched from the darkened office a triumphant smile spread across her face she reached in her desk and poured herself a drink then she took out a file folder and pulled out a newspaper picture of nancy she held it over an ashtray on her desk and lit it with a cigarette lighter вђњahha nancy drewвђќ she said gloating as the flame spread across nancyвђs face and the paper disintegrated into ash вђњwhoвђs the best mind of crime itвђs no longer you nancy drewвђitвђs ashley amberton blackmailer kidnapper and murderer extraordinaireвђќ and she lifted the glass in a toast to herself just then nancy opened the door and stepped into the office вђњsorry ashleyвђќ she said calmly вђњbut it appears that your little plan didnвђt work so well after allвђќ chapter eighteen вђњnancy nancy drew but i thoughtвђвђќ ashley amberton stood up behind her desk and swallowed hard her face turning a pasty white вђњbut the television broadcast just said that the helicopter crashed it said that you were all deadвђќ she pulled off her glasses obviously fighting for control вђњi was simply thunderstruck how could such a horrible horrible thing have happenedвђќ вђњit happenedвђќ nancy said calmly вђњbecause you loosened the oil drain plug and disconnected the warning lightвђќ she smiled slightly вђњi have to hand it to you ashley you thought of everything if the copter had gone down before we found george weвђd be out of the way and thereвђd be plenty of time to get rid of george and if it went down with all of us aboard вђќ she shrugged вђњeither way youвђd come out a winnerвђќ вђњa winnerвђќ ms amberton pulled herself up вђњi donвђt know what youвђre talking about why i was shocked to hearвђвђќ вђњitвђs no use ashleyвђќ nancy said raising her voice вђњi know all about it i know that you blackmailed the cherbourg employees it was so easy for you to find out their secrets wasnвђt it you simply poked around in their personnel files didnвђt you and you were also the one who poisoned monique when you took flowers to her the day before she fell ill you also stole the notepaper and the liquid nitrogen from dr dandridgeвђs office when you took candy to his staffвђќ ms amberton smiled вђњyou have a very lively imagination my dearвђќ she said smoothly вђњno wonder youвђve made such a name for yourself as a detective are you finished yetвђќ вђњno thereвђs moreвђќ nancy told her вђњmuch moreвђќ she pointed to the charred remains of the newspaper photo in the ashtray вђњyou made up the phony headline to scare me and you arranged for the passes to get us into the stadium and of course it was you who phoned jacques olivier and told him to run us downвђќ ms amberton frowned вђњme what makes you think thatвђќ nancy smiled вђњyou knew weвђd be at the plaza watching emile dandridge drop the money into the trash can remember i phoned you and told you we were going to be thereвђќ she shook her head вђњit was so obvious i donвђt know why i didnвђt see it right away you were the only one besides the doctor who knew weвђd be there in fact you were the only person in montreal who knew every move we madeвђќ вђњso youвђve figured it all outвђќ ms amberton asked archly вђњwhat made you suspect me it wasnвђt just that i knew where you were or youвђd have figured this out right awayвђќ вђњtrue your question about the damage to the stove when i told you about the liquid nitrogen spill was the first thing i didnвђt think about it at the time though it was only this evening when everything began to fall into place that i remembered our conversationвђќ вђњyes that was rather an undisciplined remarkвђќ ms amberton admitted вђњi realized immediately that you hadnвђt told me where in the kitchen the spill had occurred was there anything elseвђќ вђњyour bandaged handвђќ nancy replied вђњthe hand that george bit and of course the keys the kidnapper couldnвђt have gotten into the locked warehouse to hide georgeвђunless she had the key too also the police never arrived to help usвђќ вђњwell well you are an amazing young ladyвђќ ms amberton said with a deep chuckle вђњi do congratulate you on your stunning detective skills it appears that you have won this round doesnвђt itвђќ nancy stared at her вђњso thatвђs itвђќ she said вђњa game the whole thing has been a game of wits all along youвђve been laying out the clues for me to follow havenвђt youвђќ вђњindeed yesвђќ ms amberton said sitting easily on the corner of the desk вђњin fact i think a little boasting is in order if you donвђt object i masterminded the whole thingвђall of it but i didnвђt do it for the money of courseвђќ вђњof course notвђќ nancy said going to the balcony door to look out вђњyou did it for the fun of it didnвђt you it was a test of your abilitiesвђyour criminal abilitiesвђќ вђњexactlyвђќ ashley amberton beamed вђњat first of course there was just the pleasure of finding out what i could do practicing in a way why else would anyone want to bother with such insignificant blackmail victims as poor monique and jacques and that miserable evans girlвђќ вђњbut then as you began to discover your real talents it occurred to you that there was bigger game out there so you went after lake and annette and emile dandridgeвђќ вђњi knew about their silly little mistakes of courseвђќ miss amberton said with a modest shrug вђњitвђs simply amazing how much you can find out if you have an inquiring mind and are determined to learn about peopleвђs pasts but after a while even that game lost its challenge soвђвђќ вђњso you decided to test yourself against meвђќ nancy said looking out into the night вђњeven at the risk of getting caughtвђќ ashley stood up вђњwho else is worthy of my efforts your reputation your skillвђќ she smiled a little вђњalthough i must admit that your friend george did tax my physical capabilities to their limit itвђs a good thing iвђve been working out at the gym for the past year i could never have managed to carry her otherwiseвђќ her smile deepened into a laugh and she opened the top desk drawer вђњas for getting caught wellвђyou may have won this round nancy drew but you havenвђt won the gameвђќ she reached into the drawer of her desk and pulled out a gun ms amberton stepped closer to nancy her eyes glittering вђњand youвђre not going to eitherвђќ nancyвђs eyes widened at the sight of the gun вђњyouвђyou wouldnвђtвђќ she said in a whisper вђњitвђs a miracle that you survived the helicopter crashвђќ ms amberton said her lips taut вђњbut no miracle can help you escape a fifteenstory fallвђќ she shoved the gun into nancyвђs stomach вђњour little game is over nancy drew and iвђve won now get out on that balconyвђќ a loud shout rang through the office as ned burst in through the balcony doors ashley amberton half turned her attention distracted and nancy aimed a hard quick karate chop at her extended forearm with a moan she dropped the gun and grabbed her arm nancy scooped up the gun and pointed it at her вђњitвђs brokenвђќ ms amberton groaned in agony вђњyouвђve broken my armвђќ at the same moment george rushed through the office door with annette lebeau a cameraman and two burly policemen right behind her вђњyou see ashleyвђќ nancy remarked pleasantly вђњthe gameвђs never over until the final moveвђќ while the lights blazed and the camera whirred the police arrested ashley amberton her eyes glazed with pain and defeat as they led her out the door annette followed close behind holding a microphone over ms ambertonвђs shoulder and firing rapid questions at her as they went down the hall вђњwhewвђќ nancy said collapsing onto the plush sofa вђњiвђm glad thatвђs overвђќ she looked at ned вђњthanks for being on time with your cueвђќ she said вђњi would have hated to take a swan dive off that balconyвђќ ned laughed вђњi felt a little queasy at the idea of crawling out that window in the next office and onto a balcony fifteen stories upвђќ he admitted вђњbut it all worked outвђќ вђњand i was a little worried that annette wouldnвђt arrive with the police in time for ms ambertonвђs confessionвђќ george said вђњbut we heard every word of it and annette had the mike going too so iвђm sure itвђs on tapeвђќ she laughed вђњannette has even thought of a title for her storyвђќ she said вђњreallyвђќ ned asked curiously вђњwhat is itвђќ вђњsheвђs calling it the other side of evilвђ вђќ george told him nancy stretched вђњhey thatвђs a neat title and iвђm glad she got the story maybe itвђll help make up for some of the misery sheвђs been throughвђќ she stretched and yawned вђњwell i guess we can wrap this one up gangвђќ вђњyeahвђќ george said вђњspeaking of a wrapupвђќвђshe hugged herselfвђвђњdo you suppose we could go back to the apartmentвђnow these running shorts are a little drafty besides iвђm dying for something to eat something like a sixteenounce steak and a bushel of french friesвђќ вђњtell you whatвђќ ned said pulling nancy off the sofa and putting his arm around her вђњafter george gets changed iвђll treat both you girls to a midnight snack how about itвђќ вђњsounds superвђќ nancy agreed she looked at the pile of ash that was all that was left of the picture ashley amberton had burned вђњ вђthe other side of evilвђ huh well i think we can close this case for goodвђќ вђњouiвђќ ned and george said together and then laughed
