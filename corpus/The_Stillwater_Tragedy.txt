 the stillwater tragedy by thomas bailey aldrich i it is close upon daybreak the great wall of pines and hemlocks that keep off the west wind from stillwater stretches black and indeterminate against the sky at intervals a dull metallic sound like the guttural twang of a violin string rises form the froginvested swamp skirting the highway suddenly the birds stir in their nests over there in the woodland and break into that wild jargoning chorus with which they herald the advent of a new day in the appleorchards and among the plumtrees of the few gardens in stillwater the wrens and the robins and the bluejays catch up the crystal crescendo and what a melodious racket they make of it with their fifes and flutes and flageolets the village lies in a trance like death possibly not a soul hears this music unless it is the watchers at the bedside of mr leonard tappleton the richest man in town who has lain dying these three days and cannot last until sunrise or perhaps some mother drowsily hushing her wakeful baby pauses a moment and listens vacantly to the birds singing but who else the hubbub suddenly ceases ceases as suddenly as it began and all is still again in the woodland but it is not so dark as before a faint glow of white light is discernible behind the ragged line of the treetops the deluge of the darkness is receding from the face of the earth as the mighty waters receded of old the roofs and tall factory chimneys of stillwater are slowly taking shape in the gloom is that a cemetery coming into view yonder with its ghostly architecture of obelisks and broken columns and huddled headstones no that is only slocums marble yard with the finished and unfinished work heaped up like snowdrifts a cemetery in embryo here and there in an outlying farm a lantern glimmers in the barnyard the cattle are having their fodder betimes scarletcapped chanticleer gets himself on the nearest railfence and lifts up his rancorous voice like some irate old cardinal launching the curse of rome something crawls swiftly along the gray of the serpentine turnpike a cart with the driver lashing a jaded horse a quick wind goes shivering by and is lost in the forest now a narrow strip of twocolored gold stretches along the horizon stillwater is gradually coming to its senses the sun has begun to twinkle on the gilt cross of the catholic chapel and make itself known to the doves in the stone belfry of the south church the patches of cobweb that here and there cling tremulously to the coarse grass of the inundated meadows have turned into silver nets and the millpond it will be steelblue later is as smooth and white as if it had been paved with one vast unbroken slab out of slocums marble yard through a row of buttonwoods on the northern skirt of the village is seen a square lapstreaked building painted a disagreeable brown and surrounded on three sides by a platform one of seven or eight similar stations strung like indian heads on a branch thread of the great sagamore railway listen that is the jingle of the bells on the bakers cart as it begins its rounds from innumerable chimneys the curdled smoke gives evidence that the thrifty housewife or what is rarer in stillwater the hired girl has lighted the kitchen fire the chimneystack of one house at the end of a small court the last house on the easterly edge of the village and standing quite alone sends up no smoke yet the carefully trained ivy over the porch and the lemon verbena in a tub at the foot of the steps intimate that the place is not unoccupied moreover the little schooner which acts as weathercock on one of the gables and is now heading due west has a new topsail it is a storyandahalf cottage with a large expanse of roof which covered with porous unpainted shingles seems to repel the sunshine that now strikes full upon it the upper and lower blinds on the main building as well as those on the extensions are tightly closed the sun appears to beat in vain at the casements of this silent house which has a curiously sullen and defiant air as if it had desperately and successfully barricaded itself against the approach of morning yet if one were standing in the room that leads from the bedchamber on the groundfloor the room with the latticed window one would see a ray of light thrust through a chink of the shutters and pointing like a human finger at an object which lies by the hearth this finger gleaming motionless and awful in its precision points to the body of old mr lemuel shackford who lies there dead in his nightdress with a gash across his forehead in the darkness of that summer night a deed darker than the night itself had been done in stillwater ii that morning when michael hennesseys girl mary a girl sixteen years old carried the can of milk to the rear door of the silent house she was nearly a quarter of hour later than usual and looked forward to being soundly rated hes up and been waiting for it she said to herself observing the scullery door ajar wont i ketch it its him for growling and snapping at a body and its me for always being before or behind time bad luck to me theres no plazing him mary pushed back the door and passed through the kitchen serving herself all the while to meet the objurgations which she supposed were lying in wait for her the sunshine was blinding without but sifted through the green jalousies it made a gray crepuscular light within as the girl approached the table on which a plate with knife and fork had been laid for breakfast she noticed somewhat indistinctly at first a thin red line running obliquely across the floor from the direction of the sittingroom and ending near the stove where it had formed a small pool mary stopped short scarcely conscious why and peered instinctively into the adjoining apartment then with a smothered cry she let fall the milkcan and a dozen white rivulets in strange contrast to that one dark red line which first startled her went meandering over the kitchen floor with her eyes riveted upon some object in the next room the girl retreated backward slowly and heavily dragging one foot after the other until she reached the gallery door then she turned swiftly and plunged into the street twenty minutes later every man woman and child in stillwater knew that old mr shackford had been murdered mary hennessey had to tell her story a hundred times during the morning for each minute brought to michaels tenement a fresh listener hungry for the details at first hand how was it molly tell a body dear dont be asking me cried molly pressing her palms to her eyes as if to shut out the sight but taking all the while a secret creepy satisfaction in living the scene over again it was kinder dark in the other room and there he was laying in his nightgownd with his face turned towards me so looking mighty severelike jest as if he was agoing to say its late with the milk ye are ye hussy a way he had of spaking but he didnt spake molly darlin niver a word he was stone dead dont you see it was that still you could hear me heart beat saving there wasnt a drop of beat in it i let go the can sure and then i backed out with me eye on im all the while afeard to death that he would up and spake them words the pore child for the likes of her to be wakin up a murthered man in the mornin there was little or no work done that day in stillwater outside the mills and they were not running full handed a number of men from the miantowona iron works and slocums yard slocum employed some seventy or eighty hands lounged about the streets in their blouses or stood in knots in front of the tavern smoking short clay pipes not an urchin put in an appearance at the small red brick building on the turnpike mr pinkham the schoolmaster waited an hour for the recusants then turned the key in the lock and went home draggedlooking women with dishcloth or dustpan in hand stood in doorways or leaned from windows talking in subdued voices with neighbors on the curbstone in a hundred faraway cities the news of the suburban tragedy had already been read and forgotten but here the horror stayed there was a constantly changing crowd gathered in front of the house in welchs court an inquest was being held in the room adjoining the kitchen the court which ended at the gate of the cottage was fringed for several yards on each side by rows of squalid wondering children who understood it that coroner whidden was literally to sit on the dead body mr whidden a limp inoffensive little man who would not have dared to sit down on a fly he had passed pallid and perspiring to the scene of his perfunctory duties the result of the investigation was awaited with feverish impatience by the people outside mr shackford had not been a popular man he had been a hard avaricious passionate man holding his own way remorselessly he had been the reverse of popular but he had long been a prominent character in stillwater because of his wealth his endless lawsuits and his eccentricity an illustration of which was his persistence in living entirely alone in the isolated and dreary old house that was henceforth to be inhabited by his shadow not his shadow alone however for it was now remembered that the premises were already held in fee by another phantasmal tenant at a period long anterior to this one lydia sloper a widow had died an unexplained death under that same roof the coincidence struck deeply into the imaginative portion of stillwater the widow sloper and old shackford have made a match of it remarked a local humorist in a grimmer vain than customary two ghosts had now set up housekeeping as it were in the stricken mansion and what might not be looked for in the way of spectral progeny it appeared to the crowd in the lane that the jury were unconscionably long in arriving at a decision and when the decision was at length reached it gave but moderate satisfaction after a spendthrift waste of judicial mind the jury had decided that the death of lemuel shackford was caused by a blow on the left temple inflicted with some instrument not discoverable in the hands of some person or persons unknown we knew that before grumbled a voice in the crowd when to relieve public suspense lawyer perkins a long lank man with stringy black hair announced the verdict from the doorstep the theory of suicide had obtained momentary credence early in the morning and one or two still clung to it with the tenacity that characterizes persons who entertain few ideas to accept this theory it was necessary to believe that mr shackford had ingeniously hidden the weapon after striking himself dead with a single blow no it was not suicide so far from intending to take his own life mr shackford it appeared had made rather careful preparations to live that day the breakfasttable had been laid over night the coals left ready for kindling in the franklin stove and a kettle filled with water to be heated for his tea or coffee stood on the hearth two facts had sharply demonstrated themselves first that mr shackford had been murdered and second that the spur to the crime had been the possession of a sum of money which the deceased was supposed to keep in a strongbox in his bedroom the padlock had been wrenched open and the less valuable contents of the chest chiefly papers scattered over the carpet a memorandum among the papers seemed to specify the respective sums in notes and gold that had been deposited in the box a document of some kind had been torn into minute pieces and thrown into the wastebasket on close scrutiny a word or two here and there revealed the fact that the document was of a legal character the fragments were put into an envelope and given in charge of mr shackfords lawyer who placed seals on that and on the drawers of an escritoire which stood in the corner and contained other manuscript the instrument with which the fatal blow had been dealt for the autopsy showed that there had been but one blow was not only not discoverable but the fashion of it defied conjecture the shape of the wound did not indicate the use of any implement known to the jurors several of whom were skilled machinists the wound was an inch and three quarters in length and very deep at the extremities in the middle in scarcely penetrated to the cranium so peculiar a cut could not have been produced with the claw part of a hammer because the claw is always curved and the incision was straight a flat claw such as is used in opening packingcases was suggested a collection of the several sizes manufactured was procured but none corresponded with the wound they were either too wide or too narrow moreover the cut was as thin as the blade of a caseknife that was never done by any tool in these parts declared stevens the foreman of the finishing shop at slocums the assassin or assassins had entered by the scullery door the simple fastening of which a hook and staple had been broken there were footprints in the soft clay path leading from the side gate to the stone step but mary hennessey had so confused and obliterated the outlines that now it was impossible accurately to measure them a halfburned match was found under the sink evidently thrown there by the burglars it was of a kind known as the safetymatch which can be ignited only by friction on a strip of chemically prepared paper glued to the box as no box of this description was discovered and as all the other matches in the house were of a different make the charred splinter was preserved the most minute examination failed to show more than this the last time mr shackford had been seen alive was at six oclock the previous evening who had done the deed tramps answered stillwater with one voice though stillwater lay somewhat out of the natural highway and the tramp that bitter blossom of civilization whose seed was blown to us from over seas was not then so common by the new england roadsides as he became five or six years later but it was intolerable not to have a theory it was that or none for conjecture turned to no one in the village to be sure mr shackford had been in litigation with several of the corporations and had had legal quarrels with more than one of his neighbors but mr shackford had never been victorious in any of these contests and the incentive of revenge was wanting to explain the crime besides it was so clearly robbery though the gathering around the shackford house had reduced itself to half a dozen idlers and the less frequented streets had resumed their normal aspect of dullness there was a strange electric quality in the atmosphere the community was in that state of suppressed agitation and suspicion which no word adequately describes the slightest circumstance would have swayed it to the belief in any mans guilt and indeed there were men in stillwater quite capable of disposing of a fellowcreature for a much smaller reward than mr shackford had held out in spite of the tramp theory a harmless tinpeddler who had not passed through the place for weeks was dragged from his glittering cart that afternoon as he drove smilingly into town and would have been roughly handled if mr richard shackford a cousin of the deceased had not interfered as the day wore on the excitement deepened in intensity though the expression of it became nearly reticent it was noticed that the lamps throughout the village were lighted an hour earlier than usual a sense of insecurity settled upon stillwater with the falling twilight that nameless apprehension which is possibly more trying to the nerves than tangible danger when a man is smitten inexplicably as if by a bodiless hand stretched out of a cloud when the red slayer vanishes like a mist and leaves no faintest trace of his identity the mystery shrouding the deed presently becomes more appalling than the deed itself there is something paralyzing in the thought of an invisible hand somewhere ready to strike at your life or at some life dearer than your own whose hand and where is it perhaps it passes you your coffee at breakfast perhaps you have hired it to shovel the snow off your sidewalk perhaps it has brushed against you in the crowd or may be you have dropped a coin into the fearful palm at a street corner ah the terrible unseen hand that stabs your imagination this immortal part of you which is a hundred times more sensitive than your poor perishable body in the midst of situations the most solemn and tragic there often falls a light purely farcical in its incongruity such a gleam was unconsciously projected upon the present crisis by mr bodge better known in the village as father bodge mr bodge was stone deaf naturally stupid and had been nearly moribund for thirty years with asthma just before nightfall he had crawled in his bewildered wheezy fashion down to the tavern where he found a somber crowd in the barroom mr bodge ordered his mug of beer and sat sipping it glancing meditatively from time to time over the pewter rim at the mute assembly suddenly he broke out spose youve heerd that old shackfords ben murdered so the sun went down on stillwater again the great wall of pines and hemlocks made a gloom against the sky the moon rose from behind the treetops frosting their ragged edges and then sweeping up to the zenith hung serenely above the world as if there were never a crime or a tear or a heartbreak in it all iii on the afternoon of the following day mr shackford was duly buried the funeral under the direction of mr richard shackford who acted as chief mourner and was sole mourner by right of kinship took place in profound silence the carpenters who had lost a day on bishops new stables intermitted their sawing and hammering while the services were in progress the steam was shut off in the ironmills and no clinking of the chisel was heard in the marble yard for an hour during which many of the shops had their shutters up then when all was over the imprisoned fiend in the boilers gave a piercing shriek the leather bands slipped on the revolving drums the spindles leaped into life again and the old order of things was reinstated outwardly but not in effect in general when the grave closes over a man his career is ended but mr shackford was never so much alive as after they had buried him never before had he filled so large a place in the public eye though invisible he sat at every fireside until the manner of his death had been made clear his ubiquitous presence was not to be exorcised on the morning of the memorable day a reward of one hundred dollars afterwards increased to five hundred at the insistence of mr shackfords cousin had been offered by the board of selectmen for the arrest and conviction of the guilty party beyond this and the unsatisfactory inquest the authorities had done nothing and were plainly not equal to the situation when it was stated the night of the funeral that a professional person was coming to stillwater to look into the case the announcement was received with a breath of relief the person thus vaguely described appeared on the spot the next morning to mention the name of edward taggett is to mention a name well known to the detective force of the great city lying sixty miles southwest of stillwater mr taggetts arrival sent such a thrill of expectancy through the village that mr leonard tappleton whose obsequies occurred this day made his exit nearly unobserved yet there was little in mr taggetts physical aspect calculated to stir either expectation or enthusiasm a slender man of about twentysix but not looking it with overhanging brown mustache sparse sidewhiskers eyes of no definite color and faintly accentuated eyebrows he spoke precisely and with a certain unembarrassed hesitation as persons do who have two thoughts to one word if there are such persons you might have taken him for a physician or a journalist or the secretary of an insurance company but you would never have supposed him the man who had disentangled the complicated threads of the great barnabee bank defalcation stillwaters confidence which had risen into the nineties fell to zero at sight of him is that taggett they asked that was taggett and presently his influence began to be felt like a seaturn the three dogberrys of the watch were dispatched on secret missions and within an hour it was ferreted out that a man in a cart had been seen driving furiously up the turnpike the morning after the murder this was an agricultural district the road led to a market town and teams going by in the early dawn were the rule and not the exception but on that especial morning a furiously driven cart was significant jonathan beers who farmed the jenks land had heard the wheels and caught an indistinct glimpse of the vehicle as he was feeding the cattle but with a reticence purely rustic had not been moved to mention the circumstance before taggett has got a clew said stillwater under its breath by noon taggett had got the man cart and all but it was only bluftons son tom of south millville who had started in hot haste that particular morning to secure medical service for his wife of which she had sorely stood in need as two tiny girls in a willow cradle in south millville now bore testimony i havent been cutting down the population much said blufton with his wholesome laugh thomas blufton was well known and esteemed in stillwater but if the crime had fastened itself upon him it would have given something like popular satisfaction in the course of the ensuing fortyeight hours four or five tramps were overhauled as having been in the neighborhood at the time of the tragedy but they each had a clean story and were let go then one durgin a workman at slocums yard was called upon to explain some halfwashedout red stains on his overalls which he did he had tightened the hoops on a saltpork barrel for mr shackford several days previous the red paint on the head of the barrel was fresh and had come off on his clothes dr weld examined the spots under a microscope and pronounced them paint it was manifest that mr taggett meant to go to the bottom of things the barroom of the stillwater hotel was a center of interest these nights not only the barroom proper but the adjoining apartment where the more exclusive guests took their seltzerwater and looked over the metropolitan newspapers twice a week a social club met here having among its members mr craggie the postmaster who was supposed to have a great political future mr pinkham lawyer perkins mr whidden and other respectable persons the room was at all times in some sense private with a separate entrance from the street though another door which usually stood open connected it with the main salon in this was a long mahogany counter one section of which was covered with a sheet of zinc perforated like a sieve and kept constantly bright by restless caravans of lagerbeer glasses directly behind that end of the counter stood a gothic brassmounted beerpump at whose faucets mr snelling the landlord flooded you five or six mugs in the twinkling of an eye and raised the vague expectation that he was about to grind out some popular operatic air at the left of the pump stretched a narrow mirror reflecting he gailycolored wineglasses and decanters which stood on each others shoulders and held up lemons and performed various acrobatic feats on a shelf in front of it the fourth night after the funeral of mr shackford a dismal southeast storm caused an unusual influx of idlers in both rooms with the rain splashing against the casements and the wind slamming the blinds the respective groups sat discussing in a desultory way the only topic which could be discussed at present there had been a general strike among the workmen a fortnight before but even that had grown cold as a topic that was hard on tom blufton said stevens emptying the ashes out of his longstemmed clay pipe and refilling the bowl with cut cavendish from a jar on a shelf over his head michael hennessey sat down his beermug with an air of argumentative disgust and drew one sleeve across his glistening beard stevens youve as many minds as a weathercock jist didnt ye say yerself it looked mighty black for the lad when he was took i might have said something of the sort stevens admitted reluctantly after a pause his driving round at daybreak with an empty cart did have an ugly look at first indade then not to anybody who knew tom blufton interrupted samuel piggott bluftons brotherinlaw the boy hasnt a bad streak in him it was an outrage might as well have suspected parson langly or father omeara if this kind of thing goes on remarked a man in the corner with a patch over one eye both of them reverend gents will be hauled up i shouldnt wonder thats so mr peters responded durgin if my respectability didnt save me whos safe durgin is talking about his respectability hes joking look here dexter said durgin turning quickly on the speaker when i want to joke i talk about your intelligence what kind of man is taggett anyhow asked piggott you saw him durgin i believe he was at justice beemiss office the day blufton and i was there but i didnt make him out in the crowd shouldnt know him from adam stillwaters a healthy place for tramps jest about this time suggested somebody three on em snaked in today i think gentlemen that mr taggett is on the right track there observed mr snelling in the act of mixing another old holland for mr peters not too sweet you said i feel it in my bones that it was a tramp and that mr taggett will bring him yet he wont find him on the highway yonder said a tall swarthy man named torrini an italian nationalities clash in stillwater that tramp is a thousand miles from here so he is if he has any brains under his hat returned snelling but theyre on the lookout for him the minute he pawns anything hes gone cant put up greenbacks or gold can he he didnt take nothing else interposed bishop the veterinary surgeon now jewelry nor nothing there wasnt none as i understand it said bishop except a silver watch that was all snug under the old mans piller wanter know ejaculated jonathan beers i opine mr craggie said the schoolmaster standing in the inner room with a rolledup file of the daily advertiser in his hand that the person who who removed our worthy townsman will never be discovered i shouldnt like to go quite so far as that sir answered mr craggie with that diplomatic suavity which leads to postmasterships and seats in the general court and has even been known to oil a dull fellows way into congress i cannot take quite so hopeless a view of it there are difficulties but they must be overcome mr pinkham and i think they will be indeed i hope so returned the schoolmaster but there are cases are there not in which the the problem if i may so designate it has never been elucidated and the persons who undertook it have been obliged to go to the foot so to speak ah yes there are such cases certainly there was the burdell mystery in new york and later the nathan affair by the way ive satisfactory theories of my own touching both the police were baffled and remain so but my dear sir observe for a moment the difference mr pinkham rested one finger on the edge of a little round table and leaned forward in a respectful attitude to observe the difference those crimes were committed in a vast metropolis affording a thousand chances for escape as well as offering a thousand temptations to the lawless but we are a limited community we have no professional murderers among us the deed which has stirred society to its utmost depths was plainly done by some wayfaring amateur remorse has already arrived upon him if the police havent for the time being he escapes but he is bound to betray himself sooner or later if the right steps are taken and i have myself the greatest confidence in mr taggett the guilty party can scarcely fail to be brought to the bar of justice if he doesnt bring himself there indeed indeed i hope so repeated mr pinkham the investigation is being carried on very closely too closely suggested the schoolmaster oh dear no murmured mr craggie the strictest secrecy is necessary in affairs of this delicate nature if tom dick and harry were taken behind the scenes he added with the air of one wishing to say too much the bottom would drop out of everything mr pinkham shrunk from commenting on a disaster like that and relapsed into silence mr craggie with his thumbs in the armholes of his waistcoat and his legs crossed in an easy senatorial fashion leaned back in the chair and smiled blandly i dont suppose theres nothing new boys exclaimed a fat florid man bustling in goodnaturedly at the public entrance and leaving a straight wet trail on the sanded floor from the threshold to the polished mahogany counter mr wilson was a local humorist of the falstaffian stripe though not so much witty in himself as the cause of wit in others no jimmy there isnt anything new responded dexter i suppose you didnt hear that the ole man done somethin handsome for me in his last will and testyment no jemmy i dont think he has made any provision whatever for an almshouse sorry to hear that dexter said willson absorbedly chasing a bit of lemon peel in his glass with the spoon handle for there isnt room for us all up at the townfarm hows your grandmother finds it tolrably comfortable they are a primitive candid people in their hours of unlaced social intercourse in stillwater this delicate tu quoque was so far from wounding dexter that he replied carelessly well only so so the old woman complains of too much chickensallid and hothouse grapes all the year round mr shackford must have left a large property observed mr ward of the firm of ward lock glancing up from the columns of the stillwater gazette the remark was addressed to lawyer perkins who had just joined the group in the readingroom fairly large replied that gentleman crisply any public bequests none to speak of mr craggie smiled vaguely you see said lawyer perkins theres a will and no will that is to say the fragments of what is supposed to be a will were found and we are trying to put the pieces together it is doubtful if we can do it it is doubtful if we can decipher it after we have done it and if we decipher it it is a question whether the document is valid or not that is a masterly exposition of the dilemma mr perkins said the schoolmaster warmly mr perkins had spoken in his courtroom tone of voice with one hand thrust into his frilled shirtbosom he removed this hand for a second as he gravely bowed to mr pinkham nothing could be clearer said mr ward in case the paper is worthless what then i am not asking you in your professional capacity he added hastily for lawyer perkins had been known to send in a bill on as slight a provocation as mr wards thats a point the next of kin has his claims my friend shackford of course broke in mr craggie admirable young man one of my warmest supporters he is the only heir at law so far as we know said mr perkins oh said mr craggie reflecting the late mr shackford might have had a family in timbuctoo or the sandwich islands thats another point the fact would be a deuced unpleasant point for young shackford to run against said mr ward exactly if mr lemuel shackford remarked coroner whidden softly joining the conversation to which he had been listening in his timorous apologetic manner had chanced in the course of his early seafaring days to form any ties of an unhappy complexion complexion is good murmured mr craggie some hawaiian lady perhaps that would be a branch of the case worth investigating in connection with the homicide a discarded wife or a disowned son burning with a sense of wrong really mr whidden interrupted lawyer perkins witheringly it is bad enough for my client to lose his life without having his reputation filched away from him i i will explain i was merely supposing the law never supposes sir this threw mr whidden into great mental confusion as coroner was he not an integral part of the law and when in his official character he supposed anything was not that a legal supposition but was he in his official character now sitting with a glass of lemonade at his elbow in the readingroom of the stillwater hotel was he or was he not a coroner all the time mr whidden stroked an isolated tuft of hair growing low on the middle of his forehead and glared mildly at mr perkins young shackford has gone to new york i understand said mr ward breaking the silence mr perkins nodded went this morning to look after the realestate interests there it will probably keep him a couple of weeks the longer the better he was of no use here lemuels death was a great shock to him or rather the manner of it was that shocked every one they were first cousins werent they mr ward was a comparatively new resident in stillwater first cousins replied lawyer perkins but they were never very intimate you know i imagine nobody was ever very intimate with mr shackford my client was somewhat peculiar in his friendships this was stating it charitably for mr perkins knew and every one present knew that lemuel shackford had not had the shadow of a friend in stillwater unless it was his cousin richard a cloud of mist and rain was blown into the barroom as the street door stood open for a second to admit a dripping figure from the outside darkness whats blowed down asked durgin turning round on his stool and sending up a ring of smoke which uncurled itself with difficulty in the dense atmosphere its only some of jeff staverss nonsense no nonsense at all said the newcomer as he shook the heavy beads of rain from his felt hat i was passing by welchs court its as black as pitch out fellows when slap went something against my shoulder something like wet wings well i was scared its a bat says i but the thing didnt fly off it was still clawing at my shoulder i put up my hand and ill be shot if it wasnt the foremast jibsheet and all of the old weathercock on the north gable of the shackford house here you are and the speaker tossed the broken mast with the mimic sails dangling from it into durgins lap a dead silence followed for there was felt to be something weirdly significant in the incident thats kinder omernous said mr peters interrogatively ominous of what asked durgin lifting the wet mass from his knees and dropping it on the floor well sorter queer then where does the queer come in inquired stevens gravelly i dont know but im hit by it come boys dont crowd a feller said mr peters getting restive i dont take the contract to explain the thing but it does seem some way droll that the old schooner should be wrecked so soon after what has happened to the old skipper if you dont see it or sense it i dont insist whats yours denyven the person addressed as denyven promptly replied with a fine sonorous english accent a mug of alf an alf with a head on it snelling at the same moment mr craggie in the inner room was saying to the schoolmaster i must really take issue with you there mr pinkham i admit theres a good deal in spiritualism which we havent got at yet the science is in its infancy it is still attached to the bosom of speculation it is a beautiful science that of psychological phenomena and the spiritualists will yet become an influential class of mr craggie was going to say voters but glided over it persons i believe in clairvoyance myself to a large extent before my appointment to the postoffice i had it very strong ive no doubt that in the far future this mysterious factor will be made great use of in criminal cases but at present i should resort to it only in the last extremity the very last extremity mr pinkham oh of course said the schoolmaster deprecatingly i threw it out only as the merest suggestion i shouldnt think of of you understand me is it beyond the dreams of probability said mr craggie appealing to lawyer perkins that clairvoyants may eventually be introduced into cases in our courts they are now said mr perkins with a snort the police bring em it mr craggie finished the remainder of his glass of sherry in silence and presently rose to go coroner whidden and mr ward had already gone the guests in the public room were thinning out a gloom indefinable and shapeless like the night seemed to have fallen upon the few that lingered at a somewhat earlier hour than usual the gas was shut off in the stillwater hotel in the lonely house in welchs court a light was still burning iv a sorely perplexed man sat there bending over his papers by the lamplight mr taggett had established himself at the shackford house on his arrival preferring it to the hotel where he would have been subjected to the curiosity of the guests and to endless annoyances up to this moment perhaps not a dozen persons in the place had had more than a passing glimpse of him he was a very busy man working at his desk from morning until night and then taking only a brief walk for exercise in some unfrequented street his meals were sent in from the hotel to the shackford house where the constables reported to him and where he held protracted conferences with justice beemis coroner whidden lawyer perkins and a few others and declined to be interviewed by the local editor to the outside eye that weatherstained faded old house appeared a throbbing seat of esoteric intelligence it was as if a hundred invisible magnetic threads converged to a focus under that roof and incessantly clicked out the most startling information information which was never by any chance allowed to pass beyond the charmed circle the pile of letters which the mail brought to mr taggett every morning chiefly anonymous suggestions and offers of assistance from lunatics in remote cities was enough in itself to exasperate a community covertly at first and then openly stillwater began seriously to question mr taggetts method of working up the case the gazette in a doubleleaded leader went so far as to compare him to a bird with fine feathers and no song and to suggest that perhaps the bird might have sung if the inducement offered had been more substantial a singer of mr taggetts plumage was not to be taught by such chaff as five hundred dollars having killed his man the editor proceeded to remark that he would suspend judgment until next week as if to make perfect the bird comparison mr taggett after keeping the public in suspense for six days and nights abruptly flew away with all the little shreds and straws of evidence he had picked up to build his speculative nest elsewhere the defection of mr taggett caused a mild panic among a certain portion of the inhabitants who were not reassured by the statement in the gazette that the case would now be placed in the proper hands the hand so the county constabulary within a few days said the editor in conclusion the matter will undoubtedly be cleared up at present we cannot say more and it would have puzzled him very much to do so a week passed and no fresh light was thrown upon the catastrophe nor did anything occur to rattle the usual surface of life in the village a man it was torrini the italian got hurt in danas iron foundry one of bluftons twin girls died and mr slocum took on a new hand from out of town that was all stillwater was the stillwater of a year ago with always the exception of that shadow lying upon it and the fact that small boys who had kindling to get in were careful to get it in before nightfall it would appear that the late mr shackford had acquired a habit of lingering around woodpiles after dark and also of stealing into bedchambers where little children were obliged to draw the sheets over their heads in order not to see him the action of the county constabulary had proved quite as mysterious and quite as barren of result as mr taggetts had been they had worn his mantle of secrecy and arrested the tramps over again another week dragged by and the editorial prediction seemed as far as ever from fulfillment but on the afternoon which closed that fortnight a very singular thing did happen mr slocum was sitting alone in his office which occupied the whole of a small building at the right of the main gate to the marble works when the door behind him softly opened and a young man whose dress covered with stonedust indicated his vocation appeared on the threshold he hesitated a second and then stepped into the room mr slocum turned round with a swift apprehensive air you gave me a start i believe i havent any nerves left well mr slocum i have found the man the proprietor of the marble yard half rose from the desk in his agitation who is it he asked beneath his breath the same doubt or irresolution which had checked the workman at the threshold seemed again to have taken possession of him it was fully a moment before he gained the mastery over himself but the mastery was complete for he leaned forward gravely almost coldly and pronounced two words a quick pallor overspread mr slocums features good god he exclaimed sinking back into the chair are you mad v the humblest painter of real life if he could have his desire would select a picturesque background for his figures but events have an inexorable fashion for choosing their own landscape in the present instance it is reluctantly conceded that there are few uglier or more commonplace towns in new england than stillwater a straggling overgrown village with whose rural aspects are curiously blended something of the grimness and squalor of certain shabby city neighborhoods being of comparatively recent date the place has none of those colonial associations which like sprigs of lavender in an old chest of drawers are a saving grace to other quite as dreary nooks and corners here and there at what is termed the west end is a neat brick mansion with garden attached where nature asserts herself in dahlias and chinaasters but the houses are mostly frame houses that have taken a prevailing dingy tint from the breath of the tall chimneys which dominate the village the sidewalks in the more aristocratic quarter are covered with a thin elastic paste of asphalt worn down to the gravel in patches and emitting in the heat of the day an astringent bituminous odor the population is chiefly of the rougher sort such as breeds in the shadow of foundries and factories and if the protestant pastor and the fatherly catholic priest whose respective lots are cast there have sometimes the sense of being missionaries dropped in the midst of a purely savage community the delusion is not wholly unreasonable the irregular heaps of scoria that have accumulated in the vicinity of the iron works give the place an illusive air of antiquity bit it is neither ancient nor picturesque the oldest and most pictorial thing in stillwater is probably the marble yard around three sides of which the village may be said to have sprouted up rankly bearing here and there an industrial blossom in the shape of an ironmill or a cardiganjacket manufactory rowland slocum a man of considerable refinement great kindness of heart and no force inherited the yard from his father and a the period this narrative opens the summer of was its sole proprietor and nominal manager the actual manager being richard shackford a prospective partner in the business and the betrothed of mr slocums daughter margaret forty years ago every tenth person in stillwater was either a shackford or a slocum twenty years later both names were nearly extinct there that fatality which seems to attend certain new england families had stripped every leaf but two from the shackford branch these were lemuel shackford then about fortysix and richard shackford aged four lemuel shackford had laid up a competency as shipmaster in the new york and calcutta trade and in had returned to his native village where he found his name and stock represented only by little dick a very cheerful orphan who stared complacently with big blue eyes at fate and made mudpies in the lane whenever he could elude the vigilance of the kindly old woman who had taken him under her roof this atom of humanity by some strange miscalculation of nature was his cousin the strict devotion to his personal interests which had enabled mr shackford to acquire a fortune thus early caused him to look askance at a penniless young kinsman with stockings down at heel and a straw hat three sizes too large for him set on the back of his head but mr shackford was ashamed to leave little dick a burden upon the hands of a poor woman of no relationship whatever to the child so little dick was transferred to that dejected house which has already been described and was then known as the sloper house here for three of four years dick grew up as neglected as a weed and every inch as happy it should be mentioned that for the first year or so a shockheaded cicely from the townfarm had apparently been hired not to take care of him but dick asked nothing better than to be left to his own devices which moreover were innocent enough he would sit all day in the lane at the front gate pottering with a bit of twig or a caseknife in the soft clay from time to time passersby observed that the child was not making mudpies but tracing figures comic or grotesque as might happen and always quite wonderful for their lack of resemblance to anything human that patch of reddishbrown clay was his sole resource his slate his drawingbook and woe to anybody who chanced to walk over little dicks arabesques patient and gentle in his acceptance of the worlds rebuffs this he would not endure he was afraid of mr shackford yet one day when the preoccupied man happened to trample on a newly executed hieroglyphic the child rose to his feet white with rage his fingers clenched and such a blue fire flashing in the eyes that mr shackford drew back aghast why its a little devil while shackford junior was amusing himself with his primitive basreliefs shackford senior amused himself with his lawsuits from the hour when he returned to the town until the end of his days mr shackford was up to his neck in legal difficulties now he resisted a betterment assessment and fought the town now he secured an injunction on the miantowona iron works and fought the corporation he was understood to have a perpetual case in equity before the marine court in new york to which city he made frequent and unannounced journeys his immediate neighbors stood in terror of him he was like a duelist on the alert to twist the slightest thing into a casus belli the law was his rapier his recreation and he was willing to bleed for it meanwhile that fairy world of which every baby becomes a columbus so soon as it is able to walk remained an undiscovered continent to little dick grim life looked in upon him as he lay in the cradle the common joys of childhood were a sealed volume to him a single incident of those years lights up the whole situation a vague rumor had been blown to dick of a practice of hanging up stockings at christmas it struck his materialistic mind as a rather senseless thing to do but nevertheless he resolved to try it one christmas eve he lay awake a long while in the frosty darkness skeptically waiting for something remarkable to happen once he crawled out of the cotbed and groped his way to the chimney place the next morning he was scarcely disappointed at finding nothing in the piteous little stocking except the original holes the years that stole silently over the heads of the old man and the young child in welchs court brought a period of wild prosperity to stillwater the breath of war blew the forges to a white heat and the baffling problem of the mediжval alchemists was solved the baser metals were transmuted into gold a disastrous prosperous time with the air rent periodically by the cries of newsboys as battles were fought and by the roll of the drum in the busy streets as fresh recruits were wanted glory and death to the southward and at the north pale women in black all which interested dick mighty little after he had learned to read at the district school he escaped into another world two lights were now generally seen burning of a night in the shackford house one on the groundfloor where mr shackford sat mouthing his contracts and mortgages and weaving his webs like a great lean gray spider and the other in the north gable where dick hung over a tattered copy of robinson crusoe by the flicker of the candleends which he had captured during the day little dick was little dick no more a tall heavily built blond boy with a quiet sweet disposition that at first offered temptations to the despots of the playground but a sudden flaring up once or twice of that unexpected spirit which had broken out in his babyhood brought him immunity from serious persecution the boys home life at this time would have seemed pathetic to an observer the more pathetic perhaps in that dick himself was not aware of its exceptional barrenness the holidays that bring new brightness to the eyes of happier children were to him simply days when he did not go to school and was expected to provide an extra quantity of kindling wood he was housed and fed and clothed after a fashion but not loved mr shackford did not illtreat the lad in the sense of beating him he merely neglected him every year the man became more absorbed in his law cases and his money which accumulated magically he dwelt in a cloud of calculations though all his interests attached him to the material world his dry attenuated body seemed scarcely a part of it shackford what are you going to do with that scapegrace of yours it was mr leonard tappleton who ventured the question few persons dared to interrogate mr shackford on his private affairs i am going to make a lawyer of him said mr shackford crackling his fingerjoints like stiff parchment you couldnt do better you ought to have an attorney in the family just so assented mr shackford dryly i could throw a bit of business in his way now and then eh you could make his fortune shackford i dont see but you might employ him all the time when he was not fighting the corporations you might keep him at it suing you for his fees very good very good indeed responded mr shackford with a smile in which his eyes took no share it was merely a momentary curling up of crisp wrinkles he did not usually smile at other peoples pleasantries but when a person worth three or four hundred thousand dollars condescends to indulge a joke it is not to be passed over like that of a poor relation yes yes muttered the old man as he stooped and picked up a pin adding it to a row of similarly acquired pins which gave the left lapel of his threadbare coat the appearance of a miniature harp i shall make a lawyer of him it had long been settled in mr shackfords mind that richard so soon as he had finished his studies should enter the lawoffice of blandmann sharpe a firm of rather sinister reputation in south millville at fourteen richards eyes had begun to open on the situation at fifteen he saw very clearly and one day without much preliminary formulating of his plan he decided on a step that had been taken by every male shackford as far back as tradition preserves the record of his family a friendship had sprung up between richard and one william durgin a schoolmate this durgin was a sallow brooding boy a year older than himself the two lads were antipodal in disposition intelligence and social standing for though richard went poorly clad the reflection of his cousins wealth gilded him durgin was the son of a washerwoman an intimacy between the two would perhaps have been unlikely but for one fact it was durgins mother who had given little dick a shelter at the period of his parents death though the circumstance did not lie within the pale of richards personal memory he acknowledged the debt by rather insisting on durgins friendship it was william durgin therefore who was elected to wait upon mr shackford on a certain morning which found that gentleman greatly disturbed by an unprecedented occurrence richard had slept out of the house the previous night durgin was the bearer of a note which mr shackford received in some astonishment and read deliberately blinking with weak eyes behind the glasses having torn off the blank page and laid it aside for his own more economical correspondence the rascal had actually used a whole sheet to write ten words mr shackford turned and with the absorbed air of a naturalist studying some abnormal bug gazed over the steel bow of his spectacles at durgin skit durgin hastily retreated theres a poor lawyer saved muttered the old man taking down his overcoat from a peg behind the door and snapping off a shred of lint on the collar with his lean forefinger then his face relaxed and an odd grin diffused a kind of wintry glow over it richard had run away to sea vi after a lapse of four years during which he had as completely vanished out of the memory of stillwater as if he had been lying all the while in the crowded family tomb behind the south church richard shackford reappeared one summer morning at the door of his cousins house in welchs court mr shackford was absent at the moment and mrs morganson an elderly deaf woman who came in for a few hours every day to do the housework was busy in the extension without announcing himself richard stalked upstairs to the chamber in the gable and went directly to a little shelf in one corner upon which lay the dogseared copy of robinson crusoe just as he had left it save the four years accumulation of dust richard took the book fiercely in both hands and with a single mighty tug tore it from top to bottom and threw the fragments into the fireplace a moment later on the way downstairs he encountered his kinsman ascending ah you have come back was mr shackfords grim greeting after a moments hesitation yes said richard with embarrassment though he had made up his mind not to be embarrassed by his cousin i cant say i was looking for you you might have dropped me a line you were politer when you left why do you come back and why did you go away demanded the old man with abrupt fierceness the last four years had bleached him and bent him and made him look very old i didnt like the idea of blandmann sharpe for one thing said richard and i thought i liked the sea and did you no sir i enjoyed seeing foreign parts and all that quite the young gentleman on his travels but the sea didnt agree with you and now you like the idea of blandmann sharpe not the least in the world i assure you cried richard i take to it as little as ever i did perhaps that is fortunate but its going to be rather difficult to suit your tastes what do you like i like you cousin lemuel you have always been kind to me in your way said poor richard yearning for a glimmer of human warmth and sympathy and forgetting all the dreariness of his uncaredfor childhood he had been out in the world and had found it even harderhearted than his own home which now he idealized in the first flush of returning to it again he saw himself a blondheaded little fellow with stocking down at heel climbing the steep staircase or digging in the clay at the front gate with the air full of the breath of lilacs that same penetrating perfume blown through the open halldoor as he spoke nearly brought the tears to his eyes he had looked forward for years to this coming back to stillwater many a time as he wandered along the streets of some foreign seaport the rich architecture and the bright costumes had faded out before him and given place to the fat gray belfry and slim red chimneys of the humble new england village where he was born he had learned to love it after losing it and now he had struggled back through countless trials and disasters to find no welcome cousin lemuel said richard gently only just us two are left and we ought to be good friends at least we are good enough friends mumbled mr shackford who could not evade taking the hand which richard had forlornly reached out to him but that neednt prevent us understanding each other like rational creatures i dont care for a great deal of fine sentiment in people who run away without so much as thank you i was all wrong thats what folks always say with the delusion that it makes everything all right surely it help to admit it that depends it generally doesnt what do you propose to do i hardly know at the moment my plans are quite in the air in the air repeated mr shackford i fancy that describes them your fathers plans were always in the air too and he never got any of them down i intend to get mine down have you saved by anything not a cent i thought as much i had a couple of hundred dollars in my seachest but i was shipwrecked and lost it i barely saved myself when robinson crusoe damn robinson crusoe snapped mr shackford thats what i say returned richard gravely when robinson crusoe was cast on an uninhabited island shrimps and softshell crabs and all sorts of delicious mollusks readily boiled ive no doubt crawled up on the beach and begged him to eat them but i nearly starved to death of course you will always be shipwrecked and always be starved to death you are one of that kind i dont believe you are a shackford at all when they were not anything else they were good sailors if you only had a drop of his blood in your veins and mr shackford waved his head towards a faded portrait of a youngish florid gentleman with banged hair and high coatcollar which hung against the wall halfway up the staircase this was the counterfeit presentment of lemuel shackfords father seated with his back at an open window through which was seen a ship under full canvas with the unionjack standing out straight in the wrong direction but what are you going to do for yourself you cant start a subscription paper and play with shipwrecked mariner you know no i hardly care to do that said richard with a goodnatured laugh though no poor devil ever had a better outfit for the character what are you calculated for richard was painfully conscious of his unfitness for many things but he felt there was nothing in life to which he was so ill adapted as his present position yet until he could look about him he must needs eat his kinsmans reluctant bread or starve the world was younger and more unsophisticated when manna dropped from the clouds mr shackford stood with his neck craned over the frayed edge of his satin stock and one hand resting indecisively on the banister and richard on the step above leaning his back against the blighted flowers of the wallpaper from an oval window at the head of the stairs the summer sunshine streamed upon them and illuminated the highshouldered clock which ensconced in an alcove seemed top be listening to the conversation theres no chance for you in the law said mr shackford after a long pause sharpes nephew has the berth a while ago i might have got you into the miantowona iron works but the rascally directors are trying to ruin me now theres the union store if they happen to want a clerk i suppose you would be about as handy behind a counter as a hippopotamus i have no business of my own to train you to you are not good for the sea and the sea has probably spoiled you for anything else a drop of salt water just poisons a landsman i am sure i dont know what to do with you dont bother yourself about it at all said richard cheerfully you are going back on the whole family ancestors and posterity by suggesting that i cant make my own living i only want a little time to take breath dont you see and a crust and a bed for a few days such as you might give any wayfarer meanwhile i will look after things around the place i fancy i was never an idler here since the day i learnt to split kindling theres your old bed in the north chamber said mr shackford wrinkling his forehead helplessly according to my notion it is not so good as a bunk or a hammock slung in a tidy forecastle but its at your service and mrs morganson i dare say can lay an extra plate at table with which gracious acceptance of richards proposition mr shackford resumed his way upstairs and the young man thoughtfully descended to the halldoor and thence into the street to take a general survey of the commercial capabilities of stillwater the outlook was not inspiring a machinist or a mechanic or a day laborer might have found a foothold a man without handicraft was not in request in stillwater what is your trade was the staggering question that met richard at the threshold he went from workshop to workshop confidently and cheerfully at first whistling softly between whiles but at every turn the question confronted him in some places where he was recognized with thinly veiled surprise as that boy of shackfords he was kindly put off in others he received only a stare or a brutal no by noon he had exhausted the leading shops and offices in the village and was so disheartened that he began to dread the thought of returning home to dinner clearly he was a superfluous person in stillwater a mortarsplashed hodcarrier who had seated himself on a pile of brick and was eating his noonday rations from a tin can just brought to him by a slatternly girl gave richard a spasm of envy here was a man who had found his place and was establishing what richard did not seem able to establish in his own case a right to exist at supper mr shackford refrained from examining richard on his days employment for which reserve or indifference the boy was grateful when the silent meal was over the old man went to his papers and richard withdrew to his room in the gable he had neglected to provide himself with a candle however there was nothing to read for in destroying robinson crusoe he had destroyed his entire library so he sat and brooded in the moonlight casting a look of disgust now and then at the mutilated volume on the hearth that lying romance it had been indirectly the cause of all his woe filling his boyish brain with visions of picturesque adventure and sending him off to sea where he had lost four precious years of his life if i had stuck to my studies reflected richard while undressing i might have made something of myself hes a great friend robinson crusoe richard fell asleep with as much bitterness in his bosom against defoes ingenious hero as if robinson had been a living person instead of a living fiction and out of this animosity grew a dream so fantastic and comical that richard awoke himself with a bewildered laugh just as the sunrise reddened the panes of the chamber window in this dream somebody came to richard and asked him if he had heard of that dreadful thing about young crusoe no confound him said richard what is it it has been ascertained said somebody who seemed to richard at once an intimate friend and an utter stranger it has been ascertained beyond a doubt that the man friday was not a man friday at all but a lightminded young princess from one of the neighboring islands who had fallen in love with robinson her real name was saturday why thats scandalous cried richard with heat think of the admiration and sympathy the world has been lavishing on this precious pair robinson crusoe and his girl saturday that puts a different face on it another great moral character exploded murmured the shadowy shape mixing itself up with the motes of a sunbeam and drifting out through the window then richard fell to laughing in his sleep and so awoke he was still confused with the dream as he sat on the edge of his bed pulling himself together in the broad daylight well he muttered at length i shouldnt wonder theres nothing too bad to be believed of that man vii richard made an early start that morning in search of employment and duplicated the failure of the previous day nobody wanted him if nobody wanted him in the village where he was born and bred a village of countingrooms and workshops was any other place likely to need him he had only one hope if it could be called a hope at any rate he had treated it tenderly as such and kept it for the last he would apply to rowland slocum long ago when richard was an urchin making pothooks in the lane the man used occasionally to pat him on the head and give him pennies this was not a foundation on which to rear a very lofty castle but this was all he had it was noon when richard approached the marble yard and the men were pouring out into the street through the wide gate in the rough deal fence which inclosed the works heavy brawny men covered with fine white dust who shouldered each other like cattle and took the sidewalk to themselves richard stepped aside to let them pass eying them curiously as possible comrades suddenly a slim dark fellow who had retained his paper cap and leather apron halted and thrust forth a horny hand the others went on hullo dick shackford what is that you will you here been here two years now one of slocums apprentices added durgin with an air of easy grandeur two years how time flies when it doesnt crawl do you like it my time will be out next oh the work well yes its not bad and theres a jolly set in the yard but how about you i heard last night youd got home been everywhere and come back wealthy the boys used to say you was off pirating no such luck answered richard with a smile i didnt prey on the high seas quite the contrary the high sea captured my kit and four years savings i will tell you about it some day if i have a limb to my name and a breath left to my body it is no thanks to the indian ocean that is all i have got will and i am looking around for bread and butter literally bread and butter no and the old gentleman so rich durgin said this with sincere indignation and was perhaps unconscious himself of experiencing that nameless shadowy satisfaction which rochefoucauld says we find in the adversity of our best friends certainly richard looked very seedy in his suit of slopshop clothes i was on my way to mr slocums to see if i could do anything with him richard continued to get a job do you mean yes to get work to learn how to work to master a trade in short you cant be an apprentice you know said durgin why not slocum has two suppose he should happen to want another he might the association wouldnt allow it what association the marble workers association of course they wouldnt allow it how is that this the way of it slocum is free to take on two apprentices every year but no more that prevents workmen increasing too fast and so keeps up wages the marble workers association is a very neat thing i can tell you but doesnt mr slocum own the yard i thought he did yes he owns the yard if he wished to extend the business couldnt he employ more hands as many as he could get skilled workmen but not apprentices and mr slocum agrees to that inquired richard he does and likes it not he he hates it but he cant help himself upon my soul i dont see what prevents him taking on as many apprentices as he wants to why the association to be sure returned durgin glancing at the town clock which marked seven minutes past the hour but how could they stop him in plenty of ways suppose slocum has a lot of unfinished contracts on hand he always has fat contracts and the men was to knock off work that would be kind of awkward wouldnt it for a day or two yes he could send out of town for hands suggested richard and they wouldnt come if the association said stay where you are they are mostly in the ring some outsiders might come though then what why then the boys would make it pretty hot for them in stillwater dont you notice i notice there is not much chance for me said richard despondingly isnt that so cant say better talk with slocum but i must get along i have to be back sharp at one i want to hear about your knocking around the worst kind cant we meet somewhere tonight at the tavern the tavern that didnt used to be a quiet place it isnt quiet now but theres nowhere else to go of a night its a comfortable den and theres always some capital fellows dropping in a glass of lager with a mate is not a bad thing after a hard days work both are good things when they are of the right sort thats like saying im not the right sort isnt it i meant nothing of the kind but i dont take to the tavern not that im squeamish i have lived four years among sailors and have been in rougher places than you ever dreamed of but all the same i am afraid of the tavern ive seen many a brave fellow wrecked on that reef you always was a bit stuck up said durgin candidly not an inch i never had much reason to be and less now than ever when i can scarcely afford to drink water let alone beer i will drop round to your mothers some evening i hope shes well and tell you of my ups and downs that will be pleasanter for all hands oh as you like now for mr slocum though you have taken the wind out of me the two separated durgin with a half smile on his lip and richard in a melancholy frame of mind he passed from the grassfringed street into the deserted marble yard where it seemed as if the green summer had suddenly turned into white winter and threading his way between the huge drifts of snowy stone knocked at the door of mr slocums private office william durgin had summed up the case fairly enough as it stood between the marble workers association and rowland slocum the system of this branch of the tradesunion kept trained workmen comparatively scarce and enabled them to command regular and even advanced prices at periods when other trades were depressed the older hands looked upon a fresh apprentice in the yard with much the same favor as workingmen of the era of jacquard looked upon the introduction of a new piece of machinery unless the apprentice had exceptional tact he underwent a rough novitiate in any case he served a term of social ostracism before he was admitted to full comradeship mr slocum could easily have found openings each year for a dozen learners had the matter been under his control but it was not i am the master of each man individually he declared but collectively they are my master so his business instead of naturally spreading and becoming a benefit to the many was kept carefully pruned down to the benefit of the few he was often forced to decline important contracts the filling of which would have resulted to the advantage of every person in the village mr slocum recognized richard at once and listened kindly to his story it was mr slocums way to listen kindly to every one but he was impressed with richards intelligence and manner and became desirous for several reasons to assist him in the first place there was room in the shops for another apprentice experienced hands were on jobs that could have been as well done by beginners and in the second place mr slocum had an intuition that lemuel shackford was not treating the lad fairly though richard had said nothing to this effect now mr slocum and mr shackford were just then at swords points i dont suppose i could annoy shackford more was mr slocums reflection than by doing something for this boy whom he has always shamelessly neglected the motive was not a high one but richard would have been well satisfied with it if he could have divined it he did divine that mr slocum was favorably inclined towards him and stood watching that gentlemans face with hopeful anxiety i have my regulation number of young men richard said mr slocum and there will be no vacancy until autumn if you could wait a few months richards head drooped cant do that you write a good hand you say perhaps you could assist the bookkeeper until theres a chance for you in the yard i think i could sir said richard eagerly if you were only a draughtsman now i could do something much better for you i intend to set up a shop for ornamental carving and i want some one to draw patterns if you had a knack at designing if you could draw at all richards face lighted up perhaps you have a turn that way i remember the queer things you used to scratch in the mud in the court when you were a little shaver can you draw why that is the one thing i can do cried richard in a rough fashion of course he added fearing he had overstated it it is a rough fashion that will serve you must let me see some of your sketches i havent any sir i had a hundred in my seachest but that was lost pencillings of old archways cathedral spires bits of frieze and such odds and ends as took my fancy in the ports we touched at i recollect one bit i think i could do it for you now shall i mr slocum nodded assent smiling at the young fellows enthusiasm and only partially suspecting his necessity richard picked up a pen and began scratching on a letter sheet which lay on the desk he was five or six minutes at the work during which the elder man watched him with an amused expression its a section of cornice on the faзade of the hindoo college at calcutta said richard handing him the paper no its the customhouse i forget which but it doesnt matter the amused look gradually passed out of mr slocums countenance as he examined the sketch it was roughly but clearly drawn and full of facility why thats very clever he said holding it at armslength and then with great gravity i hope you are not a genius richard that would be too much of a fine thing if you are not you can be of service to me in my plans richard laughingly made haste to declare that to the best of his knowledge and belief he was not a genius and it was decided on the spot that richard should assist mr simms the bookkeeper and presently try his hand at designing ornamental patterns for the carvers mr slocum allowing him apprentice wages until the quality of his work should be ascertained it is very little said mr slocum but it will pay your board if you do not live at home i shall not remain at my cousins richard replied if you call that home i can imagine it is not much of a home your cousin not to put too fine a point on it is a wretch i am sorry to hear you say that sir hes my only living kinsman you are fortunate in having but one then however i am wrong to abuse him to you but i cannot speak of him with moderation he has just played me such a despicable trick look here mr slocum led richard to the door and pointing to a row of new workshops which extended the entire length of one side of the marble yard said i built these last spring after the shingles were on we discovered that the rear partition for a distance of seventyfive feet overlapped two inches on shackfords meadow i was ready to drop when i saw it your cousin is such an unmanageable old fiend of course i went to him immediately and what do you think he demanded five hundred dollars for that strip of land five hundred dollars for a few inches of swamp meadow not worth ten dollars the acre then take your disreputable old mill off my property says shackford he called it a disreputable old mill i was hasty perhaps and i told him to go to the devil he said he would and he did for he went to blandmann when the lawyers got hold of it they bothered the life out of me so i just moved the building forward two inches at an expense of seven hundred dollars then what does the demon do but board up all my windows opening on the meadow richard i make it a condition that you shall not lodge at shackfords nothing could induce me to live another day in the same house with him sir answered richard suppressing an inclination to smile and then seriously his bread is bitter richard went back with a light heart to welchs court at the gate of the marble yard he met william durgin returning to work the steamwhistle had sounded the call and there was no time for exchange of words so richard gave his comrade a bright nod and passed by durgin turned and stared after him looks as if slocum had taken him on but it never can be as apprentice he wouldnt dare do it mr shackford had nearly finished his frugal dinner when richard entered if you cant hit it to be in at your meals said mr shackford helping himself absently to the remaining chop perhaps you had better stop away altogether i can do that now cousin replied richard sunnily i have engaged with slocum the old man laid down his knife and fork with slocum a shackford a miserable marblechipper there was so little hint of the aristocrat in lemuel shackfords sordid life and person that no one suspected him of even selfesteem he went as meanly dressed as a tramp and as careless of contemporary criticism yet clear down in his liver or somewhere in his anatomy he nourished an odd abstract pride in the family shackford heaven knows why to be sure it dated far back its women had always been virtuous and its men if not always virtuous had always been shipcaptains but beyond this the family had never amounted to anything and now there was so very little left of it for richard as richard lemuel cared nothing for richard as a shackford he had a chaotic feeling that defied analysis and had never before risen to the surface it was therefore with a disgust entirely apart from the hatred of slocum or regard for richard that the old man exclaimed a shackford a miserable marblechipper that is better than hanging around the village with my hands in my pockets isnt it i dont know that anybody has demanded that you should hang around the village i ought to go away you mean but i have found work here and i might not find it elsewhere stillwater is not the place to begin life in its the place to go away from and come back to well i have come back and how with one shirt and a lot of bad sailor habits my one shirt is my only very bad habit said richard with a laugh he could laugh now and i mean to get rid of that mr shackford snapped his fingers disdainfully you ought to have stuck to the sea thats respectable in ten years you might have risen to be master of a bark that would have been honorable you might have gone down in a gale you probably would and that would have been fortunate but a stonecutter you can understand growled mr shackford reaching out for his straw hat which he put on and crushed over his brows i dont keep a boardinghouse for slocums hands oh im far from asking it cried richard i am thankful for the two nights shelter i have had thats some of your sarcasm i suppose said mr shackford half turning with his hands on the doorknob no it is some of my sincerity i am really obliged to you you werent very cordial to be sure but i did not deserve cordiality you have figured that out correctly i want to begin over again you see and start fair then begin by dropping slocum you have not given me a chance to tell you what the arrangement is however its irrevocable i dont want to hear i dont care a curse so long as it is an arrangement and mr shackford hurried out of the room slamming the door behind him then richard quite undisturbed by his cousins unreasonableness sat himself down to eat the last meal he was ever to eat under that roof a feat which his cousins appetite had rendered comparatively easy while engaged in this richard resolved in his mind several questions as to his future abode he could not reconcile his thought to any of the workingmens boardinghouses of which there were five or six in the slums of the village where the doorways were greasy and women flitted about in the hottest weather with thick woolen shawls over their heads yet his finances did not permit him to aspire to lodgings much more decent if he could only secure a small room somewhere in a quiet neighborhood possibly mrs durgin would let him have a chamber in her cottage he was beginning life over again and it struck him as nearly an ideal plan to begin it on the identical spot where he had in a manner made his first start besides there was william durgin for company when the long nights of the new england winter set in the idea smiled so pleasantly in richards fancy that he pushed the plate away from him impatiently and picked up his hat which lay on the floor beside the chair that evening he moved from the shackford house to mrs durgins cottage in cross street it was not an imposing ceremony with a small brownpaper parcel under his arm he walked from one threshold to the other and the thing was done viii the six months which followed richards installment in the office at slocums yard were so crowded with novel experience that he scarcely noted their flight the room at the durgins as will presently appear turned out an unfortunate arrangement but everything else had prospered richard proved an efficient aid to mr simms who quietly shifted the payroll to the younger mans shoulders this was a very complicated account to keep involving as it did a separate record of each employees time and special work an ancient bookkeeper parts lightly with such trifles when he has a capable assistant it also fell to richards lot to pay the hands on saturdays william durgin blinked his surprise on the first occasion as he filed in with the others and saw richard posted at the desk with the payroll in his hand and the pile of greenbacks lying in front of him i suppose youll be proprietor next remarked durgin that evening at the supper table when i am will answered richard cheerily you will be on the road to foreman of the finishing shop thank you said durgin not too graciously it grated on him to play the part of foreman even in imagination with dick shackford as proprietor durgin could not disconnect his friend from that seedy halfcrestfallen figure to whom a few months earlier he had given elementary instruction on the marble workers association richard did not find his old schoolmate so companionable as memory and anticipation had painted him the two young men moved on different levels richards sea life now that he had got at a sufficient distance from it was a perspective full of pleasant color he had a taste for reading a thirst to know things and his world was not wholly shut in by the stillwater horizon it was still a pitifully narrow world but wide compared with durgins which extended no appreciable distance in any direction from the stillwater hotel he spent his evenings chiefly there returning home late at night and often in so noisy a mood as to disturb richard who slept in an adjoining apartment this was an annoyance and it was an annoyance to have mrs durgin coming to him with complaints of william other matters irritated richard he had contrived to replenish his wardrobe and the sunburn was disappearing from his hands which the nature of his occupation left soft and unscarred durgin was disposed at times to be sarcastic on these changes but always stopped short of actual offense for he remembered that shackford when a boy amiable and patient as he was had had a tigers temper at bottom durgin had seen it roused once or twice and even received a chance sweep of the paw richard liked durgins rough wit as little as durgin relished richards goodnatured bluntness it was a mistake that trying to pick up the dropped thread of old acquaintance as soon as the permanency of his position was assured and his means warranted the step richard transported himself and his effects to a comfortable chamber in the same house with mr pinkham the schoolmaster the perpetual falsetto of whose flute was positively soothing after four months of william durgins bass mr pinkham having but one lung and that defective played on the flute you see what youve gone and done william remarked mrs durgin plaintively with your ways there goes the quietest young man in stillwater and four dollars a week there goes a swell youd better say he was always a proud beggar nobody was ever good enough for him you shouldnt say that william i could cry to lose him and his cheerfulness out of the house and mrs durgin began to whimper wait till hes out of luck again and hell come back to us fast enough thats when his kind remembers their friends blast him he cant even take a drop of beer with a chum at the tavern and right too theres beer enough taken at the tavern without him if you mean me mother ill get drunk tonight no no cried mrs durgin pleadingly i didnt mean you william but peters and that set i thought you couldnt mean me said william thrusting his hands into the pockets of his monkeyjacket and sauntering off in the direction of the stillwater hotel where there was a choice company gathered it being saturday night and the monthly meeting of the union mr slocum had wasted no time in organizing a shop for his experiment in ornamental carving five or six men who had worked elsewhere at this branch were turned over to the new department with stevens as foreman and richard as designer very shortly richard had as much as he could do to furnish the patterns required these consisted mostly of scrolls wreaths and mortuary dovewings for headstones fortunately for richard he had no genius but plenty of a kind of talent just abreast with mr slocums purpose as the carvers became interested in their work they began to show richard the respect and goodwill which at first had been withheld for they had not quite liked being under the supervision of one who had not served at the trade his youth had also told against him but richards pleasant offhand manner quickly won them he had come in contact with rough men on shipboard he had studied their ways and he knew that with all their roughness there is no class so sensitive this insight was of great service to him stevens who had perhaps been the least disposed to accept richard was soon his warm ally see what a smooth fist the lad has he said one day holding up a new drawing to the shop a man with a wreath of them acorns on his headstone oughter be perfectly happy damn him it was however an anchor with a broken chain pendent a design for a monument to the late captain septimius salter who had parted his cable at sea which settled richards status with stevens boys that shackford is what i call a born genei after all is not the oneeyed man who is king among the blind the most fortunate of monarchs your little talent in a provincial village looms a great deal taller than your mighty genius in a city richard shackford working for rowland slocum at stillwater was happier than michaelangelo in rome with pope julius ii at his back and richard was the better paid too one day he picked up a useful hint from a celebrated sculptor who had come to the village in search of marble for the base of a soldiers monument richard was laboriously copying a spray of fern the delicacy of which eluded his pencil the sculptor stood a moment silently observing him why do you spend an hour doing only passably well what you could do perfectly in ten minutes i suppose it is because i am stupid sir said richard no stupid man ever suspected himself of being anything but clever you can draw capitally but nature beats you out and out at designing ferns just ask her to make you a facsimile in plaster and see how handily she will lend herself to the job of course you must help her a little oh i am not above giving nature a lift said richard modestly lay a cloth on your table place the fern on the cloth and pour a thin paste of plaster of paris over the leaf do that gently so as not to disarrange the spray when the plaster is set theres your mold remove the leave oil the matrix and pour in fresh plaster when that is set cut away the mold carefully and theres your spray of fern as graceful and perfect as if nature had done it all by herself you get the very texture of the leaf by this process after that richard made casts instead of drawings for the carvers and fancied he was doing a new thing until he visited some marbleworks in the great city at this period whatever change subsequently took place in his feeling richard was desirous of establishing friendly relations with his cousin the young fellows sense of kinship was singularly strong and it was only after several repulses at the door of the shackford house and on the street that he relinquished the hope of placating the sour old man at times richard was moved almost to pity him every day mr shackford seemed to grow shabbier and more spectral he was a grotesque figure now in his napless hat and brokendown stock the metal buttonholes on his ancient waistcoat had worn their way through the satin coverings leaving here and there a sparse fringe around the edges and somehow suggesting little bald heads looking at him you felt that the inner man was as threadbare and dilapidated as his outside but in his lonely old age he asked for no human sympathy or companionship and in fact stood in no need of either with one devouring passion he set the world at defiance he loved his gold the metal itself the weight an color and touch of it in his bedroom on the groundfloor mr shackford kept a small ironclamped box filled to the lid with bright yellow coins often at the dead of night with door bolted and curtain down he would spread out the glittering pieces on the table and bend over them with an amorous glow in his faded eyes these were his blond mistresses he took a fearful joy in listening to their rustling muffle laughter as he drew them towards him with eager hands if at that instant a blind chanced to slam or a footfall to echo in the lonely court then the withered old sultan would hurry his slaves back into their ironbound seraglio and extinguish the light it would have been a wasted tenderness to pity him he was very happy in his own way that lemuel shackford ix towards the close of his second year with mr slocum richard was assigned a workroom by himself and relieved of his accountants duties his undivided energies were demanded by the carving department which had proved a lucrative success the rear of the lot on which mr slocums house stood was shut off from the marble yard by a high brick wall pierced with a private door for mr slocums convenience over the kitchen in the extension which reached within a few feet of the wall was a disused chamber approachable on the outside by a flight of steps leading to a veranda to this room richard and his traps were removed with a round table standing in the center with the plaster models arranged on shelves and sketches in pencil and crayon tacked against the whitewashed walls the apartment was transformed into a delightful atelier an open fireplace with a brace of antiquated irondogs straddling the red brick hearth gave the finishing touch the occupant was in easy communication with the yard from which the busy din of clinking chisels came musically to his ear and was still beyond the reach of unnecessary interruption richard saw clearly all the advantages of this transfer but he was far form having any intimation that he had made the most important move of his life the room had two doors one opened on the veranda and the other into a narrow hall connecting the extension with the main building frequently that first week after taking possession richard detected the sweep of a broom and the rustle of drapery in this passageway the sound sometimes hushing itself quite close to the door as if some one had paused a moment just outside he wondered whether it was the servantmaid or margaret slocum whom he knew very well by sight it was in fact margaret who was dying with the curiosity of fourteen to peep into the studio so carefully locked whenever the young man left it dying with curiosity to see the workshop and standing in rather great awe of the workman in the home circle her father had a habit of speaking with deep respect of young shackfords ability and once she had seen him at their table at a thanksgiving on this occasion richard had appalled her by the solemnity of his shyness poor richard who was so unused to the amenities of a handsomely served dinner that the chill which came over him cooled the thanksgiving turkey on his palate when it had been decided that he was to have the spare room for his workshop margaret with womanly officiousness had swept it and dusted it and demolished the cobwebs but since then she had not been able to obtain so much as a glimpse of the interior a ten minutes sweeping had sufficed for the chamber but the passageway seemed in quite an irreclaimable state judging by the number of times it was necessary to sweep it in the course of a few days now margaret was not an unusual mixture of timidity and daring so one morning about a week after richard was settled she walked with quaking heart up to the door of the studio and knocked as bold as brass richard opened the door and smiled pleasantly at margaret standing on the threshold with an expression of demure defiance in her face did mr shackford want anything more in the way of pans and pails for his plaster no mr shackford had everything he required of the kind but would not miss margaret walk in yes she would step in for a moment but with a good deal of indifference though giving an air of chance to her settled determination to examine that room from top to bottom richard showed her his drawings and casts and enlightened her on all the simple mysteries of the craft margaret of whom he was a trifle afraid at first amused him with her candor and sedateness seeming now a mere child and now an elderly person gravely inspecting matters the frankness and simplicity were hers by nature and the oldish ways notably her selfpossession so quick to assert itself after an instants forgetfulness came perhaps of losing her mother in early childhood and the premature duties which that misfortune entailed she amused him for she was only fourteen but she impressed him also for she was mr slocums daughter yet it was not her lightness but her gravity that made richard smile to himself i am not interrupting you she asked presently not in the least said richard i am waiting for these molds to harden i cannot do anything until then papa says you are very clever remarked margaret turning her wide black eyes full upon him are you far from it replied richard laughing to veil his confusion but i am glad your father thinks so you should not be glad to have him think so returned margaret reprovingly if you are not clever i suppose you are though tell the truth now it is not fair to force a fellow into praising himself you are trying to creep out well then there are many cleverer persons than i in the world and a few not so clever that wont do said margaret positively i dont understand what you mean by cleverness miss margaret there are a great many kinds and degrees i can make fairly honest patterns for the men to work by but i am not an artist if you mean that you are not an artist no an artist creates and i only copy and that in a small way any one can learn to prepare casts but to create a bust or a statue that is to say a fine one a man must have genius you have no genius not a grain i am sorry to hear that said margaret with a disappointed look but perhaps it will come she added encouragingly i have read that nearly all great artists and poets are almost always modest they know better than anybody else how far they fall short of what they intend and so they dont put on airs you dont either i like that in you may be you have genius without knowing it mr shackford it is quite without knowing it i assure you protested richard with suppressed merriment what an odd girl he thought she is actually talking to me like a mother the twinkling light in the young mans eyes or something that jarred in his manner caused margaret at once to withdraw into herself she went silently about the room examining the tools and patterns then nearing the door suddenly dropped richard a quaint little courtesy and was gone this was the colorless beginning of a friendship that was destined speedily to be full of tender lights and shadows and to flow on with unsuspected depth for several days richard saw nothing more of margaret and scarcely thought of her the strangle little figure was fading out of his mind when one afternoon it again appeared at his door this time margaret had left something of her sedateness behind she struck richard as being both less ripe and less immature than he had fancied she interested rather than amused him perhaps he had been partially insulated by his own shyness on the first occasion and had caught only a confused and inaccurate impression of margarets personality she remained half an hour in the workshop and at her departure omitted the formal courtesy after this margaret seldom let a week slip without tapping once or twice at the studio at first with some pretext or other and then with no pretense whatever when margaret had disburdened herself of excuses for dropping in to watch richard mold his leaves and flowers she came oftener and richard insensibly drifted into the habit of expecting her on certain days and was disappointed when she failed to appear his industry had saved him until now from discovering how solitary his life really was for his life was as solitary as solitary as that of margaret who lived in the great house with only her father the two servants and an episodical aunt the mother was long ago dead margaret could not recollect when that gray headstone with blotches of rustygreen moss breaking out over the lettering was not in the churchyard and there never had been any brothers or sisters to margaret richards installation in the empty room where as a child she had always been afraid to go was the single important break she could remember in the monotony of her existence and now a vague yearning for companionship the blind sense of the plant reaching towards the sunshine drew her there the tacitly prescribed half hour often lengthened to an hour sometimes margaret brought a book with her or a piece of embroidery and the two spoke scarcely ten words richard giving her a smile now and then and she returning a sympathetic nod as the cast came out successfully margaret at fifteen she was fifteen now was not a beauty there is the loveliness of the bud and the loveliness of the fullblown flower but margaret as a blossom was not pretty she was awkward and angular with prominent shoulderblades and no soft curves anywhere in her slimness only her black hair growing low on the forehead and her eyes were fine her profile indeed with the narrow forehead and the sensitive upper lip might fairly have suggested the mask of clytie which richard had bought of an itinerant imagedealer and fixed on a bracket over the mantelshelf but her eyes were her specialty if one may say that they were fringed with such heavy lashes that the girl seemed always to be in halfmourning her smile was singularly sweet and bright perhaps because it broke through so much somber coloring if there was a latent spark of sentiment between richard and margaret in those earlier days neither was conscious of it they had seemingly begun where happy lovers generally end by being dear comrades he liked to have margaret sitting there with her needle flashing in the sunlight or her eyelashes making a rich gloom above the book as she read aloud it was so agreeable to look up from his work and not be alone he had been alone so much and margaret found nothing in the world pleasanter than to sit there and watch richard making his winter garden as she called it by and by it became her custom to pass every saturday afternoon in that employment margaret was not content to be merely a visitor she took a housewifely care of the workshop resolutely straightening out its chronic disorder at unexpected moments and fighting the white dust that settled upon everything the greenpaper shade which did not roll up very well at the west window was of her devising an empty camphor vial on richards desk had always a clove pink or a pansy or a rose stuck into it according to the season she hid herself away and peeped out in a hundred feminine things in the room sometimes she was a bit of crochetwork left on a chair and sometimes she was only a hairpin which richard gravely picked up and put on the mantelpiece mr slocum threw no obstacles in the path of this idyllic friendship possibly he did not observe it in his eyes margaret was still a child a point of view that necessarily excluded any consideration of richard perhaps however if mr slocum could have assisted invisibly at a pretty little scene which took place in the studio one day some twelve or eighteen months after margarets first visit to it he might have found food for reflection it was a saturday afternoon margaret had come into the workshop with her sewing as usual the papers on the round table had been neatly cleared away and richard was standing by the window indolently drumming on the glass with a paletteknife not at work this afternoon i was waiting for you that is no excuse at all said margaret sweeping across the room with a curious air of selfconsciousness and arranging her drapery with infinite pains as she seated herself richard looked puzzled for a moment and then exclaimed margaret you have got on a long dress yes said margaret with dignity do you like it the train thats a train yes said margaret standing up and glancing over her left shoulder at the soft folds of marooncolored stuff which with a mysterious feminine movement of the foot she caused to untwist itself and flow out gracefully behind her there was really something very pretty in the hesitating lines of the tall slender figure as she leaned back that way certain unsuspected points emphasized themselves so cunningly i never saw anything finer declared richard it was worth waiting for but you shouldnt have waited said margaret with a gratified flush settling herself into the chair again it was understood that you were never to let me interfere with your work you see you have by being twenty minutes late ive finished that acorn border for stevenss capitals and theres nothing more to do for the yard i am going to make something for myself and i want you to lend me a hand how can i help you richard margaret asked promptly stopping the needle in the hem i need a paperweight to keep my sketches from being blown about and i wish you literally to lend me a hand a hand to take a cast of really i think that little white claw would make a very neat paperweight said richard margaret gravely rolled up her sleeve to the elbow and contemplated the hand and wrist critically it is like a claw isnt it i think you can find something better than that no that is what i want and nothing else that or no paperweight for me very well just as you choose it will be a fright the other hand please i gave you the left because ive a ring on this one you can take off the ring i suppose of course i can take it off well then do richard said margaret severely i hope you are not a fidget a what a fuss then a person who always wants everything some other way and makes just twice as much trouble as anybody else no margaret i am not that i prefer your right hand because the left is next to the heart and the evaporation of the water in the plaster turns it as cold as snow your arm will be chilled to the shoulder we dont want to do anything to hurt the good little heart you know certainly not said margaret there and she rested her right arm on the table while richard placed the hand in the desired position on a fresh napkin which he had folded for the purpose let your hand lie flexible please hold it naturally why do you stiffen the fingers so i dont they stiffen themselves richard they know they are going to have their photograph taken and cant look natural who ever does after a minute the fingers relaxed and settled of their own accord into an easy pose richard laid his hand softly on her wrist dont move now ill be as quiet as a mouse said margaret giving a sudden queer little glance at his face richard emptied a paper of white powder into a great yellow bowl half filled with water and fell to stirring it vigorously like a pastrycook beating eggs when the plaster was of the proper consistency he began building it up around the hand pouring on a spoonful at a time here and there carefully in a minute or two the inert white fingers were completely buried margaret made a comical grimace is it cold ice said margaret shutting her eyes involuntarily if it is too disagreeable we can give it up suggested richard no dont touch it she cried waving him back with her free arm i dont mind but its as cold as so much snow how curious what does it i suppose a scientific fellow could explain the matter to you easily enough when the water evaporates a kind of congealing process sets in a sort of atmospheric change dont you know the sudden precipitation of the the youre as good as tyndall on heat said margaret demurely oh tyndall is well enough in his way returned richard but of course he doesnt go into things so deeply as i do the idea of telling me that a congealing process set in when i am nearly frozen to death cried margaret bowing her head over the imprisoned arm your unseemly levity margaret makes it necessary for me to defer my remarks on natural phenomena until some more fitting occasion oh richard dont let an atmospherical change come over you when you knocked at my door months ago said richard i didnt dream you were such a satirical little piece or may be you wouldnt have got in you stood there as meek as moses with your frock reaching only to the tops of your boots you were a deception margaret i was dreadfully afraid of you richard you are not afraid of me nowadays not a bit you are showing your true colors that long dress too i believe the train has turned your head but just now you said you admired it so i did and do it makes you look quite like a woman though i want to be a woman i would like to be as old as old as mrs methuselah was there a mrs methuselah i really forget replied richard considering but there must have been the old gentleman had time enough to have several i believe however that history is rather silent about his domestic affairs well then said margaret after thinking it over i would like to be as old as the youngest mrs methuselah that was probably the last one remarked richard with great profundity she was probably some giddy young thing of seventy or eighty those old widowers never take a wife of their own age i shouldnt want you to be seventy margaret or even eighty on the whole perhaps i shouldnt fancy it myself do you approve of persons marrying twice n o not at the same time of course i didnt mean that said margaret with asperity how provoking you can be but they used to in the olden time dont you know no i dont richard burst out laughing imagine him he cried imagine methuselah in his eight or nine hundredth year dressed in his customary bridal suit with a sprig of centuryplant stuck in his buttonhole richard said margaret solemnly you shouldnt speak jestingly of a scriptural character at this richard broke out again but gracious me he exclaimed suddenly checking himself i am forgetting you all this while richard hurriedly reversed the mass of plaster on the table and released margarets halfpetrified fingers they were shriveled and colorless with the cold there isnt any feeling in it whatever said margaret holding up her hand helplessly like a wounded wing richard took the fingers between his palms and chafed them smartly for a moment or two to restore the suspended circulation there that will do said margaret withdrawing her hand are you all right now yes thanks and then she added smiling i suppose a scientific fellow could explain why my fingers seem to be full of hot pins and needles shooting in every direction tyndalls your man tyndall on heat answered richard with a laugh turning to examine the result of his work the mold is perfect margaret you were a good girl to keep so still richard then proceeded to make the cast which was soon placed on the windowledge to harden in the sun when the plaster was set he cautiously chipped off the shell with a chisel margaret leaning over his shoulder to watch the operation and there was the little white claw which ever after took such dainty care of his papers and ultimately became so precious to him as a part of margarets very self that he would not have exchanged it for the venus of milo but as yet richard was far enough from all that x three years glided by with richard shackford as swiftly as those periods of time which are imagined to elapse between the acts of a play they were eventless untroubled years and have no history nevertheless certain changes had taken place little by little mr slocum had relinquished the supervision of the workshops to richard until now the affairs of the yard rested chiefly on his shoulders it was like a dream to him when he looked directly back to his humble beginning though as he reflected upon it and retraced his progress step by step he saw there was nothing illogical or astonishing in his good fortune he had won it by downright hard work and the faithful exercise of a sufficing talent in his relations with margaret richards attitude had undergone no appreciable change her chance visits to the studio through the week and those pleasant halfidle saturday afternoons had become to both richard and margaret a matter of course like the sunlight or the air they breathed to richard margaret slocum at nineteen was simply a charming frank girl a type of gracious young womanhood he was conscious of her influence he was very fond of margaret but she had not yet taken on for him that magic individuality which makes a woman the one woman in the world to her lover though richard had scant experience in such matters he was not wrong in accepting margaret as the type of a class of new england girls which fortunately for new england is not a small class these young women for the most part lead quiet and restricted lives so far as the actualities are concerned but very deep and full lives in the world of books and imagination to which they make early escapes they have the high instincts that come of good blood the physique that naturally fits fine manners and when chance takes one of these maidens from her island country home or from some sleepy town on the seaboard and sets her amid the complications of city existence she is an unabashed and unassuming lady if in paris she differs from the parisiennes only in the greater delicacy of her lithe beauty her innocence which is not ignorance and her french pronunciation if in london she differs from english girls only in the matter of rosy cheeks and the rising inflection should none of these fortunate transplantings befall her she always merits them by adorning with grace and industry and intelligence the narrower sphere to which destiny has assigned her destiny had assigned margaret slocum to a very narrow sphere it had shut her up in an obscure new england manufacturing village with no society strictly speaking and no outlets whatever to large experiences to her fathers affection richards friendship and her household duties she was forced to look for her happiness if life held wider possibilities for her she had not dreamed of them she looked up to richard with respect perhaps with a dash of sentiment in the respect there was something at once gentle and virile in his character which she admired and leaned upon in his presence the small housekeeping troubles always slipped from her but her heart to use a pretty french phrase had not consciously spoken possibly it had murmured a little incoherently to itself but it had not spoken out aloud as perhaps it would have done long ago if an impediment had been placed in the way of their intimacy with all her subtler intuitions margaret was as far as richard from suspecting the strength and direction of the current with which they were drifting freedom habit and the nature of their environment conspired to prolong this mutual lack of perception the hour had sounded however when these two were to see each other in a different light one monday morning in march at the close of the three years in question as richard mounted the outside staircase leading to his studio in the extension the servantmaid beckoned to him from the kitchen window margaret had failed to come to the studio the previous saturday afternoon richard had worked at crosspurposes and returned to his boardinghouse vaguely dissatisfied as always happened to him on those rare occasions when she missed the appointment but he had thought little of the circumstance nor had he been disturbed on sunday at seeing the slocum pew vacant during both services the heavy snowstorm which had begun the night before accounted for at least margarets absence mr slocum told me to tell you that he shouldnt be in the yard today said the girl miss margaret is very ill ill richard repeated and the smile with which he had leaned over the rail towards the window went out instantly on his lip dr weld was up with her until five oclock this morning said the girl fingering the corner of her apron shes that low what is the matter its a fever what kind of fever i dont mind me what the doctor called it he thinks it come from something wrong with the drains he didnt say typhoid yes thats the name of it richard ascended the stairs with a slow step and a moment afterwards stood stupidly in the middle of the workshop margaret is going to die he said to himself giving voice to the dark foreboding that had instantly seized upon him and in a swift vision he saw the end of all that simple fortunate existence which he had lived without once reflecting it could ever end he mechanically picked up a tool from the table and laid it down again then he seated himself on the low bench between the windows it was margarets favorite place it was not four days since she sat there reading to him already it appeared long ago years and years ago he could hardly remember when he did not have this heavy weight on his heart his life of yesterday abruptly presented itself to him as a reminiscence he saw now how happy that life had been and how lightly he had accepted it it took to itself all that precious quality of things irrevocably lost the clamor of the bell in the south church striking noon and the shrilling of the steamwhistle softened by the thickfalling snow roused richard from his abstraction he was surprised that it was noon he rose from the bench and went home through the storm scarcely heeding the sleet that snapped in his face like whiplashes margaret was going to die for four or five weeks the world was nearly a blank to richard shackford the insidious fever that came and went bringing alternate despair and hope to the watchers in the hushed room was in his veins also he passed the days between his lonely lodgings in lime street and the studio doing nothing restless and apathetic by turns but with always a poignant sense of anxiety he ceased to take any distinct measurement of time further than to note that an interval of months seemed to separate monday from monday meanwhile if new patterns had been required by the men the work in the carving departments would have come to a dead lock at length the shadow lifted and there fell a day of soft may weather when margaret muffled in shawls and as white as death was seated once more in her accustomed corner by the west window she had insisted on being brought there the first practicable moment nowhere else in the house was such sunshine and mr slocum himself had brought her in his arms she leaned back against the pillows smiling faintly her fingers lay locked on her lap and the sunlight showed through the narrow transparent palace it was as if her hands were full of blushroses richard breathed again but not with so free a heart as before what if she had died he felt an immense pity for himself when he thought of that and he thought of it continually as the days wore on either a great alteration had wrought itself in margaret or richard beheld her through a clearer medium during the weeks of convalescence that followed was this the slight sharpfaced girl he used to know the eyes and the hair were the same but the smile was deeper and the pliant figure had lost its extreme slimness without a sacrifice to its delicacy the spring air was filling her veins with abundant health and mantling her cheeks with a richer duskiness than they had ever worn margaret was positively handsome her beauty had come all in a single morning like the crocuses this beauty began to awe richard it had the effect of seeming to remove her further and further from him he grew moody and restless when they were together and was wretched alone his constraint did not escape margaret she watched him and wondered at his inexplicable depression when every one in the household was rejoicing in her recovery by and by this depression wounded her but she was too spirited to show the hurt she always brought a book with her now in her visits to the studio it was less awkward to read than to sit silent and unspoken to over a piece of needlework how very odd you are said margaret one afternoon closing the volume which she had held mutely for several minutes waiting for richard to grasp the fact that she was reading aloud i odd protested richard breaking with a jerk from one of his long reveries in what way as if i could explain when you put the quotation suddenly like that i didnt intend to be abrupt i was curious to know and then the charge itself was a trifle unexpected if you will look at it but never mind he added with a smile think it over and tell me tomorrow no i will tell you now since you are willing to wait i wasnt really willing to wait but i knew if i didnt pretend to be i should never get it out of you very well then your duplicity is successful richard i was puzzled where to begin with your oddities begin at the beginning no i will take the nearest when a young lady is affable enough to read aloud to you the least you can do is to listen to her that is a deference you owe to the author when it happens to be hawthorne to say nothing of the young lady but i have been listening margaret every word where did i leave off it was where where the and richard knitted his brows in the vain effort to remember where the young daguerreotypist whatshisname took up his residence in the house of the seven gables no sir you stand convicted it was ten pages further on the last words were and margaret read from the book goodnight cousin said phoebe strangely affected by hepsibahs manner if you being to love me i am glad there sir what do you say to that richard did not say anything but he gave a guilty start and shot a rapid glance at margaret coolly enjoying her triumph in the next place she continued soberly after a pause i think it very odd in you not to reply to me oh not now for of course you are without a word of justification but at other times frequently when i speak to you you look at me so making a vacant little face and then suddenly disappear i dont mean bodily but mentally i am no great talker at best said richard with a helpless air i seldom speak unless i have something to say but other people do i for instance oh you margaret that is different when you talk i dont much mind what you are talking about i like a neat delicate compliment like that what a perverse girl you are today cried richard you wont understand me i mean that your words and your voice are so pleasant they make anything interesting whether its important or not if no one were to speak until he had something important to communicate observed margaret conversation in this world would come to a general stop then she added with a little ironical smile even you richard wouldnt be talking all the time formerly margarets light sarcasms even when the struck him pointblank used to amuse richard but now he winced at being merely grazed margaret went on but its not a bit necessary to be circular or instructive with me i am interested in trivial matters in the weather in my spring hat in what you are going to do next and the like one must occupy ones self with something but you richard nowadays you seem interested in nothing and have nothing whatever to say poor richard he had a great deal to say but he did not know how nor if it were wise to breathe it just three little words murmured or whispered and the whole conditions would be changed with those fateful words uttered what would be margarets probable attitude and what mr slocums though the line which formerly drew itself between employer and employee had grown faint with time it still existed in richards mind and now came to the surface with great distinctness like a word written in sympathetic ink if he spoke and margaret was startled or offended then there was an end to their free unembarrassed intercourse perhaps an end to all intercourse by keeping his secret in his breast he at least secured the present but that was to risk everything any day somebody might come and carry margaret off under his very eyes as he reflected on this the shadow of john dana the son of the rich ironmanufacturer etched itself sharply upon richards imagination within the week young dana had declared in the presence of richard that margaret slocum was an awfully nice little thing and the othello in richards blood had been set seething then his thought glanced from john dana to mr pinkham and the rev arthur langly both of whom were assiduous visitors at the house the former had lately taken to accompanying margaret on the piano with his dismal little flute and the latter was perpetually making a moth of himself about her class at sundayschool richard stood with the edge of his chisel resting idly upon the plaster mold in front of him pondering these things presently he heard margarets voice as if somewhere in the distance saying i have not finished yet richard go on said richard falling to work again with a kind of galvanic action go on please i have a serious grievance frankly i am hurt by your preoccupation and indifference your want of openness or cordiality i dont know how to name it you are the only person who seems to be unaware that i escaped a great danger a month ago i am obliged to remember all the agreeable hours i have spent in the studio to keep off the impression that during my illness you got used to not seeing me and that now my presence somehow obstructs your work and annoys you richard threw his chisel on the bench and crossed over to the window where margaret was you are as wrong as you can be he said looking down on her halflifted face from which a quick wave of color was subsiding for the abruptness of richards movement had startled her i am glad if i am wrong it is nearly an unforgivable thing to be as wide of the mark as you are oh margaret if you had died that time you would have been very sorry sorry no that doesnt express it one outlives mere sorrow if anything had happened to you i should never have got over it you dont know what those five weeks were to me it was a kind of death to come to this room day after day and not find you margaret rested her eyes thoughtfully on the space occupied by richard rather than on richard himself seeming to look through and beyond him as if he were incorporeal you missed me like that she said slowly i missed you like that margaret meditated a moment in the first days of my illness i wondered if you didnt miss me a little afterwards everything was confused in my mind when i tried to think i seemed to be somebody else i seemed to be you waiting for me here in the studio wasnt that singular but when i recovered and returned to my old place i began to suspect i had been bearing your anxiety that i had been distressed by the absence to which you had grown accustomed i never got used to it margaret it became more and more unendurable this workshop was full of of your absence there wasnt a sketch or a cast or an object in the room that didnt remind me of you and seem to mock at me for having let the most precious moments of my life slip away unheeded that bit of geranium in the glass yonder seemed to say with its dying breath you have cared for neither of us as you ought to have cared my scent and her goodness have been all one to you things to take or to leave it was for no merit of yours that she was always planning something to make life smoother and brighter for you what had you done to deserve it how unselfish and generous and good she has been to you for years and years what would have become of you without her she left me here on purpose its the geranium leaf that is speaking all the while margaret to say this to you and to tell you that she was not half appreciated but now you have lost her as she leaned forward listening with her lips slightly parted margaret gave an unconscious little approbative nod of the head richards fanciful accusation of himself caused her a singular thrill of pleasure he had never before spoken to her in just this fashion the subterfuge which his tenderness had employed the little detour it had made in order to get at her was a novel species of flattery she recognized the ring of a distinctly new note in his voice but strangely enough the note lost its unfamiliarity in an instant margaret recognized that fact also and as she swiftly speculate on the phenomenon her pulse went one or two strokes faster oh you poor boy she said looking up with a laugh and a flush so interfused that they seemed one that geranium took a great deal upon itself it went quite beyond its instructions which were simply to remind you of me now and then one day while you were out the day before i was taken ill i placed the flowers on the desk there perhaps with a kind of premonition that i was going away from you for a time what if you had never come back i wouldnt think of that if i were you said margaret softly but it haunts me that thought sometimes of a morning after i unlock the workshop door i stand hesitating with my hand on the latch as one might hesitate a few seconds before stepping into a tomb there were days last month margaret when this chamber did appear to me like a tomb all that was happy in my past seemed to lie buried here it was something visible and tangible i used to steal in and look upon it oh richard if you only knew what a life i led as a boy in my cousins house and what a doleful existence for years afterwards until i found you perhaps you would understand my despair when i saw everything suddenly slipping away from me margaret the day your father brought you in here i had all i could do not to kneel down at your feet richard stopped short i didnt mean to tell you that he added turning towards the worktable then he checked himself and came and stood in front of her again he had gone too far not to go further while you were ill i made a great discovery what was that richard i discovered that i had been blind for two or three years blind repeated margaret stoneblind i discovered it by suddenly seeing by seeing that i had loved you all the while margaret are you offended no said margaret slowly she was a moment finding her voice to say it i ought i to be offended not if you are not said richard then i am not i ive made little discoveries myself murmured margaret going into full mourning with her eyelashes but it was only for an instant she refused to take her happiness shyly or insincerely it was something too sacred she was a trifle appalled by it if the truth must be told if richard had scattered his lovemaking through the month of her convalescence or if he had made his avowal in a different mood perhaps margaret might have met him with some natural coquetry but richards tone and manner had been such as to suppress any instinct of the kind his declaration moreover had amazed her margarets own feelings had been more or less plain to her that past month and she had diligently disciplined herself to accept richards friendship since it seemed all he had to give indeed it had seemed at times as if he had not even that when margaret lifted her eyes to him a second after her confession they were full of a sweet seriousness and she had no thought of withdrawing the hands which richard had taken and was holding lightly that she might withdraw them if she willed she felt no impulse to do so though as margaret looked up she saw her father standing a few paces behind richard with an occult sense of another presence in the room richard turned at the same instant mr slocum had advanced two steps into the apartment and had been brought to a dead halt by the surprising tableau in the embrasure of the window he stood motionless with an accountbook under his arm while a dozen expressions chased each other over his countenance mr slocum said richard who saw that only one course lay open to him i love margaret and i have been telling her at that the flitting shadows on mr slocums face settled into one grave look he did not reply immediately but let his glance wander from margaret to richard and back again to margaret slowly digesting the fact it was evident he had not relished it meanwhile the girl had risen from the chair and was moving towards her father this strikes me as very extraordinary he said at last you have never given any intimation that such a feeling existed how long has this been going on i have always been fond of margaret sir but i was not aware of the strength of the attachment until the time of her illness when i that is we came near to losing her and you margaret as mr slocum spoke he instinctively put one arm around margaret who had crept closely to his side i dont know when i began to love richard said margaret simply you dont know perhaps it was while i was ill perhaps it was long before that may be my liking for him commenced as far back as the time he made the cast of my hand how can i tell papa i dont know there appears to be an amazing diffusion of ignorance here margaret bit her lip and kept still her father was taking it a great deal more seriously than she had expected a long awkward silence ensued richard broke it at last by remarking uneasily nothing has been or was to be concealed from you before going to sleep tonight margaret would have told you all ive said to her you should have consulted with me before saying anything i intended to do so but my words got away from me i hope you will overlook it sir and not oppose my loving margaret though i see as plainly as you do that i am not worthy of her i have not said that i base my disapproval on entirely different ground margaret is too young a girl of seventeen or eighteen nineteen said margaret parenthetically of nineteen then has no business to bother her head with such matters only yesterday she was a child richard glanced across at margaret and endeavored to recall her as she impressed him that first afternoon when she knocked defiantly at the workshop door to inquire if he wanted any pans and pails but he was totally unable to reconstruct that crude little figure with the glossy black head all eyes and beak like a young hawks my objection is impersonal continued mr slocum i object to the idea i wish this had not happened i might not have disliked it years hence i dont say but i dislike it now richards face brightened it will be years hence in a few years mr slocum replied with a slow grave smile i am not going to be unreasonable in a matter where i find margarets happiness concerned and yours richard i care for that too but ill have no entanglements you and she are to be good friends and nothing beyond i prefer that margaret should not come to the studio so often you shall see her whenever you like at our fireside of an evening i dont think the conditions hard mr slocum had dictated terms but it was virtually a surrender margaret listened to him with her cheek resting against his arm and a warm light nestled down deep under her eyelids mr slocum drew a halfpathetic sigh i presume i have not done wisely every one bullies me the marble workers association ruins my yard for me and now my daughter is taken off my hands by the way richard he said interrupting himself brusquely and with an air of dismissing the subject i forgot what i came for ive been thinking over torrinis case and have concluded that you had better make up his account and discharge him certainly sir replied richard with a shadow of dissent in his manner if you wish it he causes a deal of trouble in the yard i am afraid he does such a clean workman when hes sober but he is never sober he has been in a bad way lately i admit his example demoralizes the men i can see it day by day i wish he were not so necessary at this moment observed richard i dont know who else could be trusted with the frieze for the soldiers monument id like to keep him on a week or ten days longer suppose i have a plain talk with torrini surely we have enough good hands to stand the loss of one for a special kind of work there is nobody in the yard like torrini that is one reason why i want to hold on to him for a while and there are other reasons such as what well i think it would not be wholly politic to break with him just now why not now as well as any time he has lately been elected secretary of the association what of that he has a great deal of influence there if we put him out of the works it seems to me he would lose his importance if he really has any to speak of you are mistaken if you doubt it his position gives him a chance to do much mischief and he would avail himself of it very adroitly if he had a personal grievance i believe you are actually afraid of the fellow richard smiled no i am not afraid of him but i dont underrate him the men look up to torrini as a sort of leader hes an effective speaker and knows very well how to fan a dissatisfaction either he or some other disturbing element has recently been at work among the men theres considerable grumbling in the yard they are always grumbling arent they most always but this is more serious than usual there appears to be a general stir among the trades in the village i dont understand it clearly the marble workers have been holding secret meetings they mean business you think they mean increased wages perhaps but we are now paying from five to ten per cent more than any trade in the place what are they after so far as i can gather sir the finishers and the slabsawers want an advance i dont know how much then theres some talk about having the yard closed an hour earlier on saturdays all this is merely rumor but i am sure there is something in it confound the whole lot if we cant discharge a drunken hand without raising the pay of all the rest we had better turn over the entire business to the association but do as you like richard you see how i am bullied margaret he runs everything come dear and mr slocum quitted the workshop taking margaret with him richard remained standing awhile by the table in a deep study with his eyes fixed on the floor he thought of his early days in the sepulchral house in welchs court of his wanderings abroad his long years of toil since then and this sudden blissful love that had come to him and mr slocums generosity then he thought of torrini and went down into the yard gently to admonish the man for richards heart that hour was full of kindness for all the world xi in spite of mr slocums stipulations respecting the frequency of margarets visits to the studio she was free to come and go as she liked it was easy for him to say be good friends and nothing beyond but after that day in the workshop it was impossible for richard and margaret to be anything but lovers the hollowness of pretending otherwise was clear even to mr slocum in the love of a father for a daughter there is always a vague jealousy which refuses to render a coherent explanation of itself mr slocum did not escape this but he managed nevertheless to accept the inevitable with very fair grace and presently to confess to himself that the occurrence which had at first taken him aback was the most natural in the world that margaret and richard thrown together as they had been should end by falling in love with each other was not a result to justify much surprise indeed there was a special propriety in their doing so the shackfords had always been reputable people in the village down to lemuel shackford who of course as an old muskrat the family attributes of amiability and honesty had skipped him but they had reappeared in richard it was through his foresight and personal energy that the most lucrative branch of the trade had been established his services entitled him to a future interest in the business and mr slocum had intended he should have it mr slocum had not dreamed of throwing in margaret also but since that addition had suggested itself it seemed to him one of the happy features of the arrangement richard would thus be doubly identified with the yard to which in fact he had become more necessary than mr slocum himself he has more backbone with the men than i have acknowledged mr slocum he knows how to manage them and i dont as soft as slocum was a stillwater proverb richard certainly had plenty of backbone it was his only capital in mr slocums estimation it was sufficient capital but lemuel shackford was a very rich man and mr slocum could not avoid seeing that it would be decent in richards only surviving relative if at this juncture he were to display a little interest in the young fellows welfare if he would only offer to advance a few thousand dollars for richard said mr slocum one evening to margaret with whom he had been talking over the future the property must all come to him some time it would be a vast satisfaction to me to tell the old man that we can get along without any of his illgotten gains he made the bulk of his fortune during the war you know the old seaserpent continued mr slocum with hopeless confusion of metaphor had a hand in fitting out more than one blockaderunner they used to talk of a ship that got away from charleston with a cargo of cotton that netted the shareholders upwards of two hundred thousand dollars he denies it now but everybody knows shackford hed betray his country for fifty cents in postagestamps oh papa you are too hard on him in words dropped cursorily from time to time margaret imparted to richard the substance of her fathers speech and it set richard reflecting it was not among the probabilities that lemuel shackford would advance a dollar to establish richard but if he could induce his cousin even to take the matter into consideration richard felt that it would be a kind of moral support to him circumstanced as he was his pride revolted at the idea of coming quite unbacked and disowned as well as emptyhanded to mr slocum for the last twelve months there had been a cessation of ordinary courtesies between the two cousins they now passed each other on the street without recognition a year previously mr shackford had fallen ill and richard aware of the inefficient domestic arrangements in welchs court had gone to the house out of sheer pity the old man was in bed and weak with fever but at seeing richard he managed to raise himself on one elbow oh its you he exclaimed mockingly when a rich man is sick the anxious heirs crowd around him but theyre twice as honestly anxious when he is perfectly well i came to see if i could do anything for you cried richard with a ferocious glare and in a tone that went curiously with his words and shook to the foundations his character of good samaritan the only thing you can do for me is to go away ill do that with pleasure retorted richard bitterly and richard went vowing he would never set foot across the threshold again he could not help having ugly thoughts why should all the efforts to bring about a reconciliation and all the forbearance be on his side thenceforth the crabbed old man might go to perdition if he wanted to and now here was richard meditating a visit to that same house to beg a favor nothing but his love for margaret could have dragged him to such a banquet of humblepie as he knew was spread for his delectation the morning he passed up the main street of stillwater and turned into welchs court as richard laid his hand on the latch of the gate mr shackford who was digging in the front garden looked up and saw him without paying any heed to richards amicable salutation the old man left the shovel sticking in the sod and walked stiffly into the house at another moment this would have amused richard but now he gravely followed his kinsman and overtook him at the foot of the staircase cousin shackford can you spare me five or ten minutes dont know as i can said mr shackford with one foot on the lower stair time is valuable what do you want you want something certainly or i wouldnt think of trespassing on your time has slocum thrown you over inquired the old man turning quickly a straw which he held between his thin lips helped to give him a singularly alert expression no mr slocum and i agree the best in the world i want to talk with you briefly on certain matters i want to be on decent terms with you if you will let me decent terms means money doesnt it asked mr shackford with a face as wary and lean as a sharks i do wish to talk about money among other things returned richard whom this brutal directness disconcerted a little money on satisfactory security you can get it anywhere with that so i might and be asking no favor but i would rather get it of you and consider it an obligation i would rather you wouldnt listen to me a moment well im listening mr shackford stood in an attitude of attention with his head canted on one side his eyes fixed on the ceiling and the straw between his teeth tilted up at an angle of forty degrees i have as you know worked my way in the marble yard to the position of general manager began richard i didnt know said mr shackford but i understand youre a sort of head gravestone maker that is taking a rather gloomy view of it said richard but no matter the point is i hold a responsible position and i now have a chance to purchase a share in the works slocum is willing to take you in eh yes then the concern is hit hit slocum is going into bankruptcy you are wrong there the yard was never so prosperous the coming year we shall coin money like a mint you ought to know said mr shackford ruminatively a thing as good as a mint must be a good thing if i were a partner in the business i could marry margaret whos margaret mr slocums daughter thats where the wind is now how much capital would it take to do all that inquired mr shackford with an air of affable speculation three or four thousand dollars perhaps less well i wouldnt give three or four cents to have you marry slocums daughter richard you cant pull any chestnuts out of the fire with my paw mr shackfords interrogation and his more than usual conciliatory manner had lighted a hope which richard had not brought with him its sudden extinguishment was in consequence doubly aggravating slocums daughter repeated mr shackford id as soon you would marry crazy nan up at the workhouse the association of crazy nan with margaret sent a red flush into richards cheek he turned angrily towards the door and then halted recollecting the resolve he had made not to lose his temper come what would if the interview was to end there it had better not have taken place i had no expectation that you would assist me pecuniarily said richard after a moment let us drop the money question it shouldnt have come up between us i want you to aid me not by lending me money but by giving me your countenance as the head of the family by showing a natural interest in my affairs and seeming disposed to promote them by just seeming that is really all i desire if you were to propose to put capital into the concern mr slocum would refuse it slocum would refuse it why in the devil should he refuse it because richard hesitated finding himself unexpectedly on delicate ground because he would not care to enter into business relations with you under the circumstances mr shackford removed the straw from his mouth and holding it between his thumb and forefinger peered steadily through his halfclosed eyelids at richard i dont understand you the dispute you had long ago over the piece of meadow land behind the marble yard mr slocum felt that you bore on him rather heavily in that matter and has not quite forgiven you for forcing him to rebuild the sheds bother slocum and his sheds i understand him what i dont understand is you i am to offer slocum three or four thousand dollars to set you up and he is to decline to take it is that it that is not it at all returned richard my statement was this if you were to propose purchasing a share for me in the works mr slocum would not entertain the proposition thinking as i dont think that he would mortify you by the refusal of your money the only way slocum could mortify me would be by getting hold of it but what are you driving at anyhow in one breath you demand several thousand dollars and in the next breath you tell me that nobody expects it or wants it or could be induced to have it on any terms perhaps you will inform me what you are here for that is what you will never discover cried richard it is not in you to comprehend the ties of sympathy that ought to hold between two persons situated as we are in most families this sympathy binds closely at times at christenings or burials or when some member is about to take an important step in life generally speaking blood is thicker than water but your blood cousin shackford seems to be a good deal thinner i came here to consult with you as my sole remaining kinsman as one authorized by years and position to give me wise counsel and kindly encouragement at the turning point in my fortune i didnt wish to go among those people like a tramp with neither kith nor kin to say a word for me of course you dont understand that how should you a sentiment of that kind is something quite beyond your conception richards words went into one ear and out the other without seeming for an instant to arrest mr shackfords attention the idea of slocum not accepting money anybodys money presented itself to mr shackford in so facetious a light as nearly to throw him into good humor his foot was on the first step of the staircase which he now began slowly to mount giving vent as he ascended to a series of indescribable chuckles at the top of the landing he halted and leaned over the rail to think of slocum refusing thats a good one in the midst of his jocularity a sudden thought seemed to strike mr shackford his features underwent a swift transformation and as he grasped the rail in front of him with both hands a malicious cunning writhed and squirmed in every wrinkle of his face sir he shrieked it was a trap slocum would have taken it if i had been ass enough to make any such offer he would have jumped at it what do you and slocum take me for youre a pair of rascals richard staggered back bewildered and blinded as if he had received a blow in the eyes no continued mr shackford with a gesture of intense contempt you are less than rascals you are fools a rascal has to have brains you shameless old man cried richard as soon as he could get his voice to do mr shackford justice he was thoroughly convinced that richard had lent himself to a preposterous attempt to obtain money from him the absence of ordinary shrewdness in the method stamped it at once as belonging to slocum of whose mental calibre mr shackford entertained no flattering estimate slocum he muttered grinding the word between his teeth family ties he cried hurling the words scornfully over the banister as he disappeared into one of the upper chambers richard stood with one hand on the newelpost white at the lip with rage for a second he had a wild impulse to spring up the staircase but controlling this he turned and hurried out of the house at the gate he brushed roughly against a girl who halted and stared it was a strange thing to see mr richard shackford who always had a pleasant word for a body go by in that blind excited fashion striking one fist into the palm of the other hand and talking to his own self mary hennessey watched him until he wheeled out of welchs court and then picking up her basket which she had rested on the fence went her way xii at the main entrance to the marble works richard nearly walked over a man who was coming out intently mopping his forehead with a very dirty calico handkerchief it was an english stonedresser named denyven richard did not recognize him at first that you denyven what has happened ive ad a bit of a scrimmage sir a scrimmage in the yard in work hours the man nodded with whom torrini sir hes awful bad this day torrini it is always torrini it seems odd that one man should be everlastingly at the bottom of everything wrong how did it happen give it to me straight denyven i dont want a crooked story this thing has got to stop in slocums yard the way of it was this sir torrini wasnt at the shop this morning he ad a day off i know but about one oclock sir he come in the yard he ad been at the public ouse sir and he was hummin first he went among the carvers talking hitalian to em and making em laugh though he was in a precious bad humor hisself by and by he come over to where me and my mates was and began chaffin us which we didnt mind it seeing he was eavy in the ead he was as clear as a fog orn all the same but when he took to banging the tools on the blocks i sings out ands off and then he fetched me a clip i was never looking for nothing less than that hed hit me i was a smiling at the hinstant he must be drunker than usual hevidently sir i went down between two slabs as soft as you please when i got on my pins i was for choking him a bit but my mates hauled us apart thats the ole of it sir theyll tell you the same within are you hurt denyven only a bit of a scratch over the heye sir and the nose and the man began mopping his brow tenderly id like to ave that hitalian for about ten minutes some day when hes sober over yonder on the green im afraid he would make the ten minutes seem long to you well sir id willingly let him try his and how is it denyven said richard that you and sensible workingmen like you have permitted such a quarrelsome and irresponsible fellow to become a leader in the association hes secretary or something isnt he well sir he writes an uncommonly clean fist and then hes a born horator hes up to all the parlimentary dodges must ave ad no end of hexperience in them sort of things on the other side no doubt and that accounts for him being over here as for horganizing a meeting sir i know torrini has a great deal of that kind of ability perhaps a trifle too much for his own good or anybody elses there was never any trouble to speak of among the trades in stillwater till he and two or three others came here with foreign grievances these men get three times the pay they ever received in their own land and are treated like human beings for the first time in their lives but what do they do they squander a quarter of their weeks wages at the tavern no rich man could afford to put a fourth of his income into drink and make windy speeches at the union i dont say all of them but too many of them the other night i understand torrini compared mr slocum to nero mr slocum the fairest and gentlest man that ever breathed what rubbish it wasnt just that way sir his words was and i eard him from nero down to slocum it amounts to the same thing and is enough to make one laugh if he didnt make one want to swear i hear that that was a very lively meeting the other night what was that nonsense about the privileged class well there is a privileged class in the states so there is but its a large class denyven every soul of us has the privilege of bettering out condition if we have the brain and the industry to do it energy and intelligence come to the front and have the right to be there a skillful workman gets double the pay of a bungler and deserves it of course there will always be rich and poor and sick and sound and i dont see how that can be changed but no door is shut against ability black or white before the year we shall have a chromeyellow president and a blackandtan secretary of the treasury but seriously denyven whoever talks about privileged classes here does it to make mischief there are certain small politicians who reap their harvest in times of public confusion just as pickpockets do nobody can play the tyrant or the bully in this country not even a workingman heres the association dead against an employer who two years ago ran his yard fullhanded for a twelvemonth at a loss rather than shut down as every other mill and factory in stillwater did for years and years the association has prevented this employer from training more than two apprentices annually the result is eighty hands find work instead of a hundred and eighty now that cant last it keeps wages fixed in stillwater sir it keeps out a hundred workmen it sends away capital torrini says sir steer clear of torrini and what he says hes a dangerous fellow for his friends it is handsome in you denyven to speak up for him with that eye of yours oh i dont love the man when it comes to that but theres no denying hes right smart replied denyven who occasionally marred his vernacular with americanisms the association couldnt do without him but slocums yard can said richard irritated to observe the influence torrini exerted on even such men as denyven thats between you and him sir of course but but what well sir i cant say hexactly but if i was you i would bide a bit no i think torrinis time has come i dont make bold to advise you sir i merely throws out the hobservation with that denyven departed to apply to his bruises such herbs and simples as a long experience had taught him to be efficacious he had gone only a few rods however when it occurred to him that there were probabilities of a stormy scene in the yard so he turned on his tracks and followed richard shackford torrini was a neapolitan who had come to the country seven or eight years before he was a man above the average intelligence of his class a marble worker by trade but he had been a fisherman a mountain guide among the abruzzi a soldier in the papal guard and what not and had contrived to pick up two or three languages among the rest english which he spoke with purity his lingual gift was one of his misfortunes among the exotics in stillwater which even boasted a featureless celestial who had unobtrusively extinguished himself with a stovepipe hat torrini was the only figure that approached picturesqueness with his swarthy complexion and large indolent eyes in which a southern ferocity slept lightly he seemed to richard a piece out of his own foreign experience to him torrini was the crystallization of italy or so much of that italy as richard had caught a glimpse of at genoa to the townfolks torrini perhaps vaguely suggested handorgans and eleemosynary pennies but richard never looked at the straightlimbed handsome fellow without recalling the phrygiancapped sailors of the mediterranean on this account and for other reasons richard had taken a great fancy to the man torrini had worked in the ornamental department from the first and was a rapid and expert carver when he chose he had carried himself steadily enough in the beginning but in these later days as mr slocum had stated he was scarcely ever sober richard had stood between him and his discharge on several occasions partly because he was so skillful a workman and partly through pity for his wife and children who were unable to speak a word of english but torrinis influence on the men in the yard especially on the younger hands who needed quite other influences and his intemperate speeches at the tradesunion where he had recently gained a kind of ascendancy by his daring were producing the worst effects at another hour richard might have been inclined to condone this last offense as he had condoned others but when he parted from denyven richards heart was still hot with his cousins insult as he turned into the yard not with his usual swinging gait but with a quick wide step there was an unpleasant dilation about young shackfords nostrils torrini was seated on a block of granite in front of the upper sheds flourishing a small chisel in one hand and addressing the men a number of whom had stopped work to listen to him at sight of richard they made a show of handling their tools but it was so clear something grave was going to happen that the pretense fell through they remained motionless resting on their mallets with their eyes turned towards richard torrini followed the general glance and pause din his harangue talk of the devil he muttered and then apparently continuing the thread of his discourse broke into a strain of noisy declamation richard walked up to him quietly torrini he said you cant be allowed to speak here you know i can speak where i like replied torrini gravely he was drunk but the intoxication was not in his tongue his head as denyven had asserted was as clear as a foghorn when you are sober you can come to the desk and get your pay and your kit you are discharged from the yard richard was standing within two paces of the man who looked up with an uncertain smile as if he had not quite taken in the sense of the words then suddenly straightening himself he exclaimed slocum dont dare do it but i do you when i do a thing mr slocum backs me but who backs slocum the association may be certainly the association ought to i want you to leave the yard now he backs slocum said torrini settling himself on the block again and slocum backs down at which there was a laugh among the men richard made a step forward hands off cried a voice from under the sheds who said that demanded richard wheeling around no one answered but richard had recognized durgins voice torrini if you dont quit the yard in two minutes by the clock yonder i shall put you out by the neck do you understand torrini glared about him confusedly for a moment and broke into voluble italian then without a warning gesture sprung to his feet and struck at richard a straight red line running vertically the length of his cheek showed where the chisel had grazed him the shops were instantly in a tumult the men dropping their tools and stumbling over the blocks with cries of keep them apart shame on you look out mr shackford is it mad ye are torrany cried michael hennessey hurrying from the sawbench durgin held him back by the shoulders let them alone said durgin the flat steel flashed again in the sunlight but fell harmlessly and before the blow could be repeated richard had knitted his fingers in torrinis neckerchief and twisted it so tightly that the man gasped holding him by this richard dragged torrini across the yard and let him drop on the sidewalk outside the gate where he lay in a heap inert that was nate said michael hennessey sententiously richard stood leaning on the gatepost to recover he breath his face was colorless and the crimson line defined itself sharply against the pallor but the rage was dead within him it had been one of his own kind of rages like lightning out of a blue sky as he stood there a smile was slowly gathering on his lip a score or two of the men had followed him and now lounged in a halfcircle a few paces in the rear when richard was aware of their presence the glow came into his eyes again who ordered you to knock off work that was a foul blow of torrinis sir said stevens stepping forward and i for one come to see fair play give us your and mate cried denyven theres a pair of us thanks said richard softening at once but theres no need every man can go to his job denyven may stay if he likes the men lingered a moment irresolute and returned to the sheds in silence presently torrini stretched out one leg then the other and slowly rose to his feet giving a stupid glance at his empty hands as he did so heres your tool said richard stirring the chisel with the toe of his boot if thats what youre looking for torrini advanced a step as if to pick it up then appeared to alter his mind hesitated perhaps a dozen seconds and turning abruptly on his heel walked down the street without a stagger i think his legs is shut off from the rest of his body by watertight compartments remarked denyven regarding torrinis steady gait with mingled amusement and envy are you hurt sir only a bit of a scratch of the heye replied richard with a laugh as i hobserved just now to mr stevens sir theres a pair of us xiii after a turn through the shops to assure himself that order was restored richard withdrew in the direction of his studio margaret was standing at the head of the stairs half hidden by the scarlet creeper which draped that end of the veranda what are you doing there said richard looking up with a bright smile oh richard i saw it all you didnt see anything worth having white cheeks about but he struck you with the knife did he not said margaret clinging to his arm anxiously he didnt have a knife dear only a small chisel which couldnt hurt any one see for yourself it is merely a catscratch margaret satisfied herself that it was nothing more but she nevertheless insisted on leading richard into the workshop and soothing the slight inflammation with her handkerchief dipped in arnica and water the elusive faint fragrance of margarets hair as she busied herself about him would of itself have consoled richard for a deep wound all this pretty solicitude and ministration was new and sweet to him and when the arnica turned out to be cologne and scorched his cheek margarets remorse was so delicious that richard half wished the mixture had been aquafortis you shouldnt have been looking into the yard he said if i had known that you were watching us it would have distracted me when i am thinking of you i cannot think of anything else and i had need of my wits for a moment i happened to be on the veranda and was too frightened to go away why did you quarrel in giving margaret an account of the matter richard refrained from any mention of his humiliating visit to welchs court that morning he could neither speak of it nor reflect upon it with composure the cloud which shadowed his features from time to time was attributed by margaret to the affair in the yard but this is the end of it is it not she asked with troubled eyes you will not have any further words with him you neednt worry if torrini had not been drinking he would never have lifted his hand against me when he comes out of his present state he will be heartily ashamed of himself his tongue is the only malicious part of him if he hadnt a taste for drink and oratory if he was not a born horator as denyven calls him he would do well enough no richard hes a dreadful man i shall never forget his face it was some wild animals and you richard added margaret softly it grieved me to see you look like that i was wolfish for a moment i suppose things had gone wrong generally but if you are going to scold me margaret i would rather have some more arnica i am not going to scold but while you stood there so white and terrible so unlike yourself i felt that i did not know you richard of course you had to defend yourself when the man attacked you but i thought for an instant you would kill him not i said richard uneasily dreading anything like a rebuke from margaret i am mortified that i gave up to my anger there was no occasion if an intoxicated person were to wander into the yard papa would send for a constable and have the person removed your father is an elderly man returned richard not relishing this oblique criticism of his own simpler method what would be proper in his case would be considered cowardly in mine it was my duty to discharge the fellow and not let him dispute my authority i ought to have been cooler of course but i should have lost caste and influence with the men if i had shown the least personal fear of torrini if for example i had summoned somebody else to do what i didnt dare do myself i was brought up in the yard remember and to a certain extent i have to submit to being weighed in the yards own scales but a thing cannot be weighed in a scale incapable of containing it answered margaret the judgment of these rough uninstructed men is too narrow for such as you they quarrel and fight among themselves and have their ideas of daring but there is a higher sort of bravery the bravery of selfcontrol which i fancy they do not understand very well so their opinion of it is not worth considering however you know better than i no i do not said richard your instinct is finer than my reason but you are scolding me margaret no i am loving you she said softly how can i do that more faithfully than by being dissatisfied with anything but the best in you i wasnt at my best a while ago no richard i can never hope to be worthy of you but margaret protested against that having forced him to look at his action through her eyes she outdid him in humility and then the conversation drifted off into halfbreathed nothings which though they were satisfactory enough for these two would have made a third person yawn the occurrence at slocums yard was hotly discussed that night at the stillwater hotel discussions in that long low barroom where the latest village scandal always came to receive the finishing gloss were apt to be hot in their criticism of outside men and measures as well as in their mutual vivisections there was an unflinching directness among mr snellings guests which is not to be found in more artificial grades of society the popular verdict on young shackfords conduct was as might not have been predicted strongly in his favor he had displayed pluck and pluck of the tougher fibre was a quality held in so high esteem in stillwater that any manifestation of it commanded respect and young shackford had shown a great deal he had made short work of the most formidable man in the yard and given the rest to understand that he was not to be tampered with this had taken many by surprise for hitherto an imperturbable amiability had been the leading characteristic of slocums manager i didnt think he had it in him declared dexter well ye might replied michael hennessey look at the lads eye and the muscles of him he stands on his own two legs like a monumint so he does never saw a monument with two legs mike didnt ye wait till yere layin at the foot of one but yell wait many a day me boy yell be lucky if yere supploid with a headstone made out of a daleboard couldnt get a wooden headstone short of ireland mike retorted dexter with a laugh youd have to import it an so i will but it wont be got over in time if ye go on interruptin gintlemen when theyre discoorsin what was i sayin any way when the blackguard chipped in continued mr hennessey appealing to the company as he emptied the ashes from his pipe by knocking the bowl in the side of his chair you was talking of dick shackfords muscle said durgin and you never talked wider of the mark it doesnt take much muscle or much courage either to knock a man about when hes in liquor the two wasnt fairly matched you are right there durgin said stevens laying down his newspaper they werent fairly matched both men have the same pounds and inches but torrini had a weapon and that mad strength that comes to some folks with drink if shackford hadnt made a neat twist on the neckerchief he wouldnt have got off with a scratch shackford had no call to lay hands on him there you are wrong durgin replied stevens torrini had no call in the yard he was making a nuisance of himself shackford spoke to him and told him to go and when he didnt go shackford put him out and he put him out handsomely with neatness and dispatch as slocums prospectuses has it he was right all the time said piggott he didnt strike torrini before or after he was down and stood at the gate like a gentleman ready to give torrini his chance if he wanted it torrini didnt want it observed jemmy willson ther isnt nothing mean about torrini but he ad a dozen minds about coming back said denyven we ought to have got him out of the place quietly said jeff stavers that was our end of the mistake he is not a bad fellow but he shouldnt drink he was crazy to come to the yard when a man as a day off observed denyven and the beer isnt narsty he ad better stick to the public ouse oh you exclaimed durgin your opinion dont weigh you took a black eye of him yes i took a black heye and i can give one in a hemergency yes i gives and takes thats where we differ returned durgin i do a more genteel business i give and dont take unless youre uncommon careful said denyven pulling away at his pipe youll find yourself some day henlarging your business durgin pushed back his stool gentlemen gentlemen interposed mr snelling appearing from behind the bar with a lemonsqueezer in his hand well have no black eyes here that wasnt born so i am partial to them myself when nature gives them and i propose the health of miss molly hennessey with a sly glance at durgin who colored to be drank at the expense of the house name your taps gentlemen snelling me boy yed win the bird from the bush with yer beguilin ways yeve brought proud tears to the eyes of an aged parent and ill take a sup out of that highshowldered bottle which you kape under the counter for the gentlefolk in the other room a general laugh greeted mr hennesseys selection and peace was restored but the majority of those present were workmen from slocums and the event of the afternoon remained the uppermost theme shackford is a different build from slocum said piggott i guess the yard will find that out when he gets to be proprietor rejoined durgin clicking his spoon against the empty glass to attract snellings attention going to be proprietor is he some day or other answered durgin first hell step into the business and then into the family hes had his eye on slocums girl these four or five years got a cast of her fist up in his workshop leave dick shackford alone for lining his nest and making it soft all round why shouldnt he asked stevens he deserves a good girl and theres none better if sickness or any sort of trouble comes to a poor mans door shes never far off with her kind words and them things the rich have when they are laid up oh the girl is well enough you couldnt say less before your mother died mrs durgin had died the previous autumn i see that angil going to your house many a day with a little basket of comforts tucked under her wing but shes too good to be praised in such a place as this added stevens after a pause he inquired what makes you down on shackford he has always been a friend to you one of those friends who walk over your head replied durgin i was in the yard two years before him and see where he is lord love you said stevens leaning back in his chair and contemplating durgin thoughtfully there is marble and marble some is carrara marble and some isnt the fine grain takes a polish you cant get on to the other of course he is statuary marble and im full of seams and feldspar you are like the most of us not the kind that can be worked up into anything very ornamental thank you for nothing said durgin turning away i came from as good a quarry as ever dick shackford wheres torrini tonight nobody has seen him since the difficulty said dexter except peters torrini sent for him after supper as dexter spoke the door opened and peters entered he went directly to the group composed chiefly of slocums men and without making any remark began to distribute among them certain small blue tickets which they pocketed in silence glancing carelessly at his piece of cardboard durgin said to peters then its decided peters nodded hows torrini hes all right what does he say nothing in perticular responded peters and nothing at all about his little skylark with shackford hes a cool one exclaimed durgin though the slips of blue pasteboard had been delivered and accepted without comment it was known in a second through the barroom that a special meeting had been convened for the next night by the officers of the marble workers association xiv on the third morning after torrinis expulsion from the yard mr slocum walked into the studio with a printed slip in his hand a similar slip lay crumpled under a workbench where richard had tossed it mr slocums kindly visage was full of trouble and perplexity as he raised his eyes from the paper which he had been rereading on the way upstairs look at that yes remarked richard i have been honored with one of those documents what does it mean it means business the paper in question contained a series of resolutions unanimously adopted at a meeting of the marble workers association of stillwater held in grimseys hall the previous night dropping the preamble these resolutions which were neatly printed with a typewriting machine on a half letter sheet ran as follows resolved that on and after the first of june proximo the pay of carvers in slocums marble yard shall be per day instead of as heretofore resolved that on and after the same date the rubbers and polishers shall have per day instead of as heretofore resolved that on and after the same date the millmen are to have per day instead of as heretofore resolved that during the months of june july and august the shops shall knock off work on saturdays at five pm instead of at six pm resolved that a printed copy of these resolutions be laid before the proprietor of slocums marble yard and that his immediate attention to them be respectfully requested per order of committee m w a torrini is at the bottom of that said mr slocum i hardly think so this arrangement as i told you the other day before i had the trouble with him has been in contemplation several weeks undoubtedly torrini used his influence to hasten the movement already planned the association has too much shrewdness to espouse the quarrel of an individual what are we to do if you are in the same mind you were when we talked over the possibility of an unreasonable demand like this there is only one thing to do fight it fight it i have been resolute and all that sort of thing in times past observed mr slocum glancing out of the tail of his eye at richard and have always come off second best the association has drawn up most of my rules for me and had its own way generally since my time you have never been in so strong a position to make a stand we have got all the larger contracts out of the way foreseeing what was likely to come i have lately fought shy of taking new ones here are heavy orders from rafter son the builders company and others we must decline them by tonights mail is it really necessary asked mr slocum knitting his forehead into what would have been a scowl if his mild pinkish eyebrows had permitted it i think so i hate to do that then we are at the mercy of the association if we do not come to their terms you seriously believe they will strike i do replied richard and we should be in a pretty fix but these demands are ridiculous the men are not aware of our situation they imagine we have a lot of important jobs on hand as usual at this season formerly the foreman of a shop had access to the orderbook but for the last year or two i have kept it in the safe here the other day dexter came to me and wanted to see what work was set down ahead in the blotter but i had an inspiration and didnt let him post himself is not some kind of compromise possible suggested mr slocum looking over the slip again now this fourth clause about closing the yard an hour early on saturdays i dont strongly object to that though with eighty hands it means every week eighty hours work which the yard pays for and doesnt get i should advise granting that request such concessions are never wasted but mr slocum this is not going to satisfy them they have thrown in one reasonable demand merely to flavor the rest i happen to know that they are determined to stand by their programme to the last letter you know that i have a friend at court of course this is not to be breathed but denyven without being at all false to his comrades talks freely with me he says they are resolved not to give an inch then we will close the works that is what i wanted you to say sir cried richard with this new scale of prices and plenty of work we might probably come out a little ahead the next six months but it wouldnt pay for the trouble and the capital invested then when trade slackened we should be running at a loss and thered be another wrangle over a reduction we had better lie idle stick to that sir and may be it will not be necessary but if they strike they wont all strike at least added richard i hope not i have indirectly sounded several of the older hands and they have half promised to hold on only half promised for every man of them at heart fears the tradesunion more than nobread until nobread comes whom have you spoken with lumley giles peterson and some others your pensioners i call them yes they were in the yard in my fathers time they have not been worth their salt these ten years when the business was turned over to me i didnt discharge any old hand who had given his best days to the yard somehow i couldnt throw away the squeezed lemons an employer owes a good workman something beyond the wages paid and a workman owes a good employer something beyond the work done you stood by these men after they outlived their usefulness and if they do not stand by you now theyre a shabby set i fancy they will richard i think they had better and i wish they would we have enough odds and ends to keep them busy awhile and i shouldnt like to have the clinking of chisels die out altogether under the old sheds nor i returned mr slocum with a touch of sadness in his intonation it has grown to be a kind of music to me and he paused to listen to the sounds of ringing steel that floated up from the workshop whatever happens that music shall not cease in the yard except on sundays if i have to take the mallet and go at a slab all alone slocums yard with a single workman in it would be a pleasing spectacle said mr slocum smiling ruefully it wouldnt be a bad time for that workman to strike returned richard with a laugh he could dictate his own terms returned mr slocum soberly well i suppose you cannot help thinking about margaret but dont think of her now tell me what answer you propose to give the association how you mean to put it for i leave the matter wholly to you i shall have no hand in it further than to indorse your action tomorrow then said richard for it is no use to hurry up a crisis i shall go to the workshops and inform them that their request for short hours on saturdays is granted but that the other changes they suggest are not to be considered there will never be a better opportunity mr slocum to settle another question which has been allowed to run too long whats that the apprentice question would it be wise to touch on that at present while we are straightening out matters and putting things on a solid basis it seems to me essential to settle that there was never a greater imposition or one more shortsighted than this rule which prevents the training of sufficient workmen the tradesunion will discover their error some day when they have succeeded in forcing manufacturers to import skilled labor by the wholesale i would like to tell the marble workers association that slocums yard has resolved to employ as many apprentices each year as there is room for i wouldnt dare risk it it will have to be done sooner or later it would be a capital flank movement now they have laid themselves open to an attack on that quarter i might as well close the gates for good and all so you will if it comes to that you can afford to close the gates and they cant afford to have you in a week theyd be back asking you to open them then you could have your pick of the live hands and drop the dead wood if giles or peterson or lumley or any of those desert us they are not to be let on again i hope you will promise me that sir if the occasion offers you shall reorganize the shops in your own way i havent the nerve for this kind of business though i have seen a great deal of it in the villages first and last strikes are terrible mistakes even when they succeed what pays for the lost time and the money squandered over the tavernbar what makes up for the days or weeks when the fire was out on the hearth and the children had no bread that is what happens you know there is no remedy for such calamities richard answered yet i can imagine occasions when it would be better to let the fire go out and the children want for bread you are not advocating strikes exclaimed mr slocum why not i thought you were for fighting them so i am in this instance but the question has two sides every man has the right to set a price on his own labor and to refuse to work for less the wisdom of it is another matter he puts himself in the wrong only when he menaces the person or the property of the man who has an equal right not to employ him that is the blunder strikers usually make in the end and one by which they lose public sympathy even when they are fighting an injustice now sometimes it is an injustice that is being fought and then it is right to fight it with the only weapon a poor man has to wield against a power which possesses a hundred weapons and thats a strike for example the smelters and casters in the miantowona iron works are meanly underpaid what have they struck theres a general strike threatened in the village foundrymen spinners and all so much the worse for everybody i did not suppose it was as bad as that what has become of torrini the day after he left us he was taken on as forgeman at danas i am glad dana has got him at the meeting last night torrini gave in his resignation as secretary of the association being no longer a marble worker he was not qualified to serve we unhorsed him then rather i am half sorry too richard said mr slocum halting in one of his nervous walks up and down the room you are the oddest composition of hardness and softness i ever saw am i one moment you stand braced like a lion to fight the whole yard and the next moment you are pitying a miscreant who would have laid your head open without the slightest compunction oh i forgive him said richard i was a trifle hasty myself margaret thinks so too much margaret knows about it i was inconsiderate to say the least when a man picks up a tool by the wrong end he must expect to get cut you didnt have a choice i shouldnt have touched torrini after discharging him and finding him disposed to resist my order to leave the yard i ought to have called in a constable usually it is very hard to anger me but three or four times in my life i have been carried away by a devil of a temper which i couldnt control it seized me so unawares that was one of the times the mallets and chisels were executing a blithe staccato movement in the yard below and making the sparks dance no one walking among the diligent gangs and observing the placid faces of the men as they bent over their tasks would have suspected that they were awaiting the word that meant bread and meat and home to them as richard passed through the shops dropping a word to a workman here and there the man addressed looked up cheerfully and made a furtive dab at the brown paper cap and richard returned the salute smilingly but he was sad within the foolish fellows he said to himself they are throwing away a full loaf and are likely to get none at all giles and two or three of the ancients were squaring a block of marble under a shelter by themselves richard made it a point to cross over and speak to them in past days he had not been exacting with these old boys and they always had a welcome for him slocums yard seldom presented a serener air of contented industry than it wore that morning but in spite of all this smooth outside it was a foregone conclusion with most of the men that slocum with shackford behind him would never submit to the new scale of wages there were a few who had protested against these resolutions and still disapproved of them but were forced to go with the association which had really been dragged into the current by the other trades the dana mills and the miantowona iron works were paying lighter wages than similar establishments nearer the great city the managers contended that they were paying as high if not higher rates taking into consideration the cheaper cost of living in stillwater but you get city prices for your wares retorted the union you dont pay city rents and you shall pay city wages meetings were held at grimseys hall and the subject was canvassed at first calmly and then stormily among the molders and possibly the sheetiron workers there was cause for dissatisfaction but the dissatisfaction spread to where no grievance existed it seized upon the spinners and finally upon the marble workers torrini fanned the flame there taking for his text the rentage question he argued that slocum was well able to give a trifle more for labor than his city competitors the annual rent of a yard like slocums would be four thousand or five thousand dollars in the city it doesnt cost slocum two hundred dollars it is no more than just that the laborer should have a share he only asks a beggarly share of the prosperity which he has helped to build up this was specious and taking then there came down from the great city a glib person disguised as the workingmans friend no workingman himself mind you but a ghoul that lives upon subscriptions and sucks the senses out of innocent human beings who managed to set the place by the ears the result of all which was that one may morning every shop mill and factory in stillwater was served with a notice from the tradesunion and a general strike threatened but our business at present is exclusively with slocums yard xv since we are in for it said mr slocum the next morning put the case to them squarely mr slocums vertebrж had stiffened over night leave that to me sir richard replied i have been shaping out in my mind a little speech which i flatter myself will cover the points they have brought this thing upon themselves and we are about to have the clearest of understandings i never saw the men quieter i dont altogether admire that it looks as if they hadnt any doubt as to the issue the clearestheaded have no doubt they know as well as you and i do the flimsiness of those resolutions but the thick heads are in a fog every man naturally likes his pay increased if a simple fellow is told five or six hundred times that his wages ought to be raised the idea is so agreeable and insidious that by and by he begins to believe himself grossly underpaid though he may be getting twice what he is worth he doesnt reason about it thats the last thing hell do for you in this mood he lets himself be flown away by the breath of some loudmouthed demagogue who has no interest in the matter beyond hearing his own talk and passing round the hat after the meeting is over that is what has happened to our folks below but they are behaving handsomely yes and i dont like it since seven oclock the most unimpeachable decorum had reigned in the workshops it was now nine and this brief dialogue had occurred between mr slocum and richard on the veranda just as the latter was on the point of descending into the yard to have his talk with the men the workshops or rather the shed in which the workshops were for it was one low structure eighteen or twenty feet wide and open on the west side ran the length of the yard and with the short extension at the southerly end formed the letter l there were no partitions an imaginary line separating the different gangs of workers a person standing at the head of the building could make himself heard more or less distinctly in the remotest part the grating lisp of the wet saws eating their way into the marble boulder and the irregular quick taps of the seventy or eighty mallets were not suspended as richard took his stand beside a tall funereal urn at the head of the principal workshop after a seconds faltering he rapped smartly on the lip of the urn with the key of his studiodoor instantly every arm appeared paralyzed and the men stood motionless with the tools in their hands richard began in a clear but not loud voice though it seemed to ring on the sudden silence mr slocum has asked me to say a few words to you this morning about those resolutions and one or two other matters that have occurred to him in this connection i am no speechmaker i never learned that trade never learned any trade muttered durgin inaudibly but i think i can manage some plain honest talk for straightforward men richards exordium was listened to with painful attention in the first place he continued i want to remind you especially the newer men that slocums yard has always given steady work and prompt pay to stillwater hands no hand has ever been turned off without sufficient cause or kept on through mere favoritism favors have been shown but they have been shown to all alike if anything has gone crooked it has been straightened out as soon as mr slocum knew of it that has been the course of the yard in the past and the proprietor doesnt want you to run away with the idea that that course is going to be changed one change for the time being is going to be made at our own suggestion from now until the st of september this yard will close gates on saturdays at five pm instead of six pm several voices cried good for slocum wheres slocum why dont slocum speak for himself cried one voice it is mr slocums habit answered richard to give his directions to me i give them to the foremen and the foremen to the shops mr slocum follows that custom on this occasion with regard to the new scale of wages which the association has submitted to him the proprietor refuses to accept it or any modification of it a low murmur ran through the workshops whats a modificashun sir asked jemmy willson stepping forward and scratching his left ear diffidently a modification replied richard considerably embarrassed to give an instant definition is a a a splitting of the difference by shouted somebody in the third shop thank you said richard glancing in the direction of his impromptu websters unabridged mr slocum does not propose to split the difference the wages in every department are to be just what they are neither more nor less if anybody wishes to make a remark he added observing a restlessness in several of the men i beg he will hold on until i get through i shall not detain you much longer as the parson says before he has reached the middle of his sermon what i say now i was charged to make particularly clear to you it is this in future mr slocum intends to run slocums yard himself neither you nor i nor the association will be allowed to run it for him sensation until now the association has tied him down to two apprentices a year from this hour out mr slocum will take on not two or twenty but two hundred apprentices if the business warrants it the words were not clearly off richards lips when the foreman of the shop in which he was speaking picked up a couple of small drills and knocked them together with a sharp click in an instant the men laid aside their aprons bundled up their tools and marched out of the shed two by two in dead silence that same click was repeated almost simultaneously in the second shop and the same evolution took place then click click click went the drills sounding fainter and fainter in the distant departments and in less than three minutes there was not a soul left in slocums yard except the orator of the day richard had anticipated some demonstration either noisy or violent perhaps both but this solemn orderly desertion dashed him he stepped into the middle of the yard and glancing up beheld margaret and mr slocum standing on the veranda even at that distance he could perceive the pallor on one face and the consternation written all over the other hanging his head with sadness richard crossed the yard which gave out mournful echoes to his footfalls and swung to the large gate nearly catching old giles by the heel as he did so looking through the slats he saw lumley and peterson hobbling arm in arm down the street after more than twentyfive years of kindly treatment move number one said richard lifting the heavy crosspiece into its place and fastening it with a wooden pin now i must go and prop up mr slocum xvi there is no solitude which comes so near being tangible as that of a vast empty workshop crowded a moment since the busy intense life that has gone from it mysteriously leaves behind enough of itself to make the stillness poignant one might imagine the invisible ghost of doomed toil wandering from bench to bench and noiselessly fingering the dropped tools still warm from the workmans palm perhaps this impalpable presence is the artisans anxious thought stolen back to brood over the uncompleted task though mr slocum had spoken lightly of slocums yard with only one workman in it when he came to contemplate the actual fact he was struck by the pathos of it and the resolution with which he awoke that morning began to desert him the worst is over exclaimed richard joining his two friends on the veranda and everything went smoother than i expected everything went sure enough said mr slocum gloomily they all went old giles and lumley and everybody we somewhat expected that you know yes i expected it and wasnt prepared for it it was very bad said richard shaking his head the desertion of giles and his superannuated mates especially touched mr slocum bad is no word it was damnable oh papa pardon me dear i couldnt help it when a mans pensioners throw him over he must be pretty far gone the undertow was too strong for them sir and they were swept away with the rest and they all but promised to stay they will be the very first to come back of course we shall have to take the old fellows on again said mr slocum relenting characteristically never cried richard i wish i had some of your grit i have none to spare to tell the truth when i stood up there to speak with every eye working on me like a halfinch drill i would have sold myself at a low figure but you were a perfect whatshisname demosthenes said mr slocum with a faint smile we could hear you i dont believe demosthenes ever moved an audience as i did mine cried richard gaily if his orations produced a like effect i am certain that the grecian lecturebureau never sent him twice to the same place i dont think richard i would engage you over again i am sure richard spoke very well interrupted margaret his speech was short say shortened margaret for i hadnt got through when they left no i will not jest about it it is too serious for jesting what is to become of the families of all these men suddenly thrown out of employment they threw themselves out mag said her father that does not mend the matter papa there will be great destitution and suffering in the village with every mill closed and they are all going to close bridget says thank heaven that this did not happen in the winter they always pick their weather observed mr slocum it will not be for long said richard encouragingly our own hands and the spinners who had no ground for complaint will return to work shortly and the managers of the iron mills will have to yield a point or two in a week at the outside everything will be running smoothly and on a sounder foundation than before i believe the strike will be an actual benefit to everybody in the end by dint of such arguments and his own sanguine temperament richard succeeded in reassuring mr slocum for the time being though richard did not hide from himself the gravity of the situation there was a general strike in the village eight hundred men were without work that meant or would mean in a few days two or three thousand women and children without bread it does not take the wolf long to reach a poor mans door when it is left ajar the tradesunion had a fund for emergencies of this sort and some outside aid might be looked for but such supplies are in their nature precarious and soon exhausted it is a noticeable feature of strikes that the moment the workmans pay stops his living expenses increase even the more economical becomes improvident if he has money the tobacco shop and the tavern are likely to get more of it than the butchers cart the prolonged strain is too great to be endured without stimulant xvii during the first and second days of the strike stillwater presented an animated and even a festive appearance throngs of operatives in their sunday clothes strolled through the streets or lounged at the corners chatting with other groups some wandered into the suburbs and lay in the long grass under the elms others again though these were few took to the turnpike or the railroad track and tramped across country it is needless to say that the barroom of the tavern was crowded from early morning down to the hour when the law compelled mr snelling to shut off his gas after which john browns soul could be heard marching on in the darkness through various crooked lanes and alleys until nearly daybreak among the earliest to scent trouble in the air was hanlin the chinaman before mentioned he kept a small laundry in mud lane where his name was painted perpendicularly on a light of glass in the basement window of a tenement house hanlin intended to be buried some day in a skyblue coffin in his own land and have a dozen packs of firecrackers decorously exploded over his remains in order to reserve himself for this and other ceremonies involving the burning of a great quantity of gilt paper he quietly departed for boston at the first sign of popular discontent as dexter described it hanlin coiled up his pigtail put forty grains of rice in a yallar bag enough to last him a month and toddled off in his twostory wooden shoes he could scarcely have done a wiser thing for poor hanlins laundry was turned wrong side out within thirtysix hours afterwards the strike was popular the spirit of it spread as fire and fever and all elemental forces spread the two apprentices in bracketts bakery had a dozen minds about striking that first morning the younger lad joe wiggin plucked up courage to ask brackett for a day off and was lucky enough to dodge a piece of dough weighing nearly four pounds brackett was making bread while the sun shone he knew that before the week was over there would be no cash customers and he purposed then to shut up shop on the third and fourth days there was no perceptible fall in the barometer trade was brisk with snelling and a brass band was playing national airs on a staging erected on the green in front of the postoffice nightly meetings took place at grimseys hall and the audiences were goodhumored and orderly torrini advanced some utopian theories touching a universal distribution of wealth which were listened to attentively but failed to produce deep impression thats a healthy idea of torrinis about dervidin up property said jemmy willson ive heerd it afore but its singler i never knowd a feller with any property to have that idea ther s a great dale in it i can tell ye replied michael hennessey with a wellblackened woodstock pipe between his teeth and his hands tucked under his coattails isnt ther misther stavens when michael had on his bottlegreen swallowtailed coat with the brass buttons he invariably assumed a certain lofty air of ceremony in addressing his companions it is sorter pleasant to look at returned stevens but it dont seem to me an idea that would work suppose that after all the property was divided a fresh shipload of your friends was to land at new york or boston would there be a new deal no sir by no means exclaimed michael excitedly the furreners is counted out but youre a foreigner yourself mike am i then bedad im not im a rale american know nothing well mike said stevens maliciously when it comes to a reglar division of lands and greenbacks in the united states i go in for the chinese having their share the chinese shouted michael oh murther misther stevens ye wouldnt be fur dividin with thim blatherskites yes with them as well as the rest returned stevens dryly meanwhile the directors and stockholders of the various mills took counsel in a room at the rear of the national bank mr slocum following richards advice declined to attend the meeting in person or to allow his name to figure on the list of vicepresidents why should we hitch our good cause to their doubtful one reflected richard we have no concessions or proposals to make when our men are ready to come back to us they will receive just wages and fair treatment they know that we do not want to fight the molders let the ironmills do their own fighting and richard stolidly employed himself in taking an account of stock and forwarding by express to their destination the ten or twelve carved mantelpieces that happily completed the last contract then his responsibilities shrunk to winding up the office clock and keeping mr slocum firmly on his legs the latter was by far the more onerous duty for mr slocum ran down two or three times in the course of every twentyfour hours while the clock once wound was fixed for the day if i could only have a good set of waltham works put into your father said richard to margaret after one of mr slocums relapses he would go better poor papa he is not a fighter like you your father is what i call a belligerent noncombatant richard was seeing a great deal of margaret these days mr slocum had invited him to sleep in the studio until the excitement was past margaret was afraid to have him take that long walk between the yard and his lodgings in lime street and then her father was an old man to be without any protection in the house in such untoward times so richard slept in the studio and had his plate at table like one of the family this arrangement was favorable to many a stolen five minutes with margaret in the hall or on the staircase in these fortuitous moments he breathed an atmosphere that sustained him in his task of dispelling mr slocums recurrent fits of despondency margaret had her duties too at this period and the forenoons were sacred to them one morning as she passed down the street with a small wicker basket on her arm richard said to mr slocum margaret has joined the strikers the time had already come to stillwater when many a sharpfaced little urchin as dear to the warm deep bosom that had nursed it as though it were a crown prince would not have had a crust to gnaw if margaret slocum had not joined the strikers sometimes her heart drooped on the way home from these errands upon seeing how little of the misery she could ward off on her rounds there was one cottage in a squalid lane where the children asked for bread in italian she never omitted to halt at that door is it quite prudent for margaret to be going about so queried mr slocum she is perfectly safe said richard as safe as a sister of charity which she is indeed margaret might then have gone loaded with diamonds through the streets at midnight there was not a rough man in stillwater who would not have reached forth an arm to shield her it is costing me nearly as much as it would to carry on the yard said mr slocum but i never put out any stamps more willingly you never took a better contract sir than when you agreed to keep margarets basket filled it is an investment in real estate hereafter i hope so answered mr slocum and i know its a good thing now of the morals of stillwater at this time or at any time the less said the better but out of the slime and ooze below sprang the white flower of charity the fifth day fell on a sabbath and the churches were crowded the rev arthur langly selected his text from st matthew chap xxii v render therefore unto cжsar the things which are cжsars but as he did not make it quite plain which was cжsar the tradesunion or the miantowona iron works the sermon went for nothing unless it could be regarded as a hint to those persons who had stolen a large piece of belting from the dana mills on the other hand father omeara that morning bravely told his children to conduct themselves in an orderly manner while they were out of work or they would catch it in this world and in the next on the sixth day a keen observer might have detected a change in the atmosphere the streets were thronged as usual and the idlers still wore their sunday clothes but the holiday buoyancy of the earlier part of the week had evaporated a turnout on the part of one of the trades though it was accompanied by music and a banner with a lively inscription failed to arouse general enthusiasm a serious and even a sullen face was not rare among the crowds that wandered aimlessly up and down the village on the seventh day it required no penetration to see the change there was decidedly less goodnatured chaffing and more drunkenness though snelling had invoked popular contumely and decimated his barroom by refusing to trust for drinks bracket had let his ovens cool and his shutters were up the treasury of the tradesunion was nearly drained and there were growlings that too much had been fooled away on banners and a brass band for the iron mens parade the previous forenoon it was when bracketts eye sighted the banner with bread or blood on it that he had put up his shutters torrini was now making violent harangues at grimseys hall to largely augmented listeners whom his words irritated without convincing shut off from the tavern the men flocked to hear him and the other speakers for born orators were just then as thick as unripe whortleberries there was nowhere else to go at home were reproaches that maddened and darkness for the kerosene had given out though all the trades had been swept into the movement it is not to be understood that every workman was losing his head there were men who owned their cottages and had small sums laid by in the savingsbank who had always sent their children to the district school and listened themselves to at least one of mr langlys sermons or one of father omearas discourses every sunday these were anchored to good order they neither frequented the barroom nor attended the conclaves at grimseys hall but deplored as deeply as any one the spirit that was manifesting itself they would have returned to work now if they had dared to this class belonged stevens why dont you come up to the hall nights asked durgin accosting him on the street one afternoon youd run a chance of hearing me hold forth some of these evenings youve answered your own question william i shouldnt like to see you making an idiot of yourself this is a square fight between labor and capital returned durgin with dignity and every man ought to take a hand in it william said stevens meditatively do you know about the siamese twins what about em theyre dead aint they replied durgin with surprise i believe so but when they was alive if you was to pinch one of those fellows the other fellow would sing out if you was to black the eye of the lefthand chap the righthand chap wouldnt have been able to see for a week when either of em fetched the other a clip he knocked himself down labor and capital is jined just as those two was when youve got this fact well into your skull william i shall be pleased to listen to your ideas at grimseys hall or anywhere else such conservatism as stevenss however was necessarily swept out of sight for the moment the wealthier citizens were in a state bordering on panic all but mr lemuel shackford in his flapping linen duster for the weather was very sultry now mr shackford was seen darting excitedly from street to street and hovering about the feverish crowds like the stormy petrel wheeling on the edges of a gale usually as chary of his sympathies as of his gold he astonished every one by evincing an abnormal interest in the strikers the old man declined to put down anything on the subscription paper then circulating but he put down his sympathies to any amount he held no stock in the concerns involved he hated slocum and he hated the directors of the miantowona iron works the least he hoped was that rowland slocum would be laid out so far the strikers had committed no overt act of note unless it was the demolition of hanlins laundry stubbs the provision dealer had been taught the rashness of exposing samples of potatoes in his doorway and the tonsorial emporium of professor brown a colored citizen had been invaded by two humorists who after having their hair curled refused to pay for it and the professor had been too agitated to insist the story transpiring ten or twelve of the boys had dropped in during the morning and got shaved on the same terms by golly genlmen expostulated the professor ef dis yah thing goes on dis darkey will be cleaned clar out fo de weeks done no act of real violence had been perpetrated as yet but with bands of lawless men roaming over the village at all hours of the day and night the situation was critical the wheel of what small social life there was in stillwater had ceased to revolve with the single exception of lemuel shackford the more respectable inhabitants kept indoors as much as practicable from the first neither mr craggie nor lawyer perkins had gone to the hotel to consult the papers in the readingroom and mr pinkham did not dare to play on his flute of an evening the rev arthur langly found it politic to do but little visiting in the parish his was not the pinion to buffet with a wind like this and indeed he was not explicitly called upon to do so he sat sorrowfully in his study day by day preparing the weekly sermon a gentle pensive person inclined in the best of weather to melancholia if mr langly had gone into arboriculture instead of into the ministry he would have planted nothing but weepingwillows in the mean time the mill directors continued their deliberations in the bank building and had made several abortive attempts to effect an arrangement with the leaders of the union this seemed every hour less possible and more necessary on the afternoon of the seventh day of the strike a crowd gathered in front of the residence of mr alexander the superintendent of the miantowona iron works and began groaning and hooting mr alexander sought out mr craggie and urged him as a man of local weight and one accustomed to addressing the populace to speak a few words to the mob that was setting mr craggie on the horns of a cruel dilemma he was afraid to disoblige the representative of so powerful a corporation as the miantowona iron works but he equally dreaded to risk his popularity with seven or eight hundred voters so like the crafty chancellor in tennysons poem he dallied with his golden chain and smiling but the question by drat the man muttered mr craggie does he want to blast my whole political career i cant pitch into our adopted countrymen there was a blot on the escutcheon of mr craggie which he was very anxious not to have uncovered by any chance in these latter days his ancient affiliation with the deceased native american party the mob dispersed without doing damage but the fact that it had collected and had shown an ugly temper sent a thrill of apprehension through the village mr slocum came in a great flurry to richard this thing ought to be stopped said mr slocum i agree to that replied richard bracing himself not to agree to anything else if we were to drop that stipulation as to the increase of apprentices no doubt many of the men would give over insisting on an advance our only salvation is to stick to our right to train as many workmen as we choose the question of wages is of no account compared with that the rate of wages will adjust itself if we could manage it somehow with the marble workers suggested mr slocum that would demoralize the other trades and theyd be obliged to fall in i dont see that they lack demoralization if something isnt done theyll end up by knocking in our front doors or burning us all up let them its very well to say let them exclaimed mr slocum petulantly when you havent any front door to be knocked in but i have you and margaret to consider if there were actual danger when anything like violence threatens theres an honest shoulder for every one of the hundred and fifty muskets in the armory those muskets might get on the wrong shoulders that isnt likely you do not seem to know sir that there is a strong guard at the armory day and night i was not aware of that it is a fact all the same said richard and mr slocum went away easier in his mind and remained so two or three hours on the eighth ninth and tenth days the clouds lay very black along the horizon the marble workers who began to see their mistake were reproaching the foundry men with enticing them into to coalition and the spinners were hot in their denunciations of the molders ancient personal antagonisms that had been slumbering started to their feet torrini fell out of favor and in the midst of one of his finest perorations uncomplimentary missiles selected from the animal kingdom had been thrown at him the grand torchlight procession on the night of the ninth culminated in a disturbance in which many men got injured several badly and the windows of bracketts bakery were stove in a point of light had pierced the darkness the trades were quarreling among themselves the selectmen had sworn in special constables among the citizens and some of the more retired streets were now patrolled after dark for there had been threats of incendiarism bishops stables burst into flames one midnight whether fired intentionally or accidentally was not known but the giant bellows at danas mills was slit and two belts were cut at the miantowona iron works that same night at this juncture a report that outoftown hands were coming to replace the strikers acted on the public mind like petroleum on fire a large body of workmen assembled near the railway station to welcome them there was another rumor which caused the marble workers to stare at each other aghast it was to the effect that mr slocum having long meditated retiring from business had now decided to do so and was consulting with wyndham the keeper of the greenhouse about removing the division wall and turning the marble yard into a peach garden this was an unlookedfor solution of the difficulty stillwater without any slocums marble yard was chaos come again good lord boys cried piggott if slocum should do that meanwhile snellings bar had been suppressed by the authorities and a posse of policemen borrowed from south millville occupied the premises knots of beetlebrowed men no longer in holiday gear but chiefly in their shirtsleeves collected from time to time at the head of the main street and glowered threateningly at the single policeman pacing the porch of the tavern the stillwater grays were under arms in the armory over dundons drugstore the thoroughfare had ceased to be safe for any one and margarets merciful errands were necessarily brought to an end how the poor creatures who had depended on her bounty now continued to exist was a sorrowful problem matters were at this point when on the morning of the thirteenth day richard noticed the cadaverous face of a man peering into the yard through the slats of the main gate richard sauntered down there with his hands in his pockets the man was old giles and with him stood lumley and peterson gazing thoughtfully at the sign outside no admittance except on business the roughly lettered clapboard which they had heedlessly passed a thousand times seemed to have taken a novel significance to them richard whats wanted there giles very affably we was lookin round for a job mr shackford richard we are not taking on any hands at present giles didnt know but you was somebody said you was richard somebody is mistaken giles prhaps tomorrow or nex day richard rather doubtful giles giles uneasily mr slocum aint goin to give up business is he richard why shouldnt he if it doesnt pay the business is carried on for his amusement and profit when the profit stops it wont be amusing any longer mr slocum is not going to run the yard for the sake of the marble workers association he would rather drive a junkcart he might be allowed to steer that himself giles oh richard goodmorning giles gikles mornin mr shackford richard rushed back to mr slocum the strike is broken sir what do you mean the thing has collapsed the tide is turning and has washed in a lot of dead wood thank god cried mr slocum an hour or so later a deputation of four consisting of stevens denyven durgin and piggott waited upon mr slocum in his private office and offered on behalf of all the departments to resume work at the old rates mr slocum replied that he had not objected to the old rates but the new and that he accepted their offer conditionally you have overlooked one point mr stevens which one sir the apprentices we thought you might not insist there sir i insist on conducting my own business in my own way the voice was the voice of slocum but the backbone was richards then sir the association dont object to a reasonable number of apprentices how many is that as many as you want i expect sir said stevens shuffling his feet very well stevens go round to the front gate and mr shackford will let you in there were two doors to the office one leading into the yard and the other by which the deputation had entered and was now making its exit opened upon the street richard heaved a vast sigh of relief as he took down the beam securing the principal entrance goodmorning boys he chirped with a smile as bright as newly minted gold i hope you enjoyed yourselves the quartet ducked their heads bashfully and stevens replied cant speak for the others mr shackford but i never enjoyed myself worse piggott lingered a moment behind the rest and looking back over his shoulder said that peach garden was what fetched us richard gave a loud laugh for the peach garden had been a horticultural invention of his own in the course of the forenoon the majority of the hands presented themselves at the office dropping into the yard in gangs of five or six and nearly all were taken on to dispose definitely of lumley giles and peterson they were not taken on at slocums yard though they continued to be directly or indirectly slocums pensioners even after they were retired to the town farm once more the chisels sounded merrily under the long shed that same morning the spinners went back to the mules but the molders held out until nightfall when it was signified to them that they demands would be complied with the next day the steamwhistles of the miantowona iron works and danas mills sent the echoes flying beyond that undulating line of pines and hemlocks which half encircles stillwater and falls away loosely on either side like an unclasped girdle a calm as if from out the cloudless blue sky that arched it day after day seemed to drift down upon the village hanlin with no more facial expression than an orange suddenly reappeared on the streets and went about repairing his laundry unmolested the children were playing in the sunny lanes again unafraid and mothers sat on doorsteps in the summer twilights singing softly to the baby in arm there was meat on the table and the teakettle hummed comfortably at the back of the stove the very winds that rustled through the fragrant pines and wandered fitfully across the vivid green of the salt marshes breathed peace and repose then one morning this blissful tranquility was rudely shattered old mr lemuel shackford had been found murdered in his own house in welchs court xviii the general effect on stillwater of mr shackfords death and the peculiar circumstances attending the tragedy have been set forth in the earlier chapters of this narrative the influence which that event exerted upon several persons then but imperfectly known to the reader is now to occupy us on the conclusion of the strike richard had returned in the highest spirits to his own rooms in lime street but the quiet week that followed found him singularly depressed his nerves had been strung to their utmost tension during those thirteen days of suspense he had assumed no light responsibility in the matter of closing the yard and there had been moments when the task of sustaining mr slocum had appeared almost hopeless now that the strain was removed a reaction set in and richard felt himself unnerved by the fleeing shadow of the trouble which had not caused him to flinch so long as it faced him on the morning and at the moment when mary hennessey was pushing open the scullery door of the house in welchs court and was about to come upon the body of the forlorn old man lying there in his nightdress richard sat eating his breakfast in a silent and preoccupied mood he had retired very late the previous night and his lacklustre eyes showed the effect of insufficient sleep his single fellowboarder mr pinkham had not returned from his customary early walk and only richard and mrs spooner the landlady were at table the former was in the act of lifting the coffeecup to his lips when the schoolmaster burst excitedly into the room old mr shackford is dead he exclaimed dropping into a chair near the door theres a report down in the village that he has been murdered i dont know if it is true god forgive my abruptness i didnt think and mr pinkham turned an apologetic face towards richard who sat there deathly pale holding the cup rigidly within an inch or two of his lip and staring blankly into space like a statue i i ought to have reflected murmured the schoolmaster covered with confusion at his maladroitness it was very reprehensible in craggie to make such an announcement to me so suddenly on a street corner i i was quite upset by it richard pushed back his chair without replying and passed into the hall where he encountered a messenger from mr slocum confirming mr pinkhams intelligence but supplementing it with the rumor that lemuel shackford had committed suicide richard caught up his hat from a table and hurried to welchs court before reaching the house he had somewhat recovered his outward composure but he was still pale and internally much agitated for he had received a great shock as lawyer perkins afterwards observed to mr ward in the readingroom of the tavern both these gentlemen were present when richard arrived as were also several of the immediate neighbors and two constables the latter were guarding the door against the crowd which had already begun to collect in the front yard a knot of carpenters with their toolboxes on their shoulders had halted at the garden gate on their way to bishops new stables and were glancing curiously at the unpainted faзade of the house which seemed to have taken on a remote bewildered expression as if it had an inarticulate sense of the horror within the men ceased their whispered conversation as richard approached and respectfully moved aside to let him pass nothing had been changed in the cheerless room on the ground floor with its veneered mahogany furniture and its yellowish leprous wallpaper peeling off at the seams here and there a caneseated chair overturned near the table had been left untouched and the body was still lying in the position in which the hennessey girl had discovered it a strange chill something unlike any atmospherical sharpness a chill that seemed to exhale from the thin pinched nostrils permeated the apartment the orioles were singing madly outside their vermilion bosoms glowing like live coals against the tender green of the foliage and appearing to break into flame as they took sudden flights hither and thither but within all was still on entering the chamber richard was smitten by the silence that silence which shrouds the dead and is like no other lemuel shackford had not been kind or cousinly he had blighted richards childhood with harshness and neglect and had lately heaped cruel insult upon him but as he stood there alone and gazed for a moment at the firmly shut lips upon which the mysterious white dust of death had already settled the lips that were never to utter any more bitter things the tears gathered in richards eyes and ran slowly down his cheeks after all said and done lemuel shackford was his kinsman and blood is thicker than water coroner whidden shortly appeared on the scene accompanied by a number of persons a jury was impaneled and then began that inquest which resulted in shedding so very little light on the catastrophe the investigation completed there were endless details to attend to papers to be hurriedly examined and sealed and arrangements made for the funeral on the succeeding day these matters occupied richard until late in the afternoon when he retired to his lodgings looking in on margaret for a few minutes on his way home this is too dreadful said margaret clinging to his hand with fingers nearly as icy as his own it is unspeakably sad answered richard the saddest thing i ever knew who who could have been so cruel richard shook his head no one knows the funeral took place on thursday and on friday morning as has been stated mr taggett arrived in stillwater and installed himself in welchs court to the wonder of many in the village who would not have slept a night in that house with only a servant in the north gable for half the universe mr taggett was a person who did not allow himself to be swayed by his imagination here then he began his probing of a case which on the surface promised to be a very simple one the man who had been seen driving rapidly along the turnpike sometime near daybreak on wednesday was presumably the man who could tell him all about it but it did not prove so neither thomas blufton nor william durgin nor any of the tramps subsequently obliged to drop into autobiography could be connected with the affair these first failures served to stimulate mr taggett it required a complex case to stir his ingenuity and sagacity that the present was not a complex case he was still convinced after four days futile labor upon it mr shackford had been killed either with malice prepense or on the spur of the moment for his money the killing had likely enough not been premeditated the old man had probably opposed the robbery now among the exceptionally rough population of the town there were possibly fifty men who would not have hesitated to strike down mr shackford if he had caught them flagrante delicto and resisted them or attempted to call for succor that the crime was committed by some one in stillwater or in the neighborhood mr taggett had never doubted since the day of his arrival the clumsy manner in which the staple had been wrenched from the scullery door showed the absence of a professional hand then the fact that the deceased was in the habit of keeping money in his bedchamber was a fact well known in the village and not likely to be known outside of it though of course it might have been it was clearly necessary for mr taggett to carry his investigation into the workshops and among the haunts of the class which was indubitably to furnish him with the individual he wanted above all it was necessary that the investigation should be secret an obstacle obtruded itself here everybody in stillwater knew everybody and a stranger appearing on the streets or dropping frequently into the tavern would not escape comment the man with the greatest facility for making the requisite searches would of course be some workman but a workman was the very agent not to be employed under the circumstances how many times and by what strange fatality had a guilty party been selected to shadow his own movements or those of an accomplice no mr taggett must rely only on himself and his plan forthwith matured its execution however was delayed several days the cooperation of mr slocum and mr richard shackford being indispensable at this stage richard went to new york where his cousin had made extensive investments in real estate for a careful man the late mr shackford had allowed his affairs there to become strangely tangled the business would detain richard a fortnight three days after his departure mr taggett himself left stillwater having apparently given up the case a proceeding which was severely criticized not only in the columns of the stillwater gazette but by the townsfolks at large who immediately relapsed into a state of apprehension approximating that of the morning when the crime was discovered mr pinkham who was taking tea that evening at the danas threw the family into a panic by asserting his belief that this was merely the first of a series of artistic assassinations in the manner of those memorable murders recorded by de quincey mr pinkham may have said this to impress the four dana girls with the variety of his reading but the recollection of de quinceys harrowing paper had the effect of so unhinging the young schoolmaster that when he found himself an hour or two afterwards in the lonely unlighted street he flitted home like a belated ghost and was ready to drop at every treebox the next forenoon a new hand was taken on at slocums yard the new hand who had come on foot from south millville at which town he had been set down by the seven oclock express that morning was placed in the apprentice department there were five or six apprentices now though all this was part of an understood arrangement mr slocum nearly doubted the fidelity of his own eyes when mr taggett a smoothfaced young fellow of one and twenty if so old with all the traits of an ordinary workman down to the neglected fingernails stepped up to the desk to have the name of blake entered on the payroll either by chance or by design mr taggett had appeared but seldom on the streets of stillwater the few persons who had had anything like familiar intercourse with him in his professional capacity were precisely the persons with whom his present movements were not likely to bring him into juxtaposition and he ran slight risk of recognition by others with his hair closely cropped and the overhanging brown mustache removed the man was not so much disguised as transformed i shouldnt have known him muttered mr slocum as he watched mr taggett passing from the office with his hat in his hand during the ensuing ten or twelve days mr slocum never wholly succeeded in extricating himself from the foggy uncertainty generated by that one brief interview from the moment mr taggett was assigned a bench under the sheds mr slocum saw little or nothing of him mr taggett took lodging in a room in one of the most crowded of the low boardinghouses a room accommodating two beds besides his own the first occupied by a brother neophyte in marblecutting and the second by a morose middleaged man with one eyebrow a trifle higher than the other as if it had been wrenched out of line by the strain of habitual intoxication this mans name was wollaston and he worked at danas mr taggetts initial move was to make himself popular in the marble yard and especially at the tavern where he spent money freely though not so freely as to excite any remark except that the lad was running through pretty much all his small pay a recklessness which was charitably condoned in snellings barroom he formed multifarious friendships and had so many sensible views on the labor problem advocating the general extinguishment of capitalists and so on that his admittance to the marble workers association resolved itself into merely a question of time the old prejudice against apprentices was already wearing off the quiet evasive man of few words was now a loquacious talker holding his own with the hardest hitters and very skillful in giving offense to no one whoever picks up blake for a fool dexter remarked one night will put him down again not a shadow of suspicion followed mr taggett in his various comings and goings he seemed merely a goodnatured intelligent devil perhaps a little less devilish and a trifle more intelligent than the rest but not otherwise different denyven peters dexter willson and others in and out of the slocum clique were blakes sworn friends in brief mr taggett had the amplest opportunities to prosecute his studies only for a pained look which sometimes latterly shot into his eyes as he worked at the bench or as he walked alone in the street one would have imagined that he was thoroughly enjoying the halfvagabond existence the supposition would have been erroneous for in the progress of those fourteen days apprenticeship mr taggett had received a wound in the most sensitive part of his nature he had been forced to give up what no man ever relinquishes without a wrench his own idea with the exception of an accident in danas mill by which torrinis hand had been so badly mangled that amputation was deemed necessary the two weeks had been eventless outside of mr taggetts personal experience what that experience was will transpire in its proper place margaret was getting daily notes from richard and mr slocum overburdened with the secret of mr taggetts presence in the yard a secret confined exclusively to mr slocum richard and justice beemis was restlessly awaiting developments the developments came that afternoon when mr taggett walked into the office and startled mr slocum sitting at the desk the two words which mr taggett then gravely and coldly whispered in mr slocums ear were richard shackford xix mr slocum who had partly risen from the chair sank back into his seat good god he said turning very pale are you mad mr taggett realized the cruel shock which the pronouncing of that name must have caused mr slocum mr taggett had meditated his line of action and had decided that the most merciful course was brusquely to charge young shackford with the crime and allow mr slocum to sustain himself for a while with the indignant disbelief which would be natural to him situated as he was he would then in a manner be prepared for the revelations which if suddenly presented would crush him if mr taggett was without imagination as he claimed he was not without a certain feminine quickness of sympathy often found in persons engaged in professions calculated to blunt the finer sensibilities in his intercourse with mr slocum at the shackford house mr taggett had been won by the singular gentleness and simplicity of the man and was touched by his misfortune after his exclamation mr slocum did not speak for a moment or two but with his elbows resting on the edge of the desk sat motionless like a person stunned then he slowly lifted his face to which the color had returned and making a movement with his right hand as if he were sweeping away cobwebs in front of him rose from the chair you are simply mad he said looking mr taggett squarely and calmly in the eyes are you aware of mr richard shackfords character and his position here precisely do you know that he is to marry my daughter i am very sorry for you sir you may spare me that it is quite unnecessary you have fallen into some horrible delusion i hope you will be able to explain it i am prepared to do so sir are you serious very serious mr slocum you actually imagine that richard shackford pshaw its simply impossible i am too young a man to wish even to seem wiser than you but my experience has taught me that nothing is impossible i begin to believe so myself i suppose you have grounds or something you consider grounds for your monstrous suspicion what are they i demand to be fully informed of what you have been doing in the yard before you bring disgrace upon me and my family by inconsiderately acting on some wild theory which perhaps ten words can refute i should be in the highest degree criminal mr slocum if i were to make so fearful an accusation against any man unless i had the most incontestable evidence in my hands mr taggett spoke with such coldblooded conviction that a chill crept over mr slocum in spite of him what is the nature of this evidence up to the present stage purely circumstantial i can imagine that said mr slocum with a slight smile but so conclusive as to require no collateral evidence the testimony of an eyewitness of the crime could scarcely add to my knowledge of what occurred that tuesday night in lemuel shackfords house indeed it is all so clear but of course a few eyewitnesses will turn up eventually said mr slocum whose whiteness about the lips discounted the assurance of his sarcasm that is not improbable returned mr taggett and meanwhile what are the facts they are not easily stated i have kept a record of my work day by day since the morning i entered the yard the memoranda are necessarily confused the important and the unimportant being jumbled together but the record as it stands will answer your question more fully than i could even if i had the time which i have not to go over the case with you i can leave these notes in your hands if you desire it when i return from new york you are going to new york exclaimed mr slocum with a start when this evening if you lay a finger on richard shackford you will make the mistake of your life mr taggett i have other business there mr shackford will be in stillwater tomorrow night he engaged a stateroom on the fall river boat this morning how can you know that since last tuesday none of his movements have been unknown to me do you mean to say that you have set your miserable spies upon him cried mr slocum i should not state the fact in just those words mr taggett answered the fact remains pardon me said mr slocum i am not quite myself can you wonder at it i do not wonder give me those papers you speak of mr taggett i would like to look through them i see that you are a very obstinate person when you have once got a notion into your head perhaps i can help you out of your error before it is irreparable then after hesitating a second mr slocum added i may speak of this to my daughter indeed i could scarcely keep it from her perhaps it is better she should be informed and mr shackford when he returns tomorrow if he broaches the subject of his cousins death i advise you to avoid it why should i it might save you or miss slocum some awkwardness but you must use your own discretion as the matter stands it makes no difference whether mr shackford knows his position today or tomorrow it is too late for him to avail himself of the knowledge otherwise of course i should not have given myself away in this fashion very well said mr slocum with an impatient movement of his shoulders neither i nor my daughter will open our lips on this topic in the mean while you are to take no further steps without advising me that is understood that is perfectly understood returned mr taggett drawing a narrow red notebook from the inner pocket of his workmans blouse and producing at the same time a small nickelplated doorkey this is the key of mr shackfords private workshop in the extension i have not been able to replace it on the mantelshelf of his sittingroom in lime street will you have the kindness to see that it is done at once a moment later mr slocum stood alone in the office with mr taggetts diary in his hand it was one of those costly little volumes giltedged and bound in fragrant crushed levant morocco with which city officials are annually supplied by a community of grateful taxpayers the dark crimson of the flexible covers as soft and slippery to the touch as a snakes skin was perhaps the fitting symbol of the darker story that lay coiled within with a gesture of repulsion as if some such fancy had flitted through his mind mr slocum tossed the notebook on the desk in front of him and stood a few minutes moodily watching the reflets of the crinkled leather as the afternoon sunshine struck across it beneath his amazement and indignation he had been chilled to the bone by mr taggetts brutal confidence it was enough to chill one surely and in spite of himself mr slocum began to feel a certain indefinable dread of that little crimsonbound book whatever it contained the reading of those pages was to be a repellent task to him it was a task to which he could not bring himself at the moment tonight in the privacy of his own chamber he would sift mr taggetts baleful fancies thus temporizing mr slocum dropped the volume into his pocket locked the office door behind him and wandered down to dundons drugstore to kill the intervening hour before suppertime dundons was the aristocratic lounging place of the village the place where the only genuine havana cigars in stillwater were to be had and where the favored few the initiated could get a dash of hochheimer or cognac with their sodawater at supper that evening mr slocum addressed scarcely a word to margaret and margaret was also silent the days were dragging heavily with her she was missing richard her own daring travels had never extended beyond boston or providence and new york with richard in it seemed drearily far away mr slocum withdrew to his chamber shortly after nine oclock and lighting the pair of candles on the dressingtable began his examination of mr taggetts memoranda at midnight the watchman on his lonely beat saw those two candles still burning xx mr taggetts diary was precisely a diary disjoined full of curt obscure phrases and irrelevant reflections for which reason it will not be reproduced here though mr slocum pondered every syllable and now and then turned back painfully to reconsider some doubtful passage it is not presumed that the reader will care to do so an abstract of the journal with occasional quotation where the writers words seem to demand it will be sufficient for the narrative in the opening pages mr taggett described his novel surroundings with a minuteness which contrasted oddly with the brief hurried entries further on he found himself as he had anticipated in a society composed of some of the most heterogeneous elements stillwater viewed from a certain point was a sort of microcosm a little international ragfair to which nearly every country on earth had contributed one of its shabby human products i am moving wrote mr taggett in an atmosphere in which any crime is possible i give myself seven days at the outside to light upon the traces of shackfords murder i feel him in the air the writers theory was that the man would betray his identity in one of two ways either by talking unguardedly or by indulging in expenditures not warranted by his means and position if several persons had been concerned in the crime nothing was more likely than a disagreement over the spoil and consequent treachery on the part of one of them or again some of the confederates might become alarmed and attempt to save themselves by giving away their comrades mr taggett however leaned to the belief that the assassin had had no accomplices the sum taken from mr shackfords safe was a comparatively large one five hundred dollars in gold and nearly double that amount in banknotes neither the gold nor the paper bore any known mark by which it could be recognized the burglar had doubtless assured himself of this and would not hesitate to disburse the money that was even a safer course judiciously worked than to secrete it the point was would he have sufficient selfcontrol to get rid of it by degrees the chances mr taggett argued were ten to one he would not a few pages further on mr taggett compliments the unknown on the adroit manner in which he is conducting himself he has neither let slip a suspicious word nor made an incautious display of his booty snellings bar was doing an unusually light business no one appeared to have any money many of the men had run deeply into debt during the late strike and were now drinking moderately in the paragraph which closes the weeks record mr taggetts chagrin is evident he confesses that he is at fault my invisible friend does not materialize so successfully as i expected is mr taggetts comment his faith in the correctness of his theory had not abated but he continued his observation sin a less sanguine spirit these observations were not limited to the barroom or the workshop he informed himself of the domestic surroundings of his comrades where his own scrutiny could not penetrate he employed the aid of correspondents he knew what workmen had money in the local savingsbank and the amount of each deposit in the course of his explorations of the shady side of stillwater life mr taggett unearthed many amusing and many pathetic histories but nothing that served his end finally he began to be discouraged returning home from the tavern one night in a rather desponding mood he found the man wollaston smoking his pipe in bed wollaston was a taciturn man generally but this night he was conversational and mr taggett too restless to sleep fell to chatting with him did he know much about the late mr shackford yes he had known him well enough in an off way not to speak of him everybody knew him in stillwater he was a sort of miser hated everybody and bullied everybody it was a wonder somebody didnt knock the old silvertop on the head years ago thus mr wollaston grimly with his pores stopped up with ironfillings a person to whom it would come quite easy to knock any one on the head for a slight difference of opinion he amused mr taggett in his present humor no he wasnt aware that shackford had had trouble with any particular individual believed he did have a difficulty once with slocum the marble man but he was always fetching suits against the town and shying lawyers at the mill directors a disagreeable old cuss altogether adopted his cousin one time but made the house so hot for him that the lad ran off to sea and since then had had nothing to do with the old bilk indeed what sort of fellow was young shackford mr wollaston could not say of his own knowledge thought him a plucky chap he had put a big italian named torrini out of the yard one day for talking back who was torrini the man that got hurt last week in the dana mill who were richard shackfords intimates couldnt say had seen him with mr pinkham the schoolmaster and mr craggie went with the upper crust generally was going to be partner in the marble yard and marry slocums daughter will durgin knew him they lived together one time he wollaston was going to turn in now several of these facts were not new to mr taggett but mr wollastons presentation of them threw mr taggett into a reverie the next evening he got durgin alone in a corner of the barroom with two or three potations durgin became autobiographical was he acquainted with mr shackford outside the yard rather dick shackford his durgins mother had kept dick from starving when he was a baby and no thanks for it went to school with him and knew all about his running off to sea was near going with him old man shackford never liked dick who was a proud beggar they couldnt pull together down to the last both of a piece they had a jolly rumpus a little while before the old man was fixed mr taggett pricked up his ears at this a rumpus how did durgin know that a girl told him what girl a girl he was sweet on what was her name well he didnt mind telling her name it was molly hennessey she was going through welchs court one forenoon may be it was three days before the strike and saw dick shackford bolt out of the house swinging his arms and swearing to himself at an awful rate was durgin certain that molly hennessey had told him this yes he was ready to take his oath on it here at last was something that looked like a glimmer of daylight it was possible that durgin or the girl had lied but the story had an air of truth to it if it were a fact that there had recently been a quarrel between these cousins whose uncousinly attitude towards each other was fast becoming clear to mr taggett then here was a conceivable key to an enigma which had puzzled him the conjecture that lemuel shackford had himself torn up the will if it was a will for this still remained in dispute had never been satisfactory to mr taggett he had accepted it because he was unable to imagine an ordinary burglar pausing in the midst of his work to destroy a paper in which he could have no concern but richard shackford would have the liveliest possible interest in the destruction of a document that placed a vast estate beyond his reach here was a motive on a level with the crime that money had been taken and that the fragments of the will had been carelessly thrown into a wastepaper basket just as if the old man himself had thrown them there was a stroke of art which mr taggett admired more and more as he reflected upon it he did not however allow himself to lay too much stress on these points for the paper might turn out to be merely an expired lease and the girl might have been quizzing durgin mr taggett would have given one of his eyeteeth just then for ten minutes with mary hennessey but an interview with her at this stage was neither prudent nor easily compassed if i have not struck a trail writes mr taggett i have come upon what strongly resembles one the least i can do is to follow it my first move must be to inspect that private workshop in the rear of mr slocums house how shall i accomplish it i cannot apply to him for permission for that would provoke questions which i am not ready to answer moreover i have yet to assure myself that mr slocum is not implicated there seems to have been also a hostile feeling existing between him and the deceased why didnt some one tell me these things at the start if young shackford is the person there is a tangled story to be unraveled mem young shackford is miss slocums lover mr slocum read this passage twice without drawing breath and then laid down the book an instant to wipe the sudden perspiration from his forehead in the note which followed mr taggett described the difficulty he met with in procuring a key to fit the walldoor at the rear of the marble yard and gave an account of his failure to effect an entrance into the studio he had hoped to find a window unfastened but the window as well as the door opening upon the veranda was locked and in the midst of his operations which were conducted at noontime the approach of a servant had obliged him to retreat forced to lay aside at least temporarily his designs on the workshop he turned his attention to richards lodgings in lime street here mr taggett was more successful on the pretext that he had been sent for certain drawings which were to be found on the table or in a writingdesk he was permitted by mrs spooner to ascend to the bedroom where she obligingly insisted on helping him search for the apocryphal plans and seriously interfered with his purpose which was to find the key of the studio while mr taggett was turning over the pages of a large dictionary in order to gain time and was wondering how he could rid himself of the old ladys importunities he came upon a halffolded notesheet at the bottom of which his eye caught the name of lemuel shackford it was in the handwriting of the dead man mr taggett was very familiar with that handwriting he secured the paper at a venture and put it in his pocket without examination a few minutes later it being impossible to prolong the pretended quest for the drawings mr taggett was obliged to follow mrs spooner from the apartment as he did so he noticed a bright object lying on the corner of the mantelshelf a small nickelplated key in order to take it he had only to reach out his hand in passing it was as mr taggett had instantly surmised the key of richards workshop if it had been gold instead of brass or iron that bit of metal would have taken no additional value in mr taggetts eyes on leaving mrs spooners he held it tightly clasped in his fingers until he reached an unfrequented street where he halted a moment in the shadow of a building to inspect the paper which he had half forgotten in his satisfaction at having obtained the key a stifled cry rose to mr taggetts lips as he glanced over the crumpled notesheet it contained three lines hastily scrawled in leadpencil requesting richard shackford to call at the house in welchs court at eight oclock on a certain tuesday night the note had been written as the date showed on the day preceding the tuesday night in question the night of the murder for a second or two mr taggett stood paralyzed ten minutes afterwards a message in cipher was pulsing along the wires to new york and before the sun went down that evening richard shackford was under the surveillance of the police the doubtful unknown ground upon which mr taggett had been floundering was now firm under his feet unexpected ground but solid meeting mary hennessey in the street on his way to the marble yard mr taggett no longer hesitated to accost her and question her as to the story she had told william durgin the girls story was undoubtedly true and as a piece of circumstantial evidence was only less important than the elder shackfords note the two cousins had been for years on the worst of terms at every step mr taggett had found corroboration of wollastons statement to that effect where were coroner whiddens eyes and ears wrote mr taggett the words were dashed down impatiently on the page as if he had sworn a little internally while writing them when he conducted that inquest in all my experience there was never a thing so stupidly managed a thorough and immediate examination of richard shackfords private workshop was now so imperative that mr taggett resolved to make it even if he had to do so under the authority of a searchwarrant but he desired as yet to avoid publicity a secret visit to the studio seemed equally difficult by day and night in the former case he was nearly certain to be deranged by the servants and in the latter a light in the unoccupied room would alarm any of the household who might chance to awaken from the watchman no danger was to be apprehended as the windows of the extension were not visible from the street mr taggett finally decided on the night as the more propitious time for his attempt a decision which his success justified a brilliant moon favored the indoor part of the enterprise though it exposed him to observation in his approach from the marble yard to the veranda with the dense moonlight streaming outside against the windowshades he could safely have used a candle in the studio instead of the screened lantern which he had provided mr taggett passed three hours in the workshop the last hour in waiting for the moon to go down then he stole through the marble yard into the silent street and hurried home carrying two small articles concealed under his blouse the first was a chisel with a triangular piece broken out of the centre of the bevel and the other was a box of safetymatches the peculiarity of this box of matches was that just one match had been used from it mr taggetts work was done the last seven pages of the diary were devoted to a review of the case every detail of which was held up in various lights and examined with the conscientious pains of a lapidary deciding on the value of a rare stone the concluding entries ran as follow tuesday night here the case passes into other hands i have been fortunate rather than skillful in unmasking the chief actor in one of the most singular crimes that ever came under my investigation by destroying three objects very easily destroyed richard shackford would have put himself beyond the dream of suspicion he neglected to remove these dumb witnesses and now the dumb witnesses speak if it could be shown that he was a hundred miles from stillwater at the time of the murder instead of in the village as he was he must still be held in the face of the proofs against him accessory to the deed these proofs roughly summarized are first the fact that he had had an altercation with his cousin a short time previous to the date of the murder a murder which may be regarded not as the result of a chance disagreement but of long years of bitter enmity between the two men secondly the fact that richard shackford had had an appointment with his cousin on the night the crime was committed and had concealed that fact from the authorities at the time of the coroners inquest thirdly that the broken chisel found in the private workshop of the accused explains the peculiar shape of the wound which caused lemuel shackfords death and corresponds in every particular with the plaster impression taken of that wound fourthly that the partially consumed match found on the scullery floor when the body was discovered a style of match not used in the house in welchs court completes the complement of a box of safetymatches belonging to richard shackford and hidden in a closet in his workshop whether shackford had an accomplice or not is yet to be ascertained there is nothing whatever to implicate mr rowland slocum i make the statement because his intimate association with one party and his deep dislike of the other invited inquiry and at first raised an unjust suspicion in my mind the little red book slipped from mr slocums grasp and fell at his feet as he rose from the chair the reflection which he caught of himself in the dressingtable mirror was that of a wrinkled white old man mr slocum did not believe and no human evidence could have convinced him that richard had deliberately killed lemuel shackford but as mr slocum reached the final pages of the diary a horrible probability insinuated itself in his mind could richard have done it accidentally could he in an instant of passion stung to sudden madness by that venomous old man have struck him involuntarily and killed him a certain speech which richard had made in mr slocums presence not long before came back to him now with fearful emphasis three or four times in my life i have been carried away by a devil of a temper which i couldnt control it seized me so unawares it seized me so unawares repeated mr slocum half aloud and then with a swift unconscious gesture he pressed his hands over his ears as if to shut out the words xxi margaret must be told it would be like stabbing her to tell her all this mr slocum had lain awake long after midnight appalled by the calamity that was about to engulf them at moments as his thought reverted to margarets illness early in the spring he felt that perhaps it would have been a mercy if she had died then he had left the candles burning it was not until the wicks sunk down in the sockets and went softly out that slumber fell upon him he was now sitting at the breakfasttable absently crumbling bits of bread beside his plate and leaving his coffee untouched margaret glanced at him wistfully from time to time and detected the restless night in the deepened lines of his face the house had not been the same since lemuel shackfords death he had never crossed its threshold margaret had scarcely known him by sight and mr slocum had not spoken to him for years but richards connection with the unfortunate old man had brought the tragic event very close to margaret and her father mr slocum was a person easily depressed but his depression this morning was so greatly in excess of the presumable cause that margaret began to be troubled papa has anything happened no nothing new has happened but i am dreadfully disturbed by some things which mr taggett has been doing here in the village i thought mr taggett had gone he did go but he came back very quietly without anybodys knowledge i knew it of course but no one else to speak of what has he done to disturb you i want you to be a brave girl margaret will you promise that why yes said margaret with an anxious look you frighten me with your mysteriousness i do not mean to be mysterious but i dont quite know how to tell you about mr taggett he has been working underground in this matter of poor shackfords death boring in the dark like a mole and thinks he has discovered some strange things do you mean he thinks he has found out who killed mr shackford he believes he has fallen upon clews which will lead to that the strange things i alluded to are things which richard will have to explain richard what has he to do with it not much i hope but there are several matters which he will be obliged to clear up in order to save himself from very great annoyance mr taggett seems to think that that good heavens papa what does he think margaret he thinks that richard knew something about the murder and has not told it what could he know is that all no that is not all i am keeping the full truth from you and it is useless to do so you must face it like a brave girl mr taggett suspects richard of being concerned directly or indirectly with the crime the color went from margarets cheek for an instant the statement was too horrible and sudden not to startle her but it was also too absurd to have more than an instants effect her quick recovery of herself reassured mr slocum would she meet mr taggetts specific charges with the like fortitude mr slocum himself had been prostrated by them he prayed to heaven that margaret might have more strength than he as indeed she had the man has got together a lot of circumstantial evidence continued mr slocum cautiously some of it amounts to nothing being mere conjecture but some of it will look badly for richard to outsiders of course it is all a mistake said margaret in nearly her natural voice it ought to be easy to convince mr taggett of that i have not been able to convince him but you will what has possessed him to fall into such a ridiculous error mr taggett has written out everything at length in this memorandumbook and you must read it for yourself there are expressions and statements in these pages margaret that will necessarily shock you very much but you should remember as i tried to while reading them that mr taggett has a heart of steel without it he would be unable to do his distressing work the cold impartiality with which he sifts and heaps up circumstances involving the doom of a fellowcreature appears almost inhuman but it is his business no dont look at it here said mr slocum recoiling he had given the book to margaret take it into the other room and read it carefully by yourself when you have finished come back and tell me what you think but papa surely you i dont believe anything margaret i dont know the true from the false any more i want you to help me out of my confusion and you cannot do it until you have read that book margaret made no response but passed into the parlor and closed the foldingdoors behind her after an absence of half an hour she reentered the breakfast room and laid mr taggetts diary on the table beside her father who had not moved from his place during the interval margarets manner was collected but it was evident by the dark circles under her eyes and the set colorless lips that that half hour had been a cruel thirty minutes to her in margarets selfpossession mr slocum recognized not for the first time the cropping out of an ancestral trait which had somehow managed to avoid him in its wayward descent well he questioned looking earnestly at margaret and catching a kind of comfort from her confident bearing it is mr taggetts trade to find somebody guilty said margaret and he has been very ingenious and very merciless he was plainly at his wits ends to sustain his reputation and would not have hesitated to sacrifice any one rather than wholly fail but you have been crying margaret how could i see richard dragged down in the dust in this fashion and not be mortified and indignant you dont believe anything at all of this do you asked margaret looking through and through him i confess i am troubled if you doubt richard for a second said margaret with a slight quiver of her lip that will be the bitterest part of it to me i dont give any more credit to mr taggetts general charges than you do margaret but i understand their gravity better a perfectly guiltless man one able with a single word to establish his innocence is necessarily crushed at first by an accusation of this kind now can richard set these matters right with a single word i am afraid he has a world of difficulty before him when he returns he will explain everything how can you question it i do not wish to but there are two things in mr taggetts story which stagger me the motive for the destruction of shackfords papers thats not plain the box of matches is a puerility unworthy of a clever man like mr taggett and as to the chisel he found why there are a hundred broken chisels in the village and probably a score of them broken in precisely the same manner but margaret did richard every breathe a word to you of that quarrel with his cousin no he never mentioned it to me either as matters stood between you and him nothing was more natural than that he should have spoken of it to you so natural that his silence is positively strange he may have considered it too unimportant mr shackford always abused richard it was nothing new then again richard is very proud and perhaps he did not care to come to us just at that time with family grievances besides how do we know they quarreled the village is full of gossip i am certain there was a quarrel it was only necessary for those two to meet to insure that i distinctly remember the forenoon when richard went to welchs court it was the day he discharged torrini a little cloud passed over margarets countenance they undoubtedly had angry words together continued mr slocum and we are forced to accept the hennessey girls statement the reason you suggest for richards not saying anything on the subject may suffice for us but it will scarcely satisfy disinterested persons and doesnt at all cover another circumstance which must be taken in the same connection what circumstance his silence in regard to lemuel shackfords note a note written the day before the murder and making an appointment for the very night of it the girl looked steadily at her father margaret exclaimed mr slocum his face illuminated with a flickering hope as he met her untroubled gaze did richard tell you no replied margaret then he told no one said mr slocum with the light fading out of his features again it was madness in him to conceal the fact he should not have lost a moment after the death of his cousin in making that letter public it ought instantly to have been placed in coroner whiddens hands richards action is inconceivable unless unless do not say it cried margaret i should never forgive you in recapitulating the points of mr taggetts accusation mr slocum had treated most of them as trivial but he had not been sincere he knew that that broken chisel had no duplicate in stillwater and that the finding of it in richards closet was a black fact mr slocum had also glossed over the quarrel but that letter the likelihood that richard kept the appointment and his absolute silence concerning it here was a grim thing which no sophistry could dispose of it would be wronging margaret to deceive her as to the vital seriousness of richards position why why did he hide it mr slocum persisted i do not see that he really hid it papa he shut the note in a book lying openly on the table a dictionary to which any one in the household was likely to go you think mr taggett a person of great acuteness he is a very intelligent person margaret he appears to me very shortsighted if richard were the dreadful man mr taggett supposes that paper would have been burnt and not left for the first comer to pick up i scorn myself for stooping to the suggestion there is something in the idea said mr slocum slowly but why did richard never mention the note to you or to me or to anybody he had a sufficient reason you may be sure oh papa how ready you are to believe evil of him i am not god knows how you cling to this story of the letter suppose it turns out to be some old letter written two or three years ago you could never look richard in the face again unfortunately shackford dated it it is useless for us to blindfold ourselves margaret richard has managed in some way to get himself into a very perilous situation and we cannot help him by shutting our eyes you misconceive me if you imagine i think him capable of coolly plotting his cousins death but it is not outside the limits of the possible that what has happened a thousand times may have happened once more men less impulsive than richard i will not listen to it interrupted margaret drawing herself up when richard returns he will explain the matter to you not to me if i required a word of denial from him i should care very little whether he was innocent or not mr slocum threw a terrified glance at his daughter her lofty faith sent a chill to his heart what would be the result of a fall from such a height he almost wished margaret had something less of that ancestral confidence and obstinacy the lack of which in his own composition he had so often deplored we are not to speak of this to richard he said after a protracted pause at least not until mr taggett considers it best i have pledged myself to something like that has richard been informed of mr taggetts singular proceeding asked margaret freezingly not yet nothing is to be done until mr taggett returns from new york and then richard will at once have an opportunity of clearing himself it would have spared us all much pain and misunderstanding if he had been sent for in the first instance did he know that this person was here in the yard the plan was talked over before richard left the details were arranged afterwards he heartily approved of the plan a leisurely and not altogether saintlike smile crept into the corners of margarets mouth yes he approved of the plan repeated mr slocum perhaps he here mr slocum checked himself and left the sentence flying at loose ends perhaps richard had looked with favor upon a method of inquiry which was so likely to lead to no result but mr slocum did not venture to finish the suggestion he had never seen margaret so imperious and intractable it was impossible to reason or to talk frankly with her he remained silent sitting with one arm thrown dejectedly across the back of the chair presently his abject attitude and expression began to touch margaret there was something that appealed to her in the thin gray hair fallowing over his forehead her eyes softened as they rested upon him and a pitying little tremor came to her under lip papa she said stooping to his side with a sudden rosy bloom in her cheeks i have all the proof i want that richard knew nothing of this dreadful business you have proof exclaimed mr slocum starting from his seat yes the morning richard went to new york margaret hesitated well he put his arm around me and kissed me well well repeated margaret could richard have done that could he have so much as laid his hand upon me if if mr slocum sunk back in the chair with a kind of groan papa you do not know him oh margaret i am afraid that that is not the kind of evidence to clear richard in mr taggetts eyes then richards word must do it she said haughtily he will be home tonight yes he is to return tonight said mr slocum looking away from her xxii during the rest of the day the name of richard shackford was not mentioned again by either margaret or her father it was a day of suspense to both and long before nightfall margarets impatience for richard to come had resolved itself into a pain as keen as that with which mr slocum contemplated the coming for every hour augmented his dread of the events that would necessarily follow the reappearance of young shackford in stillwater on reaching his office after the conversation with margaret mr slocum found lawyer perkins waiting for him lawyer perkins who was as yet in ignorance of the late developments had brought information of his own the mutilated document which had so grimly clung to its secret was at last deciphered it proved to be a recently executed will in which the greater part of lemuel shackfords estate real and personal was left unconditionally to his cousin that disposes of one of mr taggetts theories was mr slocums unspoken reflection certainly richard had not destroyed the will the old man himself had destroyed it probably in some fit of pique yet after all the vital question was in no way affected by this fact the motive for the crime remained and the fearful evidence against richard still held after the departure of lawyer perkins who had been struck by the singular perturbation of his old friend mr slocum drew forth mt taggetts journal and reread it from beginning to end margarets unquestioning faith in richard her prompt and indignant rejection of the whole story had shaken her father at moments that morning but now his paralyzing doubts returned this second perusal of the diary impressed him even more strongly than the first richard had killed lemuel shackford in selfdefense may be or perhaps accidentally but he had killed him as mr slocum passed from page to page following the dark thread of narrative that darkened at each remove he lapsed into that illogical frame of mind when one looks half expectantly for some providential interposition to avert the calamity against which human means are impotent if richard were to drop dead in the street if he were to fall overboard off point judith in the night if only anything would happen to prevent his coming back thus the ultimate disgrace might be spared them but the ill thing is the sure thing the letter with the black seal never miscarries and richard was bound to come there is no escape for him or for us murmured mr slocum closing his finger in the book it was in a different mood that margaret said to herself it is nearly four oclock he will be here at eight as she stood at the parlor window and watched the waning afternoon light making its farewells to the flowerbeds in the little square frontgardens of the houses opposite margarets heart was filled with the tenderness of the greeting she intended to give richard she had never been cold or shy in her demeanor with him nor had she ever been quite demonstrative but now she meant to put her arms around his neck in a wifely fashion and recompense him so far as she could for all the injustice he was to suffer when he came to learn of the hateful slander that had lifted its head during his absence he should already be in possession of the assurance of her faith in the mean while the hands in slocums yard were much exercised over the unaccountable disappearance of blake stevens reported the matter to mr slocum ah yes said mr slocum who had not provided himself with an explanation and was puzzled to improvise one i discharged him that is to say i let him go i forgot to mention it he didnt take to the trade but he showed a good fist for a beginner said stevens he was head and shoulders the best of the new lot shall i put stebbins in his place you neednt do anything until mr shackford gets back when will that be sir tonight probably the unceremonious departure of blake formed the theme of endless speculation at the tavern that evening and for the moment obscured the general interest in old shackfords murder never to let on he was goin said one didnt say goodby to nobody remarked a second it was devilish uncivil added a third it is kind of mysterious said mr peters some girl suggested mr willson with an air of tender sentiment which he attempted further to emphasize by a capricious wink no observed dexter when a man vanishes in that sudden way his body is generally found in a clump of blackberry bushes months afterwards or left somewhere on the flats by an ebb tide two murders in stillwater in one month would be rather crowding it wouldnt it inquired piggott bosh said durgin there was always something shady about blake we didnt know where he hailed from and we dont know where hes gone to hell take care of himself that kind of fellow never lets anybody play any points on him with this durgin threw away the stump of his cigar and lounged out at the street door i couldnt get anything out of the proprietor said stevens but he never talks may be shackford when he stevens stopped short to listen to a low rumbling sound like distant thunder followed almost instantly by two quick faint whistles hes aboard the train tonight mr peters quietly rose from his seat and left the barroom the evening express due at eight was only a few seconds behind time as the screech of the approaching engine rung out from the dark woodland margaret and her father exchanged rapid glances it would take richard ten minutes to walk from the railway station to the house for of course he would come there directly after sending his valise to lime street the ten minutes went by and then twenty margaret bent steadily over her work listening with covert intentness for the click of the street gate likely enough richard had been unable to find any one to take charge of his handbaggage presently mr slocum could not resist the impulse to look at his watch it was half past eight he nervously unfolded the stillwater gazette and sat with his eyes fastened on the paper after a seemingly interminable period the heavy bell of the south church sounded nine and then tolled for a few minutes as the dismal custom is in new england country towns a long silence followed unrelieved by any word between father and daughter a silence so profound that the heart of the oldfashioned timepiece throbbing monotonously in its dusky case at the foot of the stairs made itself audible through the room mr slocums gaze continued fixed on the newspaper which he was not reading margarets hands lay crossed over the work on her lap ten oclock what can have kept him murmured margaret there was only that way out of it reflected mr slocum pursuing his own line of thought margarets cheeks were flushed and hot and her eyes dulled with disappointment as she rose from the low rockingchair and crossed over to kiss her father goodnight mr slocum drew the girl gently towards him and held her for a moment in silence but margaret detecting the subtile commiseration in his manner resented it and released herself coldly he has been detained papa yes something must have detained him xxiii when the down express arrived at stillwater that night two passengers stepped from the rear car to the platform one was richard shackford and the other a commercial traveler whose acquaintance richard had made the previous evening on the fall river boat there were no hacks in waiting at the station and richard found his politeness put to a severe test when he saw himself obliged to pilot his companion part of the way to the hotel which lay it seemed almost maliciously in a section of the town remote from the slocums curbing his impatience richard led the stranger through several crooked unlighted streets and finally left him at the corner of the main thoroughfare within pistolshot of the red glass lantern which hung over the door of the tavern this cost richard ten good minutes as he hurriedly turned into a crossstreet on the left he fancied that he heard his name called several times from somewhere in the darkness a man came running towards him it was mr peters can i say a word to you mr shackford if it isnt a long one i am rather pressed it is about torrini sir what of him hes mighty bad sir oh i cant stop to hear that and richard quickened his pace the doctor took off his hand last wednesday said peters keeping alongside and hes been getting worse and worse richard halted took off his hand didnt you know he was caught in the rollingmachine at danas well it was after you went away this is the first ive heard of it it was hard lines for him sir with the woman and the two children and nothing to eat in the house the boys in the yard have done what they could but with the things from the drugstore and so on we couldnt hold up our end mr dana paid the doctors bill but if it hadnt been for miss slocum i dont know what would have happened i thought may be if i spoke to you and told you how it was did torrini send you lord no hes too proud to send to anybody hes been so proud since they took off his hand that there has been no doing anything with him if they was to take off his leg he would turn into one mass of pride no mr shackford i came of myself where does torrini live now in mitchells alley i will go along with you said richard with a dogged air it seemed as if the fates were determined to keep him from seeing margaret that night peters reached out a hand to take richards leather bag no thank you i can carry it very well in a small morocco case in one of the pockets was a heavy plain gold ring for margaret and not for anything in the world would richard have allowed any one else to carry the bag after a brisk five minutes walk the two emerged upon a broad street crossing their path at right angles all the shops were closed except stubbs the provision dealers and dundons drugstore in the window of the apothecary a great purple jar with a spray of gas jets behind it was flaring on the darkness like a bengal light richard stopped at the provision store and made some purchases a little further on he halted at a fruit stand kept by an old crone who had supplemented the feeble flicker of the corner street lamp with a pitchpine torch which cast a yellow bloom over her apples and turned them all into oranges she had real oranges however and richard selected half a dozen with a confused idea of providing the little italians with some national fruit though both children had been born in stillwater then the pair resumed their way peters acting as pioneer they soon passed beyond the region of sidewalks and curbstones and began picking their steps through a narrow humid lane where the water lay in slimy pools and the tenement houses on each side blotted out the faint starlight the night was sultry and door and casement stood wide making pits of darkness few lights were visible but a continuous hum of voices issued from the human hives and now and then a transient red glow at an upper window showed that some one was smoking a pipe this was mitchells alley the shadows closed behind the two men as they moved forward and neither was aware of the figure which had been discreetly following them for the last ten minutes if richard had suddenly wheeled and gone back a dozen paces he would have come face to face with the commercial traveler mr peters paused in front of one of the tenement houses and motioned with his thumb over his shoulder for richard to follow him through a yawning doorway the hall was as dark as a cave and full of stale moldy odors peters shuffled cautiously along the bare boards until he kicked his toe against the first step of the staircase keep close to the wall mr shackford and feel your way up theyve used the banisters for kindling and the landlord says he shant put in any more i went over here the other night added mr peters reminiscentially after fumbling several seconds for the latch mr peters pushed open a door and ushered richard into a large gloomy rear room a kerosene lamp was burning dimly on the mantelshelf over which hung a coarselycolored lithograph of the virgin in a pine frame under the picture stood a small black crucifix there was little furniture a cookingstove two or three stools a broken table and a chest of drawers on an iron bedstead in the corner lay torrini muffled to the chin in a blanket despite the hot midsummer night his right arm as if it were wholly disconnected with his body rested in a splint on the outside of the covering as the visitors entered a tall dusky woman with blurred eyes rose from a low bench at the foot of the bed is he awake asked peters the woman comprehending the glance which accompanied the words though not the words themselves nodded yes here is mr shackford come to see you torrini peters said the man slowly unclosed his eyes they were unnaturally brilliant and dilated and seemed to absorb the rest of his features i didnt want him let bygones be bygones torrini said richard approaching the bedside i am sorry about this you are very good i dont understand i ask nothing of slocum but the signorina comes every day and i cannot help it what would you have im a dead man and he turned away his face it is not so bad as that said richard torrini looked up with a ghastly smile they have cut off the hand that struck you mr shackford i suppose it was necessary i am very sorry in a little while you will be on your feet again it is too late they might have saved me by taking the arm but i would not allow them i may last three or four days the doctor says it peters standing in the shadow jerked his head affirmatively i do not care for myself the man continued but she and the little ones that is what maddens me they will starve they will not be let starve in stillwater said richard torrini turned his eyes upon him wistfully and doubtfully you will help them yes i and others if they could be got to italy said torrini after meditating it would be well her farther giving a side look at the woman is a fisherman of capri at the word capri the woman lifted her head quickly he is not rich but hes not poor he would take her you would wish her sent to naples yes if you do not pull through she and the children shall go there brigida called torrini then he said something rapidly in italian to the woman who buried her face in both hands and did not reply she has no words to thank you see she is tired to death with the children all day and me all night these many nights tell her to go to bed in the other room said richard theres another room isnt there ill sit with you you your wife is fagged out that is plain send her to bed and dont talk any more peters i wish youd run and get a piece of ice somewhere theres no drinkingwater here come now torrini i cant speak italian oh i dont mind your scowling i intend to stay torrini slowly unknitted his brows and an irresolute expression stole across his face then he called brigida and bade her go in with the children she bowed her head submissively and fixing her melting eyes on richard for an instant passed into the adjoining chamber peters shortly reappeared with the ice and after setting a jug of water on the table departed richard turned up the wick of the kerosene lamp which was sending forth a disagreeable odor and pinned an old newspaper around the chimney to screen the flame he had by an odd chance made his lampshade out of a copy of the stillwater gazette containing the announcement of his cousins death richard gave a quick start as his eye caught the illuminated headlines mysterious murder of lemuel shackford perhaps a slight exclamation escaped richards lips at the same time for torrini turned and asked what was the matter nothing at all said richard removing the paper and placing another in its stead then he threw open the blinds of the window looking on the back yard and set his handbag against the door to prevent it being blown to by the draught torrini without altering the rigid position of his head on the pillow followed every movement with a look of curious insistence like that of the eyes in a portrait his preparations completed for the night richard seated himself on a stool at the foot of the bed the obscurity and stillness of the room had their effect upon the sick man who presently dropped into a light sleep richard sat thinking of margaret and began to be troubled because he had neglected to send her word of his detention which he might have done by peters it was now too l ate the town clock struck ten in the midst of his selfreproaches at the first clang of the bell torrini awoke with a start and asked for water if anybody comes he said glancing in a bewildered anxious way at the shadows huddled about the door you are not to leave me alone with him him whom are you expecting any one no but who knows one might come then you are not to go you are not to leave me for a second ive no thought of it replied richard you may rest easy hes a trifle light in the head was richards reflection after that torrini dozed rather than slumbered rousing at brief intervals and whenever he awoke the feverish activity of his brain incited him to talk now of italy and now of matters connected with his experiences in this country naples is a pleasant place he broke out in the hush of the midnight just as richard was dropping off the band plays every afternoon on the chiaia and then the festas every third day a festa the devil was in my body when i left there and dragged little brigida into all this misery we used to walk of an evening along the marinella thats a strip of beach just beyond the molo piccolo you were never in naples not i said richard here wet your lips and try to go to sleep again no i cant sleep for thinking when the signorina came to see me the other day her heart was pierced with pity like the blessed madonnas her bosom bleeds for all you will let her come tomorrow yes yes if you will only keep quiet margaret shall come margherita we say you are to wed her is it not so richard turned down the wick of the lamp which was blazing and spluttering and did not answer then torrini lay silent a long while apparently listening to the hum of the telegraph wires attached to one end of the roof at odd intervals the freshening breeze swept these wires and awoke a low жolian murmur the moon rose in the mean time and painted on the uncarpeted floor the shape of the cherry bough that stretched across the window it was two oclock richard sat with his head bent forward in a drowse now the cousin is dead you are as rich as a prince are you not inquired torrini who had lain for the last half hour with his eyes wide open in the moonlight richard straightened himself with a jerk torrini i positively forbid you to talk any more i remember you said that one day somewhere where was it ah in the yard you cant be allowed to speak here you know and then i struck at you with that hand theyve taken away see how i remember it why do you bother your mind with such things think of just nothing at all and rest perhaps a wet cloth on your forehead will refresh you i wish you had a little of my genius for not keeping awake you are tired you i have had two broken nights traveling and i give you no peace well no returned richard bluntly hoping the admission would induce torrini to tranquilize himself you dont give me much has any one been here demanded torrini abruptly not a soul good heaven man do you know what time it is i know i know its very late i ought to keep quiet but the devil with this fever in my brain mr shackford and torrini in spite of his imprisoned limb suddenly half raised himself from the mattress i i richard sprung to his feet what is it what do you want nothing said torrini falling back on the pillow richard brought him a glass of water which he refused he lay motionless with his eyes shut as if composing himself and richard returned on tiptoe to his bench a moment or two afterwards torrini stirred the blanket with his foot mr shackford well i am as grateful as a dog torrini did not speak again this expression of his gratitude appeared to ease him his respiration grew lighter and more regular and by and by he fell into a profound sleep richard watched awhile expectantly with his head resting against the rail of the bedstead then his eyelids drooped and he too slumbered but once or twice before he quite lost himself he was conscious of brigidas thin face thrust like a silver wedge through the halfopen door of the hall bedroom it was the last thing he remembered that sharp pale face peering out from the blackness of the inner chamber as his grasp loosened on the world and he drifted off on the tide of a dream a narrow white hand like a childs seemed to be laid against his breast it was not margarets hand and yet it was hers no it was the plaster model he had made that idle summer afternoon years and years before he had ever thought of loving her strange for it to be there then richard began wondering how the gold ring would look in the slender forefinger he unfastened the leather bag and took out the ring he was vainly trying to pass it over the first joint of the dead white finger when the cast slipped from his hold and fell with a crash to the floor richard gave a shudder and opened his eyes brigida was noiselessly approaching torrinis bedside torrini still slept it was broad day through the uncurtained window richard saw the blue sky barred with crimson xxiv richard did come home last night after all said mr slocum with a flustered air seating himself at the breakfast table margaret looked up quickly i just met peters on the street and he told me added mr slocum richard returned last night and did not come to us it seems that he watched with torrini the man is going to die oh said margaret cooling instantly that was like richard he never thinks of himself first i would not have had him do differently last evening you were filled with i dont know what horrible suspicions yet see how simply everything explains itself if i could speak candidly margaret if i could express myself without putting you into a passion i would tell you that richards passing the night with that man has given me two or three ugly ideas positively papa you are worse than mr taggett i shall not say another word replied mr slocum then he unfolded the newspaper lying beside him and constructed a barrier against further colloquy an hour afterwards when richard threw open the door of his private workshop margaret was standing in the middle of the room waiting for him she turned with a little cry of pleasure and allowed richard to take her in his arms and kept to the spirit and the letter of the promise she had made to herself if there was an unwonted gravity in margarets manner young shackford was not keen enough to perceive it all that morning wherever he went he carried with him a sense of margarets face resting for a moment against his shoulder and the happiness of it rendered him wholly oblivious to the constrained and chilly demeanor of her father when they met the interview was purposely cut short by mr slocum who avoided richard the rest of the day with a persistency that must have ended in forcing itself upon his notice had he not been so engrossed by the work which had accumulated during his absence mr slocum had let the correspondence go to the winds and a formidable collection of unanswered letters lay on shackfords desk the forenoon was consumed in reducing the pile and settling the questions that had risen in the shops for mr slocum had neglected everything richard was speedily advised of blakes dismissal from the yard but not knowing what explanation had been offered was unable to satisfy stevens curiosity on the subject i must see slocum about that at once reflected richard but the opportunity did not occur and he was too much pressed to make a special business of it mr slocum meanwhile was in a wretched state of suspense and apprehension justice beemiss clerk had served some sort of legal paper presumably a subpoena on richard who had coolly read it in the yard under the gaze of all and given no sign of discomposure beyond a momentary lifting of the eyebrows then he had carelessly thrust the paper into one of his pockets and continued his directions to the men clearly he had as yet no suspicion of the mine that was ready to be sprung under his feet shortly after this little incident which mr slocum had witnessed from the window of the countingroom richard spoke a word or two to stevens and quitted the yard mr slocum dropped into the carving department where is mr shackford stevens he has gone to mitchells alley sir said hed be away an hour am i to say he was wanted no replied mr slocum hastily any time will do you neednt mention that i inquired for him and mr slocum returned to the countingroom before the hour expired he again distinguished richards voice in the workshops and the cheery tone of it was a positive affront to mr slocum looking back to the week prior to the tragedy in welchs court he recollected richards unaccountable dejection he had had the air of a person meditating some momentous step the pallor the set face and the introspective eyes then came the murder and richards complete prostration mr slocum in his own excitement had noted it superficially at the time but now he recalled the young mans inordinate sorrow and it seemed rather like remorse was his present immobile serenity the natural expression of a man whose heart had suddenly ossified and was no longer capable of throbbing with its guilt richard shackford was rapidly becoming an awful problem to mr slocum since the death of his cousin richard had not been so much like his former self he appeared to have taken up his cheerfulness at the point where he had dropped it three weeks before if there were any weight resting on his mind he bore it lightly with a kind of careless defiance in his visit that forenoon to mitchells alley he had arranged for mrs morganson his cousins old housekeeper to watch with torrini the ensuing night this left richard at liberty to spend the evening with margaret and finish his correspondence directly after tea he repaired to the studio and lighting the german studentlamp fell to work on the letters margaret came in shortly with a magazine and seated herself near the round table at which he was writing she had dreaded this evening it could scarcely pass without some mention of mr taggett and she had resolved not to speak of him if richard questioned her it would be very distressing how could she tell richard that mr taggett accused him of the murder of his cousin and that her own father half believed the accusation no she could never acknowledge that for nearly an hour the silence of the room was interrupted only by the scratching of richards pen and the rustling of the magazine as margaret turned the leaf now and then he looked up and caught her eye and smiled and went on with his task it was a veritable return of the old times margaret became absorbed in the story she was reading and forgot her uneasiness her left hand rested on the pile of answered letters to which richard added one at intervals she mechanically lifting her palm and replacing it on the fresh manuscript presently richard observed this movement and smiled in secret at the slim white hand unconsciously making a paperweight of itself he regarded it covertly for a moment and then his disastrous dream occurred to him there should be no mistake this time he drew the small morocco case from his pocket and leaning across the table slipped the ring on margarets finger margaret gave a bewildered start and then seeing what richard had done held out her hand to him with a gracious impetuous little gesture i mean to give it you this morning he said pressing his lip to the ring but the daylight did not seem fine enough for it i thought you had forgotten said margaret slowly turning the band on her finger the first thing i did in new york was to go to a jewelers for this ring and since then i have guarded it day and night as dragonishly as if it had been the kohinoor diamond or some inestimable gem which hundreds of envious persons were lying in wait to wrest from me walking the streets with this trinket in my possession i have actually had a sense of personal insecurity i seemed to invite general assault that was being very sentimental was it not yes perhaps that small piece of gold meant so much to me and to me said margaret have you finished your letters not yet i shall be through in ten minutes and then well have the evening to ourselves richard hurriedly resumed his writing and margaret turned to her novel again but the interest had faded out of it the figures had grown threadbare and indistinct like the figures in a piece of old tapestry and after a moment or two the magazine glided with an unnoticed flutter into the girls lap she sat absently twirling the gold loop on her finger richard added the address to the final envelope dried it with the blotter and abruptly shut down the lid of the inkstand with an air of as great satisfaction as if he had been the fisherman in the arabian story corking up the wicked afrite with his finger still pressing the leaden cover as though he were afraid the imp of toil would get out again he was suddenly impressed by the fact that he had seen very little of mr slocum that day i have hardly spoken to him he reflected where is your father tonight he has a headache said margaret he went to his room immediately after supper it is nothing serious of course i fancy not papa is easily excited and he had had a great deal to trouble him lately the strike and all that i wonder if mr taggett has been bothering him i dare say mr taggett has bothered him you knew of his being in the yard not while he was here papa told me yesterday i think mr taggett was scarcely the person to render much assistance then he has found nothing whatever nothing important but anything trifles are of importance in a matter like this your father never wrote me a word about taggett mr taggett has made a failure of it richard if nothing new has transpired then i do not understand the summons i received today a summons ive the paper somewhere no it is in the pocket of my other coat i take it there is to be a consultation of some kind at justice beemiss office tomorrow i am very glad said margaret with her face brightening tomorrow would lift the cloud which had spread itself over them all and was pressing down so heavily on one unconscious head tomorrow richards innocence should shine forth and confound mr taggett a vague bitterness rose in margarets heart as she thought of her father let us talk of something else she said brusquely breaking her pause let us talk of something pleasant of ourselves then suggested richard banishing the shadow which had gathered in his eyes at his first mention of mr taggetts name of ourselves repeated margaret gayly then you must give me your hand stipulated richard drawing his chair closer to hers there said margaret while this was passing mr slocum in the solitude of his chamber was vainly attempting to solve the question whether he had not disregarded all the dictates of duty and common sense in allowing margaret to spend the evening alone with richard shackford mr slocum saw one thing with painful distinctness that he could not help himself xxv the next morning mr slocum did not make his appearance in the marble yard his halfsimulated indisposition of the previous night had turned into a genuine headache of which he perhaps willingly availed himself to remain in his room for he had no desire to see richard shackford that day it was an hour before noon up to that moment richard had been engaged in reading and replying to the letters received by the mornings mail a duty which usually fell to mr slocum as richard stepped from the office into the yard a small boy thrust a note into his hand and then stood off a short distance tranquilly boring with one toe in the loose gravel and apparently waiting for an answer shackford hastily ran his eye over the paper and turning towards the boy said a little impatiently tell him i will come at once there was another person in stillwater that forenoon whose agitation was scarcely less than mr slocums though it greatly differed from it in quality mr slocum was alive to his fingertips with dismay lawyer perkins was boiling over with indignation it was a complex indignation in which astonishment and incredulity were nicely blended with a cordial detestation of mr taggett and vague promptings to inflict some physical injury on justice beemis that he melanchthon perkins the confidential legal adviser and personal friend of the late lemuel shackford should have been kept for two weeks in profound ignorance of proceedings so nearly touching his lamented client the explosion of the old lawyers wrath was so unexpected that justice beemis who had dropped in to make the disclosures and talk the matter over informally clutched at his broadbrimmed panama hat and precipitately retreated from the office mr perkins walked up and down the worn green drugget of his private room for half an hour afterwards collecting himself and then dispatched a hurried note to richard shackford requesting an instant interview with him at his lawyer perkinss chambers when some ten minutes subsequently richard entered the lowstudded square room darkened with faded moreen curtains and filled with a stale odor of lawcalf mr perkins was seated at his desk and engaged in transferring certain imposing redsealed documents to a green baize satchel which he held between his knees he had regained his equanimity his features wore their usual expression of judicial severity nothing denoted his recent discomposure except perhaps an additional wantonness in the stringy black hair falling over the high forehead that pallid high forehead which always wore the look of being covered with cold perspiration mr shackford said lawyer perkins suspending his operations a second as he saluted the young man i suppose i have done an irregular thing in sending for you but i did not see any other course open to me i have been your cousins attorney for over twentyfive years and ive a great regard for you personally that must justify the step i am taking the regard is mutual i am sure returned richard rather surprised by this friendly overture for his acquaintance with the lawyer had been of the slightest though it had extended over many years my cousin had very few friends and i earnestly desire to have them mine if i were in any trouble there is no one to whom i would come as unhesitatingly as to you but you are in trouble yes my cousins death was very distressing i do not mean that mr perkins paused a full moment the district attorney has suddenly taken a deep interest in the case and there is to be a rigorous overhauling of the facts i am afraid it is going to be very unpleasant for you mr shackford how could it be otherwise asked richard tranquilly lawyer perkins fixed his black eyes on him then you fully understand the situation and can explain everything i wish i could unfortunately i can explain nothing i dont clearly see why i have been summoned to attend as a witness at the investigation to be held today in justice beemiss office you are unacquainted with any special reason why your testimony is wanted i cannot conceive why it should be required i gave my evidence at the time of the inquest and have nothing to add to it strictly speaking i have had of late years no relations with my cousin during the last eighteen months we have spoken together but once have you had any conversation on this subject with mr slocum since your return from new york no i have had no opportunity i was busy all day yesterday he was ill in the evening and is still confined to his room mr perkins was manifestly embarrassed that is unfortunate he said laying the bag on the desk i wish you had talked with mr slocum of course you were taken into the secret of taggetts presence in the marble yard oh yes that was all arranged before i left home you dont know the results of that manoeuvre there were no results on the contrary taggett claims to have made very important discoveries indeed why was i not told i cant quite comprehend mr slocums silence what has taggett discovered several things upon which he builds the gravest suspicions against whom against you against me cried richard recoiling the action was one altogether of natural amazement and convinced mr perkins who had keenly watched the effect of his announcement that young shackford was being very hardly used justice beemis had given mr perkins only a brief outline of the facts and had barely touched on details when the old lawyers anger had put an end to the conversation his disgust at having been left out in the cold though he was in no professional way concerned in the task of discovering the murderer of lemuel shackford had caused lawyer perkins instantly to repudiate mr taggetts action taggett is a low intriguing fellow he had said to justice beemis taggett is a fraud young shackfords ingenuous manner now confirmed mr perkins in that belief richard recovered himself in a second or two why did not mr slocum mention these suspicions to me he demanded perhaps he found it difficult to do so why should he find it difficult suppose he believed them but he could not believe them whatever they are well then suppose he was not at liberty to speak it seems that you are mr perkins and you owe it to me to be explicit what does taggett suspect lawyer perkins brooded a while before replying his practice was of a miscellaneous sort confined in the main to what is technically termed office practice though he was frequently engaged in small cases of assault and battery he could scarcely escape that in stillwater he had never conducted an important criminal case but when lawyer perkins looked up from his brief reverie he had fully resolved to undertake the defense of richard shackford i will tell you what taggett suspects he said slowly if you will allow me to tell you in my own way i must ask a number of questions richard gave a halfimpatient nod of assent where were you on the night of the murder inquired lawyer perkins after a slight pause i spent the evening at the slocums until ten oclock then i went home but not directly it was moonlight and i walked about perhaps for an hour did you meet any one not that i recollect i walked out of town on the turnpike when you returned to your boardinghouse did you meet any one no i let myself in with a passkey the family had retired with the exception of mr pinkham then you saw him no but i heard him he was playing on the flute at his chamber window or near it he always plays on the flute when he cant sleep what oclock was that it must have been after eleven your stroll was confined to the end of the town most remote from welchs court yes i just cruised around on the outskirts i wish you had spoken with somebody that night the streets were deserted i wasnt likely to meet persons on the turnpike however some one may have seen you without your knowing it yes said richard curtly he was growing restive under these interrogations the drift of which was plain enough to be disagreeable moreover mr perkins had insensibly assumed the tone and air of a counsel crossexamining a witness on the other side this nocturnal cruise whose direction and duration were known only to young shackford struck lawyer perkins unpleasantly he meditated a moment before putting the next question were you on good terms i mean fairly good terms with your cousin no said richard but the fault was not mine he never liked me as a child i annoyed him i suppose and when i grew up i offended him by running away to sea my mortal offense however was accepting a situation in slocums yard i have been in my cousins house only twice in three years when was the last time a day or two previous to the strike as you were not in the habit of visiting the house you must have had some purpose in going there what was the occasion richard hung his head thoughtfully i went there to talk over family matters to inform him of my intended marriage to margaret slocum i wanted his goodwill and support mr slocum had offered to take me into the business i thought perhaps my cousin lemuel seeing how prosperous i was would be more friendly to me did you wish him to lend you capital i didnt expect or wish him to but there was some question of that and he refused rather brutally if i may say so now was there a quarrel richard hesitated of course i dont press you said mr perkins with some stiffness you are not on the witness stand i began to think i was in the prisoners dock answered richard smiling ruefully however i have nothing to conceal i hesitated to reply to you because it was painful for me to reflect that the last time i saw my cousin we parted in anger he charge me with attempting to overreach him and i left the house in indignation that was the last time you saw him the last time i saw him alive was there any communication between you two after that no none whatever none are you quite positive as positive as i can be that i live and have my senses lawyer perkins pulled a black strand of hair over his forehead and remained silent for nearly a minute mr shackford are you sure that your cousin did not write a note to you on the monday preceding the night of his death he may have written a dozen for all i know i only know that i never received a note or a letter from him in the whole course of my life then how do you account for the letter which has been found in your rooms in lime street a letter addressed to you by lemuel shackford and requesting you to call at his house on that fatal tuesday night i i know nothing about it stammered richard there is no such paper it was in this office less than one hour ago said lawyer perkins sternly it was brought here for me to identify lemuel shackfords handwriting justice beemis has that paper justice beemis has it exclaimed richard i have nothing more to say observed lawyer perkins reaching out his hand towards the green bag as a sign that the interview was ended there were other points i wished to have some light thrown on but i have gone far enough to see that it is useless what more is there demanded richard in a voice that seemed to come through a fog i insist on knowing you suspect me of my cousins murder mr taggett does and you i am speaking of mr taggett well go on speak of him said richard desperately what else has he discovered mr perkins wheeled his chair round until he faced the young man he has discovered in your workshop a chisel with a peculiar break in the edge a deep notch in the middle of the bevel with that chisel lemuel shackford was killed richard gave a perceptible start and put his hand to his head as if a sudden confused memory had set the temples throbbing a full box of safety matches continued mr perkins in a cold measured voice as though he were demonstrating a mathematical problem contains one hundred matches mr taggett has discovered a box that contains only ninetynine the missing match was used that night in welchs court richard stared at him blankly what can i say he gasped say nothing to me returned lawyer perkins hastily thrusting a handful of loose papers into the open throat of the green bag which he garroted an instant afterwards with a thick black cord then he rose flurriedly from the chair i shall have to leave you he said ive an appointment at the surrogates and lawyer perkins passed stiffly from the apartment richard lingered a moment alone in the room with his chin resting on his breast xxvi there was a fire in richards temples as he reeled out of lawyer perkinss office it was now twelve oclock and the streets were thronged with the motley population disgorged by the various mills and workshops richard felt that every eye was upon him he was conscious of something wild in his aspect that must needs attract the attention of the passersby at each step he half expected the leveling of some accusing finger the pitiless sunshine seemed to single him out and stream upon him like a calcium light it was intolerable he must get away from this jostling crowd this babel of voices what should he do where should he go to return to the yard and face the workmen was not to be thought of if he went to his lodgings he would be called to dinner and have to listen to the inane prattle of the schoolmaster that would be even more intolerable than this garish daylight and these careless squads of men and women who paused in the midst of their laugh to turn and stare was there no spot in stillwater where a broken man could hide himself long enough to collect his senses with his hands thrust convulsively into the pockets of his sackcoat richard turned down a narrow passageway fringing the rear of some warehouses as he hurried along aimlessly his fingers encountered something in one of his pockets it was the key of a new lock which had been put on the scullery door of the house in welchs court richards heart gave a quick throb there at least was a temporary refuge he would go there and wait until it was time for him to surrender himself to the officers it appeared to richard that he was nearly a year reaching the little back yard of the lonely house he slipped into the scullery and locked the door wondering if his movements had been observed since he quitted the main street here he drew a long breath and looked around him then he began wandering restlessly through the rooms of which there were five or six on the groundfloor the furniture the carpets and all the sordid fixtures of the house were just as richard had known them in his childhood everything was unchanged even to the faded peacockfeather stuck over the parlor lookingglass as he regarded the familiar objects and breathed the snuffy atmosphere peculiar to the place the past rose so vividly before him that he would scarcely have been startled if a lean gray old man had suddenly appeared in one of the doorways on a peg in the front hall hung his cousins napless beaver hat satirically ready to be put on in the kitchen closet a pair of ancient shoes worn down at the heel and with taps on the toe had all the air of intending to step forth the shoes had been carefully blacked but a thin skin of mould had gathered over them they looked like lemuel shackford they had taken a position habitual with him richard was struck by the subtile irony which lay in these inanimate things that a mans hat should outlast the man and have a jaunty expression of triumph that a dead mans shoes should mimic him the tall eightday clock on the landing had run down it had stopped at twelve and it now stood with solemnly uplifted finger as if imposing silence on those small unconsidered noises which commonly creep out like mice only at midnight the house was full of such stealthy sounds the stairs creaked at intervals mysteriously as if under the weight of some heavy person ascending now and then the woodwork stretched itself with a snap as though it had grown stiff in the joints with remaining so long in one position at times there were muffled reverberations of footfalls on the flooring overhead richard had a curious consciousness of not being alone but of moving in the midst of an invisible throng of persons who elbowed him softly and breathed in his face and vaguely impressed themselves upon him as being former occupants of the premises this populous solitude this silence with its busy interruptions grew insupportable as he passed from room to room one chamber he did not enter the chamber in which his cousins body was found that wednesday morning in richards imagination it was still lying there white and piteous by the hearth he paused at the threshold and glanced in then turned abruptly and mounted the staircase on gaining his old apartment in the gable richard seated himself on the edge of the cotbed his shoulders sagged down and a stupefied expression settled upon his face but his brain was in a tumult his own identity was become a matter of doubt to him was he the same richard shackford who had found life so sweet when he awoke that morning it must have been some other person who had sat by a window in the sunrise thinking of margaret slocums love some richard shackford with unstained hands this one was accused of murdering his kinsman the weapon with which he had done it the very match he had used to light him in the deed were known the victim himself had written out the accusation in black and white richards brain reeled as he tried to fix his thought on lemuel shackfords letter that letter where had it been all this while and how did it come into taggetts possession only one thing was clear to richard in his inextricable confusion he was not going to be able to prove his innocence he was a doomed man and within the hour his shame would be published to the world rowland slocum and lawyer perkins had already condemned him and margaret would condemn him when she knew all for it was evident that up to last evening she had not been told how did it happen that these overwhelming proofs had rolled themselves up against him what malign influences were these at work hurrying him on to destruction and not leaving a single loophole of escape who would believe the story of his innocent ramble on the turnpike that tuesday night who could doubt that he had gone directly from the slocums to welchs court and then crept home redhanded through the deserted streets richard heard the steamwhistles recalling the operatives to work and dimly understood it was one oclock but after that he paid no attention to the lapse of time it was an hour later perhaps two hours richard could not tell when he roused himself from his stupor and descending the stairs passed through the kitchen into the scullery there he halted and leaned against the sink irresolute as though his purpose if he had had a purpose were escaping him he stood with his eyes resting listlessly on a barrel in the further corner of the apartment it was a heavyhooped winecask in which lemuel shackford had been wont to keep his winters supply of salted meat suddenly richard started forward with an inarticulate cry and at the same instant there came a loud knocking at the door behind him the sound reverberated through the empty house filling the place with awful echoes like those knocks at the gate of macbeths castle the night of duncans murder richard stood petrified for a second then he hastily turned the key in the lock and mr taggett stepped into the scullery the two men exchanged swift glances the bewildered air of a moment before had passed from richard the dullness had faded out of his eyes leaving them the clear alert expression they ordinarily wore he was selfpossessed but the effort his selfpossession cost him was obvious there was a something in his face a dilation of the nostril a curve of the under lip which put mr taggett very much on his guard mr taggett was the first to speak ive a disagreeable mission here he said slowly with his hand remaining on the latch of the door which he had closed on entering i have a warrant for your arrest mr shackford stop a moment said richard with a glow in his eyes i have something to say i advise you not to make any statement i understand my position perfectly mr taggett and i shall disregard the advice after you have answered me one or two questions i shall be quite at your service if you insist then you were present at the examination of thomas blufton and william durgin were you not i was you recollect william durgins testimony most distinctly he stated that the stains on his clothes were from a certain barrel the head of which had been freshly painted red i remember mr taggett the head of that barrel was painted blue xxvii mr taggett in spite of the excellent subjection under which he held his nerves caught his breath at these words and a transient pallor overspread his face as he followed the pointing of richards finger if william durgin had testified falsely on that point if he had swerved a hairsbreadth from the truth in that matter then there was but one conclusion to be drawn from his perjury a flash of lightning is not swifter than was mr taggetts thought in grasping the situation in an instant he saw all his carefully articulated case fall to pieces in his hands richard crossed the narrow room and stood in front of him mr taggett do you know why william durgin lied he lied because it was life or death with him in a moment of confusion he had committed one of those simple fatal blunders which men in his circumstances always commit he had obliterated the spots on his clothes with red paint when he ought to have used blue that is a very grave supposition it is not a supposition cried richard the daylight is not a plainer fact you are assuming too much mr shackford i am assuming nothing durgin has convicted himself he has fallen into a trap of his own devising i charge him with the murder of lemuel shackford i charge him with taking the chisel and the matches from my workshop to which he had free access and i charge him with replacing those articles in order to divert suspicion upon me my unfortunate relations with my cousin gave color to this suspicion the plan was an adroit plan and has succeeded it seems mr taggett did not reply at once and then very coldly you will pardon me for suggesting it but it will be necessary to ascertain if this is the cask which durgin hoped and also if the head has not been repainted since i understand what your doubt implies it is your duty to assure yourself of these facts and nothing can be easier the person who packed the meat it was probably a provision dealer named stubbs will of course be able to recognize his own work the other question you can settle with a scratch of your penknife you see there has been only one thin coat of paint laid on the grain of the wood is nearly distinguishable through it the head is evidently new but the cask itself is an old one it has stood here these ten years mr taggett bent a penetrating look on richard why did you refuse to answer the subpoena mr shackford but i havent refused i was on my way to justice beemiss office when you knocked perhaps i am a trifle late added richard catching mr taggetts distrustful glance the summons said two oclock remarked mr taggett pressing the spring of his watch it is now after three after three how could you neglect it with evidence of such presumable importance in your hands it was only a moment ago that i discovered this i had come here from mr perkinss office mr perkins had informed me of the horrible charge which was to be laid at my door the intelligence fell upon me like a thunderclap i think it unsettled my reason for a while i was unable to put two ideas together at first he didnt believe i had killed my cousin and presently he seemed to believe it when i got out in the street the sidewalk lurched under my feet like the deck of a ship everything swam before me i dont know how i managed to reach this house and i dont know how long i had been sitting in a room upstairs when the recollection of the subpoena occurred to me i was standing here dazed with despair i saw that i was somehow caught in the toils and that it was going to be impossible to prove my innocence if another man had been in my position i should have believed him guilty i stood looking at the cask in the corner there scarcely conscious of it then i noticed the blue paint on the head and then william durgins testimony flashed across my mind where is he cried richard turning swiftly that man should be arrested i am afraid he is gone said mr taggett biting his lip do you mean he has fled if you are correct he has fled he failed to answer the summons today and the constable sent to look him up has been unable to find him durgin was in the barroom of the tavern at eight oclock last night he has not been seen since he was not in the yard this morning you have let him slip through your fingers so it appears for the moment you still doubt me mr taggett i dont let persons slip through my fingers richard curbed an impatient rejoinder and said quietly william durgin had an accomplice mr taggett flushed as if richard had read his secret thought durgins flight if he really had fled had suggested a fresh possibility to mr taggett what if durgin were merely the pliant instrument of the cleverer man who was now using him as a shield this reflection was precisely in mr taggetts line in absconding durgin had not only secured his own personal safety but had exonerated his accomplice it was a desperate step to take but it was a skillful one he had an accomplice repeated mr taggett after a moment who was it torrini the man who was hurt the other day yes you have grounds for your assertion he and durgin were intimate and have been much together lately i sat up with torrini the night before last he acted and talked very strangely the man was out of his head part of the time but now as i think it over i am convinced that he had this matter on his mind and was hinting at it i believe he would have made disclosures if i had urged him a little he was evidently in great dread of a visit from some person and that person was durgin torrini ought to be questioned without delay he is very low and may die at any moment he is lying in a house at the further end of the town if it is not imperative that i should report myself to justice beemis we had better go there at once mr taggett who had been standing with his head half bowed lifted it quickly as he asked the question why did you withhold lemuel shackfords letter it was never in my possession mr taggett said richard starting that paper is something i cannot explain at present i can hardly believe in its existence though mr perkins declares that he has had it in his hands and it would be impossible for him to make a mistake in my cousins writing the letter was found in your lodgings so i was told i dont understand it that explanation will not satisfy the prosecuting attorney i have only one theory about it said richard slowly what is that i prefer not to state it now i wish to stop at my boardinghouse on the way to torrinis it will not be out of our course mr taggett gave silent acquiescence to this richard opened the scullery door and the two passed into the court neither spoke until they reached lime street mrs spooner herself answered richards ring for he had purposely dispensed with the use of his passkey i wanted to see you a moment mrs spooner said richard making no motion to enter the hall thanks we will not come in i merely desire to ask you a question were you at home all day on that monday immediately preceding my cousins death no replied mrs spooner wonderingly with her hand still resting on the knob i wasnt at home at all i spent the day and part of the night with my daughter maria ann at south millville it was a boy added mrs spooner quite irrelevantly smoothing her ample apron with the disengaged hand then janet was at home said richard call janet a trim intelligentlooking nova scotia girl was summoned from the basement kitchen janet said richard do you remember the day about three weeks ago that mrs spooner was absent at south millville yes replied the girl without hesitation it was the day before and then she stopped exactly it was the day before my cousin was killed now i want you to recollect whether any letter or note or written message of any description was left for me at this house on that day janet reflected i think there was mr richard a bit of paper like mr taggett riveted his eyes on the girl who brought the paper demanded richard it was one of the murphy boys i think did you hand it to me no mr richard you had gone out it was just after breakfast you gave it to me when i came home to dinner then no returned janet becoming confused with a dim perception that something had gone wrong and she was committing herself i remember i didnt come home i dined at the slocums what did you do with that paper i put it on the table in your room upstairs mr taggetts eyes gleamed a little at this and that is all you can say about it inquired richard with a fallen countenance janet reflected she reflected a long while this time no mr shackford an hour or so afterwards when i went up to do the chamberwork i saw that the wind had blow the paper off of the table i picked up the note and put it back but the wind blew it off again what then then i shut up the note in one of the big books meaning to tell you of it and and i forgot it oh mr richard have i done something dreadful dreadful cried richard janet i could hug you oh mr richard said janet with a little coquettish movement natural to every feminine thing bird flower or human being youve always such a pleasant way with you then there was a moment of dead silence mrs spooner saw that the matter whatever it was was settled you neednt wait janet she said with a severe mystified air we are greatly obliged to you mrs spooner not to mention janet said richard and if mr taggett has no questions to ask we will not detain you mrs spooner turned her small amiable orbs on richards companion that silent little man mr taggett he doesnt look like much was the landladys unuttered reflection and indeed he did not present a spirited appearance nevertheless mrs spooner followed him down the street with her curious gaze until he and richard passed out of sight neither richard nor mr taggett was disposed to converse as they wended their way to mitchells alley richards ire was slowly kindling at the shameful light in which he had been placed by mr taggett and mr taggett was striving with only partial success to reconcile himself to the idea of young shackfords innocence young shackfords innocence was a very awkward thing for mr taggett for he had irretrievably committed himself at headquarters with richards latent ire was mingled a feeling of profound gratitude the lord was on my side he said presently he was on your side as you remark and when the lord is on a mans side a detective necessarily comes out second best really mr taggett said richard smiling that is a handsome admission on your part i mean sir replied the latter slightly nettled that it sometimes seems as if the lord himself took charge of a case certainly you are entitled to the credit of going to the bottom of this one i have skillfully and laboriously damaged my reputation mr shackford mr taggett said this with so heavy an air that richard felt a stir of sympathy in his bosom i am very sorry he said goodnaturedly no i beg of you exclaimed mr taggett any expression of friendliness from you would finish me for nearly ten days i have looked upon you as a most cruel and consummate villain i know said richard i must be quite a disappointment to you in a small way mr taggett laughed in spite of himself i hope i dont take a morbid view of it he said a few steps further on he relaxed his gait we have taken the hennessey girl into custody do you imagine she was concerned have you questioned her yes she denies everything except that she told durgin you had quarreled with the old gentleman i think mary hennessey an honest girl shes little more than a child i doubt if she knew anything whatever durgin was much too shrewd to trust her i fancy as the speakers struck into the principal street through the lower and busier end of which they were obliged to pass mr taggett caused a sensation the drivers of carts and the pedestrians on both sidewalks stopped and looked at him the part he had played in slocums yard was now an open secret and had produced an excitement that was not confined to the clientиle of snellings barroom it was known that william durgin had disappeared and that the constables were searching for him the air was thick with flying projectures but none of them precisely hit the mark one rumor there was which seemed almost like a piece of poetical justice a whisper to the effect that rowland slocum was suspected of being in some way mixed up with the murder the fact that lawyer perkins with his green bag streaming in the wind so to speak had been seen darting into mr slocums private residence at two oclock that afternoon was sufficient to give birth to the horrible legend mitchells alley said mr taggett thrusting his arm through richards and hurrying on the escape the stillwater gaze you went there directly from the station the night you got home how did you know that i was told by a fellowtraveler of yours and a friend of mine by jove did it ever strike you mr taggett that there is such a thing as being too clever it has occurred to me recently here is the house two sallowskinned children with wide wistful black eyes who were sitting on the stone step shyly crowded themselves together against the doorjamb to make passageway for richard and mr taggett then the two pairs of eyes veered round inquiringly and followed the strangers up the broken staircase and saw one of them knock at the door which faced the building richards hasty tap bringing no response he lifted the latch without further ceremony and stepped into the chamber mr taggett a pace or two behind him the figure of father omeara slowly rising from a kneeling posture at the bedside was the first object that met their eyes the second was torrinis placid face turned a little on the pillow the third was brigida sitting at the foot of the bed motionless with her arms wrapped in her apron he is dead said the priest softly advancing a step towards richard you are too late he wanted to see you mr shackford but you were not to be found richard sent a swift glance over the priests shoulder he wanted to tell me what part he had played in my cousins murder said richard god forbid the wretched man had many a sin on his soul but not that not that no he had no hand in it no more than you or i his fault was that he concealed his knowledge of the deed after it was done he did not even suspect who committed the crime until two days afterwards when william durgin richards eyes lighted up as they encountered mr taggetts the priest mistook the significance of the glances no said father omeara indicating brigida with a quick motion of his head the poor soul does not understand a word but even if she did i should have to speak of these matters here and now while they are fresh in my mind i am obeying the solemn injunctions of the dead two days after the murder william durgin came to torrini and confessed the deed offering to share with him a large sum in gold and notes if he would hide the money temporarily torrini agreed to do so later durgin confided to him his plan of turning suspicion upon you mr shackford indeed of directly charging you with the murder if the worst came to the worst torrini agreed to that also because of some real or fancied injury at your hands it seems that the implement which durgin had employed in forcing the scullery door the implement which he afterwards used so mercilessly had been stolen from your workshop the next morning durgin put the tool back in its place not knowing what other disposition to make of it and it was then that the idea of shouldering the crime upon you entered his wicked heart according to torrini durgin did not intend to harm the old gentleman but simply to rob him the unfortunate man was awakened by the noise durgin made in breaking open the safe and rushed in to his doom having then no fear of interruption durgin leisurely ransacked the house how he came across the will and destroyed it with the idea that he was putting the estate out of your possession this and other details i shall give you by and by father omeara paused a moment after the accident at the mill and the conviction that he was not to recover torrinis conscience began to prick him when he reflected on miss slocums kindness to his family during the strike when he now saw her saving his wife and children from absolute starvation he was nearly ready to break the oath with which he had bound himself to william durgin curiously enough this man so reckless in many things held his pledged word sacred meanwhile his wavering condition became apparent to durgin who grew alarmed and demanded the stolen property torrini refused to give it up even his own bitter necessities had not tempted him to touch a penny of it for the last three days he was in deadly terror lest durgin should wrest the money from him by force the poor woman here knows nothing of all this it was her presence however which probably prevented durgin from proceeding to extremities with torrini who took care never to be left alone i recollect said richard the night i watched with him he was constantly expecting some one i supposed him to be wandering in his mind he was expecting durgin though torrini had every reason for believing that he had fled mr taggett leaned forward and asked when did he go and where he was too cunning to confide his plans to torrini three nights ago durgin came here and begged for a portion of the banknote previously he had reclaimed the whole sum he said the place was growing too warm for him and that he had made up his mind to leave but torrini held on to the money having resolved that it should be restored intact to you he promised durgin however to keep his flight secret for three or four days at the end of which time torrini meant to reveal all to me at confession the night you sat with him mr shackford he was near breaking his promise your kindness was coals of fire on his head his agony lest he should die or lose his senses before he could make known the full depth of durgins villainy must have been something terrible this is the substance of what the poor creature begged me to say to you with his dying regrets the money is hidden somewhere under the mattress i believe a better man than torrini would have spent some of it added father omeara waving a sort of benediction in the direction of the bed richard did not speak for a moment or two the wretchedness and grimness of it all smote him to the heart when he looked up mr taggett was gone and the priest was gently drawing the coverlet over torrinis face richard approached father omeara and said when the money is found please take charge of it and see that every decent arrangement is made i mean spare nothing i am a protestant but i believe in any mans prayers when they are not addressed to a heathen image i promised torrini to send his wife and children to italy this pitiful miserable gold which cost so dear and is worth so little shall be made to do that much good at least as richard was speaking a light footfall sounded on the staircase outside then the door which stood ajar was softly pushed open and margaret paused on the threshold at the rustle of her dress richard turned and hastened towards her it is all over he said softly laying his finger on his lip father omeara was again kneeling by the bedside let us go now whispered richard to margaret it seemed fit that they should leave the living and the dead to the murmured prayers and solemn ministration of the kindly priest such later services as margaret could render to the bereaved woman were not to be wanting at the foot of the stairs richard shackford halted abruptly and oblivious of the two children who were softly chattering together in the doorway caught margarets hand in his margaret torrini has made a confession that sets at rest all question of my cousins death do you mean that he margaret faltered and left the sentence unfinished no it was william durgin god forgive him william durgin the young girls fingers closed nervously on richards as she echoed the name and she began trembling that that is stranger yet i will tell you everything when we get home this is no time or place but one thing i must ask you now and here when you sat with me last night were you aware that mr taggett firmly believed it was i who had killed lemuel shackford yes said margaret that is all i care to know cried richard that consoles me and the two pairs of great inquisitive eyes looking up from the stone step saw the signorina standing quite mute and colorless with the strange gentlemans arms around her and the signorina was smiling xxviii one june morning precisely a year from that morning when the reader first saw the daylight breaking upon stillwater several workmen with ladders and hammers were putting up a freshly painted sign over the gate of the marble yard mr slocum and richard stood on the opposite curbstone to which they had retired in order to take in the general effect the new sign read slocum shackford richard protested against the displacement of its weatherstained predecessor it seemed to him an act little short of vandalism but mr slocum was obstinate and would have it done he was secretly atoning for a deep injustice into which richard had been at once too sensitive and too wise closely to inquire if mr slocum had harbored a temporary doubt of him richard did not care to know it it was quite enough to suspect the fact his sufficient recompense was that margaret had not doubted they had now been married six months the shadow of the tragedy in welchs court had long ceased to oppress them it had vanished with the hasty departure of mr taggett neither he nor william durgin was ever seen again in the flesh in stillwater but they both still led and will probably continue for years to lead a sort of phantasmal legendary life in snellings barroom durgin in his flight had left no traces from time to time as the months rolled on a misty rumor was blown to the town of his having been seen in some remote foreign city now in one place and now in another always on the point of departing selfpursued like the wandering jew but nothing authentic his afterfate was to be a sealed book in stillwater i really wish you had let the old sign stand said richard as the carpenters removed the ladders the yard can never be anything but slocums yard it looks remarkably well up thee replied mr slocum shading his eyes critically with one hand you object to the change but for my part i dont object to changes i trust i may live to see the day when even this sign will have to be altered to slocum shackford son how would you like that i cant say returned richard laughing as they passed into the yard together i should first have to talk it over with the son the end
