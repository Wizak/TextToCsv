 wapshots demon he kept me waiting on a hard wooden bench for threequarters of an hour before his secretary came wan dering out glanced casually at me stopped to chat with the switchboard girl drifted in my direction again paused to straighten out the magazines on the waitingroom table and finally came over to tell me that the postal inspector would see me now i was in no mood to be polite but i was very good i marched in and put my briefcase on his desk and said sir i must protest this highhanded behavior i assure yon i have no client whose activities would bring him in conflict in any way with the post office department i said as much to one of your staff on the phone after i received your letter ordering me to appear here but they he stood up smiling amiably and shook my hand be fore i could get it out of the way thats all right he said cheerfully thats perfectly all right well straighten it out right away what did you say your name was i told him my name and started to go on with what i had to say but he wasnt listening roger barclay he repeated looking at a pile of folders on his desk bar clay barclay barclay oh yes he picked up one of the folders and opened it the wapshot business he said the folder seemed to contain mostly large bright colored flimsylooking magazines entitled secret most secret top secret and shush he opened one of them where a paper clip marked a place and handed it to me there was a small ad circled in red crayon thats it he said your boy wapshot the ad was of no conceivable interest to me i barely glanced at it something about fortunetelling it looked like signed by somebody named cleon wapshot at an address in one of those little towns in maine i handed it back to the postal inspector i have already mformed you i said that i have no client involved in difficulties with the post office department that is not my sort of practice at all and i most certainly have no client named aeon wapshot that took some of the wind out of his sails he looked at me suspiciously then took a scrawly piece of paper out of the folder and read it over then looked at me suspi ciously again he handed over the piece of paper what about this then he demanded it was a penciled letter addressed to the postal in spector in eastport maine it said dear sir please send all further communications to my attorney roger barclay esq of fifth avenue new york and oblige yours sincerely clean wapshot naturally that was a puzzler to me but i finally con vinced the postal inspector that id never heard of this wapshot you could see he thought there was something funny about the whole thing and wasnt quite sure whether i had anything to do with it or not but after all the post office department is used to cranks and he finally let me go and even apologized for taking my time after i had assured him for the tenth time that i had nothing to do with wapshot that shows how wrong you can be i hurried back to my office and went in through the private door down the hall when i rang for phoebe i had already put the affair out of my mind as the sort of ridiculous timewaster that makes it so difficult to run a law office on schedule phoebe was bursting with messages frankel had called on the harrys hideaway lease call him back mr zimmer had called three times wouldnt leave a message the process server had been unable to find the defendants in the her lihy suit one of the operatives from the splendid detec tive agency was bringing in a confidential report at and theres a man to see you she finished up hes been here over an hour his names uh wapshot cleon wapshot he was a plump little man with a crew cut not very much like any downeast lobsterman i ever had imagined but his voice was authentic of the area i said sir you have caused me a great deal of embarrassment what in heavens name possessed you to give the post office my name he biinked at me mildly youre my lawyer nonsense my good man there are some formalities to go through before pshaw he said heres your retainer mr barclay he pushed a manila envelope toward me across the desk i said but i havent taken your case you will but the retainer scarcely know what the figure should be i dont even know what law you brwhat allegations were made oh postal fraud swindling fortunetelling that kind of thing he said nothing to it how much you figure you ought to have just to get started i sat back and looked him over fortunetelling postal fraud but he had a roundfaced honesty you know the kind of expression jurymen respect and trust he didnt look rich and he didnt look poor he had a suit on that was very far from new but the overcoat was new brand new and not cheap and besides he had come right out and said what his business was none of this fake air of i dont need a lawyer but if you want to pick up a couple bucks for saving me the trouble of writing a letter youre on that i see coming in to my office thirty times a week i said briskly five hundred dollars for a starter mr wapshot he grinned and tapped the envelope count er up he said i stared at him but i did what he said i dumped the contents of the manila envelope on my desk there was a thick packet of u s postal money orders a hundred and fortyone of them according to a neatly penciled slip attached to them made out variously to aeon wapshot clion wopshatt c wapshut and a dozen other alternate forms each neatly endorsed on the back by my new client each in the amount of there was a packet not quite so thick of checks all colors and sizes ninetysix of these all in the same amount of there was a still thinner packet of onedollar bills thirty of them and finally there were stamps amounting to c i took a pencil and added them up wapshot said anxiously thats all right isnt it im sorry about the stamps but thats the way the orders come in and theres nothing i can do about it tried and tried to turn them in but they wont give me but half the value for them in the post office and thats not right thats wasteful you can use them around here cant you i said with an effort sit down mr wapshot tell me what this is all about well he told me but whether i understood or didnt understand i cant exactly say parts of it made sense and parts of it were obviously crazy but what it all came to was that with five appointments and a heavy days mail untouched i found myself in a cab with this deon wapshot beetling across town to a little fleabag hotel on the west side i didnt think the elevator was going to make it but i have to admit i was wrong it got us to the fifth floor and wapshot led the way down a hall where all the doors seemed to be ajar and the guests peeping impassively out at us and we went into a room with an unmade bed and a marbletopped bureau and a dripping shower in the pintsized bath and a lug gage rack andon the luggage rack a washing machine or anyway it looked like a washing machine wapshot put his hand on it with simple pride my semantic polarizer he explained i followed him into the room holding my breath there was a fine greasy film of grit on the gadgetwapshot had not been clever enough to close the window to the air shaft which appeared to double as a garbage chute for the guests on the upper stories under the gritas i say a washing machine one of the small lighthousekeeping kinds a drawn aluminum pail a head with some sort of electric business inside and a couple of things that didnt seem connected with washing clothestwo traps one on either side of the pail the traps were covered with wire mesh and both of them were filled with white cards here said wapshot and picked one of the cards out of the nearest trap it was a tiny snapshot like the vmail letters photographically diminished soldiers overseas used to send i read it without difficulty dear mr wapshat my husband was always a good husband to me not counting the drink but when his cousin moved in up stairs he cooled off to me he is always buying her candy and flowers because he promised her mother he would take care of her after the mother who was my husbands aunt died her television is always getting broken and he has to go up to fix it sometimes until four oclock in the morning also he never told me he had an aunt until she moved in i enclose dollar and cents as it says in your ad in shut up please tell me is she really his cousin i looked up from the letter wapshot took it from me glanced at it shrugged i get a lot of that kind he said mr wapshot are you confessing that you are telling fortunes by mail no he looked upset didnt i make you under stand it hasnt got anything to do with fortunes ques tions that have a yes or no answer thats allif i can give them a definite yes or a definite no i do it and keep the dollar ninetyeight if i cant i give back the money i stared at him trying to tell if he was joking he didnt look as though he was joking in the airshaft something went whizpop a fine spray of grit blew in off the window sill wapshot shook his head reproachfully throwing their trash down again mr barclay ive told the desk clerk a dozen times forget the desk clerk whats the difference between what you said and fortunetelling he took a deep breath i swear mr barclay he said sadly i dont think you listen i went all through this in your office do it again he shrugged well he said you start with clerk maxwell he was a man who discovered a lot of things and one of the things he discovered he never knew about i yelled now how could he just listen mr barclay it was something that they call maxwells demon you know what hot air is i said meaning it to hurt im learning no no not that kind of hot air i mean just plain hot air like you might get out of a radiator its hot be cause the molecules in it are moving fast understand heat is fast molecules cold is slow molecules thats the only difference he was getting warmed up now ordinary air he went on is a mixture of molecules at different speeds some move fast some move slow its the average that gives you your temperature what clerk maxwell said and he said it kind of as a joke you know except a genius never really jokes and never really makes a mistake even the things he doesnt really mean sometimes turn out to be true anyway what clerk maxwell said was wouldnt it be nice if we could train a little demon to stand in the window of a house he could direct the fastmoving molecules inside giving us heat and direct the slowmoving ones into say the kitchen refrigeratorgiving us cold you follow me so far i laughed haha but im not a fool mr wapshot and i have had a certain amount of education i am aware that there is a law of entropy that haha he interrupted hold on for a minute mr barclay i heard all about the law of entropy which says that high and low temperatures tend to merge and average out instead of separating i heard about it you heard about it and even maxwell heard about it but there was a german fellow name of hilsch and he didnt hear about it because what he did mr barclay was to invent some thing called the hilsch tube and all the hilsch tube is is maxwells demon come to life honest it really works you blow into itits a kind of little pipe with a joint sticking out of it the simplestlooking little thing you ever sawand hot air comes out of one end cold air comes out of the other dont take my word for it he said hur riedly holding up his hand dont argue with me after world war ii they brought back a couple of those things from germany and theyre all over the country now they work i said patiently mr wapshot what has this got to do with fortunetelling he scowled it isnt fortune well never mind that so we take my semantic polarizer i put into it a large sample of particleswhat we call a universe these par ticles are microfilmed copies of letters people have sent me along with their checks for a dollar ninetyeight just like i told them to do in my ads i run the polarizer for a while until the particles in the universe are thoroughly randomed and then i start tapping off the questions the ones that come out at this end the answer is yes the ones that come out at the other no i have to admit he confessed a little embarrassed that i can only pull about sixty per cent out before the results begin getting un reliablethe ones that come off slowly are evidently less highly charged than the ones that come off right away and so theres a chance of error but the ones that come off early mr barclay theyre for sure after all he de manded what else can they be but definite dont for get the particles are exactly alike in every respectshape color weight size texture appearance feel everything every respect but one the only difference is for some the answer is yes for some the answer is no i stood looking at him silently a bottle whizzed and splintered in the airshaft we both ducked i said it works it works he said solemnly youve tried it out he grinnedalmost for the first time you took my case didnt you that was a yes your price was five hundred that was a yes it works mr barclay as i see it that ends the discussion and so it did of coursepermanently the semantic polarizer was remarkably easy to run i played with it for a while and then i sent the whitehaired bellboy down for the sunday papers he looked at me as if i was some kind of an idiot excuse me he said scratching his head but isnt today wednes i want the sunday papers i told him here well the fivedollar bill got the papers for me but obviously he still thought i was crazy he said excuse me but did the gemmun in this room go out you mean mr wapshot i asked him yes thats right he went out and now if you will kindly do the same i locked the door behind him oh wapshot had gone out all right i pulled the papers apartthey were a stack nearly a foot highand crumpled them section by section and when i had dumped them down the airshaft piece by piece stare how i might lean as far out as i would i could see nothing at the bottom of the shaft but paper so much for cleon wapshot gone early to join the immortals i checked the room over carefully there was one small blood spot on the floor but in that room it hardly mat tered i pulled the leg of the chair over to cover it put the semantic analyzer in its crate turned off the light and rang for the elevator the blasted thing weighed a ton but i managed it the elevator starter at my office gave me a lot of trouble but i finally got the thing into a freight elevator andfor another five bucks to the porterin the private door to my office phoebe heard me moving around and came trotting in with a face like cataclysm mr barclay she cried theyre here theyve been waiting ever since you left with mr wapshot god rest him i said who are yon talking about why the men from the bar association she ex plained it had completely slipped my mind i patted her hand there i said show them in my dear the two men from the bar association came in like corpse robbers mr barclay the fat one said speaking for the committee we cannot accept your explanation that of the hoskins estate was expended for miscellany lacking a more detailed accounting we have no choice but to i understand perfectly i told him bowing you wish me to pay backto make up the deficit out of my own pocket he scowled at me whyyes that for a starter he said sternly but there is also the matter of the annie sprayragen trust fund where the item of for general expense has been challenged by that too i said gentlemen i shall pauperize my self to make good these sums my whole fortune will go to it if necessary fortune squawked the short thin one thats the trouble barclay weve talked to your bank and they say you havent two dimes to rub together disbarment snarled the fat one thats why were here barclay it was time to make an end i gave up the pretense of politeness gentlemen i said crisply i think not they stared barclay snapped the fat one bluff will get you theres no bluff i walked over to my desk patting the crate of the semantic polarizer on the way i pre tended to consult my calendar be good enough to return on monday next i told them i shall have certified checks for the full amounts ready at that time the short thin one said uncertainly why should we let you stall what else can you do the moneys gone gentlemen if you want it back be here on monday and now goodday phoebe appeared to show them out and i got down to work busy busy busy phoebe was busier than i at thatafter the first day i spent the rest of that day printing out yesorno ques tions on little squares of paper microfilming them and bouncing them through the hopper of the semantic polar izer while the drum of the machine spun and bounced i stood and gloated wapshots demon and all he could think to use it for was a simple mailorder business drudgery instead of wealth beyond dreaming with a brain that could create the semantic polarizer he was unable to see beyond the cash value of a fortunetelling service well it was an easy way to pay his bills and obviously he wasnt much in terested in wealth but i however was and that was why i ran poor phoebe ragged to the bookmakers to the bank to the stockbrokers to the track to the numbers runners back to the office i loaned her my pigskin case and when that wasnt big enough the numbers bank for instance paid off in fives and tens she took a hundred dollars out of the bottom file drawer and bought a suitcase because it was after all simple enough to get rich in a hurry take a race at aque duct there are eight horses entered maybe write a slip for each one will win the first at aqueduct today repeat for the second race the third race all the races to the end of the day run them through the polar izer pick out the cards that come through the yes hopper and place your bets numbers you need thirty slips will the first digit of the winning number be etc ten slips for the first digit ten for the second ten for the third pick out the three that come out yes put them together and a bet on the numbers pays odds of to one it took me thirtysix hours to work out the winners of the next three weeks races fights ball games and tennis matches the stock quotations of a hundred selected issues and the numbers that would come up on the policy wheel and i say this they were the happiest thirtysix hours of my life of all my life it was a perfectly marvelous time and too bad that it couldnt go on i had everything ready my suitcase of currency my lists of the bets to place in the immediate future my feltlined wardrobe trunk for transporting the polarizer my anonymous letter to the manager of the late cleon wapshots hotel directing his attention to the air shaft even my insulting note to the committee on dis barments of the bar association my passport was in order my reservation by air france to new guinea was confirmed and i was only waiting for phoebe to come back with the tickets i had time to kill and curiosity is a famed killer of cats of time and of other things when phoebe came back she pounded on the door for nearly an hour knowing i was in there knowing i would miss my plane begging me to come out to answer to speak to her but what was the use i took my list of bets and tore it in shreds i took the polarizer and smashed it to jangling bits and then i waited goodby wall street goodby kentucky derby good by a million dollars a month i suppose theyll find wap shots body sooner or later and there isnt a doubt that theyll trace it back to methe bellboy the postal inspec tor even phoebe might provide the link say a week to find the body another week at the most to put the finger on me two months for the trial and sentence of execu tion a month or two after call it four months from date until they would put me in the chair i wish i hadnt asked the polarizer one certain question i wish i were going still to be alive four months from date
