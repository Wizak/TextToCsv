enid blyton the circus of adventure chapter home from school the quiet house was quiet no longer the four children were back from boardingschool and were even now dragging in their trunks shouting to one another kiki the parrot joined in the general excitement of course and screeched loudly aunt allie were back yelled jack be quiet kiki i cant hear myself shout mother where are you called dinah were home again her mother appeared in a hurry smiles all over her face dinah philip i didnt expect you quite so soon well lucyann youve grown and philip you look bursting with health i dont know why grinned philip giving mrs cunningham a big hug the food at school is so frightful i never eat any of it same old story said mrs cunningham laughing hallo kiki say how do you do how do you do said the parrot solemnly and held out her left foot as if to shake hands new trick said jack but wrong foot old thing dont you know your left from your right yet left right left right left right said kiki at once and began marking time remarkably well left right left thats enough said jack he turned to mrs cunningham hows bill is he here too he meant to be here to welcome you all said mrs cunningham bills wife but he had a sudden phone call this morning took the car and went racing off to london all in a hurry the four children groaned it isnt some job thats turned up just as were home for the easter hols is it said lucyann bills always got some secret work to do just at the wrong time well i hope it isnt said mrs cunningham im expecting him to telephone at any moment to say if hes going to be back tonight or not mother shall we unpack down here and take our things up straight away called dinah four trunks lying about the hall leave no room to move yes but leave two of the trunks downstairs when theyre empty said her mother were going off on a holiday tomorrow all of us together this was news to the children they clustered round mrs cunningham at once you never said a word in your letters where are we going why didnt you tell us before well it was really bills idea not mine said mrs cunningham he just thought it would make a nice change i was surprised myself when he arranged it arranged it and never said a word to us said philip i sayis anything up it seems funny that bill did it all of a sudden last time i saw him when he came down to school to see us he was talking about what wed all do at home in the four weeks easter hols i dont really think theres anything peculiar about it said his mother bill gets these sudden ideas you know wellwhere are we all going to then asked jack pushing kiki off the sideboard where she was trying to take the lid off the biscuitjar its a place called little brockleton said mrs cunningham very quiet in the middle of the country just the kind of place you all like you can mess about in old things all day long little brockleton said philip brock means badger i wonder if there are badgers there ive always wanted to study badgers queer little bearlike beasts well youll be happy then said dinah i suppose that means youll be keeping a couple of badgers for pets before we know where we are ugh badgers are very nice animals began philip clean and most particular in their habits and lucyann gave a little squeal of laughter oh dearthey dont sound a bit like you then philip dont interrupt like that and dont make silly remarks said philip i was saying about badgers but nobody wanted to listen jack had a question he wanted to ask are there any decent birds round about little brockleton he said where is it by the sea jack was as mad as ever about birds so long as he could do birdwatching of some kind he was happy mrs cunningham laughed at him you and your birds jack and philip and his badgers i cant tell you anything about the birds therethe same ones as usual i suppose nowwhat about these trunks well unpack the lot take the boys trunks upstairs and leave the girls to take with us to little brockletonthey are not quite so hardused as yours can we have something to eat after weve unpacked asked philip im famished the school food you know is so yesive heard all that before philip said his mother youll have a fine lunch in half an houryes your favouritecold meat salad baked beans in tomato sauce potatoes in their jackets heaps of tomatoes oh good said everyone at once and kiki hopped solemnly from one leg to another good she said good good morning good night good the unpacking began kiki was dreadful in the train home said jack struggling with an armful of clothes and dropping half of them she got under the carriage seat to pick over some old toffee papers there and such a nice old man got in kiki stuffed the toffee papers into the turnup of his trousersyou should just have seen his face when he bent down and saw them and then she began to bark like a dog said lucyann with a giggle and the poor old man leapt off his seat as if hed been shot bangbang put in kiki poppop pop goes the weasel wipe your feet and shut the door oh kiki its nice to have you again with your silly talk said mrs cunningham laughing kiki put up her crest and sidled over to her she rubbed her head against mrs cunninghams hand like a cat i always expect you to purr kiki when you do that said mrs cunningham scratching the parrots head the unpacking was soon done it was very simple really dirty clothes were pitched into the enormous linenbasket the rest were pitched into drawers cant think why people ever make a fuss about packing or unpacking said jack kiki take your head out of my pocket whats this sudden craze for toffees do you want to get your beak stuck so that you cant talk kiki took her head out of jacks pocket and screeched triumphantly she had found a toffee now she would have a perfectly lovely time unwrapping the paper talking to herself all the while well thatll keep her quiet for a bit said dinah thankfully kikis always so noisy when shes excited so are you said philip at once dinah glared at him shut up you two said jack no sparring on the first day of hols gosh look at lucyann going up the stairs dropping a pair of socks on every step the telephone bell rang mrs cunningham ran to answer it that will be bill she said it was there was a short conversation which consisted mostly of yes no i see i suppose so no of course not yes yes no bill right yes ill explain see you tonight then goodbye whats he say asked lucyann is he coming soon i do want to see him yes hes coming this evening about halfpast five said mrs cunningham the four children didnt think she looked very pleased she opened her mouth to say something hesitated and then closed it again mother what was it you said youd explain said philip at once we heard you say yes ill explain was it something you had to tell us what is it dont say its anything horrid said lucyann bill is coming away with us isnt he oh yes said mrs cunningham welli hope you wont mind my dearsbut he badly wants us to take someone else with us who asked everyone at once and they all looked so fierce that mrs cunningham was quite surprised not his old aunt said dinah oh mother dont say its someone weve got to be on our best behaviour with all the time no of course not said her mother its a small boythe nephew of a friend of bills do we know him whats his name asked jack bill didnt tell me his name said mrs cunningham why cant he go to his own home for the holidays asked dinah in disgust i dont like small boys why should we have to have him hell probably spoil everything for us oh no he

come to us persisted dinah hasnt he got a home oh yesbut hes a foreigner said her mother hes been sent to school in england to have a good english education i should imagine his family want him to have a few weeks in a british family now and experience a little of our homelife also i gather there is some difficulty at his home at the momentillness i should think oh wellwell have to make the best of it said lucyann picturing a very little homesick boy and thinking that she would comfort him and make a fuss of him well park him with you then lucyann said dinah who didnt like small boys at all or small girls either you can wheel him about in a pram and put him to bed at night dont be silly dinah he wont be as small as that said her mother nowhave you finished its almost lunchtime so go and wash your hands and brush your hair wash your hands brush your hair wipe your feet blow your nose shouted kiki brush your hands blow your feet wipe youryouryour yesyouve got a bit muddled old thing said jack with a laugh kiki flew to his shoulder and began to pull at jacks ear lovingly then as she heard the sound of the gong suddenly booming out she gave a loud screech and flew into the diningroom she knew what that sound meant jack kiki will peck all the tomatoes if you dont keep an eye on her called mrs cunningham go after her quickly but there was no need to say thateveryone had rushed to the diningroom at the first sound of the gong chapter arrival of gustavus the afternoon was spent in looking all over the house to see if any changes had been made and in exploring the garden from end to end to see what flowers were out what edible things there were and to introduce kiki to six new hens theres a new carpet in the guestroom said lucyann but thats all the changes there are im glad i dont like to come home and find anything changed i suppose this small boy will sleep in the guestroom aunt allie yes said mrs cunningham im getting it ready in a minute or two go and join the others in the garden you can pick a few daffodils if you likewe want some in the hall lucyann wandered off happily the very first day of the holidays was always heavenly all the first few days went slowly and the thought of days and days of holiday ahead was one to dwell on contentedly almost every minute lucyann come here kikis having the time of her life called jack look at her showing off in front of the new hens kiki was sitting on a post in the henrun the six hens were gathered admiringly round her cluckcluckcluck they said to one another and one stretched herself on tiptoe and flapped her wings as if trying to fly kiki put her head on one side stretched herself on tiptoe too spread her wings wide and took off she sailed down to the surprised hens cluckluckluck urrrrrrk she said earnestly cluckluckluck urrrrrrk cluckuckuck cluck said the hens in admiration and went nearer one hen daringly pecked at one of the parrots tailfeathers this was insolence kiki danced round the alarmed hens making a noise like an aeroplane in trouble the hens took to their heels and fled into the henhouse almost tumbling over one another as they tried to squeeze in at the narrow doorway two at a time kiki waddled after them clucking again mrs cunningham called from a window children the hens will never lay us eggs if you let kiki scare them kikis gone into the henhouseshell probably sit in a nestingbox and try to lay an egg like the hens called jack come out kiki kiki came back and looked inquiringly out of the little doorway polly put the kettle on she said peaceably cluckluckluck urrrrrrk she flew to jacks shoulder and the hens looked at one another in relief was it safe to go out and wander round yet theres the nextdoor cat said dinah come to see what all the fuss is about i expect hang on to kiki jack oh shell bark like a dog if the cat comes any nearer said jack come onlets see what the gardener has got in the greenhouse it was a pleasant sunny afternoon and the four really enjoyed themselves mooching about as jack called it they all longed for bill to arrive then the family would be completeexcept of course that it would have one too many if he really brought the unexpected boy with him im going to watch at the gate for bill announced lucyann after tea we all will said philip good old bill what luck for us that hes not on one of his hushhush jobs just now and can come away with us they went to hang over the front gate together kiki kept putting her crest up and down excitedly she knew quite well that bill was coming bill pay the bill she kept saying wheres bill pop goes bill youre a sillybilly said lucyann stroking the parrots soft neck thats what you are thats an idiotic thing to call her said dinah just as were expecting bill shell screech out sillybilly to him now i bet you she will sillybilly billysilly shouted kiki she always loved words that sounded the same jack tapped her on the head no kiki stop it look heres a car coming perhaps its bills but it wasnt as it went by kiki hooted loudlyparpparpparpexactly like a car the driver was astonished he could see no car in sight he sounded his horn thinking there must be a hidden corner somewhere and then lucyann gave a squeal heres bill she said a big black car very sleek and shiny bill bill she was right it was bills car it drew up at the front gate and bills jolly face grinned at them as he looked out of the window somebody sat beside him was it the boy bill opened the door and leapt out the four children pounced on him bill good old bill how are you bill sillybilly screeched a voice ahgood evening kiki said bill as the parrot landed full on his shoulder still the same rude old bird aha you want me at home to teach you a few manners kiki cackled like an excited hen now thendont you lay eggs down my neck said bill what are you cackling about wheres your mother dinah there she is said dinah as mrs cunningham came running to the gate bill was about to call to her when an extremely loud cough came from the cara cough that was meant to be noticed ohi completely forgot for the moment said bill ive brought a visitor did you tell them allie yes i did said mrs cunningham where is he oh in the car bring him out bill come on out said bill and in the midst of a dead silence the owner of the loud cough slid out of the car in as dignified a manner as he could everyone stared at him he was about eleven and certainly very foreignlooking his blueblack hair was curly and too long his eyes were as black as his hair and he had thicker lashes than either of the girls and he certainly had magnificent manners he went to mrs cunningham and took the hand she held out to him but instead of shaking it he bowed over it and touched it with his lips mrs cunningham couldnt help smiling the four children stared in amusement my thanks to you dear lady he said in a very foreign accent thats all right said mrs cunningham have you had any tea but before the boy chose to answer this question he had to make a further display of manners he went to dinah and before she knew what he meant to do he took her hand and bent over it she gave a squeal and snatched it away dont she said lucyann put her hands firmly behind her back she didnt want them kissed either what an extraordinary boy gus old fellowwe just shake hands you know said bill trying to hide his amusement at the sight of the two girls indignant faces erthis is gustavus barmilevo allie he will be with us for the next few weeks as his uncle has asked me to keep an eye on him gustavus barmilevo bowed very low but did not attempt any more handkissing bill introduced the rest dinahlucyannjackand philip ierhope youll soon all be good friends the two boys shook hands with gus eyeing him with much disfavour goodness were they to put up with this little foreigner all the holidays gus did a funny little bow each time he shook hands plizzed to mit you he said what is zis bird how you call it its a kikibird said jack solemnly gus meet kiki kiki meet gus kiki held out her left foot as usual to shake hands gus looked extremely surprised but his manners remained perfect he held out his hand to kikis foot unfortunately kiki dug her talons into his ringers and he gave a loud yell what a noise what a noise said kiki severely wipe your feet and blow your nose fetch the doctor my fingers blidding said the boy with tears in his voice it blids look fetch the doctor pollys got a cold fetch the doctor chanted kiki enjoying herself the boy suddenly realised that it was the parrot who was talking he forgot his blidding and stared at kiki in amazement it spiks he announced in awe it spiks it spiks words it sees my blidding finger and spiks to fetch the doctor i never haf seen a kikibird before come along in and ill put a bit of bandage on your finger said mrs cunningham getting tired of all this yes it blids said gus mournfully watching a minute drop of blood fall to the ground he looked as if he was going to cry then he said a most extraordinary thing this bird he said looking at kiki suddenly this birdit must be in a cage i order it dont be a fathead said jack after a moments silence of astonishment come on aunt allielets go indoors gus might blid to death this was a most alarming thought and gus rushed into the house at once the others followed slowly what an extraordinary boy bit dippy said dinah in a low voice and they all nodded bills voice hailed them hey what about a spot of help with the luggage oh bill sorry we werent thinking said jack and ran back at once gus rather took our breath away what nationality is he oh hes a bit of a mixture i think said bill dont bother him about his family or his home or hell probably burst into tears sorry

promise you as its my friend who asked me to keep an eye on him well help bill said lucyann i expect hes shy oh deari was so afraid hed kiss my hand what would the girls at school say well i should

goes billy pop goes billy screeched kiki in delight and flew down to his shoulder to nibble his ear poppoppop chapter gussy and kiki there really wasnt very much time that evening to get to know gustavus barmilevo as they were all going off again the next day there was packing to do and all kinds of arguments arose as to what was or was not to be taken gustavus was bewildered by the noise of so many people talking at once he sat staring at them all nursing his bandaged finger kiki absolutely fascinated him he watched her continually but would not allow her near him as soon as she came near he flapped his hands at her as if she was a hen go off he cried clear away hes as muddled as kiki sometimes gets said jack with a grin kiki cant make him out now where did i put that book aunt allie did i pack that big book you did said aunt allie and i have unpacked it for the third time jack you are not going to take a score of books about birds two is more than enough so make your choice youre so hardhearted groaned jack well i suppose you will allow me to take my fieldglasses in fact if they dont go i shant go either you can carry those round your neck said mrs cunningham do try and remember that there will be seven of us in the car and all the luggage too we really must take the least luggage possible kiki bring that string back kiki jack if you dont stop kiki running off with absolutely everything i put down for a moment i shall go mad where is the cage suddenly demanded gustavus in a commanding voice put him in the cage shes a her not a him said jack and stop talking about cages no ordering about please gustavus apparently did not follow this but he resented jacks firm voice he sat up stiffly this bird ississwicket he said not good wicket i will not haf him wizzout a cage now jack now said mrs cunningham warningly as she saw jacks furious face hes not used to kiki yet or to our ways give him a chance to settle down dont take any notice of him gustavus the bird is not wicked she is good sit still and be quiet where is the cage repeated gustavus in a most maddening manner a beeg beeg cage for a wicket bird jack went over to him and spoke slowly and loudly with his face close to the surprised boys i have a beeg beeg cage he said most dramatically but i keep it for small silly boys i will bring it for you gus if you want a beeg beeg cage you shall have it for yourself you shall sit in it and be safe from that wicket wicket bird to jacks enormous surprise gustavus burst into tears all four children looked at him aghast how could a boy of eleven be so incredibly silly even lucyann was disgusted mrs cunningham hurried over to him hes tired out she said to the others its all strange to him here and hes never seen a parrot like kiki before nor have any of us come to that cheer up gustavus jack didnt mean what he said of course i jolly well did began jack kikis old cage is enormous and mrs cunningham firmly led the weeping gus from the room the others stared at one another in complete disgust well to think weve got to put up with that these hols began jack all i can say is that im going to take him firmly in handand he wont enjoy it one bit ill take him in hand too said dinah quite fiercely who does he think he islaying down the law about kiki and a cage oh jacki do wish youd got that old cage and brought it in id have loved to see gustavuss face poor old gussy said lucyann wouldnt he have howled poor gussy gussy said kiki at once fussygussy fussygussy everyone laughed youve hit it off again said philip to kiki fussythats exactly what well have to put up withfuss and grumbles and silliness all the time why dont foreigners bring up their kids properly fussygussy we shall get jolly tired of him fussygussy screamed kiki dancing to and fro to and fro on her big feet wipe your feet gussy dry your eye you mean said philip i hope gussys not going to burst into tears too often i think ill borrow one of mothers afternoonteacloths and take it with me to offer him every time he looks like bursting into tears mrs cunningham came back and overheard this i think youre being a bit unkind she said hes a silly little boy i admitbut it must be rather nerveracking for him to be plunged into the midst of a company like this when he doesnt speak the language properly and everyone laughs at him i think you should play fair and give him a chance all right mother said philip all the sameit isnt like bill to thrust someone like gussy on us at a moments notice just at the beginning of the hols well you see said his mother its like this bill was saddled with this youngsterand he knew you wouldnt like having him so he suggested to me that he should go off with him alone somewhere i couldnt bear that because a holiday without bill would be horridand so we thought it would be best if gustavus came with us all and we tried to put up with him its either that or going without both gussy and bill i see said philip well id rather put up with gussy than have no bill thats what i thought said his mother so dont make bill feel too bad about it will you hes quite likely to vanish with gussy for the rest of the holidays if you make too much fuss all the samei think you can quite safely make young gustavus toe the line that wont do him any harm at all he seems a spoilt little crybaby to me well soon show him exactly where he stands said jack but i really cant think how bill was soft enough to take him on wheres the crybaby now ive popped him into bed with a book said mrs cunningham theres such a lot of things to do this evening and i really felt i couldnt cope with sobs and tears and bickerings the very first day you were homeso i thought everyone would be happier if he was in bed how right you were said jack well now dear gussy is safely out of the way lets get on with things i suppose you dont want any help with the supper aunt allie i imagine thats a roundabout way of saying you are hungry again said aunt allie all rightthe girls can see to supper you boys come and help me finish packing the greatest number of things into the smallest possible bags im leaving behind practically everything belonging to gustavushes got the most ridiculous thingspyjamas made of real silk for instance and monograms on everything he must have gone through an awful lot of ragging at school then said philip pity they didnt have his hair cut hed make a lovely girl with all that long curly black hair couldnt we get his hair cut mother possibly said his mother lets not talk about him any more im tired of him already the packing was finished by suppertime mrs cunningham was determined not to take more than a change of clothes for everyone shirts jerseys blazers and macs once more she had to take jacks enormous book on birds from where he had hidden it yet again under some shirts in a suitcase she looked at him in exasperation he grinned back amiably oh sorry aunt allie you dont mean to say its got itself packed again im locking the cases now said aunt allie with determination really jack i sometimes feel you want a good spanking supper was a hilarious meal gustavus having a tray of food in bed listened rather enviously he was tired and glad to be in bedbut it did sound very jolly downstairs he didnt somehow feel that he had made a very good impression though that birdit was that wicket bird who had made things go wrong when he got kiki alone he would slap her hardbiff gustavus brought his hand down smartly as he pictured himself slapping kiki the tray jerked and his lemonade spilt over the traycloth therethat was thinking of kiki again he was so engrossed in trying to mop up the mess he had made that he didnt notice someone rather small sidling in at the door it was the parrot come to find out where gustavus was kikis sharp eyes had missed him at suppertime then where was he upstairs kiki went under the bed and explored the slippers and boxes there she pecked at one of the boxes trying to get off the lid she loved taking off lids gustavus heard the noise what was it he looked round the room peckpeckpeck the lid wouldnt come off whos there who iss it said gustavus in an anxious voice kiki debated what noise to make she had a grand store of noises of all kinds there was the screech of a railway train going through a tunnel nothat would bring mrs cunningham upstairs and she would be angry there was the lawnmowera most successful noise but also not very popular indoors and there was quite a variety of coughslittle short hacking coughsdeep hollow onesand sneezes what about a sneeze kiki gave one of her most realistic sneezes awoooooshoo it sounded very peculiar indeed coming from under the bed gussy was petrified a sneezeand such an enormous oneand under the bed who was under the bed someone lying in wait for him he began to tremble and the lemonade spilt again kiki began to cougha deep hollow cough mournful and slow gustavus moaned who was it coughing under his bed now he didnt dare to get out and see he was sure that whoever was there would catch hold of his ankles as soon as his feet appeared on the floor kiki next did a very fine growl and poor gussy shivered so much in fright that his tray nearly slid off the bed altogether he just clutched it in time but a plate fell off hit one of his shoes standing nearby and rolled slowly under the bed now it was kikis turn to be surprised she hopped out of the way and glared at the plate which flattened itself and lay still help help suddenly yelled gussy finding his voice at last someones under my bed help help bill was up in a trice striding over to gustavus what is it quick tell me under the bed said gussy weakly and bill bent down to look there was nobody there kiki had decided that the joke was over and was now safely inside the nearby wardrobe her head on one side listening you mustnt imagine things old chap bill was saying kindly theres nobody under the bedand never was nobody at all ill take your tray and you can settle down to sleep chapter off to little brockleton next day was bright and sunny with big piledup clouds racing over the april sky like puffs of cottonwool said dinah i hope its going to be like this all the hols im going to get the car said bill when i hoot i shall expect you all to be ready allie you can sit in front with me and lucyann must squeeze there too somehow the other four can go at the back luggage in the boot and if anyone wants to be dumped on the road and left to walk he or she has only got to behave badly and ill dump them with pleasure i really believe you would too bill said lucyann oh not a doubt of it said bill putting on such a grim face that poor gussy was really alarmed he made up his mind that he would behave superlatively well and he immediately put on his finest manners he opened doors for everyone he bowed he tried to take whatever mrs cunningham was carrying and carry it for her when he got into anyones way which he did almost every minute he sprang aside bowed and said excuse plizz i pollygize polly put the kettle on said kiki at once polly pollypollygize then she went off into an alarming cackle of laughter hows your finger gus asked jack politely it has stopped blidding said gus well i warn youdont try and play tricks with old kiki said jack or shell go for youmake you blid againmuch much blid ah wicket said gus i think that bird is not nice i bet kiki thinks the same of you said jack youre standing in my way youd better move unless you want this suitcase biffing you in the middle excuse plizz i pollygize said gussy hurriedly and skipped out of the way at last everything was ready mrs cunninghams charwoman came to see them off promising to lock up after them and come in every day to clean and dust bill was hooting loudly gussy was so terribly afraid of being left behind that he shot down the front path at top speed bill mrs cunningham and lucyann squeezed themselves into the long front seat the other four got into the back gussy shrank back when he saw that kiki was going with them apparently on jacks shoulder next to him kiki made a noise like a cork being pulled out of a bottlepop gussy jumped kiki cackled and then popped another cork pop pop goes the weasel gussy fussygussy gussyfussy pop what do you think youre doing gussy said jack seeing the boy slipping from the seat down to the floor excuse plizz i pollygize the kikibird he spits in my earhe goes pop explained gussy from his seat on the floor everyone roared dont be an ass gussy said jack come on up to the seat squeeze in at the other end if you like next to dinah but i warn youkiki will wander all over the car when shes tired of sitting on my shoulder blow your nose said kiki sternly looking down at the surprised gussy all ready behind called bill putting in the clutch he pressed down the accelerator the engine roared a little and the car moved off down the road heavy load weve got said bill what a family this car is going to grunt and groan up every hill it did though it was a powerful car and one that bill used in his work it swallowed up the miles easily and mrs cunningham was pleased to think they would arrive at their destination before dark what is the name of the place we are going to aunt allie asked lucyann oh yes i rememberlittle brockleton are we having a cottage or what yes said aunt allie its called quarry cottage because an old quarry is nearby its about a mile from the village and i believe only a farmhouse is near we can get eggs and butter and milk and bread from there which is lucky i shall ask about badgers as soon as i get there said philip from the back i wish i could get a young badger ive heard they make wonderful pets there i knew youd start hunting out pets of some kind said dinah we never can have a holiday without your bringing in mice or birds or insects or even worse creatures ive been thinking of studying spiders these hols said philip seriously amazing creatures spiders those great big ones with hairy legs are dinah shivered at once lets change the subject she said i dont know why but whenever anyone even mentions spiders i seem to feel one crawling down my back oh goshdont say my spiders escaped said philip at once and pretended to look through his pockets gussy watched him in alarm he didnt like spiders either dinah gave a small shriek dont be mean philipplease please you havent really got a big spider have you philip called his mother warningly youll be dumped in the road remember what bill said all right i havent got a spider said philip regretfully you can sit in safety di i say gus arent you uncomfortable down there on the floor among our feet i keep forgetting youre there i hope i havent wiped my feet on you yet that is not a nice thing to spik said gussy with dignity i will be angry to have your feets wiped on me lets play a game said jack seeing an argument developing well look out for black dogswhite catspiebald horsesred bicyclesand icecream vans the one who is last to reach a hundred must stop at the next icecream van and buy ices for us all this sounded exciting to gussy he scrambled up from the floor at once and squeezed himself beside dinah bill and mrs cunningham heaved a sigh of relief now there would be quite a bit of peaceeveryone would be looking out and counting hard gussy was not at all good at this game he missed any amount of black dogs and white cats and kept counting ordinary horses instead of piebald ones he looked very miserable when he was told that he couldnt put all the brown and white horses he had seen into his score hes going to cry said philip wait gus wait take my hanky and he pulled out one of the kitchen tablecloths which he had neatly purloined just before coming away in spite of his mothers threats gussy found the tablecloth pushed into his hands he looked at it in astonishmentand then he began to laugh ha ha ho ho this is cloth not hanky i will not weep in this i will laugh good for you gussy said jack giving him a pat on the back laugh away we like that it was quite a surprise to everyone to find that gussy could actually laugh at a joke against himself they began to think he might not be so bad after all he stopped playing the counting game after that but displayed even more surprising behaviour at the end of the game lucyann was last to reach a hundred she felt in her little purse for her money knowing that she must buy icecreams for everyone because she had lost the game please bill will you stop at the next icecream van she said so bill obligingly stopped but before lucyann could get out gussy had opened the door at the back shot out and raced to the icecream van seven plizz he said wait i lost not you shouted lucyann half indignant then she stared gussy had taken a wallet out of his pocketa wallet not a purse and from it he took a wad of pound notesgood gracious however many had he got he peeled off the top one and gave it to the icecream van who was as surprised as anyone else you come into a fortune mate asked the icecream man or is your dad a millionaire gussy didnt understand he took his change and put it into his pocket then he carried the icecreams back to the car and handed round one each beaming all over his face thanks gus said bill accepting his but look here old chapyou cant carry all that money about with you you know i can said gussy all the term i had it here in my pocket it is my pocketmoney i think they said i could have pocketmoney hm yes but a hundred pounds or so in notes is hardly pocketmoney began bill yes yesi know you kept it in your pocket but real pocketmoney isisoh you explain boys it proved to be very difficult to explain that all those pound notes were not pocketmoney merely because gussy kept them in his pocket you ought to have handed them in at your school said philip they said i could have pocketmoney said gussy obstinately my uncle gave it to me it is mine your people must be jolly rich said jack i bet even bill doesnt wander round with as many pound notes as that is gus a millionaire or something bill wellhis people are welloff said bill he slipped in the clutch again and the car slid off all the same hell have to hand over those notes to me hell be robbed sooner or later hes going to cry reported dinah philip quickwheres that tablecloth

not having any more icecreams in the car doesnt anyone want a nap it would be so nice for me to drive in peace and quietness wellnext stop lunch chapter quarry cottage little brockleton was a dear little village the car ran through it scattering hens and a line of quacking ducks bill stopped at a little postoffice must just send off a message he said wont be a minute then well go and call at the farmhouse to ask the way to quarry cottage and to pick up eggs and things and order milk he reappeared again after a moment the children knew that bill had to report where he was each day because urgent jobs might come his way at any momentsecret tasks that only he could do they went off to the farmhouse the farmers wife was delighted to see them now you come away in she said ive been expecting you this last halfhour and ive got tea for you you wont find anything ready at the cottage i know and a good tea will help you along thats very kind of you said mrs cunningham gratefully my goodnesswhat a spread it certainly was it wasnt an ordinary afternoon tea it was a hightea a fresh ham glistening pink a vealandham pie smothered in green parsley like the ham yellow butter in glass dishes a blue jug of thick yellow cream honey homemade strawberry jam hot scones a large fruitcake as black as a plum pudding inside egg sandwiches tea cocoa and creamy milk im absolutely determined to live on a farm when im grown up said jack looking approvingly at all the food on the big round table i never saw such food as farmhouses have i say isnt this smashing gussy felt glad that mrs cunningham had insisted that he should eat very little at lunchtime he felt sure he had an appetite three times bigger than anyone elses what will you have asked the farmers wife kindly seeing his hungry look i will have somesome pigmeat said gussy and some piemeat with it and i will have some cream with it and hes a little foreigner isnt he said the farmers wife with a laugh pigmeat does he mean ham and surely hell be sick if i pour cream over it all cut him a little ham if you will said mrs cunningham no pie he cant possibly eat both and of course not the cream i have ordered my meal said gustavus in a very haughty voice staring at the surprised farmers wife i will have what i say plizz he added as an afterthought shut up gus said bill youll do as youre told youre forgetting yourself i have not forgot myself said gus puzzled i have remembered myself and i want shut up said bill and gus shut up the others grinned it was nice to see bill squashing gussy gussy was very angry he glared at bill and seemed about to say something but bill looked across at him and he didnt say it bill winked at the others and they winked back fussygussy remarked kiki from jacks left shoulder dingdongbell gussys in the well pussys in the well not gussy corrected jack oh you pestyouve nabbed a strawberry out of the jam the farmers wife took kiki in her stride and was not unduly surprised at her nor annoyed my old aunt had a parrot once she said one like yours here she didnt talk as well as yours though is she alive asked jack thinking that it would be fun to put the two parrots together and see them eyeing one another what kind of conversation would they have is who alive my aunt or her parrot asked the farmers wife pouring out cups of creamy milk the parrots dead it was supposed to be over a hundred years old when it died my old aunt is still alive though there she is sitting by the fire over in that corner shes my greataunt really and shell be more than a hundred if she lives another ten years the five children stared in awe at the old woman in the corner she looked rather like a witch to them but her eyes were faded blue instead of green she smiled a dim smile at them and then bent her white head to her knitting again shes a real worry sometimes said the farmers wife she wanders round and falls about you know and the doctors off on a weeks holiday soon and what i shall do if old aunt naomi falls and hurts herself then i dont know theres no neighbours near but youand youre a good bit away you send a message to us if you want us at any time said mrs cunningham at once ill certainly come i am quite good at firstaid and nursing so dont worry about the doctor going send a message if you want us ah yesi could do that said the farmers wife thank you kindly nowwho wants a bit of that fruitcake its good though i shouldnt say it seeing that i made it myself if i eat any more i shant be able to move a step said bill at last will you kindly make up your minds to finish you kids well get along to quarry cottage and settle in did you manage to send a woman in to clean up the place for us mrs ellis oh yes said the farmers wife and she took eggs milk a pie some homemade cheese ham and butter and new bread for you oh yes and a side of bacon you wont do too badly down there come along to me when you want anything i hope you have a good restful holiday they left the cosy farmhouse reluctantly jack eyed gussy suspiciously as they got into the car you look a bit green he said sure youll be all right in the car hell be all right said mrs cunningham hurriedly its not very farhell be quite all right wishful thinking aunt allie said jack kikis very quiet kiki youve made a pig of yourself tooa little pig eating such a big tea kiki gave a big hiccup nobody ever knew if her hiccups were real or put on mrs cunningham always felt quite certain that they were put on kiki said jack severely manners manners pardon said kiki gussy stared at her in amazement it was surprising enough for a parrot to hiccup but even more surprising that she should apologize he quite forgot to feel sick because of his astonishment at kiki down a winding laneup a little hilldown another lane whose hedges were so high that the children felt they were in a green tunnel round a sharp bend and then there was quarry cottage standing a little way back from the lane it was a pretty place its garden full of primroses wallflowers and daffodils the people who owned it had gone to the south of france for a holiday and had been pleased to let it to bill the windows were rather small as they always are in old cottages the door was stout made of oak darkened by the years and was protected by a small porch thatched with straw like the sloping roof of the cottage a thatched cottagehow lovely said lucyann i dont know why but thatched houses always look as if they belong to fairytales not to real life its a dear little place they went up the path bill had the key and unlocked the door in they all went exclaiming over everything i need hardly remind you that this house and everything in it belongs to someone else said mrs cunningham so that well have to be extra carefulbut as you will probably be out of doors most of the day you wont have time to do much damage we shouldnt anyway said jack not with bill here ready to jump on us the cottage was just as pretty inside as out and very cosy and comfortable the three boys had a big attic the two girls had a small bedroom over the sittingroom and bill and his wife had a larger one next to it the larder was full of food mrs ellis the farmers wife had certainly remembered them generously mrs cunningham heaved a sigh of relief as she looked at the ham and bacon eggs and milk housekeeping was not going to be the nightmare she had expected you two girls unpack everything she said weve not brought much with us so it wont take you long arrange the boys things in the big chest in their roomtheres enough room for the clothes of all three there i cannot slip with others announced gustavus coming down the stairs into the hall where the girls and mrs cunningham were undoing the suitcases never have i slipt with others what are you talking about said dinah nobody wants you to slip why should you he means sleep said lucyann dont you gussy it is what i said said gussy i may not slip with others at school i slipt by myself here i will slip by myself also it iss the rule of my family well it isnt the rule here said dinah get off those shirts gus and dont be an ass there are only three bedrooms anyway whats the argument said bill coming in after putting the car into a shed and seeing gussys frowning face its gus said dinah piling her arms full of clothes hes just announced he wants to sleep by himself says its the rule of his family who does he think he is a prince gussy opened his mouth to reply and bill hurriedly interrupted what he was going to say gus youll sleep with the two boys here understand i slip alone said gus obstinately never have i theres a tiny little boxroom he could have said dinah suddenly a gleam in her eye i saw it just now when i was upstairs he could slip there im sure he wont mind the dozens of colossal spiders thereugh theyve all got hairy legs and i heard a mouseor it might have been a ratscuttling behind the cisternand gus looked horrified no i do not slip with spiders and mouses he said but still it is not right that i should slip with philip and jack and i will not slip with that wicket bird come in here a minute gus said bill and he took the boy firmly by the shoulder led him into the sittingroom and shut the door the two girls heard a murmur of voices and looked at one another in surprise mother whats all the fuss about said dinah puzzled why doesnt bill put that silly young gus in his place if hes going to be highandmighty all the time and give his orders and act in such an idiotic way were all going to hate him leave it to bill said her mother and then changed the subject take those things up dinahand lucyann put these things in my room will you now did i pack bills set of pipes or didnt i the girls went upstairs mothers as mysterious about gus as bill is said dinah crossly is there some mystery about him can he be a prince in disguise or something what a silly little boy like him said lucyann in disgust of course not chapter mostly about gussy it was fun settling in at quarry cottage mrs cunningham was pleased and happy she hadnt been looking forward to a holiday for seven people five of them children knowing that she would have to do everything for them and that perhaps the shopping would be difficult but it was easy the village was not too far away even for walking purposes the farmhouse was willing to supply a wonderful selection of good food mrs gump the tiny little charwoman came every day and was cheerful and hardworking she also liked children which was a great blessing she didnt like gussy though he orders me about that one she complained he even wanted me to go upstairs and fetch his handkerchief for him mam hes a little foreigner isnt he well im not going to be ordered about by foreigners specially not little nippers like that gussy was very difficult those first days he didnt like this and he didnt like that he complained if he was given a cracked plate he absolutely refused to make his bed though it was a rule in the house that everyone should make their own i do not make beds he announced in his haughtiest manner mrs gump shall make my bed mrs gump shall not said dinah firmly you go and make your ownand for goodness sake dont make such a fuss gussy fussygussy fussygussy chanted kiki in delight fussygussy fussy gus caught up a book and flung it at kiki the bird dodged easily sat on the back of a chair and cackled with laughter gus was just about to pick up another book when he found himself on his back on the floor dinah had put up with enough from gussy she had now lost her temper and was showing him how well she could do it she banged his head on the floor and he yelled the place down mrs cunningham came in at once dinah what are you thinking of get up at once go upstairs and stay there till i come to you he flung a book at kiki panted dinah rising up red and angry gussy still lay on the floor and the tears ran down his cheeks get up gussy said mrs cunningham im just as cross with you as i am with dinah go up to your room too and stay there you cannot order me said gussy with as much dignity as he could manage through his tears send this girl back home and that wicket bird go to your room said mrs cunningham in such a furious voice that gussy leapt to his feet tore up the stairs went into his room slammed the door and turned the key bill came in its gussy again said his wife hes such a little fathead i hope this is going to work out all right bill i think we should have thought of some other idea the others dont understand you see cant we tell them ill have a word with gussy again said bill if he doesnt come to heel ill take him away by myselfbut i thought it would be so much safer if he was here with all of us he went upstairs mrs cunningham also went up to dinah lucyann was with her arranging the clothes in the drawers dinah was very mutinous its all very well she said when her mother scolded her but why should gussy spoil everything for us hes always interfering always ordering us about always wanting the best of everything for himselfand fancy daring to try and hurt kiki i understand how you all feel said her mother so does bill but hes promised to keep an eye on gussy for the next few weeks and he must i think perhaps it would be best if he took gussy off somewhere and left us here by ourselves oh no said lucyann at once no aunt allie youve married him and he belongs to us now please dont let him do that dinah say something welli thought i could put up with gussy rather than have bill leave us said dinah butbutoh dear i cant promise not to go for gussy i dont think ill be able to stop myself and i cant possibly let bill go away either well stay here by yourself for an hour and make up your mind said her mother losing patience lucyann come downstairs with me nobody told jack or philip about gussy flinging a book at kiki kiki didnt forget though she plagued the life out of poor gussy he never knew when she was under the table ready to tweak his toes at the end of his sandals he never knew when she would hide in his bedroom and wait for him to come up then she would produce one of her extraordinary noises and send him downstairs in a panic at top speed well if bill didnt punish himand i dont think he didkikis doing it all right said dinah to lucyann anyway gussy is certainly better i wish he wasnt coming on the picnic with us today though a picnic had been arranged for everyone on sugarloaf hill it was really the name that had attracted the childrensugarloaf hill what a lovely name they set off together bill and the boys carrying the food in satchels on their backs gus had made a fuss of course he seemed to think that it was a great indignity to carry something on his back never haf i done this before he protested in my country it is thehow do you call itdonkeys who carry for us why do you not haf donkeys i will not be a donkey he was puzzled at the shouts of laughter that greeted this speech oh gusyoull be the death of me said jack do you mean to say you didnt know you were a donkey it is bad to call me that said gussy frowning in my country you would oh geeup donkey and stop braying said philip giving gussy a shove leave your satchel behind if you like no one will mind its got your lunch in but nobody elses were carrying the girls lunch and bills got mothers youve only got your own so chuck it into the bushes then you wont have to carry it like a donkey said dinah with a squeal of laughter go on gus but gus didnt he thought better of it and took the satchel of food on his back though he looked extremely sulky about it sugarloaf hill was just like its nameit was very like a sugarloaf coneshaped but flat at the top and was covered with primroses cowslips and dogviolets we ought to be able to see quite a good way from the top said jack as they toiled up it was a stiff pull up but at last they were at the top a strong breeze blew round them but the sun was hot so it was very pleasant to feel the wind blowing by i say gussy carried his lunch after all said jack pretending to be surprised my word im hungry they all were they ate every single thing they had brought and kiki had a good share too especially of the bananas she loved holding a banana in one foot and biting big pieces off it gussy sneezed kiki immediately sneezed too a much bigger sneeze than gussys then gussy sniffed a little habit he had which annoyed mrs cunningham very much kiki sniffed too stop it kiki said mrs cunningham one sniffer is quite enough pollys got a cold said kiki and sniffed again exactly like gussy gussy took no notice but after a minute he suddenly sniffed again blow your nose shouted kiki wheres your hanky gussys got a cold send for be quiet kiki said jack gussy dont keep sniffing if you do youll set kiki off and shell do nothing but sniff too i do not sniff said gussy that bird is wicket and too clever it should have a cage shut up gus said bill who was now leaning back enjoying a pipe remember what i said to you gus apparently remembered he subsided and lay back and closed his eyes the others sat and looked at the view it was marvellous for they could see a great way off thats the village over there said philip pointing and theres the farmhouse and you can just see the tops of the chimneys and a bit of one end of the thatched roof belonging to quarry cottage in those trees look and theres the road we came bythe main road said jack where are my fieldglasses pass them di gosh i can see miles with these i can see the way the main road twists and turns i can see the traffic on itlooking just as small as the toy cars we used to have philip have a look philip put the glasses to his eyes they really were magnificent ones he could see for miles just as jack had said yesits queer to see the cars and the lorries looking like toys going along those ribbony roads said philip nowtheres a black carrather like bills im going to watch it and see how far i can follow it the others lay back half asleep listening to philips voice the sun was hot now and they didnt feel inclined to go walking after such a big picnic yesits on the main road still said philip staring through the glasses there it goesa good speed too jolly good speed may be a police car perhaps you cant tell a police car so far away said jack bill looked up from his newspaper he knew a lot about police cars tell me its number and ill tell you if its a police car he said the boys laughed thats clever of you bill said jack but you know jolly well youre safewe cant possibly read the number at this distance still got the car philip lost it for a bit said philip its gone behind some buildingsno there it is again its come to crossroadsits gone across now its stopped gussy gave a little snore which kiki immediately copied philip went on with his car story a man got outi think he must have gone back to look at the signpost hes got into the car again yes they missed their way theyre backing ah i thought sotheyve turned down the other roadthe road that leads to our village youll tell us its at quarry cottage next said jack sleepily youre making all this up now i bet ive lost it again no here it comes said philip pleased yes its going through the villagedown into the lane its stopped again i think theyre asking the way from someonea labourer probably cant see from here on they go againand theyve turned up the farmroad theyre going to the farmhouse probably rich relations of mrs ellis bill put down his paper abruptly and reached out for the glasses he focused them on the farmhouse and saw the car immediatelya big one obviously expensive he studied it intently for a minute and then handed back the glasses without a word do you know the car bill asked jack curiously seeing bills expression no said bill i dont butit just makes me think a bit thats all sorry i cant tell you any more ill wander up to the farmhouse tonight and ask a few questionsthen ill know a bit more chapter a surprising announcement philip and jack were more interested in the car after bills remarks they took it in turns to keep an eye on it but it simply stayed where it was for twenty minutes and then went away taking the same route as it came its gone bill said philip i expect it was only some visitor i say look at gussy his mouth is wide open lets put something into it let sleeping donkeys lie said jack and dont put ideas into kikis head shell hunt around for something now to pop into gussys mouth philip looked round at everyone only bill and jack were awake besides himself he put his hand into his pocket and brought out somethingsomething small and brown and pretty it sat up on his hand i say youve got a dormouse what a pet said jack dont let dinah see itshell have a fit i got it on the way here said philip i saw it sitting on a branch and it let me pick it up it would said jack enviously youve got some magic about you philip ive never seen an animal yet that didnt come under your spell isnt he a pretty little fellow ive called him snoozy said philip stroking the tiny creature whose large black eyes shone like mirrors in his head dormice are very dozy snoozy things i must remember to buy some nuts from the grocers next time we go to the village snoozy will like those we wont tell dinah hell live comfortably in my pocket ive had dormice beforetheyre very tame how nice to keep putting your hand in your pocket and feeling a furry dormouse there said jack hallodo i hear voices the boys looked in the direction of the voices they saw two men obviously farmlabourers taking a path near the foot of the hill talking together i think ill just scoot down and ask them if they know anything about badgers here said philip coming jack the two boys ran down the hill the men heard them coming and looked round good afternoon panted jack do you mind if i ask you a question or two its about badgers badgerswhat may they be said the younger man eee manyou know badgers said the older man brocks they be oh the brocks said the younger fellow no i dont know nothing about them never seed one in my life thats acause you sleeps in your bed every night said the other man with a laugh brock he comes out at night i sees him many a time youre an old poacher you are jeb said the younger man out at nights when honest folk are asleep thats how you see the brocks maybe maybe said the older man with a twinkle in his bright eyes he turned to the boys what are you wanting to know about the brocks he said wellid like to watch them said philip at once im keen on wild creaturesall kinds ive not had much chance of seeing badgers though where can i see them around here were at quarry cottage ah so thats where you be said the old man then youll find old brock not far away from you little master you may see him in the woods on the east side of the cottagethats the most likely placeor you may see him down in the old quarry i saw a badgers sett therehis den you knowlast year i knew he had his hole down there by the big pile of earth hed taken out of it yesthats right he always does that said philip wishing he could get to know this old fellow he felt sure that he would be able to tell him many tales well thanks very much well watch in both places theres owls in the quarry too said the old man little owls and barnowls and tawnies they go there for the rats and mice ive heard themthe barnowlsscreeching their heads off frighten the life out of you they do i know said jack making up his mind at once that he would go and watch in the quarry he liked owls very much perhaps he could get a young one and tame it but hed have to be careful not to let it see snoozy the dormouse that would be the end of snoozy the boys walked off together exploring the coneshaped hill a shout from above attracted their attention jack philip were going back in a minute are you coming with us or do you want to follow sometime later well come now shouted jack and he and philip began to climb up towards the others they found gussy awake but scowling he spat something out of his mouth as they came up manners manners said jack reprovingly he says somebody popped bits of grass into his mouth said dinah with a giggle so he keeps on spitting them out did you put them in jack no said jack and philip didnt either there you are said dinah triumphantly turning to the sulky gussy nobody put anything in your mouth when you were asleep youre just making it all up i bet you chewed a bit of grass yourself i did not said gussy it was a wicket thing to do it nearly chocked me i was chocked choked you mean said lucyann well its a mystery nobody did itand yet you were nearly chocked with grass dont spit any more you cant have any left in your mouth now jack and philip threw a quick look at one another they knew quite well who had played this trick on poor gussy gussy saw the look and rounded on them you know who did it i saw you look all right we know who did it said jack a jolly good trick too we thought of doing it ourselves you looked so silly with your mouth wide open snoring i do not snore said gussy and tell me who did it come on said bill i expect it was old kiki shes done it beforeto me cant you see a joke gus gus suddenly exploded into his own language he stood there shaking his long hair back his face scarlet and a string of incomprehensible words coming from his mouth nobody understood a thing kiki was intensely interested with this string of what sounded like gibberish she sat herself on jacks shoulder near to the angry gus and listened intently when he stopped for breath she continued on her own gibberollydockeryblowykettlefussygussy she began and poured out strings of nonsense into which she wove many of the words she knew mixed up with ones she didnt everyone roared it sounded exactly as if kiki was talking to gus in his own language gus was silenced he stared at kiki amazed does she spik english now he demanded what does she spik shes spikking a lot of nonsense like you said jack be quiet kiki dont show off bill and mrs cunningham had already set off down the hill the girls followed giggling gus was annoying but he really did provide them with a lot of amusement gus followed them at last shaking back his long hair defiantly he spat now and again as if he still had grass in his mouth and kiki copied him with joy going off into cackles of laughter every now and again it was about halfpast five when they got back to quarry cottage if any of you want tea after that enormous lunch will you please get yourself a glass of milk and some biscuits said mrs cunningham or a bit of fruitcake if you feel real pangs of hunger all the five children apparently felt real pangs for they raided the larder and reduced the fruitcake to a mere fragment of itself they also drank all the milk much to mrs cunninghams dismay now weve none for your cocoa tonight or for breakfast tomorrow she said ill get some at the farm when i slip up this evening said bill it will be a good excuse to go up and ask a few questions any mystery on enquired dinah im never sure about you bill even in the middle of a holiday i always wonder if youve got a hushhush job on as well mystery or not bill always keeps his eyes open said philip its part of your job isnt it bill lets play a game said dinah where are the cards lets play racing demon do you play it gus i play it said gus i played it at school last term i am good with this game very good i go as fast as this he pretended to be putting cards down and was so vigorous that his hair fell over his eyes he pushed it back he was always doing that and it got on dinahs nerves your awful hair she said you ought to be a girl now dont start anything said jack a spark is enough to set him off talk about being touchy dont glare like that gus you make me shake at the knees poof said gus rudely poof said kiki at once poof poof poof thatll do said jack one poofer is quite enough in the family got the cards di oh good they were soon sitting in a ring on the floor playing racing demon kiki couldnt understand the game at all and wandered off into a corner because jack wouldnt let her pick up any of the cards poof they heard her say to herself quietly poof surprisingly enough gussy was good at racing demon he was very deft with his cards and very sharp to see which pile he could put them on he got very excited and panted loudly his hair fell over his eyes and he pushed it back jack calmly put a card on a pile that gus was just about to put one on and gus exclaimed in annoyance i was going to put mine therebut my hair fell over me why do you have hair like that then said dinah you look like a girl why dont you get it cut yes thats a good idea said philip putting a card down well go into the village tomorrow and see if theres a barber hell cut it nice and short for you gus youll get a crick in your neck tossing your hair about like that yes good idea well have it cut tomorrow said jack grinning at gus gus surprised them he flung down his cards stood up and went scarlet in the face short hair is for boys like you he said scornfully it is not for me never must i have my hair short in my country always it is the custom for such boys as me to wear their hair long such boys as you echoed jack what do you mean youve got a very high opinion of yourself my lad you may come from a rich family but you act like royalty and it wont do youre not a prince so dont try and act like one it only makes you ridiculous gus drew himself up to his last inch he threw back his hair once more i am a prince he said dramatically i am the prince aloysius gramondie racemolie torquinel of taurihessia chapter bill explains there was a dead silence after this dramatic announcement nobody said a word not even kiki they all stared in astonishment at gus not knowing whether to believe a word of what he had said then his lips began to shake and he tried to press them together firmly lucyann was sure he wanted to cry again i have broke my word suddenly wailed gus i am a prince and i have broke my word a voice came from behind them it was bills yes you have broken your word aloysius gramondie racemolie torquinel and your uncle told me you would never do that how am i to keep you safe if you break your word bill came forward his face stern everyone stared at him in alarm whatever was up billhes not really a prince is he said jack believe it or not he is said bill his uncle is the king of taurihessia well that explains his peculiar behaviour said dinah his ordering people aboutand his highandmighty airsand all his money and boasting and his long hair too said bill the princes in his country never have their hair cut short as ours do they wear it a certain length as you see its bad luck on him really because he gets teased still the boys at his school knew who he was and knew he couldnt help it and he didnt have too bad a time there was a pause while the four took a look at prince aloysius he shook back his hair and dinah groaned i wish you wouldnt do that gussy i cant call you allyallysomething or other youll have to go on being gussy oh he must said bill at once i gave him the name of gustavus barmilevo for a special reason thingsrather serious thingsare happening in his country at the moment and its essential that he should go under another name here what serious things are happening said jack revolts or something well ill tell you said bill his uncle is king and as he has no children gussy is the heir to the throne now there are certain people in taurihessia who dont like his uncle or the firm way in which he governs the country incidentally he governs it very well and our own government think him a very sound ruler i can guess whats coming said jack those who dont like the strong uncle think it would be a good thing to get a weak youngster wholl have to do what they tell him and put him on the throne then they can do as they like exactly said bill and so they are on the lookout for gussy here if they can get hold of him and put him on the throne he will have to do exactly what hes told his uncle will be imprisoned or killed and gussy knows all this does he asked philip he knows all right said bill everything was explained to him hes fond of his uncle he doesnt want to be used as a kind of pawn by his uncles enemiesand so he was put in my keeping and told to be merely a foreign schoolboy called gustavus and here he is i have broke my word to you said gussy sounding very doleful mr bill i ask you to pardon me well dont do it again thats all said bill nobody here is likely to give you away fortunatelywe are all your friendsor would like to be if only youd behave yourself a bit better i behave better at once immediately said gussy emphatically hm well well see said bill drily it would help considerably if you could try to behave like the others so that if any stranger comes hanging round hell think you are an ordinary schoolboy staying with friends at present i think youre behaving like a spoilt baby not like a prince at all in fact if i were a taurihessian citizen id be sorry to think id have you as a king when you grew up billis it the taurihessian government or ours that has asked you to have charge of gussy said dinah both said bill its important to both governments that there should be a sound strong ruler in taurihessia i cant tell you why at present i think its possible that all this will blow over in a few weeks and then gussy can go back to school in safety in the meantime weve got to make the best of all this yes i see everything now said dinah you should have told us at first bill wed have understood better i had orders not to say a word except to your mother said bill she had to be in on this of course i took this cottage because it was well hidden and nobody would guess that gussy would be here and i thought if you all came too he would be even better hiddenhidden in the midst of you one of many so to speak youre clever bill said lucyann slipping her hand in his well look after gussy we wont let him out of our sight gussy were your friends i thank you said gussy with a funny little bow it is an honour thats the way to talk said bill and gave him a clap on the back now then everyoneyouve got to forget all about aloysius gramondie and taurihessia got that yes bill said everyone they looked rather solemn it was queer to have serious and unusual problems suddenly presented to them candidly in the middle of a game of racing demon the ordinary and the extraordinary didnt really mix they turned with relief to their game again as bill went out of the room to find his wife and tell her what had happened look what kikis been doing while weve been talking said jack in exasperation mixing up all the cards put down the ones youre holding kiki shes been playing a quiet little game by herself said lucyann with a laugh and shes holding two cards in her foot exactly as if she was waiting for her turn to go put them down kiki one two three six eight four one said kiki getting her numbers muddled up as usual three four buckle my shoe one two buckle my shoe said lucyann your memorys going kiki kiki gave a hiccup as she often did when she thought she had made a mistake enough kiki said jack anyone want another game nobody really felt like one after all the revelations bill had made they didnt like to discuss them in front of gussy though they were longing to talk about them mrs cunningham put her head in at the door bills going up to the farm for milk anyone want to go with him not gussy he says ill go said lucyann scrambling up id like a walk you boys stay with aunt allie and look after her right said jack thinking it was just as well to do so with prospective kidnappers and revolutionaries about even although they might be as far away as taurihessia ill stay behind too said dinah ive got a blister on my foot so lucyann went off happily with bill she liked getting him alone he was always jolly and full of fun when they were all together but lucyann thought he was even nicer alone she slipped her hand through his arm and they walked off in the dusk together in case you want to say anything about gussy ill just warn you not to said bill in a low voice i dont want the slightest suspicions to get about that hes not all he seems it would be a very serious thing for him if he were forced to be king at his age i wont say anything said lucyann in a whisper lets talk about jack youre always ready to talk about jack arent you said bill amused well i must say that jack has got something id dearly like to have myself whats that kiki asked lucyann noa very nice little sister said bill its good to see a brother and sister so fond of one another well our mother and father died when we were very young said lucyann so we only had each other but now weve got you and aunt allie and weve got philip and dinah as well were lucky im lucky too said bill a nice readymade family for me hark at the owls hooting round what a collection of hoots that was the littleowl said lucyann who had been well trained in bird calls by jack that tvittvittvit noise and that lovely long quavering hoot is the tawnyowl and what in the world is that said bill suddenly startled by a loud screech near his head lucyann laughed the screechowlthe old barnowl she said he does that to frighten the mice and the rats well he scared me too said bill ahis that the farmhouse looming up it is you come in with me lucyann and dont be surprised at my conversation with mrs ellis they knocked at the door and went into the big cosy kitchen although it was a warm night there was a fire in the chimney corner and old aunt naomi sat there knitting huddled up in a shawl mrs ellis hurried to meet them well its good to see you and how are you getting on settled in nicely thats right now what can i do for you sit you down do they sat down lucyann found a rockingchair and began to rock to and fro a big tabby came and jumped into her lap settled down and went to sleep lucyann felt quite honoured mrs ellis brought her a piece of cake and she nibbled at it and listened lazily to bill he gave mrs ellis all the news first then he went on to talk about quarry cottage its a lovely peaceful spot he said i shouldnt think strangers ever come along here do they mrs ellis except people like ourselves who want to stay for a bit now its funny you should say that said mrs ellis because two strangers came to our farmhouse this very afternoonin a lovely black car rather like yours mr cunningham i suppose they lost their way said bill although he spoke in his ordinary voice lucyann knew that he had pricked up his ears at once no they hadnt lost their way said mrs ellis theyd been hunting round for a nice farmhouse to stay in for a few daysthe mans wife has been ill and simply longed to be in a quiet farmhouse with good food somebody told him of our farm and they came to inquire i see said bill anderdid you say you would take them mrs ellis i did said mrs ellis though my husband scolded me for it he says my kind heart runs away with me theyre coming tomorrow they said their name was jonesbut its my belief theyre foreigners foreigners said bill slowly yesi had an idea you were going to say that chapter an afternoon out lucyann stopped rocking the chair and her heart sank into her shoes foreigners did that mean they were from taurihessia or whatever the country wasand had they tracked down gussy oh dearsurely surely another adventure wasnt beginning this had seemed as if it would be such a nice peaceful holiday blow whispered lucyann to the cat on her knee blow gussy blow his uncle bill asked a few more cautious questions but mrs ellis had nothing else to tell him of any interest he got up took the milk she had brought him from the dairy and paid her he thanked her said good night and out he and lucyann went into the starry night i feari very much fearthat somebody is on gussys track said bill in a halfwhisper as they went along together now how could they have guessed he was with us its a pity hes so strikinglooking and so easily recognizable i suppose someone must have spotted him with me made enquiries about meand as soon as they knew who i was the rest would be easy hm i dont like it very much will you and gussy have to disappear from here whispered lucyann so softly that bill could hardly hear please dont go away bill ill have to discuss things with your aunt said bill dont say a word to gussy hell get the wind up properly if i know anything about him and on no account must any of you leave him alone anywherealways keep him in your midst yes bill said lucyann oh deari do wish those people werent going to the farm bill they might be ordinary people mightnt they they havent got to be enemies have they bill squeezed lucyanns hand no i may be wrong but i get hunches about these things lucyann and ive got a hunch this very minute you neednt worry i shant let anything happen wellso long as youre with us said lucyann but please dont go away bill i wont said bill not unless i take gussy with me which would really be the safest thing to do they reached quarry cottage and went in gussy and dinah had gone to bed aunt allie and the boys were still up reading bill put the milk in the larder and came back he sat down and told the three of them what mrs ellis had said mrs cunningham looked grave how did they know he was down here she wondered oh billwhat shall we do now shall we leave here at onceall of us no that would tell the enemy too much said bill i dont see that two peoplea man and a womancan do very much by themselvesi mean they cant fall on us and wrest gussy away from our midst as long as there are only the two of them we havent much to fearand mrs ellis will soon tell us if any more arrive one of the boys can go up each day for milk and get the latest news right well go on as we are then said his wife and lucyann heaved a sigh of relief youll tell gussy of course billput him on his guard hes got to be very sensible nowkeep with us all not wander awayand im afraid the boys must fasten their window at night blow said jack who hated a shut window at night kikis enough of a sentinel aunt allie she would screech the place down if anyone came id feel safer with your window shut said his aunt i think kiki would screech stilli dont want to run any risks gussy was told next morning and so was dinah philip was posted up by the farm to watch the new people arrive they came in the same black car that philip had seen through his fieldglasses the day before it was long and low and largeand very expensivelooking a daimler said philip i bet that can get along nowcan i spot what the visitors are like there were two one was a spruce tall lean man wearing a very wellcut suit an eyeglass in one eye and hair smoothly brushed back the other was a womanpretty young and with a very foreign voice the man spoke english well but he was obviously a foreigner too he handed the woman out very carefully indeed then she leaned on his arm as they walked up the path to the farmhouse door they went very slowly either shes been ill or shes pretending to be thought philip id better go back and tell billand gussy too he may recognize them from my description but gussy didnt he shook his head no i dont know them i wouldnt be surprised if they come along here sometime today said bill just to have a snoop round i feel sure they know im at this cottageand that gussy may be with you all on holiday bill was right that afternoon while jack was birdwatching near the house he heard the sound of voices he peeped through the bushes it must be the visitors from the farm the man had an eyeglass in his eye as philip had describedand the woman was walking slowly leaning on his arm jack sped indoors by the back way bill he called theyre coming wheres gussy he could peep at them as they go by and see if he knows them gussy ran to a front window and hid behind the curtain waiting but the couple from the farm didnt go by they turned in at the front gate and came right up to the cottage door a sharp sound came on the afternoon air ratatattatat mrs cunningham jumped she was having a rest on her bed bill opened her door and went in allie its the couple from the farm what nerve to come right to the house they obviously dont think that we suspect anything at all will you go down and open the door i shant appearand gussy mustnt either the others can of course bill went to tell gussy to keep out of the way and mrs cunningham ran down the stairs to the front door patting her hair tidy she opened it two people stood on the step a man and a woman the man raised his hat politely forgive this sudden visit he said but my wife and i were taking a short walk and she has begun to feel faint a cup of water would help her i thinkif you would be so kind ohdo come in said mrs cunningham hoping that gussy wouldnt come running down the stairs ill get some water she took them into the little sittingroom the woman sank down into a chair and closed her eyes my wife has been ill said the man i have brought her down to the farm for a few daysgood air and good food you knowbetter than any hotel but i should not have taken her so far on her first day im so sorry said mrs cunningham playing her part as best she could dinah where are you get a jug of water and a glass will you dear dinah sped to the kitchen and came back with a glass jug of icecold water and a glass on a little tray she put them down on the table and looked curiously at the couple they looked back at her and is this your daughter said the woman what a nice child have you any other children oh yes said mrs cunningham another of my own and two adopted ones fetch them dinah dinah went to fetch the others they came in politely lucyann philip and jack the woman screamed when she saw kiki on jacks shoulder a parrot dont let it come near me i beg of you wipe your feet ordered kiki shut the door grrrrrrrrr the woman gave an exclamation in a foreign language and said something to the man he laughed my wife says that people who come to visit you should have good manners or your parrot will soon teach them he said so these are your four children but have you not a fifth no said mrs cunningham only these four belong to me i thought mrs ellis said there was another little boy said the woman sipping the water mrs cunningham reached for a box of cigarettes and handed it to the woman hoping that she would not pursue the subject of the other little boy but the woman persisted perhaps you have a little boy staying with you she said sweetly smiling at mrs cunningham oh i expect mrs ellis means gussy said mrs cunningham little gussy is staying for a whiletill his family can take him home and may we not see the little gussy said the woman i love children do not leave this little gussy out anyone know where he is said mrs cunningham in a voice that made the four children quite certain that she didnt want them to know they didnt know anyway gussy was at that moment in the wardrobe upstairs where he had put himself straight away at the first sound of the knock on the door bill had thought he might as well stay there ive no idea where gus is said jack doing something on his own i expect do you know where he is philip no idea said philip messing about somewhere probably out in the woods ahhe likes to wander about does he said the man wellwe may see him when we go back to the farm thank you madam for being so kind to my wife may i please give your four nice children something to buy icecreams with and here is something for the little missing gussy also to the childrens surprise he put down five new tenshilling notes on the table in front of mrs cunningham she pushed them back at once quite horrified oh noplease i couldnt hear of it we only got you a glass of water no notake this back i couldnt possibly allow the children to have it the man looked surprised and rather uncomfortable he put the notes back in his pocket just as you please he said in my country it is only a courtesy to return a kindness what is your country sir asked jack at once aha he thought now well bring you out into the open the man hesitated and the woman gave him a quick glance my countryoh i come from italy he said a beautiful land come my dear we must go he took his wifes arm and led her to the door his eyes searching everywhere for the missing gussy he bowed to mrs cunningham and went down the path she called a sentence after him and he turned what do you say he said i didnt understand mrs cunningham repeated it he looked puzzled bowed again and went out of the gate he disappeared with his wife up the lane well hes not from italy said mrs cunningham i called out to him in italian to say that he was to give my best wishes to mrs ellisand he didnt understand a word chapter an urgent gall jack slipped out to make sure that the couple went back to the farm he came back to report that they had and bill held a conference at once gussy had been hauled with difficulty out of the wardrobe he had recognized the woman but not the man she is madame tatiosa he said the wife of the prime minister i hate her she is clever and sharp and cruel whatthat pretty young woman said mrs cunningham in astonishment yes said gussy nodding his head vigorously once she was a spy for our country my uncle told me a very clever spy and she married the prime minister and tells him what to do hm said bill and you didnt know the man gussy not that that matters youve recognized one of them and so we know for certain that theyre after you i almost think wed better clear out i really dont know what to do for the best i think id better take you and hand you over to the keepers in the tower of london youd at least be safe there but you said bill that if there were only two of them the man and the woman they couldnt very well do anything to gussy said jack why not let one of us keep watch each day to make sure no other car comes down to the farmor no other visitor i can easily go and spend the day at the farm and watchand philip can watch the next day i think perhaps youre right said bill puffing at his pipe anywaywell stay put for the next two days and wait for the enemy to make the next move theres no doubt that they think gussys the boy they want i expect mrs ellis has described him carefully to themand hes easily described yeslong hair for one thing grinned jack shall i nip along to the farm now bill and keep watch for the rest of the day i can go and ask for some butter or something and then hang round helping with a few jobs id like that anyway right you go said bill and jack sped off with kiki on his shoulder the others got up to go for a walk well away from the farm take your tea said mrs cunningham nobody will know where you are if you go off for a walk so nobody will be able to find you you should be quite safe gussy so gussy philip and the two girls went off with a picnic basket they walked for about two miles and then found a glade that was golden with polished celandines they sat down hot with their walk this is heavenly said lucyann i do love celandines they look as if someone polished them every single morning jolly good workman he must behe never misses a petal dinah gave a scream ohwhats that on your shoulder philip oh its a mouse philips dormouse had decided that the pocket he lived in was getting too hot for his liking so he had squeezed his way out run up philips vest and appeared through the opening of his collar there he was now sitting up on the boys shoulder oha dormouse cried lucyann in delight whats his name philip will he let me hold him his name is snoozy and it suits him said philip he felt in a pocket and brought out a nut he gave it to lucyann here take this offer it to him on the palm of your hand and hell run over to you lucyann balanced the nut on her palm and held it out to the tiny mouse being careful not to move too quickly the dormouse watched her hand coming close to philips shoulder and his whiskers quivered as his nose twitched he can smell the nut said philip keep quite still lucyann there he goes how do you like the feel of his tiny feet oh lovely said lucyann isnt he a dear philip i wish i had one too ill try and get you one said philip but dinah gave a squeal at once no she sleeps with me and im not having mice in the bedroom but this is a dormouse not a housemouse said lucyann it doesnt smell or anything its just perfectly sweet snoozy nibbled daintily at the nut a bit broke off and he took it into his front paws sitting up just like a squirrel he looked at lucyann out of his bright eyes hes got such big black eyes that they really are like mirrors she said i can see my own face very tiny in each of them can you said gussy in surprise and put his face close to lucyanns to look into the big eyes of the dormouse it fled at once disappearing down philips neck at top speed you idiot gussy said lucyann in disgust you would do a thing like that excuse pliss i pollygize said gussy i beg your pardon lucyann all right but i do hope snoozy will come back said lucyann rather cross he peeped out of philips neck once or twice but he wouldnt come right out hes not absolutely tame yet explained philip ive not had him long enough but he soon will be hell be coming out at mealtimes soon and nibbling his little nut on my breadplate not if i can help it said dinah dont be silly said philip you simply dont try to like dormice you someone coming said lucyann suddenly her sharp ears had caught the sound of voices get under that bush gussy ordered philip go on quick gussy vanished at once and the bush closed over him it was a pity it was a gorse bush but gussy didnt have time to think of prickles two men came by talking in the broad accent of the countryside one was the man who had told philip so much about badgers he waved to him itll be a good night for badgers tonight he called moonlightand thats what they like come out gus said philip when the men had passed false alarm gussy crawled out scratched on face hands and knees by the gorse prickles he was nearly in tears he blids said dinah unkindly gus you are blidding all over its nothing much said philip taking out his handkerchief and scrubbing the drops of blood away here and there everyone gets pricked by gorse sooner or later cheer up gus and for goodness sake dont be a baby i dont like blidding said poor gussy in a woebegone voice it makes me feel sick well be sick then said hardhearted dinah but dont make a fuss gussy made a valiant effort and swallowed hard he didnt cry after all what a victory after they had eaten every crumb of their tea they decided to go back philip wanted to have a look at the quarry on the way to see if he thought that badgers might really make that their haunt he wandered round the big deserted place examining the hedges round for signs of a badgers sett the girls and gussy ran the few hundred yards that lay between the quarry and the cottage lucyann thought they ought to in case any enemy was lying in wait any news she asked as they went indoors panting has jack come back from the farm yet he hadnt nobody had any news at all it seemed jack had none either when he came not a soul came to the farm he said and i didnt even see the man and the woman they must have been in their room all the time once i heard a tingas if somebody was using the telephone it might have been them cant tell said bill welli seem to have had a lazy day ive got some papers to read and then i suppose it will be suppertime theres going to be a fine moon tonight just right for badgers philip whispered to jack like to come out and see if we can find any rather said jack we can slip out when the others are in bed gussy always sleeps so soundly hell never hear suppertime came gold ham a salad junket and cream just the right kind of meal said philip why cant we have this kind of food at school dont lets start up the subject of school meals again philip said his mother youre yawning go to bed i think i will said philip coming jack jack remembered that they had planned an outing in the moonlight and he nodded they might as well get a little sleep first gussy went up with them the girls stayed down to finish their books and then went up too ill set my little alarm clock for eleven said philip to jack in a low voice not wanting gussy to hear ill put it under my pillow and it wont wake anyone but me gosh im sleepy in ten minutes all the five children were fast asleep downstairs bill and his wife sat listening to the radio well hear the ten oclock news and then go to bed said bill but just as the ten oclock news was about to come on there came a cautious tapping at the front door bill stiffened who was that he looked at his wife and she raised her eyebrows who could that be at this time of night bill went quietly to the door he didnt open it but spoke with his mouth close to the crack whos there oh sir mrs ellis has sent me down to beg you to come up to the farm said an anxious voice its her old aunt shes fallen down and broken her hip can you come mrs ellis is in such a way she sent me to ask you because the doctors away bill opened the door he saw a bent figure wrapped round in a shawl it must be alice the old woman who helped mrs ellis in the kitchen come in he said no sir ill be getting back said the old woman youll come wont you yes well come said bill he shut the door and went back to tell his wife its a message from mrs ellis about the old aunt apparently she has fallen and broken her hip he said will you go allie ill take you there of course and then i must leave you and come back here because of gussy but mr ellis will bring you back unless you stay for the night yes id better go at once said mrs cunningham poor mrs ellis just what she was afraid might happen she got her things on and bill and she went out of the door its not worth waking up the children and telling them he said theyre sound asleep anyway ill be back here in a few minutes time he shut the door quietly made sure he had the key with him to open it when he came back and then set off with his wife what a wonderful moonlight night really he would quite enjoy the walk chapter happenings in the night the moonlight streamed down over the countryside as bill and his wife set out what a lovely night said bill as light as day almost they went up the tiny lane hurrying as much as they could ill ask at the farm if mr ellis can bring you back bill said i wont stay even a minute im worried about gussy i may get a glimpse of madame tatiosa and her companionbut i dont particularly want them to see me they were passing a little copse of trees a patch of dense black shadow in the surrounding moonlight bill and his wife walked by not seeing a small movement in the shadows then things happened very quickly indeed four shadows came from the copse of trees running silently over the grass bill turned at a slight soundbut almost as he turned someone leapt on him and bore him to the ground mrs cunningham felt an arm round her and a hand pressed over her mouth she tried to scream but only a small sound came from her dont struggle said a voice and dont scream were not going to hurt you we just want you out of the way for a short time but bill did struggle of course he knew what these men were aftergussy he groaned in anger at himself this was a trick of course old aunt naomi hadnt had a fall there had been no real message from the farm it was all a ruse to get them out of the house so that it would be easy to kidnap gussy someone gagged his mouth by wrapping a cloth firmly round his face he could hardly breathe he wondered how his wife was getting on but he could see and hear nothing he stopped struggling when at last his arms were pinned behind him and tied together with rope there was nothing he could do it was four against two and as they had been taken by surprise they were at a great disadvantage perhaps he would be able to undo the rope that bound him when his captors had gone to get gussy he might still prevent the kidnapping mrs cunningham was scared and did her best to get away but one man was quite sufficient to hold her and bind her hands and feet she too was gagged so that she could not scream we are sorry about this said a mans voice quite politely it is important to us to take the little prince out of your hands his country needs him we shall not harm him in any wayand we have not harmed you either we have merely put you to some inconvenience once we have the prince one of us will come to untie you if it is possible if notwell you will be found by some farmlabourer early in the morning the men left bill and his wife against a haystack protected from the wind one of them had gone through bills pockets first and had taken out the key of the cottage bill listened as the men went off were they gone he rubbed his head against the ground trying to get off the cloth bound round his face was his wife all right he was furious with himself to walk into a trap as easily as all that the woman with the message must have been one of the gang of course no wonder she wouldnt come in he should have been suspicious about that an ordinary messenger would have waited for them and then walked to the farm in their company he remembered the ting of the telephone that jack said he had heard that afternoon that must have been madame tatiosa or her companion telephoning to their headquarters to say that they knew where the prince was and requesting help to capture him another car must have come down that evening with other members of the gang it all fitted in so wellbut poor bill saw the plot after it had been carried out instead of before he wondered what was happening at quarry cottage he believed the man who had said that he was not going to harm the little prince all they wanted to do was to depose his uncle and set gussy up in his place poor gussy he would be made to do all that the gang wanted and his life would be very miserable nothing was happening just then at quarry cottage all the five children were fast asleep and so was kiki the window of the boys bedroom was shut as bill had orderedbut of what use was that when the enemy had the key to the front door time crept onand eleven oclock came philips alarm clock went off under his pillow whirring in a muffled way that woke him up with a jump at first he didnt know what the noise was then he remembered eleven oclock he thought and slid his hand under his pillow to stop the alarm ringing he sat up moonlight poured into the room and made everything silvery just the night for badgers he padded across the room and shook jack wake up eleven oclock he whispered right into his ear he did not mean to wake gussy and have him clamouring to go with them but gussy was very sound asleep indeed the moonlight streamed on to his face and showed up the long lock of hair that had fallen as usual over his forehead kiki awoke as soon as the alarm went off but she was used to muffled alarm clocks and merely gave a little yawn and stretched her wings if the boys were going out she was quite ready nothing would persuade her to be left behind the two boys dressed quickly in shorts jerseys and rubbersoled shoes they took a last glance at gussy his mouth was wide open again jack grinned as he remembered the bits of grass that kiki had popped into it on sugarloaf hill they crept downstairs pausing outside bills bedroom door to make sure all was quiet and that bill and his wife were asleep cant hear a thing whispered jack they must be very sound asleep not even a snore from bill this wasnt very surprising of course as bill was at that moment struggling with his ropes as he lay in the shelter of the haystack well go out the back way whispered philip the front door creaks a little dont bump into anything in the hall for goodness sake kiki was on jacks shoulder as quiet as the dormouse in philips pocket she could always be depended on to keep silent when it was necessary she knew quite well that the boys were trying not to be heard she pecked jacks ear affectionately wondering what he was up to on this moonlight night the boys went out of the back door and then stood still debating which way to go i think ill come up to the little wood with you first said jack i might pop down to the quarry later to hear the owls there and see if i can watch them swooping on mice or rats so they went silently to the wood on the east side of the cottage making no noise in their rubbersoled shoes they kept to the shadows of the hedges afraid that someone might see them even in this deserted spot the moonlight was so very brilliant they came to the wood philip knew what type of place badgers would visit and he led jack to a hedge overshadowing a big bank this is the sort of place to wait about in he said lets squeeze into that bush there they crouched down in the black shadows an owl suddenly hooted nearby and kiki at once hooted back copying the long quavering hoot exactly and making jack jump shut up kiki he whispered fiercely youll bring all the owls down on us with your hooting gosh here comes the one you mimicked an owl swooped by his head and he ducked so did kiki kiki longed to hoot again she loved puzzling any other bird she kept silent halfsulky the boys listened with their sharp ears watching for any movement suddenly jack gave philip a nudge a long snakelike animal was hurrying by stoat whispered philip in jacks ear and whats this a hedgehog the hedgehog was curious about the black shadows sitting under the bush he came fearlessly up to investigate philip put out his hand slowly and the hedgehog sniffed it over jack quite expected to see him climb on to philips knee no creature was ever afraid of him but the hedgehog was hungry and he ran off to find the slugs he liked best the boys thought he went along as if he was a little clockwork animal they waited for the next nightcreature to appear and this time it was a badger it really was philip drew in his breath sharply he had hardly hoped to see one so soon it was a biggish creature with a curiously striped black and white face it stood absolutely still in the moonlight sniffing wondering if it could smell a dangersmella smell of humans but the wind blew from the badger to the boys and he could smell nothing he could hardly be seen as he stood in the full moonlight because the black and white stripes down his face were so exactly like the black and white shadows of this moonlit night perfect camouflage whispered philip and jack nodded then he nudged philip something else was coming young badgers thought philip in delight a family partyyes theres mother badger at the back what a bit of luck the young badgers were skittish little bearlike things they began to play about and the two boys watched their curious games quite fascinated the little badgers began to bounce they really did bounce on all four legs jumping up and down in the same place looking like fat furry balls they bounced at one another one knocked another over but in a flash he turned a somersault came up under the first badger and knocked him over this headoverheels game seemed a favourite one and the young badgers played it for some time then the parents gave a little call and went off into the wood the young ones stopped their game and followed jack gave a little laugh what an amusing sight ive never seen animals play that game before do all badgers turn headoverheels like that ive heard so said philip a keeper once told me that a grown badger will spring traps that wayhe just turns himself headoverheels on the trap sets it off and then takes the bait all he loses is a few hairs off his back an owl hooted again some way off it was a tawny owl calling then there was a screech from a barnowl kiki stirred on jacks shoulders she was longing to do a bit of hooting and screeching herself i think ill go back now said philip getting up id like to stay and watch for a few more creatures to come by but im afraid i shall fall asleep you coming jack welli rather think ill go and wander round that quarry a bit said jack id like to see what owls are thereand id like to give old kiki the chance of calling them to see if she really can bring them to her i know shes longing to try arent you kiki old bird kiki muttered something into his ear afraid of speaking out loud jack got up and stretched well you get to bed and ill come when im ready he said ill be about half an hour i expect dont be surprised if you hear thousands of hoots in a little while once kiki gets going philip went back to the cottage and jack made his way to the quarry little did they guess what a shock they were both going to get in the next ten minutes chapter capture philip made his way to the back door of the cottage but just as he was about to go in he stopped what noise was that it sounded like someone going to the front doorsomeone tiptoeing up the path surely the boy hesitated could it be someone after gussy hed better warn bill thengo in and wake him he tiptoed quietly through the back door into the hall and up the stairs he stopped at the top and looked back hearing a small sound the front door was opening quietly but with the little creak it always gave then a torch was flashed on and off very quickly yessomebody was getting in philip yelled at the top of his voice bill bill bill wake up bill theres someone getting in he was standing just outside the girls door as he yelled and they woke up at once graciouswho was shouting like that someones getting in quick bill quick shouted philip again wondering why there was no answering shout from bills room nearby the girls door opened and dinah looked out scared what is it who is it wheres bill keep where you are said a voice suddenly and a torch was flashed on to the three of them for lucyann had now appeared trembling philip pushed the girls violently and they almost fell into their bedroom then he rushed into bills room yelling again bill do wake up the moonlight showed him a completely empty beda bed not even slept in then where was bill and his motherwhere was she philip was astounded gussy was now awake up in the attic bedroom he sat up bewildered what was all this shouting he suddenly noticed that jack and philip were not in their beds and he leapt out of his afraid downstairs in bills bedroom philip was still yelling bill must be somewhere aboutbut where bill i say bill a torch flashed into the room and two figures loomed up by the door you wont find bill said a voice or his wife either weve got them and now we want the prince aloysius we do not intend to harm him in any waybut he must come with us his country needs him what have you done with my mother demanded philip fiercely ill get the police what do you think youre doing capturing people and coming after the prince you cant do that kind of thing in britain oh yes we can said the foreign voice smoothly and the man stepped into the moonlight philip saw that it was the man who had come with the woman that afternoon behind him were other peoplehow many philip wished that jack was with him one boy wasnt much against all these people he didnt count gussy as a boy one of the men behind called out something in a language that philip didnt understand and received a sharp order in return there was the sound of feet on the stairs leading up to the attic bedroom they were after gussy who had done quite the wrong thing and had appeared at the top in the bright moonlight he had been seen at once of course gussy fled into the bedroom slammed the door and locked it he leaned against it trembling then he ran to the window could he get out no gussy was no climber and although jack and philip would certainly have had a shot at clambering down the creeper gussy was afraid he might fall unlock this door cried a voice but gussy did not obey then two of the men flung themselves against it and it broke down easily they clambered over the broken panels and went to gussy he screamed one of the men bowed to him your highness we have not come to harm you we have come to take you back to taurihessia to be crowned king in the place of your uncle he is not liked your uncle the people want you instead its a lie shouted gussy trembling ive been told all about it my uncle is too strong a ruler for you and you want a boy instead who will do as he is told i will not come all this was said in his own language so that the girls listening fearfully in their room below did not understand a word philip pushed by the men at the door of bills room and ran up to gussy look here he said fiercely to the two men there you know that the british government and your own government wont let you make gussy king youll get into trouble with our government you know youll be clapped into prison either here or in your own country the men joined by the other two below had a quick conference philip didnt understand a word then the tall man with the eyeglass bowed slightly to philip you too will come with us he said and the other children as well you willerbe companions for our little princeand we do not think your government will be too angry when they know we hold you also oh so you think youll take us and make us a kind of hostage do you said philip quite beside himself with rage you think you can bargain with our government just because youll hold us prisoners my word you dont know the british people youll be sorry for this holding us to ransom i never heard such a fatheaded idea in my life you arent living in the middle ages you know the man heard him out to the end quite politely then he made a motion with his hand and two of the men pounced on philip and gussy and held them in such a vicelike grip that it was quite hopeless to get away run you two girls run yelled philip at the top of his voice hoping that dinah and lucyann would have the sense to rush into the woods and get away but although they did manage to tear downstairs they found a man in the hall and he was quite able to hold the two kicking yelling girls until yet another fellow came to his help sharp orders were given by the man with the eyeglass who seemed to be in command one man detached himself and went upstairs he came down with an assortment of clothes for the girls and gussy who was of course still in his beautiful silk pyjamas the girls were in pyjamas and dressinggowns but had no slippers on the man was sent back to fetch shoes wheres bill said lucyann with chattering teeth i want bill what have they done with him and wheres aunt allie dont be frightened said the man with the eyeglass patting her we shall treat you very kindly we shall not hurt you it will be nice for the little prince aloysius to have his friends with him you will have a fine time in taurihessia lucyann suddenly realized that jack was missing she looked round wildly for him wheres jack what have you done with jack ah yesthere was another boy i remember now said the chief man where is he out birdwatching said philip sullenly his only hope now was that jack would see and hear this disturbance and go to fetch help before they were all whisked away he had given up struggling what was the use he would only get hurt and he could see that if the girls were going to be captured he certainly must go with them to look after them as best he could birdwatching at this time of night said the man what strange habits you britishers have we will not wait for this boy jack we do not need him they opened the front door again and pushed the four children out in front of them holding their arms tightly it is of no use to scream said the chief still very politely there is no one to hear youand we should gag you if you did scream philipwhat shall we do asked dinah scarlet with rage at being captured like this nothing said philip justerhope for the best dinah guessed what he meant perhaps even at this very minute jack was bringing help lucyann stumbled along miserably in her dressinggown she had been allowed to put on her shoes and so had the others she was worried about bill and her aunt and very very worried about jack would she be taken off to taurihessia and have to leave jack for months and months where was jack jack was down in the quarry with kiki he had found plenty of owls hooting and screeching there for as the old farmhand had said it was a wonderful huntingplace for owls of all kinds kiki had been having the time of her life she had hooted and screeched and twitted and had brought a crowd of owls almost down to jacks shoulders one owl a barnowl had screeched deafeningly in his ear and had struck him with a wing jack decided that he was too easily seen where he stood he must get under a bush somewhere or else the next owl might scratch his face with a sharp talon or two he moved to the other side of the quarry and made his way to a big hedge there as he drew near the moonlight glinted on something under the hedge something that shone brightly jack stopped what could it be he went cautiously forward and saw that something dark and long and very big was under the tall hedge as close to it as possible the moonlight caught its polished surface here and there gosh its a car said jack in the greatest astonishment a car exactly like the one the couple have at the farmit must be the same one whats it doing here he went over to it it was empty nobody was in it at all the key had been taken out so that it could not be driven away has somebody parked it here to go and spy round quarry cottage wondered jack he went to the back of the car it had an enormous luggage boot jack opened it and peered inside it was empty except for an extra inner tube and a few tools kiki hooted again and an owl answered her be quiet now kiki said jack weve got to do a bit of spying well creep back to quarry cottage and see if theres anyone snooping round there but before he could do that he heard the sound of footsteps coming into the quarry and he dived into some bushes the footsteps made quite a lot of noise because there were eight people coming into the deserted quarry where the car had been parked jack peered out of his bush and saw to his great alarm that philip dinah lucyann and gussy were all being held very firmly indeed he stared bewildered unable to think what to do kiki suddenly screechedbut it was not an owlscreech it was a real parrot screechand philip recognized it at once it was kiki then jack must be somewhere in the quarry still he gave a shout theyre taking us away tell bill the man holding him gave him a shove you were told not to shout whats the use of shouting here theres no one to hear you but there was of course there was jack but what was jack to do chapter the extra passenger jack stared in distress at the four children being bundled into the carphilip and dinah at the back with three men and gussy and lucyann in front with the driver what a crowd if anyone saw the car going along with such a number of people in surely it would be noticed and stopped yes it would thought jack so that means they cant be going very farthey will arrive at their destination before daylight are they going to take them to some hidingplace fairly near then why in the world have they got philip and the girls as well as gussy everyone was now in the car the doors were shut as quietly as possible the engine was started upand just at that very moment jack had an idea he ran crouching to the back of the car he hadnt had time to shut the luggage boot properly when he had opened it to look inside could he get into it before the car drove off it was such a fine big one the car began to move very slowly out of the quarry bumping over rough places jack flung himself at the back of it and clambered up on to the luggage boot it swung right open and jack halffell into it kiki was astounded and flew off his shoulder at once jack stared at her anxiously he dared not call her back but as soon as she saw jack settled in the boot she flew down again and found his shoulder she talked solemnly into his ear in a very low voice trying to tell him in parrot language that she thought these goingson were extremely peculiar but that so long as jack approved of them she did tooand she was coming with him even in this dark smelly car boot jack felt comforted to have her he puzzled over everything where was bill and aunt allie how was it these fellows had been able to get into quarry cottage so easily and capture every one but what had they done with bill was he lying knocked out in the cottage ought jack to have gone to see instead of climbing into the boot the car had now gathered speed and was going down country lanes very fast it drew up once at some dark little house where a man came out there was another car there and one of the men in the first car thankfully got out and went to the second car this went on ahead as if guiding the other jack was glad he didnt want bright headlights behind him showing him sitting in the boot i ought to close the boot and shut myself in but suppose i cant get it open again he thought i simply must see what place theyre taking the others to if i can do that i can soon raise the alarm have the place surrounded and everyone rescued i hope no one sees me here another hours run in the smoothrunning powerful carthen it stopped there was a sharp exchange of words a light flashed and a gate creaked open hallo were here already wherever that may be thought jack had i better get out now while the car has stopped blowits too late theyre going on again the car bumped over a dark field and then suddenly a strange extraordinarily loud noise started up not far ahead jack jumped violently and kiki gave a loud screech which fortunately couldnt possibly be heard in the enormous noise going on an aeroplane said jack so thats what theyve planned theyre going off to taurihessia they must be and theyll hide gussy somewhere till their plans are all ready and the girls and philip with him nobody will know where they are he felt the car come to a stop with a bump he crawled out of the boot at once and ran to a big shape looming up nearby it was a lorry jack crouched beside it watching he saw an aeroplane not far off its propellers whirring it hadnt all its lights on yet but men were round it with lamps it was obviously soon going to take off what was this place a private airfield jack had no idea at all he watched all the passengers in the big black car tumbling out one after the other he thought he heard lucyann crying and his heart sank she would hate all this she wasnt tough like dinah where would she be tomorrow everyone was hurried towards the plane jack left his hidingplace and hurried too he had had another idea could he hide in the plane he had hidden in the car and noone had suspected it would there be any place to hide in the plane he thought of the planes he had flown in the luggagespace would be the only place there probably wouldnt be much there it was a risk but hed take it if he was discovered well at least hed be with the others but i mustnt be discovered he thought desperately if i am ill be hidden away somewhere tooand i simply must find out where the others are being taken so that i can somehow get word to bill kiki came to his help quite unexpectedly she didnt see why she shouldnt talk to the others whose voices she had recognized as soon as she heard them getting out of the car she left jacks shoulder and flew towards lucyann pop goes the weasel she cried god save the king send for the doctor the four children in front turned round in utter amazement kiki kiki how did you get here the men pushing them forward stopped at once they had no idea that kiki was only a parrot and had not even spotted her in the darkness they thought she must be someone coming after the children on the airfield someone quite unexpected who had followed them orders were shouted lamps flashed here and there kiki was frightened and flew back to jack wipe your feet she called much to the amazement of the men with the lamps jack ran round the other side of the lorry for the men were coming too near him then he saw his chance everyones attention was on the men who were searching the field with lamps nobody was watching the plane jack ran to it in the darkness stumbling as he went thank goodness the moon had conveniently gone behind a remarkably black cloud he felt a drop of rain perhaps the moon wouldnt come out till he was safely in the plane he reached the plane and thankfully saw the steps up to it he ran up and found himself in the plane no one was there he groped his way to the back where he hoped to find the luggagespace he felt something that was shaped like a crate yesthis must be where they put the luggage he felt round again and came across a box it had a lid and he lifted it up hoping that the box was empty it wasnt it was full of something soft that might be clothes or material of some kind it felt like silk jack pulled most of it out and stuffed it into a corner behind the big crate then he hurriedly got into the box and pulled the lid down only just in time kiki was with him of course silent and astonished jack had tapped her beak to tell her she must be absolutely quiet he heard the sound of voices and the noise of feet going up the steps into the plane he heard shouts and bangs and whirs the propellers which had stopped were started up again and the aeroplane shook violently the wheels bumped very slowly over the field and then the bumping stopped weve taken off thought jack thankfully and im here with the others though they dont know it now will my luck hold shall i get to wherever theyre going without being discovered i do hope so if only i can find out where they will be hidden things will be easy it was uncomfortable in the box but as jack had left some of the soft material at the bottom at least he had something soft to crouch on kiki didnt like it at all she grumbled in his ear and then suddenly produced a tremendous sneeze it sounded very loud indeed to jack he sat as quiet as a mouse waiting for someone to come and look round the luggagespace but nobody did the noise of the engines was too loud for kikis sneeze to be heard it was a real sneeze not a pretend one and kiki was just as surprised as jack was when it came the children in the front of the plane talked in low voices sure that the engines would drown what they were saying it seemed queer to be sitting in a plane dressed in nightclothesall but philip of course was that kiki we heard out on the field said lucyann it must have been im sure i heard pop goes the weasel i believe it was said philip i wouldnt be surprised if old jack hung on to that car somehow after all we know he was in that quarryhe probably saw what was happening and managed to hang on behind somewhere i wish he was with us now sighed lucyann i shant like being without him where are we going i wonder to some horrid old castleor perhaps a palace gussy have you got a palace yes said gussy but only a small one we shant go there because the people know me they would see me i have heard these men talking and they do not want me to be seen yet first they must deal with my uncle i hope they will not kill him he is nice my uncle i sincerely hope they wont do anything of the sort said philip youd have to be king then gussy how id hate to be a king always having to be on my best behaviour never to lose my temper or do a thing that was wrong or impolite having to be nice to people i hated and why isnt your father king asked dinah why are you the heir to the throne my father is dead said gussy there is only my mother and in our country women are not allowed to rule so one day i must be king i shall like it wellyou like ordering people about and showing off said dinah so i suppose itll suit you but i cant say youre my idea of a king oh deari wish this hadnt happened all our easter hols spoiled i hate all this said lucyann dismally im cold and now im sleepy cuddle up to me said dinah after all its the middle of the night so we ought to feel sleepy i do too lets go to sleep it will make the night seem shorter i could go to sleep at once if i didnt keep thinking of bill and aunt allie said lucyann shutting her eyes and getting close to dinah for warmth i keep on thinking aboutabouti keep on philip smiled at dinah over lucyanns head she was asleep already in spite of her thinking poor lucyannshe fell into adventures as readily as the others but she didnt enjoy them nearly so much jack fell into an uncomfortable sleep too in his box in the luggagespace kiki tucked her head under her wing and slept peacefully the plane went on and on in the night through a rainstorm and then out into clear weather again with a moon still bright in the sky none of the children saw that it was flying over the brilliant moonlit sea none of them gazed down to see the towns that looked like toy villages far below the engines droned on and on and the rhythm lulled the sleepers for mile upon mile and then the plane began to circle over a small airfield it had arrived philip woke in a hurry and shook the girls gussy woke too and looked down from the window taurihessia he said proudly my country taurihessia chapter jack is on his own the sun was up just above the horizon when the plane landed gently on the runway the sky was golden and in the distance small whitewashed houses gleamed brightly jack awoke when the engines stopped he lifted up the lid of his box slightly listening had they arrived then he heard gussys voice taurihessia so weve arrived thought jack nowwhat do i do next its daylightthough i should guess its only just sunrise the four children in front were hustled out the little airfield was completely deserted except for a few mechanics a large car stood waiting the children were pushed into it without a moments pause obviously they were to be hurried somewhere secret as fast as possible jack got out of the box and made his way cautiously to a window he saw the children just below getting into a big car the man with the eyeglass appeared to be in command and gave an order to the chauffeur as he got in the man was holding open the door and bowed he saluted too and repeated something after the man with the eyeglass borken then he got into the drivingseat and drove swiftly off the field to a large gate in the distance borken said jack to himself now would that be the name of a placeor just a hessian word for thank you or something welltheyve gone kiki you and i are on our own in a strange land whose language we dont know and we have only got a few english coins in our pocketso what do you suppose is the best thing to do send for the doctor said kiki putting up her crest and looking very wise send for the doctor put the kettle on jack went on looking out of the window it seemed to him that everyone had walked off to a little wooden building at one end of the airfieldto get refreshments perhaps jack felt that he would like some too he went cautiously into the other part of the plane not a soul was there in fact not a soul was to be seen anywhere even on the field or in the distance i think the time has come for us to go kiki said jack ready for a sprint i hardly think well get away without being noticedbut at any rate well have a good start if the men have to come from that wooden building right over there he went to the landingsteps and ran down them then he sprinted at top speed across the field to the entrance nothing happened for a minute or two and then two men appeared at the door of the distant building they shouted loudly and then began to run after jack but he had a wonderful start and the men gave up almost at once and returned to the building just a boy longing for a close look at an aeroplane they said to one another jack ran out of the entrance and found himself on a wide deserted road no one was in sight he could not even see any houses this must be a very lonely airfield he began to walk along the road kiki on his shoulder he was very hungry indeed by now why isnt anyone about he thought not a car to be seen so i cant get a lift i wonder where the others are by now wish i was with them he suddenly remembered that it was very early in the morning of course no one would be about yet the sun had only just risen possibly he might meet a workman or two soon he met a man cycling along the road after a while and held up his hand to stop him the man put one foot on the road and stopped his bicycle eglinoota he said at least that is what it sounded like to jack he looked astonished to see kiki im english said jack trying to speak slowly and clearly where is the police station eglinoota said the man again looking bewildered oota oota parpparp said kiki suddenly parpparp it sounded exactly like the hooter of a car jack laughed did you think the man kept saying hooter he asked kiki well he wasnt goodness knows what he was saying i wish i knew what food was in the hessian language powkepotoplink said the man trying again he pointed to the parrot powkepotoplink ai ai he suddenly took out a notebook and a pencil and began drawing something on a page jack wondered what it was the man tore out the page and gave it to him the drawing looked like a small map showing various roads there was something that looked like a pond also and something else that looked like a church spire at the bottom of the map the man had drawn what looked like a tent he jabbed at it with his pencil powkepototplink he said again very loudly as if that might help jack to understand plinkplonk plinkplonk said kiki at once and went off into a cackle of laughter the man looked at her in admiration he undid a bag and took out a small sugared cake he presented it to kiki who took it with her right foot making a sudden clucking noise like a hen jack looked at it with hungry eyes and the man noticed the look he delved in his bag again and brought out an enormously thick sandwich with some kind of bright red meat in it he presented this to jack who was thrilled thank you said the boy thank you very much cheepalikkle said the man incomprehensibly and rode off waving jack walked on munching the huge sandwich kiki put out her parrottongue and licked the cake she didnt like it and gave it to jack in return he gave her some of her favourite sunflower seeds of which he always kept a supply in his pocket she sat happily on his shoulder cracking them jack looked at the map what did it mean why had that man drawn it he must have thought there was some particular place jack wanted to go tobut jack himself didnt know of any place in taurihessia that he wanted to find except the place where the others had gone and that might be borken and it might not borken might mean anything in this peculiar hessian language he walked on and on for miles feeling much better for the sandwich he decided that he must look for a policestation if ever he came to the end of this wide deserted road it looked as if it had only been built to lead to the airfield except for the man on the bicycle he met nobody at all but at last he saw houses in the distance anne was coming to a villageno a town because as he came nearer he saw that it was far too big to be called a village if i could just find somebody who spoke english it would be such a help thought jack i could ask for a policestation then and get a telegramor cablesent to bill i wish hed come out here and help i wonder what happened to him i bet those fellows knocked him out he came into the town and looked around him with interest the shops were small and dark the houses were whitewashed or pinkwashed and seemed to run to curls and squiggles and much decorationrather fretworky jack decided curly roofs squiggly bits of woodwork here and there and windows whose sills were covered with decorated flowerboxes the people looked like peasants and were dressed in gay simple clothes no woman wore a hat but many wore shawls the men wore rather tight trousers and had some kind of sash round their waists their waistcoats were gaily embroidered and somehow they reminded jack of bullfighters though he didnt quite know why the children were very dirty and badly dressed even the little girls wore long rather raggedy skirts and the boys wore tight trousers like their fathers but had no gay waistcoats instead they had very dirty red blue or yellow shirts they soon saw jack and ran to him the parrot fascinated them powke powke they yelled pointing at kiki who was delighted at being the centre of attention she put up her crest and lowered it and even did a little hoppitty dance on jacks shoulder powkethat must mean parrot thought jack hey you kidswheres the policestation they didnt understand a word of course they followed jack talking together still entertained by kiki who was showing off tremendously then a small boy with a little wooden gun ran up he pointed it at jack and shouted poppoppop that was quite enough for kiki she stood up on her toes and shouted at the top of her voice pop pop bangbangbang pop goes the weasel powke powke powke there was an awed silence after this effort of kikis everyone stared still trotting after jack kiki went off into one of her idiotic bouts of laughter and the children all began to laugh too wipe your feet blow your nose shouted kiki and then made a noise like an express train in a tunnel this made a tremendous impression the children fell back a little startled but they soon caught up again yelling powke powke powke and soon the crowd was considerably bigger and jack began to feel like the pied piper of hamelin with so many children following him then a peculiarlooking person stopped him at a crossroads and addressed him quite sternly pointing to the crowd that had now gathered round him jack didnt understand a word i am english he said english you speak english yes no ha ingleeeeesh said the person and took out a black notebook which immediately told jack what he was of coursea hessian policeman you speak english said jack hopefully the policeman rattled off something at him and held out his hand he still had the notebook in the other one jack hadnt the faintest idea what he wanted he shook his head puzzled the policeman grew annoyed he slapped his hand with the notebook and shouted again jack shook his head once more kiki shouted back at the policeman pop goes the weasel put the kettle on pop all the children laughed there were a goodmany grownups around now watching one suddenly put his hand into his pocket and drew out a dirty doubledover card he showed it to jack and made him understand that that was what the policeman was asking him for jack saw that it was a kind of passport or identity card he hadnt got one on him of course so once more he shook his head kiki shook hers too and the children roared the policeman shut his notebook with a snap and put his hand on jacks shoulder he fired a sentence at him in sharp hessian and pushed him in front of him smartly now where do we go thought jack what a comic policemanblue trousers red shirt blue sash a comic kind of flowerpot helmetreally but he didnt think things were quite so comic when he saw where the policeman was taking him there was no doubt about it at all it was a policestation a small square whitewashed place soberlooking and severe with a good many more of the comic policemen standing about look here you cant put me into prison cried jack struggling away ive done nothing wrong you let me go chapter the map comes in useful jack was pushed firmly into a small square room with one bench in it against the wall he was made to sit down on this and the policeman went to report at a big untidy desk he spoke very quickly and it all sounded like a lot of double dutch to jack it did to kiki too and she sat on jacks shoulder and sent out such a stream of unending nonsense that every policeman in the place stared in admiration nobody was standing in jacks way to the door he looked at it he thought he would make a dash for freedom and try to get away from these comic policemen he was halfafraid he might be locked up for weeks perhaps they thought he was a beggar or a tramp perhaps it was a great crime not to have some kind of card to say who he was he saw his chance when nobody was looking at him and raced for the door he was down the steps and into the street before a policeman stirred he heard shouts behind him but he didnt look back down the dusty street he ran at top speed turned a corner ran down an alley and came to a big door he ran inside and looked round no one was there a squawk attracted his attention and made kiki look round in interest jack saw a parrot in a cage a very gay one with blue and green and yellow feathers kiki flew to the cage and stood on the top she bent her head down and looked inside excitedly another parrot howdoyoudo howdoyoudo said kiki good morning good night pop goes the weasel the other parrot gave another squawk it seemed rather scared then jack heard the sound of footsteps and before he could move a voice spokea gentle voice soft and kind a girl stood there aged about twelve she was beautifully dressed in gay silks and her long dark hair was woven in and out with bright ribbons she stared at jack in surprise eglinoota said the girl oota jack wished he knew what this oota word meant he really didnt know what to say he pointed to the parrots and smiled cheerfully powke powke he said the girl looked at the two parrots and laughed then to his delight she slowly spoke a few words in english whereyougo she said youenglishyes jack fished out the bit of paper the man on the bicycle had drawn him it would look as if he really was going somewhere if he showed her that she took it and nodded her head come she said and took him to the door listendo you know anyone who speaks english well asked jack eagerly the girl didnt understand though he repeated it several times then she heard a voice from somewhere in the house and she gave him a push pointing down an alley and then to the right jack thanked her called kiki and went out he ran down the alley and came to the end then he turned to the right and went quickly along a narrow dusty street with high walls each side he stopped at the end and looked at his map he supposed he might as well follow it obviously the bicyclist must have had some reason for drawing it it might lead somewhere useful in front of him was what would be in england a village green but this green was parched and dusty and three skinny hens wandered over it looking thoroughly miserable at the side was a big round pond in which dozens of small children were paddling jack looked at his map again ahthe pond yes i must be on the right road ill go down here and see if i can spot the thing that looks like a church tower he went on for some way without seeing anything like a church tower at last he stopped a kindlylooking old woman and showed her the map he pointed to the drawing that looked like a church she nodded her head at once she took his arm and pointed across a field there was a path there it led upwards towards a hill on the hill jack saw a building with a great tower he couldnt imagine what it was unless it was a taurihessian church he went on again over the field and up to the tower he looked at the map againit showed a winding road from the tower and this road led to the drawing on the map that looked rather like a tent jack looked up from the map and recognized the winding road going down the other side of the hill on which the tower stood but what could the tentlike drawing be an old man sat on a bench dozing jack went cautiously up to him and sat down the old man opened an eye saw the parrot and sat up at once good hes awake thought jack and pushed the map in front of him pointing to the tentlike drawing and trying to make the man understand that he wanted to get there ahhhh said the old fellow in a hoarse voice pikkatioratyforg ahhhhhh very helpful thought jack the old man got up and tottered a little way down the path then he pointed with his stick surkytalar he said surky surky repeated jack and looked where he was pointing then he stared hard he knew why the bicyclist had drawn the tent now in a big field were crowds of tents and vans it must be a circus of some kinda travelling circus of course surkyhe means circus thought jack its a circus thats why that fellow on the bike directed me there he thought i wanted the circusthought i was trying to make my way to it because id got a talking parrot well well well ive solved that puzzle he thanked the old man and thought he might as well make his way to the circus somebody there might possibly speak english circus people knew all kinds of languages anyway they were usually kindly folk they might give him a meal and help him a bit so jack suddenly feeling very hungry again went down the long winding road to the field where the circus was it took him about half an hour to reach it and when he got there he saw that it was packing up to move on the tents were being taken down horses were being put into some of the vans and there was a great deal of shouting and noise jack leaned over the gate a boy came by carrying a load of boxes that looked very heavy as he passed the pile toppled over and he dropped about four of them jack leapt over the gate and went to help the boy was about his own age swarthy and blackeyed he grinned at jack and said something he couldnt understand he said it again in another language still jack didnt understand merci beaucoup said the boy trying again this time in french ahjack understood that ce nest rien he answered the boy looked at kiki and rattled off something in french again asking jack if he was a circus boy and had come to ask for a job there jack answered as best he could for his french was not really very good i should like a job said jack in french better still i should like a meal come with me then said the boy again in french and jack followed him to a van a woman sat there peeling potatoes ma said the boy in english heres a hungry kid got anything for him jack stared at the boy in astonishment why he was speaking english hey said jack why didnt you speak english before im english my dads english said the boy grinning my mas spanish we dont mind what language we speak really weve picked them all up in our wanderings around ma give this boy something to eat do you think he can get a job with us where do you want to go he asked jack wellis there a place called borken anywhere about asked jack hopefully borken yes were on the way there said the boy and jack felt suddenly cheerful its a big town and outside theres the castle of borken on a hill jack drank all this in a castlewould that be where the others had been taken this was a bit of luck after all his setbacks he would certainly go with this travelling circus if they would have him ma gave him a meal it was very rich and rather greasy but jack enjoyed it because he was so hungry then ma said something commanding in spanish and the boy nodded got to take you to the boss he said and let him look you over got anyone to speak for you anyones name to give the boss will give you up to the police if youve run away from any kind of trouble no i dont know anyone here who will speak for me said jack anxiously i just want to get to borken ive got friends there oh wellmaybe theyll speak for you said the boy look my names pedro whats yours jack said jack he followed pedro to a big motor caravan pedro rapped on the door and a voice growled something from inside they went in and jack saw a vast enormously fat man sitting in a great chair he had startlingly blue eyes grey curly hair and a beard that fell to his waist he looked rather a terrifying kind of person you speak for me pedro said jack i shant be able to understand a word he says unless he speaks english i spik the english said the old man in his deep growling voice english boys are good boys where you come from wellnowhere particularly said jack wondering what to say erive just been wandering about since i came to this country but im hoping to meet my friends at borken the old man fired a question or two at pedro pedro turned to jack he wants to know if youve ever been in trouble with the police he asked this was awkward had he been in trouble with the hessian police well no not really jack considered so he shook his head he wants to know if youll make yourself useful here said pedro he can see you must be used to circuses because youre carrying a talking parrot around with you he says that if we stop here and there on the road to borken you can put your parrot on show if you like and earn a bit of money by making it talk he says make it talk now jack rubbed kikis soft neck talk kiki he said make a noise kiki was always ready to talk she raised her crest and began unexpectedly to sing at the top of her voice humptydumpty sat on a wall humptydumpty fell down the well dingdongdingdong pussys in the well fussygussy ha ha ha wipe your feet and shut the door oh you naughty boy poppoppop kiki ended with a loud sneeze and a hiccup which sent pedro into fits of laughter kiki cackled too and then went off into her expresstrain performance which drew people from all over the field at once ha she is goot fery fery goot said the old man laughing which made him appear as if an earthquake was shaking him yesyesyou may come with us boy i say your parrots a wonder isnt she said pedro as they walked back to his van would you like to sleep with me in my little vanlook the one behind mas therell be room for you if you dont mind a squash jack didnt mind at all he would soon be on the way to borken borken castle would he find the others there hed get bill over as soon as he could to rescue themif only they were there chapter with the circus jack liked pedro very much he was only a circus boy with rough manners and ways but he was sensitive enough to know that jack did not want to talk about himself or what he was doing in taurihessia wandering about with kiki so he asked him no questions and jack was very grateful he couldnt have told him the truth and he didnt want to tell him lies perhaps when they were in borken and he knew pedro better he would be able to tell him a littleperhaps even get his help the circus went on the road that evening the vans and lorries creaked out of the fields and went clattering down the highway it was a rough road and the vans swayed about dangerously some of them had caged animals inside and jack watched them anxiously what would happen if a van went overwould the animals escape there were bears in one van and two chimpanzees in another kiki was a source of enormous amusement to everyone in the camp many of the circusfolk could speak a broken englishenough to make themselves understood anyway they laughed at everything kiki said they brought her all kinds of titbits and when they found that she was fond of tinned pineapple they raided the shops they passed and bought tins of it jack asked pedro many questions how far was borken who owned the castle was it very old could anyone see over it pedro laughed borken castleand the whole of borkenand all the land we are passing throughis owned by the count paritolen he lives at the castle and as for letting anyone see over itmy word theyd be clapped into a dungeon before they even got through the door he sounds rather fierce said jack gloomily if the others had been taken to the counts castle they wouldnt have a very nice time with such a fierce captor hes a very strong and determined fellow said pedro he hates the king who is too strong for him hed like to make the young prince aloysius kingthen he could rule the country himself through the prince who would have to do as he was told i see said jack his heart sinking what could he hope to do against a man like count paritolen is this count the prime minister asked jack suddenly remembering what gussy had said no his brotherinlaw count hartius is prime minister said pedro theyre both alike in hating the kingbut count hartius is weak where his brotherinlaw is strong it is his wife who rules hima very clever woman so they saymadame tatiosa jack listened to all this intently he was beginning to have a clearer idea about things how strange to be suddenly plunged into the middle of all thisto know the little prince himselfto be so near the castle of borken and to be on the land of count paritolen who wanted to depose the king it sounded like a tale in a book a tale that had suddenly become real how do you know all this pedro he asked oh everyone in taurihessia knows it said pedro it may mean civil war you see and all the people fear that if the king is deposed and this young prince is put in his place the people will take sides and will be at one anothers throats in no timeand circus people like us will have to get out of the country as quick as we can so we keep our ears to the ground to find out what is going on jack was certain that he himself knew the latest news of all he was sure that as yet no one in taurihessia knew that prince aloysius had been kidnapped from england and was even now a prisoner in borken castle but what was going to happen next would the plot take one step further and news come out that the king had been killedor put into prison jack fell into deep thoughtso deep that he didnt even hear ma calling to him to come and eat the boy suddenly felt that he had become a very important person in this plotsomeone fortunately unknown to the plottersbut who might spoil the plot altogether if only he could manage to get into the castle penny for your thoughts said pedro and gave him a punch wake up you look very solemn anything on your mind jack shook himself and smiled kiki had flown off his shoulder to ma who was fishing up some peculiar titbits for her from a big black pot polly put the kettle on said kiki she cocked her head on one side and looked at ma bonnytageloota ma slapped her knees and laughed she loved kiki she pointed to kiki she spik hessian she called jack was astonished now how in the world did kiki manage to pick up the hessian language really she was a marvellous mimic what does bonnytageloota mean he asked top of the morning to you said pedro with a grin the circus stopped at a big village and set up camp for two days jack was busy then he had to give pedro a hand in all kinds of waysputting up tents pulling vans into place setting up the benches in rows running here and there for the boss whose name jack never could manage to pronounce the circusfolk approved of jack he was willing and quick and he had good manners which made him very popular with the women who had got used to rough ways from the menfolk jack liked most of the circus peoplethey were kindly and generous quicktempered and cheerfulbut they were dirty and slovenly too not always very honest and sometimes lazy they were good to jack and made him one of themselves at once they were a curious lot there was fank with his three bears one of the great draws of the show the bears were all large dark brown and were natural clowns they boxed they knocked each other over they lumbered round in a laughable dance and they adored fank their trainer dont you go too near them though pedro warned him theyre treacherous no one but fank can manage them badtempered bears arehave to be careful of them the two chimpanzees were amusing fellows they walked about handinhand with their owner a tiny woman called madame fifi she wasnt much taller than they were they really loved her jack liked them very much but soon found that they were dreadful pickpockets they slipped their furry hands into his pockets without his knowing and took his handkerchief a notebook and two pencils madame fifi gave them back to him with a laugh she poured out something in frenchor was it spanish or italian she spoke so quickly that jack couldnt even make out what language she was speaking she saw that jack didnt understand and produced a few words of english bad boys said madame fifi pointing a tiny finger at the chimpanzees feefo and fum smack smack smack there were toni and bingo the acrobats toni was a marvellous ropewalker and raised a perfect storm of cheers and shouts when he performed on a wire rope high up in the big circus tent he could do anything on itrun jump danceeven turn headoverheels jack was always afraid he would fall why doesnt he have a safetynet he asked pedro you know hed kill himself if he fell from that height ask him said pedro with a laugh so jack put the question to toni when the acrobat came across to talk to pedros mother toni was spanish but he understood english well though he did not speak it fluently pah saffteenet he said in scorn onnly in eengland iss a saffteenet put for me i do not fall i am toni the grrrrreat toni there was tops too a clown whose great speciality was stiltwalking it was absolutely amazing to see him stalk into the ring as tall as a giant he had big boots fitted on to the bottom of his stilts and to most of the children in the audience he seemed a true giant especially as he had a tremendous voice he had had a peculiar bicycle built for himself very talland he could ride this when still on stilts that brought the house down another thing that made everyone laugh till they cried was when someone in the ring wanted to talk to tops they brought in a long ladder and put it right up to his waistthen up the ladder somebody ran to talk to the clown at the top of it tops was a funny little man in himself always joking his big voice didnt fit his small body thats why he learnt stiltwalking pedro told jack to be tall enough for his voice thats what he always says anyway there was hola the swordswallower jack watched him shuddering hola could put a sword right down his throat up to the hilt he would put back his head and down would go the sword i can understand his being able to swallow short daggers or knives said jack wellnot swallow them exactly but stick them right down his throatbut pedro how can he swallow that long long sword of his its awful to see him it makes me feel quite sick pedro laughed ill take you to holas van when he is in a good temper he said he will show you how he does that and one evening jack had gone across to holas bright yellow van and had been introduced to hola himself a tall thin fellow with sad eyes pedro spoke to him in german and hola nodded and produced a small smile he beckoned jack into his van in a big stand were all sizes of knives daggers and swords jack pointed to a very long sword indeed hola took it up he put back his head and down went the sword down down down his throat right up to the hilt it wasnt possible how could a man do that up came the sword again and hola took it out of his mouth and smiled still with his sad expression he handed the sword to jack and then the boy understood how hola could do such an extraordinary thing the sword was collapsible it could be made to slide into itself so that it became only the length of a long dagger by a most ingenious mechanism worked by a knob in the handle hola could make the sword shorter and shorter as he swallowed it jack was most relieved he was allowed to press the little secret knob and see how the pointed end of the sword slid upwards into the main part making itself into a curious dagger the circusfolk were certainly interesting to live with jack couldnt help enjoying the strange happygolucky life although he worried continually about lucyann and the others and was impatient for the circus to go on to borken he was so afraid that he would be too late if the circus was too long on the way but i must stay with them he thought it is the best possible hidingplace for me the police would certainly get me sooner or later if i wandered off on my own but i wish the circus would get on a bit faster i simply must get to borken soon and do a bit of prowling round the castle on my own chapter borken at last kiki was a great success not only with the circusfolk but with the people who came to visit it the boss kept his word and allowed jack to show kiki pedro helped him to make a little stand with a gilded perch set on a pole kiki was thrilled i believe you think youre on a throne or something said jack grinning princess kiki the finest talking parrot in the world nowwhat about a song kiki was always ready to do anything if she could get claps and cheers and laughter she really surpassed herself and made fank the beartrainer quite jealous because she drew such a lot of people to her little sideshow she sang lustily and although she mixed up the rhymes and words she knew in a most ridiculous manner the taurihessian folk didnt know that they really thought she was singing a proper song then she would always answer them if they said anything to her though as they didnt speak english they had no idea what she was saying stillshe answered at once and usually went off into such a cackle of laughter afterwards that everyone roared too tikkopoolinwallyoo somebody would ask kiki shut the door fetch the doctor pollys got a cold kiki would answer at once even jack had to grin at her she enjoyed it all so much her noises were the biggest attraction of all her sneezes and coughs and her sudden hiccups made the village people hold their sides and laugh till the tears fell down their cheeks they were rather overawed by her expresstrainroaringthroughatunnel imitation and they didnt understand the lawnmower noise because they had never seen one but they really loved the way she clucked like a hen grunted like fanks bears and barked like a dog yeskiki was a great success jack felt that she was getting very spoilt by all this fussbut she did bring in money to him so that he could pay pedros mother for the food she gave him and for letting him share pedros little van the rest of the money he tied carefully up in his handkerchief thinking that it might come in very useful if he needed any in borken he kept his hand on it when feefo and fum the chimpanzees were anywhere about they would pick his pocket if they couldand he would lose all his savings we shall be in borken tomorrow pedro told him as they got orders to pack up that evening the boss has got a pitch theregood one too at the bottom of the castle hill jacks heart leaptah borken at last a whole week had already gone by and he had been getting very worried indeed now perhaps he could get some news of the others if only he could was lucyann all right she would so hate being a prisoner in a castle they arrived in borken the next evening jack first saw the castle from a long way off it stood on a hill and looked like something out of an old tale of king arthur and his knights it was immensely strong and had four sturdy towers one at each end borken castle said pedro seeing it suddenly as they came out of a thick wood through which a rough road ran he pointed to the great hill in that castle many a prisoner has been heldand never heard of again the dungeons are dont said jack fearfully dont tell me things like that pedro looked at him in surprise whats the matter not scared of a castle are you no said jack erwhereabouts were prisoners kept in a tower anywhere special dont know said pedro we might have a stroll round it sometimebut we wouldnt be allowed to go too near it you know the circus camp settled itself in a sloping field just at the bottom of the castle hill the townsfolk came streaming out to watch them set up camp evidently it was a great thing for them to have a travelling circus visiting borken children darted in and out shouting and laughing one small girl came running up to pedro calling out something excitedly he swung her up into his arms and she shrieked in delight pedro pedro allapinotolyoota pedro replied in the same language then he turned to jack grinning with pleasure my little cousin hela he said her father married my aunt he is a soldier in the hessian army he turned and asked the excited hela a few questions hela says her mother is with her father hereshe is working as a maid in the castle for madame tatiosa who is living at the castle now and hela lives in the castle too this was news grand news now perhaps he would hear something about lucyann and the others he stared at the small gay hela in excitement but waitwaithe mustnt give himself away he mustnt blurt out questions without thinking he frowned and tried to think what would be the best thing to ask pedrohas madame tatiosa any children he asked at last would sheerwould she like us to give a little show in the castle for them do you think madame tatiosa has no children said pedro i can tell you that if she had she would try to make one of them king she is a clever dangerous woman that one hela wanted to know what jack had asked she listened and then went right up to pedro and whispered something in his ear her eyes dancing then she put her ringer to her mouth as if telling him not to talk of what she had said silly child said pedro you have been dreaming what did she say said jack impatient to hear everything that hela said to think she lived in the castle whyshe might see the others every single day hela says that madame tatiosa must have adopted some children because sometimes when she goes with her mother to one of the towers she hears childrens voices said pedro laughing and she says that no one but madame tatiosa and count paritolen go right into that tower she says it is very mysterious but that no one must know because when she told her mother what she had heard her mother threatened her with a sound whipping for making up stories i see said jack does she know which tower this is could she show us from where we stand now you dont want to believe a word she says jack said pedro she is a babbler a storyteller our little hela ask her all the same said jack in such an insistent voice that pedro did what he asked hela gazed up at the great stone castle she pointed to the tower on the south side that one she said in a halfwhisper to pedro and jack understood although she used hessian words she put her finger on her lip again to make sure that jack and pedro understood that they mustnt give her away jack took her to buy some sweets he wished intensely that he could speak the language of the country but although he had picked up quite a few wordsthough apparently not so many as kiki hadit was impossible to hold any sensible kind of conversation with the scatterbrained hela she chattered away to him and he didnt understand a word he bought her the sweets and she flung her arms round him and hugged him then she ran off at top speed to show the sweets to her friends the camp was soon ready the circus was to open the following evening jack had been very busy indeed and was tired but he was determined quite determined that he was going to prowl round the foot of the great castle that night should he ask pedro to go with him noit might be awkward to have pedro there if he did manage to get into touch with philip and the others he would have to explain everything to pedro and he didnt quite know how the circusboy would take his news ma called out something to pedro as he and jack went to her van to get their evening meal pedro listened and looked grave whats up asked jack its fank the beartrainer said pedro hes feeling ill again the boss is very worried why asked jack it will only mean that the bears dont perform wont it anyway fank may be better by tomorrow its a great loss to the circus when a big attraction like fanks bears is taken off said pedro but theres worse to it than that no one can manage those bears but fank they get quite out of hand when hes illwont let their cage be cleaned outwont eatfight one another once they even broke down their cage and got out fank had to crawl out of his bed in his caravan and somehow get them back but it nearly killed him poor fank said jack well lets hope he is all right again by tomorrow i dont particularly want great bears like that breaking down their cage and wandering about the camp i must say fanks a wonder with themive watched him he teases them and plays with themand they fawn round him like dogs not many people can manage animals as fank can said pedro he had lions onceand two tigerstrained them all by himself then he suddenly said they didnt like performing and sold them to a zoo and yet they were the besttrained lions and tigers in the world and now hes got bears said jack he must love animals very much and they must love him there are other people like that pedro i know a boy who can do anything with animals too he was thinking of philip of course ever tried his hand with lions or tigers or bears asked pedro no i thought not i bet they wouldnt eat out of his hand cats and dogs and rats and mice and other creatures are easy to do what you like withbut not the big animalsthe bears and the great cats no i suppose not said jack thinking that philip had never had the chance to work his magic on great creatures like those welli hope fank will be better tomorrow i wouldnt like the job of cleaning out the bears cage i must say id be afraid of their claws in my back the whole time jack did not go to sleep as quickly as he usually did when he lay down on his mattress in pedros caravan he didnt mean to he was going to explore all round the foot of borken castle he had bought a torch in the town that day he didnt quite know what good he would do wandering round in the darkbut it was the only thing he could think of he had to do something he slid off the mattress as soon as he heard pedro breathing deeply he didnt want to wake him he went out of the van holding his clothes he put them on in the darkness and then with the surprised kiki on his shoulder he set off to the castle hill if only he could speak to the others if only he could make sure they were still all right chapter up to the castle jack went stealthily out of the camp all was quiet there was no lamp or candle alight in any of the vans the circusfolk were tired out with setting up camp again and had gone to bed early in readiness for their grand opening the next day it was a starry night with no moon so there was not much light it was not pitchdark however and jack did not need to use his torch once his eyes had got used to the darkness the stars gave a faint light just enough for him to avoid falling over anything he went up the slope of the hill where the camp was placed he came to a low castle wall he shone his torch here and there and found a place he thought he could climb where the stones were rough and uneven his rubber shoes helped him a good deal he wished he had rubber gloves on his hands too so that his fingers would not slip on the stones as he tried to grasp them he was over at last he looked round cautiously not daring to put on his torch he seemed to be in a small courtyard he strained his eyes he could make out the great bulk of the castle easily it rose up high towering about him solid and strong he despaired of ever getting insideor even of getting in touch with philip and the others he crept quietly over the courtyard stumbling now and again over an uneven stone he suddenly walked into something that scared him tremendously and made kiki give a frightened squawk something wrapped itself round his head what was it in a panic jack tore at it and ran forward but something flapped at him again and covered his whole face desperately jack switched his torch on and off for a moment to see what was attacking him when he saw what it was he gave a laugh of relief and felt very silly he had walked into a line of washing a sheet had attacked him that was alland the thing that had wrapped itself round his head was a jersey a jersey jack stopped a jerseysuch things were not worn in taurihessia he stepped back and flashed his torch on again yesit was either lucyanns or dinahs there was no doubt of it so they definitely were there good good good they were quite near him somewhere if only only he could get to them he stood and considered if the children were held in secret then it was strange that their clothes should be washed and hung out on a line people would see them and be surprised perhaps this courtyard was an enclosed spacea secret yard where nobody came except possibly madame tatiosa would she wash the clothes though she might if she didnt want anyone to know about the children perhaps helas mother was in the secret too perhaps she washed for the children cooked their meals and so on somebody would have to do that there must be a way into the castle from this little yardpossibly a backway into the kitchen or washhouses jack went towards the great walls of the castle and flashed his torch up and down he would have to risk being seen by someone he would never find out anything if he didnt use his torch now and again there was a small washhouse there as he had expected he tried the door it was locked he shone his torch in at the window and saw coppers and pails and washingbaskets yes that was where the washing was done what a pity the washerwoman had remembered to lock the door jack looked at the little washhouse it was built out from the castle wall he flashed his torch to the roof of the washhouseand then higher up he saw something that made his heart jump in excitement there was a window not far above the washhouse roofand as far as jack could see it had no glass in it at all it was a very old narrow window and might never have had any glass he thought now let me think carefully he said to himself if i could get up on that washhouse roofand then up to that windowid be inside the castle at once and could look for the others but how can i get up to the roof i really dont think i can climb it though it isnt very high he couldnt it was just too high for him to jump and catch hold of the guttering to pull himself up there was no pipe he could climb up either nothing at all a ladder thought jack desperately if only i could find a ladder he began to hunt round feeling rather hopeless kiki sat still on his shoulder puzzled she knew she must not make a sound but she longed to especially when a bat came swooping near her jack went carefully round the yard it wasnt very big he came to a small shed it was not locked only latched he opened the door carefully horrified at the squeak it made and flashed his torch inside wonder of wonders there was a ladder there jack could hardly believe his eyes he went over to it it was very old and some of its rungs were missingbut it might do it just might do anyway he would try it he pulled it out of the shed upsetting a can of some sort as he did so the noise echoed round the yard sounding extraordinarily loud jack halted holding his breath he quite expected to see lights flashing up in every window but none came everything was still and dark he heaved a sigh of relief perhaps nobody had heard the noise after allor perhaps nobody slept on that side of the castle he carried the ladder over to the washhouse it was not very heavy because it wasnt very long still it would be long enough he was sure he set it up against the washhouse it reached almost to the roof he flashed his torch at the rungs to make sure which were missing then he put his torch into his pocket and with kiki flying round his head in excitement he began to climb it certainly was a very old ladder one of the rungs he trod on almost gave way he hurriedly missed it and put his foot up to the next he was very thankful when at last he was at the top now to pull himself on to the roof he managed to get there with a scraped knee and sat panting now for the next stepto get to the window above in the castle wall itself the roof of the washhouse was flattish and jack was able to make his way on all fours he came to the wall he stood up cautiously feeling it with his hands and then used his torch again blow the windows just too high for me to pull myself up thought jack in deep disappointment i can reach the sill with my handsbut cant get enough hold to pull up my body he wondered if he could use the old ladder again he crawled back to it he put his hand down and felt the topmost rung then he pulled hard the ladder seemed a great deal heavier to pull up than it had been when he only carried it level he tugged and tugged it was difficult to get it over the edge of the roof but he managed it at last he had to sit and hold the ladder by him for a while because it had taken all his strength he felt very pleased now he could put the ladder up to the window and getting in would be childs play he managed to get the ladder to the castle wall though it was a very dangerous business and twice he nearly rolled off but at last he was by the wall and raised the ladder carefully it was difficult to find a safe place to put it at last he thought he had got it as safe as he could manage now to go up he hoped that the ladder wouldnt suddenly slip as he was climbing it that wouldnt be at all a pleasant tiling to happen he climbed up as quickly as he could his heart thumping would the ladder hold he got right to the top and was just clambering onto the windowsill when the ladder slipped beneath him it slid sideways fell on to the roof with an appalling noise and then crashed down into the courtyard now there would be people waking up and coming to see what the noise was jack pulled himself right through the window as he had thought it had no glass and probably never had had he jumped quietly down inside the window and crouched there waiting he waited for three or four minutes with kiki fondling his right ear not making a sound then he stood up and stretched himself he peered out of the window nonobody was about he could see no lantern or torch flashing could hear no voices this side of the castle must be uninhabited then or surely someone would have heard such a tremendous noise dare he flash his torch to see where he was he waited another minute and then hearing no sound flicked his torch on quickly and off again but he had seen enough in that second he was in a small room piled with chairs and benches set neatly on top of one anothernothing else was there at all just a storeroom for extra furniture thought jack come along kikiwe must remember weve got to find some other way of getting out of the castlewe cant get out the way we came in that ladder is certainly out of our reach he went to the door and looked out into what seemed a corridor not a sound was to be heard it was pitchdark here so he flashed his torch on again yesa long stone passage without even a carpetrunner on it no pictures about no chairs this certainly must be a part of the castle where nobody slept he went down the long corridor his rubber shoes making no sound he came to the end where there was a windowa round one with glass in it he turned the corner and saw another long corridor highceilinged a little wider than the other but still very bare halfway down the corridor changed from bareness to comfort a beautiful carpet ran down it almost touching the walls each side a big settee covered in a golden damask stood at one side great pictures hung on the walls this is where ive got to be careful thought jack theres even a lamp alight on that round table over therea dim one its truebut still enough for anyone to see me by he went on he passed an open door and looked cautiously inside the light from another lamp just outside showed him what looked like a grand drawingroom tapestries hung all round the walls mirrors hung there too a great carved table stood in the middle its polished surface gleaming softly in the light of jacks torch he went out into the passage again and considered what to do firstin which direction was the tower that hela had said the children were in he must go in that direction if he could puzzle it out he would have to find stairs too and climb them he decided to go on down the corridor he must come to stairs soon leading up into a tower he came to another door wide open he peeped inside how grand this castle was what magnificent furnishings it had this room must be a library it had books from floor to ceiling goodnesshad anyone ever read even a hundredth of them surely not a noise made jack flick out his torch and stand absolutely still it was a noise in the room he was standing inthe library it came from behind hima whirring groaning noise kiki gave a small squawk she was as startled as jack whatever was it chapter an adventure in the night whirrrrrr whirrrrrrrr dingdongdingdong dingdongdingdong dingdongdingdong dingdongdingdong dong dong dong dong dong dong dong dong dong dong dong dong jack sat down suddenly on a nearby chair his heart thumping it was only a clock chiming and striking but what a start it gave him midnightexactly midnight wellthe people in the castle ought to be asleep that was one thing to be glad of he got up and went back to the door he went down the corridor again and then facing him round the next turning he saw a great flight of stairsa marble stairway almost covered by a fine sweep of thick beautifully patterned carpet i suppose that leads down to the hall thought jack down to the entrance well that gives me a guidelet me seeif the front entrance is down therethen the tower i want should be a bit further on come on kikidown the corridor again and down the endless corridor went the two of them it was lighted by lamps and was too bright for jacks liking the doors he passed now were shut perhaps they were bedrooms he certainly wasnt going to look in and see he came to a sturdy oak door set in the inside wall he paused the tower ought to be about here would that door lead up to it it looked different from the other doors he had passed he tried the handle gently it was a thick ring of iron and as he turned it sideways the door opened jack pushed it wide stone steps led upwards lighted by a dim lamp he stood and debated with himself should he risk it and go up yeshe felt sure this was the way to the tower he tiptoed up and came to the top he looked round in surprise he was on another floor now and the layout here was different from the one below he was in what looked like a great hall draped with magnificent curtains a gallery overhung one end there was a small platform at the other end and on it stood musicstands the floor was highly polished and jack suddenly realised what the hall was its a ballroom he thought my wordwhat grand dances they must hold here but now i seem to have lost my way to the tower again perhaps theres another stair somewhere he went round the ballroom on the other side behind some curtains he came to a door he opened it and found that it led to a kind of antechamber opening off this was a stone staircasea spiral stair that wound upwards this is the tower staircase thought jack excited it must be hallowhats that he could hear the sound of nailed boots on stone quick as lightning he slid behind a nearby curtain the footsteps came nearer stamped turned and went back again how extraordinary jack put his head carefully round the curtain going down a stone passage opposite was a soldier gun on shoulder he must be on guardguarding the tower he disappeared down the passage his footsteps sounding farther and farther away till jack could hear them no longer then back he came again to the foot of the tower stairway stampstamp the sentry turned round once more and marched into the passage jack watched him again he was dressed in hessian uniform very gay and decorative jack had seen many of these soldiers while he had been with the circus perhaps this soldier was helas father he waited till the sound of footsteps had completely died away again then made a dart for the entrance to the spiral staircase he ran up it swiftly knowing that he had about half a minute before the return of the sentry round and round wound the stairway and at the top it grew so steep that jack could no longer run up the steps but had almost to climb he came to a little stone landing with a round window a chest stood beneath the window and an old chair stood beside it opposite jack was a big sturdy door made of dark oak and studded with great nails he looked at it was lucyann behind that door dare he call her name he tiptoed to the door he pushed it was fast shut he turned the great handle but still it would not open there was a keyhole there but no key he bent down to look through the keyhole but could see nothing he could hear nothing either jack wished he knew what to do for the best if he knocked on the door and called he might find that the children were not there after all but that somebody else was and the somebody might not be at all pleased to see him also the sentry downstairs might hear him and come rushing upand there was no way of escape up on this little landing and then he saw something in the light of his torchsomething very surprisingsomething that told him for certain that the children were inside that room on the other side of the oak door a tiny creature had slipped under the wide space at the bottom of the door and sat there looking up at jack with large black eyes philips dormouse whispered jack and knelt down slowly snoozy you are snoozy arent you youre philips dormouse then philip is in there the dormouse was very tame it had lived for some time with four children who adored it petted it and had never once frightened it even dinah had fallen under its spell and loved it though she would not let it run all about her as the others did and now here it was on jacks hand its whiskers twitching its big eyes watching him and kiki kiki looked at it in surprise but made no attempt to hurt it did you hear me outside the door whispered jack did you leave philip and come to see who the midnight visitor was how can i wake philip tell me an owl hooted somewhere outside the castle the dormouse leapt from jacks hand in fright and scuttled under the door the hoot of the owl gave jack an idea the sentry would take no notice of an owls hootbut if he jack gave a hoot just under the crack of the door it would certainly wake up philip it would sound far away to the sentry but very near to philip far far better than banging on the door which was a noise that might echo down the stairs and make the sentry come bounding up jack lay down on his tummy he put his face to the door and placed his hands together to blow through his thumbs and hoot like an owl this was the way to make a quavering hoot so like an owls that no one not even an owl could tell the difference hoooo hoohoohoohoo hooted jack and the noise went under the door and into the room beyond jack listened something creakedwas it a bed then a voice spokeand it was philips gussy did you hear that owl it might have been in the room but gussy apparently was asleep for he made no answer jack got up and put his mouth to the door trembling in his excitement philip philip there was an astonished exclamation then philips voice came amazed whos that whos calling me its mejack come to the door there was a pattering of feet the other side and then an excited breathing at the keyhole jack good gracious how did you get here jack how wonderful no time to tell you my story whispered jack are you all all right hows lucyann were all well and cheerful said philip we flew here i know said jack go onwhat happened and we were taken here by car said philip his mouth close to the keyhole and gussy was sick of course madame tatiosa who met us in the car was furious with him shes here in the castleand her brother too count paritolen we dont know whats happening at allhave you heard gussy keeps worrying about his uncle his uncle is still safely on his throne as far as i know said jack but i expect theyll have a bustup sooneveryones expecting it then gussy will find himself in the limelight jackcan you rescue us do you think asked philip hopefully how did you get here gosh ive been thinking you were miles away at quarry cottage and here you are outside the door of our room pity its locked yes if i only knew where the key was it would be easy whispered jack where does your window face east or north north said philip its just opposite a peculiar tower built all by itselfa belltower with a bell in it gussy says its an alarmtowerthe bell used to be rung when enemies were sighted in the old days our window is just opposite that now that we know youre here well keep looking out give my love to lucyann said jack is she in the same room as you nothe girls have another room said philip looklet me go and wake them theyd be so thrilled to speak to you all right said jack and then he stiffened footsteps footsteps at the bottom of the spiral stairway someone coming he whispered hurriedly goodbye ill try and come again and well make plans he stood up and listened yesthat sentry was coming up the stairway had he heard anything jack looked round desperately how could he possibly hide on this small landing it was impossible the chest he ran to it and flashed his torch on it he lifted the lid there was nothing inside except an old rug he stepped inside the chest kiki fluttered in too and jack shut down the lid only just in time a lantern flashed at the last turn of the stairs and the sentry came on to the landing he held up the lantern and looked round all was in order he clumped downstairs again his nailed boots making a great noise jacks heart slowed down and he heaved an enormous sigh he got out of the chest and listened philips voice at the keyhole again made him jump hes gone he always comes up every hour jacki never asked you have you got old kiki rather shes been with me all the time said jack longing to tell philip what a success kiki was at the circus but philip didnt know about that either of course he didnt even know how jack had got to taurihessia what a lot there would be to tell him and the others kiki began to whisper too blow your nose shut the door dingdongbell pollys got a cold god save the king philip chuckled its good to hear her again shall i get the girls now no said jack id better go while its safe goodbye philip he went very quietly down the spiral stairway he stood and listened where was the sentry he must have gone down the passage again on his regular beat jack slipped across the anteroom and into the great ballroom he stood there for a moment looking round the dimly lighted room and then something caught his eye and he jumped on the far side was a great pictureand as jack looked at it it moved it moved sideways across the wall and behind it appeared a black hole good gracious whatever was happening now chapter the way out a mans face suddenly appeared in the hole jack would not have been able to recognize it but for one thingthe man wore an eyeglass in one eye the count thought jack my wordwhats he doing popping up in secret places in the middle of the night the man jumped down to the floor a door at once opened near him and a woman came out jack recognized her too madame tatiosa the pretty woman who had pretended to be ill at quarry cottagethe wife of the prime minister this was evidently a secret meeting between her and her brother where had he come from why was he so excited the two of them spoke rapidly together and madame tatiosa seemed very pleased she kissed her brother on both cheeks and patted him on the back her plans seem to be going well whatever they are thought jack i bet its something to do with the king theyve probably arranged to capture him soon that means that gussy will be hauled out of that room and made to sit on the throne i dont like the look of count paritolen hes a nasty bit of workand its quite plain hes been up to something tonight the brother and sister still talking excitedly went into the room from which madame tatiosa had appeared the door shut jack heard the clink of glasses they were going to celebrate something perhaps things were obviously moving jack wished fervently that bill was there with him but bill probably didnt even guess that the five of them were in taurihessia he had no means of knowing that they had come over by plane he was probably hunting for them all over the place in england jack looked at the hole in the wall where did it lead to he felt impelled to go and look at it he could still hear clinking and talking in the room nearby he ran across to the hole clambered on a chair and looked inside he could see nothing so he felt for his torch then he saw the door of the room opening there was only one thing to dohe must tumble inside that hole and hope for the best so in went jack almost falling over himself in his hurry he found that there were steps there and he slid down them landing with a bump at the bottom he sat there and listened full of alarm but it seemed as if the count and his sister hadnt heard anything he heard their voices in the distance and then he heard something else he heard a slight scraping noise and the light that came into the hole where he was hiding was abruptly cut off goshthe pictures gone back into place im trapped said jack in alarm he went up the steps and felt about at the back of the picture the back was of stout wood and fitted tightly over the hole it wouldnt move even when he pushed it he didnt like to do anything violent in case the count heard him he put on his torch he looked down the steps and saw a passage at the bottom wellit must lead to somewhere it might even lead out of the castle the only thing to do was to try it and see so jack went down the steps again and into a narrow little passage he came to the conclusion that the passage must run just inside the walls of the room at a little below the level of the floor it went round at right angles quite suddenlythen there were more steps very steep indeed down them climbed jack thankful for his torch it was very musty in the passage he came to a place where there seemed to be a little light shining behind the lefthand wall what was it jack soon discovered it was a small hole made in the wooden panelling there and through it he could see into a dimlylit rooma room where people apparently met to discuss things for there was a round table with chairs pulled up to it and blottingpads and papers were set out neatly hma nice little spyhole thought jack wellon we go wherever does this lead to kiki kiki didnt knowshe only knew she was getting rather tired of this trip she clung to jacks shoulder and grumbled in his ear the passage went downwards again not by steps this time but in a steep slope jack found himself in a much narrower lower passage nowhe had to bend his head down two people would have found it difficult to pass one another kiki protested because the ceiling kept brushing the top of her head i wish i knew where this is all leading to kiki said jack i dont like it any more than you do halloheres a cellar or something the passage suddenly ended in a round cellarlike place full of old junk the entrance to this was only a round hole through which jack climbed glad he wasnt as fat as the old boss of the circus now where do we go from here he thought he flashed his torch all round nothing much to see but junk then he flashed his torch on the ceiling above his headit was only about two inches higher than he was a trapdoor surely thats a trapdoor if only i can open it thought jack he pushed hardand it opened it swung right back and landed flat with a tremendous crash it startled jack horribly and made kiki screech like a barnowl nobody came rushing up nobody shouted whos there jack waited a minute and then clambered out where was he now he began to feel he must be in a kind of nightmare where nothing really led anywhereonly just on and on steps passages holes cellars trapdoorswhat next again he shone his torch round he was in a very tall very narrow building of stone great ropes hung round him he turned his torch upwards and then he knew where he was the belltower the tower that is just opposite philips room that passage ive come down must be a secret way into the castle wellwhat a discovery he went to the doorway of the belltower there was no door there merely an archway the place was apparently built just to hold the great bell and nothing else and then jack discovered something that filled him with relief and joy the belltower was built outside the castle wall and not inside he could run down the slope of the hill to the circus with nothing to prevent himno walls to climbno windows to jump fromthere he was outside the castle walls and all thats a bit of luck thought the boy come on kiki were out now well go back and get a bit of sleep it wasnt long before jack was creeping into pedros caravan the floor creaked loudly but pedro did not awake jack stripped off his things thinking hard he felt pleased lucyann and the others were safe they had come to no harm they were safe as long as gussy wasnt kingthen they might be held as hostages if the british government sided with the present king and demanded that he be put back on the throne jack could quite well imagine that count paritolen and madame tatiosa would delight in threatening all kinds of dreadful things where the children were concerned if the british government made things too uncomfortable for them the thing to do is to rescue them quickly before gussys uncle is captured and gussys put on the throne thought jack i really must try and get in touch with bill but it will be difficult because probably the people in this part of the country are on the side of the countand if i try to get news through to bill ill be captured myself he fell asleep thinking of it all he had had a night of real adventure and he was tired out he didnt even wake when mr fanks bears created a great disturbance in the early morning and tried to break their cage down pedro told him about it at breakfasttime nobody dares to go near them he said they havent come to fighting each other yet but they will and then they wont be any use in the circus isnt mr fank better then asked jack no worse said pedro the boss is really worried pity that friend of yours you told me about isnt anywhere near here if hes as clever as you say he might be able to quieten the bears and manage them pedro was joking of coursebut jack sat up straight and began considering the matter at once he was sure that philip could manage the bears of course could he possibly tell pedro where philip wasand say that if pedro would help him to rescue the children philip would try to do his best for the bears whats the matter said pedro looking at him curiously you seem excited about something welli could get hold of my friend but only with help said jack heswell hes not really very far away really why didnt you tell me said pedro where is he jack hesitated could he trust pedro he asked him a question pedrotell me truthfullyare you on anybodys side in this business about the king and the prince aloysius i meanwhat do you think about it nothing said pedro promptly i dont care which of them is king let them get on with it the only thing i dont want is civil war herewed have to clear out of the country quickly then circuses and war dont go together why do you ask me that i might tell you later on said jack suddenly feeling that he had told pedro too much but ill just say thisif i could get my friend herewith his friends toowed prevent civil warfanks bears would soon be under control and what rubbish you talk said pedro looking astonished stop pulling my leg i dont believe a word of it jack said no more but as the day wore on and fank got no better and the bears behaviour got much worse he felt inclined to tell pedro a good deal more it would be really marvellous if he could get philip and the rest into the circuswhat a wonderful hidingplace for them all gussy would be too noticeable of course how could they disguise him of course with that long hair of his and those girlish eyelashes and big eyes he could be dressed as a girl thought jack what a brainwave i think i will tell pedro everything ill tell him after the show tonight the circus gave its first show at borken that evening it opened with the usual fanfare of trumpets and drums and the people of the town streamed up excitedly the bears of course were not on show but otherwise everything went well there was a good deal of grumbling from the townsfolk about the bears because they had been well advertised and some people demanded their money back we must get those bears going somehow grumbled the boss we must pull fank out of bed we must get somebody else in we must do this we must do that where is fank those bears will maul each other to death soon after supper jack spoke to pedro i want to tell you a lot of things he said i want to get your help pedro will you listen it is very importantvery important indeed i am listening said pedro looking startled tell me all you want to i will help you jacki promise you that chapter a daring plan where shall we go said jack in your van nobody can overhear us there can they they went inside the little van and shut the door pedro looked puzzledwhat was all this about jack began to tell him he told him about gussy staying with them at quarry cottage and how he turned out to be the prince pedros eyes almost fell out of his head at that he told him of the kidnapping and how he jack had stowed away first at the back of the car and then in the aeroplane in order to follow the others youre a wonder you are said pedro staring at jack in the greatest admiration youre jack wouldnt let him say any more he went on rapidly with his story and brought it right up to date telling pedro of his adventure of the night before i never heard anything like this in my life said pedro amazed why didnt you ask me to come with you you knew i would it was a dangerous thing you did all by yourself wellim used to adventures said jack i just had to find out about my sister anywayand the others too of course now pedrothis is where i want your help i must rescue the four of them before the king is kidnapped or killed and gussy is put on the throne you see if gussy is missing there wouldnt be much point in doing away with his uncle they must have gussy to put in his place because they want a kid there so that they can make him rule as they like count paritolen and his sister madame tatiosa and the prime minister will be in power then do you understand yes i understand said pedro but im not used to seeing history happening before my eyes like this i cant think its real somehow it is real said jack urgently very very real and pedro if we can get philip here in the circus he could manage those bears as easily as fank i tell you hes a wizard with animalsit doesnt matter what they are why once in an adventure we had a crowd of alsatian dogs chased uswe thought they were wolves actuallyand philip turned them all into his friends as soon as they came up to him pedro listened to all this with a solemn face he was much impressed he had guessed of course that there was something unusual about jackbut the story he had to tell was so extraordinary that he could hardly believe it all he did believe it though he was sure that jack would never lie about anything wellwhat do you want me to do he asked at last ill do anything of course but honestly jack i dont see how we can rescue your four friends from the towerroom of borken castlelocked in with a sentry at the foot of the stairs its impossible jack sat and frowned he was beginning to think it was impossible too plans had gone round and round in his head for hoursbut not one of them was any good he couldnt get in through that window over the washhouse again he was sure the ladder would have been discovered by now and taken away alsoeven if he did get in that way how could he let philip and the others out of that locked room he didnt even know where the key was and to go in the other way wouldnt be any good either he thought down that trapdoor and all through those passagesid only come up against the back of that big picture and ive no idea how to make it move away from its place and then again im no better off if i doi still dont know where the key to that towerroom is pedro sat and frowned too to think that he and jack could perhaps save the startingup of a horrible civil warand they couldnt think of even one sensible thing to do jack he said at last do you mind if we tell someone else about this my two best friends here are toni and bingo the acrobatsthey might be able to think of some plan its their job to think of good ideas jack looked doubtful would they give my secrets away though he said its important that nobody else should know what we knowonce the count suspected that anyone was trying to rescue the four prisoners he holds he would spirit them away somewhere else and probably hurry his plans on so that we couldnt possibly stop them you neednt worry about toni and bingo said pedro theyre the best pals i ever had and ready for anything this is the kind of job theyd jump atits right up their street ill go and fetch them now he went off across the field and jack sat and worried he wasnt happy about telling anyone else soon the van door opened and in came pedro with toni and bingo they didnt look in the least like acrobats in their ordinary clothes they were slim lithe young men with shocks of hair and cheerful faces what for you want us said toni the ropewalker in broken english it is trouble with the boss no said pedro look here jackshall i tell themi can speak to them in italian which they know best and itll be quicker right said jack wishing that he could use half a dozen languages as easily as this muchtravelled circus boy he didnt understand a word of what followed pedro spoke rapidly using his hands excitedly just as all the spaniards french and italian people did in the circus bingo and toni listened their eyes almost falling out of their heads what a story then they too began to chatter in excitement and jack could hardly contain himself in his impatience to find out what they were saying pedro turned to him at last grinning broadly i have told them everything he said and it pleases them they have an idea for rescuea surprising idea jackbut a very very good one what asked jack thrilled not too impossible a one i hope shall i tell him said pedro turning to toni i can tell him more quickly than you tell him said toni nodding his head well said pedro they got the idea when i told them how you escaped out of that trapdoor in the tall belltower i told them it was exactly opposite the window of the towerroomand they said it would be easy to throw a rope across from the top of the tower to the window yesbut i dont see what good that would be said jack puzzled i meanthe others couldnt get across ittheyd fall listen said pedro you have seen the trapeze swings that toni and bingo use in their acrobatic tricks havent you well those swings can be attached to the wire rope by pulleywheels and run to and fro would your friends agree to sit on a swing in turn and be pulled across hanging from the wire rope it would be easy good gracious said jack startled my word what an idea its not workable si si it is wukkable said toni excitedly we go up belltower we get rope across to your friendsi walk acrosseasy i pull swing behind me hanging on rope i place each boy or girl safe on swingand i run back on rope dragging swing by wireone two three four times and everyone is safe good idea no is it really possible said jack it sounds very dangerous ah no noit is simple this way said toni i do it all i toni bingo nodded his head he apparently agreed with toni that it was a good and perfectly possible idea it would certainly only have been thought of by wirewalkers or acrobats jack was sure and then zis boyhow you call himfeeliphe will take fanks bears and make them good said toni everybody plizzed everybody pleased agreed jack getting excited too after allthese acrobats were used to things of this kind it seemed nothing to themthough to ordinary people it appeared to be a very dangerous and quite impossible feat tonight we go said toni we will have all things ready we tell the bossno nonot yet said pedro considering and hot very much when we do tell him nothing about the prince or anything like thatonly just that weve got a friend of jacks to help with the bears ill have to think up some way of explaining the other threebut im not worrying about that yet toni and bingo went off to their van talking nineteen to the dozen this was evidently something they were going to enjoy very much jack could hardly keep still now he kept on and on thinking about tonis plan would it be all right would lucyann be too afraid to swing across on a trapezeperch and be caught at the other end of the rope by bingo what about gussy his hair would stand on end and yet what better way was there there wasnt any other way at all the circus opened as usual and again there were grumbles about the nonappearance of the bears fank tried to get up but it was no use he couldnt even stand the bears hearing the circus beginning and the shouts of the sideshows became restless and excited they had allowed no one in their cage that day not even to clean it and their food had been hurriedly poked between the bars they wouldnt even eat that it lay in their cage untouched they padded up and down the floor heads down grunting and growling all the time the show was over at last and the townsfolk went back to borgen chattering and laughing jack helped pedro to clear up the litter pick up the fallen benches and sweep the big circus ring thinking about tonight whispered pedro as he passed him i bet toni and bingo are i saw toni taking one of the trapeze swings out to shorten the rope so that he could use it tonight they had a late supper and then ma yawned bed she said and creaked up into her caravan the two boys went into theirs and sat waiting for the acrobats to come and say they were ready there came a tap at the door pedro opened it come said tonis voice and pedro and jack slipped like shadows out of their van the four of them made their way in the darkness up the slope of the hill above them towered the great castle its shadowy bulk looking sinister and mysterious they came to the belltower toni and bingo had already had a good look at it in the daylight in we go said pedro in a low voice he flashed on his torch as soon as they were safely inside the torch lighted up the strong wire rope that bingo carried and the trapeze swing that toni held they all looked up into the roof of the belltower how were they to get up by the great bell there are iron rungs up the wall said toni i go first follow me chapter escape it was not difficult to climb up the iron rungs toni was soon up in the roof of the tower kiki was first though she flew up from jacks shoulder and perched on the big bell making a slight clanging noise that startled her considerably the iron ladder went right above the bell which hung from a great beam above it was a stone platform with an opening in it at one side for the iron ladder to pass through toni climbed up to the bell and then through the opening above it and passed on to the stone platform jack came next and then pedro bingo was last there were arched openings like windows in the top of the tower opening off the stone platform one arch facing each waynorth south cast and west toni peered out of the arch that faced the window in the castle opposite he considered the distance carefully jack peered out too it seemed a long way to him in the darkness he shivered he didnt at all want to go on with this idea now that he was up so high and could see what a drop it was to the ground but toni and bingo treated it in a very casual matteroffact manner they talked to one another and discussed it very thoroughly and with great interest they apparently had no doubt at all but that they could do what they had planned toni said something to pedro and he repeated it to jack in english toni says he is ready he says how can we attract the attention of your friends in the room opposite they will have to help at the beginning if we flash a torch on and offor perhaps hoot like an owlphilip will come said jack we try the owl said toni and jack put his cupped hands to his mouth and blew vigorously between his two thumbs hooo hoohoohoohoo came quaveringly on the night air jack hooted again they waited their eyes on the shadowy window opposite then from the window a light flashed on and off philips there said jack joyfully and flashed his own torch philip he called in a low voice can you hear me yes where are you not over there surely said philip in an amazed voice tell him toni is coming over on a rope said pedro but weve got to get the rope across firstso will he look out for a stone tied on to a bit of stringand pull on it so that a thicker rope can come across i know a better way than that said jack suddenly excited let kiki take the rope acrossnot the thick heavy wire one of coursebut the first ropethe one thats fixed to the wire she can take it in her beak ahthat is good said toni understanding and approving at once it will save time philipkikis coming across with a rope called jack cautiously look out for her take the rope and pull hard it will bring across a wire rope can you find something to loop it to it has a strong ring at the endsee that it is made fast right but how will i say i dont understand said philip bewildered call kiki said jack kiki had now been given the end of the rope in her beak she was pulling at it with interest take it to philip said jack kiki called philip kiki kiki flew straight across to him carrying the end of the rope in her strong beak she knew she had to take it to philip of course but she had no idea that behind her came a whole length paid out quickly by toni she landed on philips shoulder and let go the rope to fondle his ear philip just caught it in time he wasted no time but pulled on it hard more and more rope came inand then joined to the ordinary rope came the strong wire rope heavy but flexible philip hauled on that too until a tug warned him to stop now he had to fasten it securely to something but what he had a lamp in his room and he lighted it to see better he kept it turned low and held it up to see where he could fasten the ring that was on the end of the wire rope his bed had strong iron feet philip dragged the bed to the window waking gussy up with a jump as he did so and then slipped the iron ring under one foot pulling it up about twelve inches now it should be held fast the bed was by the window the iron foot against the stone wall neither bed nor foot could move the rope should be safe for anyone to use what is it whats happening said gussy sitting up in bed in surprise unable to see much in the dim light of the lamp be quiet said philip who was now almost too excited to speak jacks out there go and wake the girlsbut for goodness sake dont make a noise over in the belltower toni pulled on his end of the wire rope he pulled as hard as he could and bingo pulled with him was the other end quite fastsafe enough for toni to walk across on it he had to be quite certain of that before he tried to walk the rope its fast enough said bingo in his own language it will hold you toni wasted no time he got out of the stone archway and stood upright on the narrow sill bingo held a torch to light up the wire stretching in front from the belltower to the window away opposite toni tested the wire with his footand then jack gasped in astonishment toni had run straight across the wire at top speed there were his legs and feet clearly lighted in the beam of the torch running easily over the taut wire toni reached the opposite window and stood on the sill for a moment then he bent his head and climbed in finding the bed just below the sill philip gripped hold of him looking white i say what a thing to do you might have fallen the girls were now in the boys room having been awakened by gussie kiki was with them making a great fuss of them both whos this said lucyann startled to see toni jumping down to the bed philipwhats happening no time to talk yet said philip who wasnt really sure himself what was happening were being rescued thats all toni was now busy pulling on a rope that he had brought across with him he was hauling steadily on itand along the wire hanging neatly down from it came a small trapeze swingthe one that toni used each night when he swung high up in the circus tent doing his tricks it clicked against the stone wall toni turned to philip you sit there he said pointing to the swing below the rope sit still see and i will pull you over to jack philip was startled he looked at the trapeze swinging below the wire rope running along it on a pulleywheel so that was the idea they were each in turn to sit on that peculiar swing and be pulled across to the belltower well hurry said toni impatiently you first yes said philip thinking perhaps that if the others saw him going across quite easily they wouldnt be afraid he turned to gussy and the startled girls ill go first and you watch me he said then lucyannthen you gussyand you last dinah he stood on the bed and then swung himself up on the stone windowsill he held on to the rope outside and suddenly felt tonis strong hands under his armpits it really wasnt very difficult to sit on the trapeze i come said toni to the anxious watchers opposite and he ran over the wire once more pulling the trapeze back to the belltower philip arrived there on the swing almost before he knew it he was pulled off and dragged into the tower in safety jack found his hand and shook it hard he found that he suddenly couldnt say a word neither could philip toni ran across again pulling back the trapeze lucyann was scared almost stiff with fright but she was brave and managed to get on to the swing quite well with tonis help away she went giving a little gasp as she thought of the great distance to the ground below her back came toni with the swing and gussy was pushed forward to get on it he was so frightened that toni began to wonder whether he would fall off in the middle of his trip across the wire but gussy held on grimly his teeth chatteringand almost burst into tears of relief when he got safely to the belltower dinah was no trouble she wasnt afraid and if she had been she wouldnt have shown it she shot across easily with toni pulling her as surefooted as a cat everyone suddenly felt very cheerful lucyann hugged jack without stopping there was now such a crowd on the little stone platform at the top of the tower that poor toni could hardly find room for himself what about this wire rope said pedro how can we get it back we leave it said toni it is not possible to get it away i have another lets get down to the ground said jack half afraid that now things had gone so well something might suddenly happen to make them go wrong ill go first soon they were all at the bottom of the tower silent now whispered jack and they began to walk cautiously down the slope of the hill to the circus lucyann kept close to jack and he put his arm round her he was very glad to know that his sister was safe gussy stumbled along scared and puzzled he didnt really seem to know quite what was happening the girls can have our van said pedro to jack you and i and gussy can sleep beneath it but before they could get to the van a great clamour came on the air and startled them so much that they all stood still in panic whatever was that tremendous noise its a bellits bells said jack putting his hands to his ears the bell in the belltowerand the bell in the churchand another bell somewhere else whatevers happening have they missed gussy already the circusfolk all awoke and rushed out of their vans marvelling at the pandemonium of noise made by the bells clang clang jangle jangle clang clang it went on all the time and then there came shouting from the town lights shone out and still the bells went on and on there are some ringing from the next village too said jack marvelling its to warn the people about something what can it be they cant know yet about gussy escapingwhy except for count paritolen and his sister nobody knew gussy was a prisoner nothe bells were not ringing for gussy they were giving other newsserious news the king the king is gone he has disappeared he is nowhere to be found the king is gone the townsfolk shouted the news to one another in foreboding what had happened to their king had he been killed all the bells in the country rang out the news enemies had taken their king who why clang clang clang jangle jangle my word said jack when he heard the news we only just got gussy out in time only just another halfhour and it would have been too late yes said philip and id like to see count paritolens face when he rushes to the towerroom to get gussy out of bed and put him on the throneand gussys not there the king goneand no one to put in his place gussy burst into howls whats happened to my uncle he wailed where is he i dont want to be king shut up said jack fiercely do you want every single person here to know youre the prince if someone gives you away youll be captured by the count immediately go into that caravan and dont dare to make a sound chapter beware the bears jack hurried the girls and gussy to pedros van he hadnt reckoned on arriving back with them in the middle of a disturbance like this all the circusfolk were out of their vans they were dressed in all kinds of shawls coats and macs hastily pulled over their night things and were gathering together in frightened groups to talk it was just about the very worst time to bring gussy to the camp suppose anyone recognized him he would certainly have to be disguised at once pedro realized this too he knew much better than jack what trouble the circusfolk would get into if it was discovered that they were harbouring the prince himself they would all be clapped into prison at once pedro was very very worried jack ill have to tell ma he said desperately ill have to she can hide gussy better than anyone let me tell her shell help us there was nothing for it but to say yes jack watched pedro go up to his mother and say something urgently then they disappeared up the steps of mas caravan and shut the door jack looked at philip who was feeling bewildered at this sudden transition from confinement in the towerroom to the excited turmoil of the circus camp the girls and gussy were now safely in pedros own caravantrying to peer out of the windows to see what was going on kiki had gone with them lucyann almost wished she was back in the peace of the towerroom she couldnt understand exactly what was happening where was jack why didnt he come and tell her pedro came out of his mothers caravan and went straight over to jack its all right he said mas taken command shes not a bit afraid of hiding the princeactually she rather enjoys something like this shell get him some girls clothes put a ribbon on that long hair of his and keep him close to her she says shell tell everyone hes her little granddaughter come to stay for a few days jack gave a chuckle at the thought of gussy as a girl hell hate it he said hell kick up no end of a fuss ma wont take any notice said pedro with a grin shes quite likely to give him a few hard slaps and my word shes got a bony hand ill get him and take him to her no one will recognize prince aloysius when shes finished with him pedro went off and jack turned to philip who grinned at him poor old gussy thats a wonderful idea thoughgussy will make a beautiful girl there came a sudden shouting from the other end of the campthen screams people began to stream away towards the two boys shouting in fear the bears the bears theyre out toni came bounding up to jack wheres that friend of yours you said could manage animals oh there he is the bears are loosetheyve broken three of the bars of their cage see if your friend can help fank cant even get out of bed philip knew nothing about the bears of course and jack hurriedly told him the details as they ran to the other end of the field i hope you can do something with them philip toni helped me to rescue you on the chance that you could help it will be a terrible loss to the circus if the bears get loose and have to be shot one bear was still in the broken cage afraid to go out because of the crowds he was making a terrible noise no one dared to go near in a nearby cage feefo and fum the two chimpanzees were wailing in fright madame fifi made sure they were safely locked in and ran over to jack dont go near that bear you two boys hes dangerous and look out for the others theyre loose cant someone block up those broken bars said philip hell be out soon nobody dares said toni but little madame fifi dared she ran to a brilliant flaring torch stuck in a holder nearby plucked it out and ran back to the cage she thrust the pointed bottom end of the torch into the ground just in front of the cage the bear shrank back at the bright light and crouched down in a corner he was afraid of the brilliance that settles him said philip pleased he wont attempt to come out while that light is there nowwhere are the others over theresniffing round the bosss caravan said jack pointing to two dark shapes i bet the boss is shivering in his shoes inside the van where can i get some meat panted philip as they ran across the field towards the bears or better still can i get honey anywhereor treacle treacle yes mas got a whole jar of it said jack remembering ill get it he raced off to mas caravan burst in and demanded the treacle gussy was there standing in silken vest and pants protesting loudly ma was evidently getting to work on him she didnt seem to be at all surprised at jack bursting in to ask for treacle on the shelf she said and went on brushing out gussys hair jack found the big stone jar and fled back to philip with it philip had now gone close to the bears who turned to look at him suspiciously theyve already injured one man said jack in a low voice look out wont you philip ill be all right said philip keep out of sight jack he took the jar of treacle dipped his hands in it and smeared them up to the wrists with the thick sweet syrup then he walked towards the bears pouring a little of the syrup out on the grass as he went the bears growled warningly philip turned and went back again he sat down with the jar of treacle and waited by now many people were watching who was this boy what was he doing meddling with two dangerous bears they watched in fearful curiosity ready to run at any moment jack stood out of sightbut near enough to run to philips help if necessary he didnt think it would be necessary he had absolute faith in philips ability to manage any animal the bears soon smelt the syrup that philip had spilt here and there on the grass they loved the sweetness of treacle fank sometimes gave it to them for a treatand there was nothing they liked better than to have an empty syrup tin given to them and to be allowed to lick it and put their great paws inside they sniffed and went towards the first spots of treacle on the ground one bear found them and licked eagerly the second bear growled at him and tried to push him asidebut suddenly smelt another few spots of treacle further on he lumbered on clumsily and licked eagerly as soon as the bears realized that there was treacle about they began to grunt excitedly they had refused food for two days now and they were hungry they sniffed eagerly for more treacle the watching people held their breath as they saw the two great clumsy creatures getting nearer and nearer to the boy sitting on the ground surely he was in danger who is he he ought to be warned they said but toni and bingo hushed them be quiet he is jacks friend a wonder with animals give him a chance he can run if the bears threaten him the first bear was now quite near philip his head close to the ground as he sniffed about for more treacle philip put his hand into the jar he held and took it out waving it slowly in the air so that the bear could get the full scent of it the bear raised his head and saw philip he backed away a little and gave an angry grunt who was that sitting on the ground his eyes gleamed an angry red in the light from a nearby lamp a little sigh of fear went through the anxious crowd and then philip spoke he spoke in what jack called his special voicethe voice he always kept for animals it was a low monotonous voice a gentle kindly voice but somehow it was a voice that had to be listened to a sort of hypnotising voice thought jack as he stood watching the bear listened he grunted again and backed away bumping into the second bear but still philips voice went on what was he saying jack couldnt hear how did he know how to talk to animals like this and why did they all listen the watching circusfolk knew that most animal trainers used a special tone of voice when they petted their animalsbut here was a strange boy talking to frightened and suspicious bearsand yet they listened the second bear came a little nearer his ears pricked he sniffed he sniffed not only the treacle but philips own particular smell he liked it it was a friendly smell the bears always sorted out people into two kindsthose whose smell they liked and those they didnt he lumbered right up to philip and sniffed at him ready to strike if the boy moved a little scream came from someone in the crowd but the bear took no notice philip went on talking and now his voice was so honeyed and persuasive that even the crowd began to feel his spell the bear licked philips hand which was covered in treacle philip did not move the bear went on licking quite unafraid the other bear came up and seeing how unafraid his brother was he took a quick lick at philips other hand in two or three seconds both bears were grunting in delight at so much treacle this boy was a friend they didnt know who he was but they were quite sure he was a friend philip talked all the time monotonously and kindly he thought he could now dare to move so he lifted one hand slowly put it into the jar beside him and then took it out covered with treacle again one bear lay down beside him to lick in comfort another sigh at once went through the tense crowd philip gave the jar to the other bear and then with his free hand began to fondle the bear lying beside him it grunted in pleasure now the bears were happy and at peace they had found someone they liked and trusted philip knew that he had them under controlif only the crowd didnt do something sillymake a sudden noise or come surging towards him but the circusfolk knew better than that they were used to animals philip stood up doing nothing quicklyall his movements were smooth and slow he picked up the jar and with his other hand on one bears neck began to walk to the cage the bears followed shambling along quietly licking their lips philip took them right to the cage undid the door and let them shuffle in he put the treacle jar inside shut the door and went quietly outside and then how the people cheered hes a wonder who is he tell fank the bears are safe who is this boy chapter morning comes philip called to jack jacksee if you can get some meatplenty of itand bring it to me ill get some said toni and raced off he came back with a basket containing great slabs of horsemeat philip took it he opened the cage door and threw in the meat talking cheerfully to the hungry bears now they were ready for their meal they were no longer sulky scared or angry they were just three very hungry bears and they fell on the meat and gulped it down let them have as much as they will eat said philip then they will go to sleep while they are asleep someone must mend their cage bars keep that light in front nownone of them will venture out of the broken bars while that light is there everyone gathered round philip hes a friend of jack they said to one another he fetched him here because he is good with bears he must have come from another circus lookthe boss wants him the boss had watched everything from his caravan window he was most impressed and extremely thankful pedro told philip that the boss had sent for him and he and jack and philip went up the steps of the bosss big caravan the boss poured out praise and thanks in a mixture of several languages pedro interpreted with a grin he says what can he do for you he says youve saved the bears from being shot he says ask anything you like and you can have it if he can give it to you jack answered quickly theres only one thing we want now that there is this upset in borken can we all stay with the circus philip will be glad to look after the bears as long as fank is illbut he has girls with him our sisterscan they stay too we dont like to let them go off by themselves in case civil war starts up in taurihessia pedro interpreted the boss quite thought that these sisters were circus performers too he nodded his head yesyou may let them stay if they have tricks or shows of their own they may get a chance here but we must strike camp tomorrowit will be dangerous to stay here in borken any longer the count paritolen owns this land and as it is probably he who has something to do with the kings disappearance it would be best for us to leave before trouble starts what does he say asked jack anxiously pedro translated all this into english and the two boys were much relieved good they could all stay with the circus and would leave almost immediately with the circus folk they would soon be out of the danger zoneand then perhaps they could get a message to bill the boys went down the steps of the van with pedro they made their way to pedros own little van feeling that they simply must have a good long talk it was about two oclock in the morning now but none of the three boys felt tiredthey were far too strung up with the happenings of the night the circusfolk as they passed clapped philip on the back he smiled and nodded and then at last all three were in the little van with the two girls and kiki shut the door said kiki at once wipe your feet fetch the king i wish we could kiki said jack with a laugh as the parrot flew on to his shoulder but dont you start talking about the king ohlucyannyou nearly had me over what a hug it reminds me of the bears i cant help it said lucyann and gave philip a hug too i was so anxious about you and philip with those bears it all seems like a horrid dream i was longing for you to come back to us gussys gone too is he really going to be a girl he is said jack sitting down on the mattress now weve got to talk and make plans first of all because of philips grand performance with the bears the boss has said we can all stay with the circus we couldnt have a better hidingplace thats true said dinah but suppose the count makes a search for usand his men are sent here to look among other places gussy might not be recognized if hes dressed up as a girlbut what about me and lucyann and philip were all dressed in the english waywed soon be noticed yes i hadnt thought of that said jack im too english as well pedroive got some money saved up that i made out of kikis performancescould you buy some hessian clothes for us early today ma will fix you all up said pedro shes a wonder with her needle shell get some cloth from old lucia the woman whos in charge of the circus clothes and well borrow some greasepaint from toni and give you all dark taurihessian faces but dont go speaking english no we wont well talk a wonderful gibberish of our own said philip with a laugh well come from jabberwocky and talk the jabberwock language it goes like thisgoonalillypondicherrytapularkawoonatee everyone laughed good said pedro ill tell any searchers that you are jabberwockians and then you can talk like that if they ask you anything by the way where is jabberwocky kiki suddenly launched with delight into the jabberwockian language they all listened to her and roared youre a very fine specimen of a jabberwockian parrot said jack fondling her go to the top of the class dinah gave an enormous yawn at once copied by kiki it made everyone begin to feel terribly sleepy come onwell be striking camp fairly early said pedro getting up sleep in peace girls we three boys will be just under the van on a couple of rugs as for gussy i expect hes snoring in mas extra bunk looking like a beautiful little girl gussy was not asleep however he lay in the small bunk listening to mas deep breathing and sudden snorts he was very angry and very humiliated ma had seen to him properly she had tried his hair this way and that and had finally decided that he looked more like a girl with a small bow at each side rather than with one big one on top she had also looked out some clothesa longish skirt rather dirty very highly coloured and decidedly raggedand a small red blouse with a green scarf tied skittishly round the waist gussy could have cried with shame it wasnt the slightest bit of good arguing with ma in fact when gussy refused to stand still while his bows were being tied ma had given him a hefty slap on a very tender place which had given gussy such a tremendous shock that he couldnt even yell you know im a prince dont you he said fiercely under his breath pah said ma youre just a boy ive no time for princes and she hadnt now gussy was trying to go to sleep his hair still tied with bows and a peculiar sort of garment on him that looked half like a nightgown and half like a long coat he went over the exciting escape in his mind and shuddered nohe wouldnt think about that awful rope and the trapeze swing he wondered about his uncle and shuddered again was he killed poor gussys thoughts were not pleasant ones at all the morning came all too soon for the five tired children philip went across at once to the bears cage to see how they were the bars had been mended and strengthened the bears looking extremely wellfed were half asleepbut as soon as they saw philip they padded to the bars and grunted amiably one bear tried to reach him with his paw goodtheyre quite all right said philip and gave them a little talk to which they listened entranced as if they understood every word fank was betterbut still could not stand up philip went to see him and the little man took his hand and poured out a stream of completely unintelligible words philip knew what he was saying though here was a grateful man if ever there was one fank loved his bears as if they were his brothers and he had been almost mad with anxiety the night before when he heard they had escaped ill take them on till youre well said philip and fank understood and shook philips hand fervently the next thing was clothes the camp was to set off in three hours so ma had got to hurry if she was going to get the four of them clothes that would disguise the fact that they were english she went to lucia an old bent woman who kept the clothes of the circusfolk in ordernot the ordinary ones they wore every day but their fine ones worn in the ringtheir glittering capes and skirts their silken shirts and magnificent cloaks these were valuable and old lucias needle was always busy so was her iron nobody could press fine clothes as well or as carefully as lucia by the time the circusfolk were ready to strike camp nobody would have recognized dinah lucyann philip and jack toni had lent them greasepaint and each of them was as dark as a taurihessianface neck legs and hands the girls wore the taurihessian dresslong skirts and shawls and gay ribbons in their hair the boys looked just like roughly broughtup boys of the country and seemed to have grown older all of a sudden lucyann stared at jack in surprise hardly recognizing this brown youth whose teeth gleamed suddenly white in his dark face ma was pleased with her efforts but most of all she was delighted with gussy nobody nobody could possibly think that gussy was anything but a girl he looked really pretty all five of them pedro too roared with laughter when poor gussy came down mas caravan steps looking very red in the face very angry and very ashamed dis is my little grandchild annamaria said ma with a broad smile be kind to her plizz gussy looked as if he was about to burst into tears yes go on cry said philip hardheartedly youll be exactly like a girl then annamaria dinah gave him a punch its only soft girls that cry she said oh deardoesnt gussyi mean annamarialook priceless smashing said jack honestly hes as pretty as a picture thank goodness for his long hairthats what makes him look like a girl more than anything i cut it short soon soon soon said poor gussy furiously snipsniplike that you cant you told us that princes of this country have to wear it long like you do said dinah i will not be a prince then said gussy he looked suddenly very forlorn and gazed at lucyann beseechingly feeling that she had the kindest heart of the lot do not tizz me he begged i hate zis i am full of shamefulness all right gussy erannamaria said jack we wont tizz you cheer upyoull be a prince again before long im sure if my uncle is alive i will be said gussy soberly if he is deadi must be king god save the king said kiki devoutly and raised her crest impressively fetch the doctor and save the king chapter the camp is searched soon a long procession of vans was going down the winding road that led away from borken the two girls and gussy were in pedros little van and he was driving the small skewbald horse that belonged to him jack was driving mas van for her and the old lady looked really happy she loved a bit of excitement and she roared with laughter whenever she caught sight of poor gussy philip of course was driving the van in which the bears cage was built toni was driving fanks little livingvan whistling cheerfully fank lay on his mattress inside glad to feel better and to know that that wonderboy philip had got his bears in charge he felt full of gratitude to philipand to toni too for so cheerfully driving his van for him the circusfolk were always ready to help one another that was one of the nicest things about them the vans rumbled along the road going very slowly for neither the bears nor the chimpanzees liked going fast they were all excited at being on the move again feefo and fum chattered away together looking through the window of their van where are we going dinah asked pedro through the open window of the van pedro shrugged his shoulders he had no idea we must get away from borken where a lot of trouble may start he said and try to find somewhere more peaceful we shall probably make for some country road and keep away from all the main roads soldiers will use those if trouble starts dinah went back into the van the taurihessian dress suited her well and she looked exactly right in it were making for some country road she told lucyann its a pity we still cant get in touch with mother or bill they really will be dreadfully worried about us by now i suppose the police will have been told and will be hunting everywhere for usbut in england instead of here said lucyann well anyway were safe for the moment and out of that towerroom i was getting tired of that nothing to do all day but to play games with those funny cards they brought us they all stopped for a meal at about one oclock the vans stood at one side of the road and the circusfolk sat beside them and ate it was like summer although it was only april the sun was very hot and masses of brilliant flowers were out everywhere philips little dormouse came out to share the meal with him he had had it with him all the time it was scared by the noisy talk of the circusfolk and only appeared when things were quiet it sat on the palm of philips hand enjoying a nut its big black eyes now and again glancing up at the boy i dont know what wed have done without you snoozy when we were shut up in that towerroom said philip softly you kept us all amused with your little games and antics didnt you and you told jack where we were the other nightyou ran under the door to him soon they were on the way again the bears settled down to sleep happy to know that philip was driving them he had fed them himself again when the procession halted for a meal and the bears grunted at him happily fank heard them and was happy too the procession wound down the road came out into a main road and went down that intending to turn off at a country road about two miles on but halfway down something happened three powerful military cars swept by the procession and drove right up to the head of it then they stopped and soldiers leapt down from the cars with a captain in command halt he said to the front driver and the whole procession came to a stop the circusfolk looked worried what was this soldiers already and why were they being halted they had done nothing wrong they jumped down from their vans and gathered together in little knots waiting jack poked his head back into mas van which he was driving this is it ma he said i think the vans are going to be searched give gussy something to do and scold him as if he was your grandchild gussy youre a girl rememberso dont answer back or even say a word when the men come along look shy if you can pedro also knew what was about to happen he called to the two girls come out and mix with the circus folk go with toni and bingo ill come too ill put my arms round you both as if you were my sisters or my friends philip however didnt move he decided that he was in a very good place driving the bears van the men would be sure to upset the bears and he would have to pacify them he would appear to the men to be a beartrainer the captain found the boss pedro heard him talking to him in sharp tones we are going to search your vans we suspect you have someone here we want it will be the worse for you if you have i warn you to give him up now at once because when we find him you will be severely punished the boss looked surprised he was sitting in his great chair inside his van i do not know what you mean he said search my vans you are welcome the boss thought that the soldiers were looking for a deserter a young man perhaps he did not know they were hunting for a small boy and certainly had no idea they were after the little prince aloysius the captain gave a sharp command his soldiers marched down the sides of the vans keeping a watch for anyone who might try to hide in the wayside bushes then they began to search carefully probing each van lifting up piles of rugs or clothes to see if anyone could be hidden there they stopped at the sight of philip they had been told that although they must at all costs find gussy there were three other children too to look for children whose presence in the camp would tell them the prince was somewhere about too they came up to the bears van their heels clicking sharply their loud voices angered the three bears and they growled and flung themselves at the bars toni came up and spoke to them telling them to keep out of sight of the bears we had trouble with them yesterday he said and this boy who helps the trainer only just managed to keep them under control as you see the bars of the cage were broken and had to be mended keep out of sight please or they will break the bars again philip didnt understand what toni was saying but guessed he decided that the best thing he could do to avoid being questioned was to get inside the bears cage and pretend to quieten them so in he went and the bears fawned round him in delight the soldiers watched from a safe distance the captain was satisfied obviously this boy belonged to the circus and travelled as a helper with the bears he could not be one of the boys they had been told to look out for they went on to the next van and toni winked at philip good he said keep there you are safer with the bears than anywhere else the soldiers went from van to van they hardly glanced at dinah or lucyann who with pedros arms round them were standing watching the two chimpanzees madame fifi had taken the opportunity of giving them a little airing the captain however glanced sharply at pedro could he be one of the boys they sought he beckoned to him pedro came over still with the girls smiling and at ease the captain snapped something at him in taurihessian pedro answered smoothly pointing to his mothers van he was saying that he travelled with his mother and his little cousin annamaria and these two girls said the captain sharply they are with the circus too said pedro they belong to the boy who manages the bearsyou have seen him they are jabberwockians and speak very little hessian but they speak french if you would like to ask them anything dinah heard pedro say the word jabberwockians and guessed that he was saying that she and lucyann belonged to jabberwocky dinah immediately poured out a string of utter gibberish to the captain waving her hands about and smiling broadly lucy nodded her head now and again as if she agreed with her sister all right all right said the captain in his own language its all nonsense to me this i cant understand a word what is she saying pedro grinned he told the captain that dinah thought him very magnificent much grander than captains in jabberwocky he was pleased he saluted the two smiling girls smartly and went away satisfied that they were certainly not english he really must find out where the land of jabberwocky washe didnt seem to have heard of it these circusfolk came from queer places and now the soldiers had reached mas caravan jack was still sitting in the drivers seat kiki on his shoulder he had warned her not to talk because he was afraid her english words might give them away but you can make noises he told her and kiki understood perfectly she raised her crest as the men came near and coughed loudly the soldiers looked at her in surprise powke said jack patting kiki powke arka powke he knew that this meant clever parrot because the people who had come to marvel at kiki when she had been on show had so often said those two words arka powke clever parrot kiki gave a loud hiccup and then another the soldiers were tickled and roared with laughter then kiki ducked like a hen laying eggs and that amused them even more this was the kind of thing kiki liked it gave her a wonderful opportunity for showing off she put down her head looked wickedly at the soldiers and gave them the full benefit of her aeroplaneintrouble noise they were extremely startled and stepped back at once kiki cackled idiotically laughing till the soldiers and jack were laughing helplessly too a sharp voice came from behind them it was their captain they jumped to attention at once why waste time on this boy said the captain you can see he is a circus boy with a parrot like that search the van jack knew enough of the hessian language now to understand roughly what the captain had said he wasnt suspected thenand it was obvious that none of the soldiers suspected philip or the girls now there was only gussy left would he play up and be sensible two soldiers went into mas van they saw gussy at once sitting beside ma whos this they said sharply whats her name chapter the pedlars van gussy looked shyly up at them and then hid his face in mas lap as if very overcome that had been mas idea of course now now said ma in taurihessian tapping gussy sit up and answer the gentlemen my little annamaria she turned to the soldiers you must pardon her she said she is a silly little girl and cannot say boo to a goose sit up my pet and show these kind gentlemen what you are making gussy sat up and held out a piece of embroidery to the two soldiers keeping his head down as if very shy indeed jack looking in through the window was amazed at gussys acting and that embroidery how very very clever of ma to give gussy that to show to the soldiers he had seen ma working on it herself night after night she is my favourite grandchild ma prattled on the prettiest little thing and so good talk to the kind gentlemen annamaria say howdoyoudo i cannot said gussy and hid his face in mas lap again dont bother her said one soldier i have a little girl at home as shy as she is its better to have them that way than bold and cheeky how pretty her hair is you must be proud of her old woman she is such a good little needlewoman said ma proudly and patted gussys head sit up my petthe gentlemen wont eat you were going said the first soldier here give her this to spend she really does remind me of my little girl at home he threw a coin to ma and she caught it deftly and pocketed it at once jack heaved an enormous sigh of relief when he saw the two men walking away he poked his head in at the window its all right theyve gone gussy you were absolutely marvellous talk about an actor why youre a born actor a shy little girl to the life gussy lifted his head from mas lap his eyes were bright and his face was red he was laughing it was mas idea to behave like that he said she said i must not show my face at all i must be shy and put it into her lap a really good idea said jack and grinned at mas smiling face honestly gussy i congratulate youi never imagined you could act like that i like acting said gussy but not in girls clothes i feel silly stillit was a very good idea nowi am safe is it not so i think so said jack looking up the road the men are going back to their cars they are getting into them yesthe first car is going off whew i was in a stew when those two fellows walked into your van as soon as the three military cars had shot off down the road philip left the bears van and came running over to the others grinning they all collected round mas van and heard jacks recital of gussys marvellous performance gussy was pleased he was not often praised by the others and it was very pleasant to have them admiring him for once in a way then he caught sight of himself in mas mirror ribbons and all and his face clouded i do not like myself he said staring in the mirror i will now dress in my own things again oh nonot yet said jack quickly you dont know who might recognize you suddenly if you did youll have to be a girl until we get you to safety somewhere go on now gussyyou like acting youll give a marvellous performance the vans went on again the excitement quickly died down and everyone grew silent they were tired with their short night and the disturbances they had had they stopped for a snack about six oclock and then went on again they were now on a lonely country road the surface was bad and the vans had to go slowly nobody minded that circusfolk were never in a hurry except when their show was about to begin then everyone fell into a tremendous rush and raced about in excitement they camped that night in the hills they all slept very soundly to make up for the lack of sleep the night before then they set out again jogging on slowly not really very certain where they were going the boss suddenly decided that they had taken a wrong turning a few miles back the vans were turned round and back they all went grumbling hard they passed few people on the road for they were now in a very lonely part i want shops grumbled ma i need to buy things we all need to buy things we must go to some place where there are shops i will go to tell the boss but she didnt because she was afraid of him she just went on grumbling she wanted new cotton reels she wanted some tinned fruit she wanted hairpins cheer up mawe may meet a travelling pedlarvan said pedro getting tired of mas grumbling whats that asked jack oha van that takes all kinds of things to lonely villages said pedro i dont expect we shall meet onebut ive got to say something to keep ma quiet the boss gave the order to camp early that night and everyone was thankful soon fires were burning by the roadside and good smells came on the air just as it was getting dusk a small van came labouring up the hill on the slope of which the camp had been pitched madame fifi saw it first and gave a shout everyone looked up ma youre in luck called pedro heres a pedlars van the little black van drew up at the sight of the circus camp two men sat in the front of it in the usual taurihessian clothes sunburnt fellows one small one big and burly better keep out of sight gussy said jack suddenly you never knowthis might be men sent to check over the camp again oh dear sighed lucyann dont say theyre going to search all over again the small man jumped out went to the side of the van and swung down half the wooden side making a kind of counter inside the van on shelves were goods of every conceivable kind tins of meat sardines and fruit tins of salmon and milk skeins of wool reels of cotton rolls of lace bales of cheap cotton cloth safetypins and hairpins combs of all kinds soap sweets really it was just like a little general shop seen in so many villages it sells everything said pedro ma do you want me to buy half the things for you no ill come myself said ma who enjoyed a bit of shopping stay here annamaria can we go and have a look at the shop do you think asked dinah youve got some hessian money havent you jack i do really want to buy some soap and a few other things surely that van is genuinethose men cant be spies sent to search the camp again no i dont think they can be said jack the van does seem quite genuine as you say all rightwell go and buy a few things not gussy though so while the others strolled off in the dusk to the little travelling shop poor gussy was left behind in mas van he was very cross the small man sold all the goods the big man merely helped handing down this and that and wrapping up anything that needed it he said nothing at all the other man was a real talker he chattered all the time chaffed the women and passed on little bits of news and what news have you got he asked ma and old lucia as he sold them hairpins and combs youve come from the direction of borken havent you any news of the king there hes not been found yet you know ma gave him her news and described the clamour of the bells in the night old lucia chimed in with a few remarks too wheres little prince aloysius she wanted to know they say he was sent to school in england if the king is dead the little prince will have to be brought back wont he we had soldiers searching our camp today said madame fifi though what they expected to find i dont know the king perhaps everyone laughed the chattering and buying went on for some time and the pedlars did very well jack went up to buy some sweets for the girls kiki on his shoulder goodmorning goodnight good gracious said kiki conversationally to the pedlar who was serving he laughed but the other man didnt he turned round and looked very sharply at kiki indeed jack felt uncomfortable why did the second man look round like that he tried to see what he was like but it was now dark and difficult to see inside the little van lucyann pointed to some toffee id like some of that she said in english jack saw the man at the back of the van stiffen he seemed to be listening for what lucyann might say next he reached up to a shelf took down a tin and then stood still again as lucyann spoke once more lets have a tin of pineapple kiki likes that the man swung round jack hurriedly pushed lucyann back into the darkness this fellow was a spy he was sure of it he took another look at him but could not make out very much a head of black curly hair such as all the taurihessians hada small black moustachethat was about all jack could see whats up jack said lucyann in astonishment as he hurried her away from the van pulling dinah and philip with him too he told them hurriedly what he thought and they were very worried they rushed back to mas van to see if gussy was all right to their great relief he was there looking very sulky though why we should think he wouldnt be there i dont know said jack gussy get out your embroidery weve seen somebody suspicious he heard lucyann talking in english and kiki too and he was much too interested wellwell hope he clears off soon said philip ill go and watch and tell you when theyre gone but the pedlars van didnt go the two men shut up the side of the van safely locking up all their goods and then sat outside with a little campfire cooking some kind of meal theyre staying the night reported philip not too good is it and madame fifi told me that the small man has been asking questions about kikiif the boy who owns her belongs to the campand where his caravan is blow said jack what can we do we cant possibly run away ive no idea at all where we aremiles away from anywhere thats certain wellwe can only hope for the best well sleep as usual under the girls van and gussy can be with ma after all hes the important onewere not really important except that gussy escaped with us and presumably the count will think that wherever we are gussy will be too the girls went to their van and undressed to go to sleep gussy was safely with ma the three boys lay on the rugs below the girls van as usual pedro soon fell asleep but jack and philip were worried and lay awake whispering suddenly jack clutched philip i can hear someone he whispered in his ear someone crawling near this van jack sat up cautiously and felt for his torch yessomeone was near the van crawling quietly on all fours jack flicked on his torch at once a surprised face was caught in the light a man was on hands and knees nearby it was the big pedlar from the little van his black hair showed up plainly in the beam of the torch what do you want said jack fiercely what do you mean by crawling around like this ill raise the camp and have them all after you chapter a surpriseand a plan sh said the man urgently i and then before he could say another word a very strange thing happened kiki who had been watching the man in the greatest surprise suddenly spread her wings and flew to his shoulder she rubbed her beak against his cheek in the most loving manner crooning like a dove kiki said the man and stroked her neck sillybilly said kiki lovingly sillybilly put the kettle on send for the doctor jack was so astonished that he simply couldnt say a word why in the world was kiki behaving like thatand how did this man know her it was philip who guessed he suddenly rolled himself over on hands and knees and crawled at top speed from under the wagon bill bill this must be a dream bill it is you isnt it are you wearing a wig with a grin the big man stripped off the whole of his black hairyes he was wearing a wig and without it he looked himself at once in spite of the little black moustache which of course was merely stuck on bill oh bill i cant believe it said philip bill put out his great hand and the two shook hands solemnly for quite a long time then jack joined them his eyes almost falling out of his head it must be a dream this couldnt be real but it was it was bill himself he asked eagerly about the girls i was so relieved to see them both looking so well he said though i hardly knew them in that getup they were wearing but i knew lucyanns clear high voice all rightand i spotted kiki too of course i couldnt believe it when i saw her on your shoulder jack i really couldnt where are the girls in this van here yes we heard that you had made enquiries about where our van was said jack and we thought you were spies we didnt guess it was you and that you wanted to come and find us in the night lets get into the van and wake the girls well wake old pedro too hes a great friend of ours soon an extremely excited company of six people and a parrot sat in pedros little van lucyann hung on to bill and wouldnt let him move even an inch from her tears ran down her cheeks and she kept brushing them away i cant help it bill im not really crying its just because im so happy again i just cant help it bill said poor lucyann laughing through the tears that simply poured down her face bill took out an enormous hanky and patted her eyes he was very fond of lucyann you make me think of gussy he said and the time when philip took a kitchen tablecloth to dry his tears cheer upwere all together againand you can give me most valuable information hows mother said philip is she very worried very said bill she and i were caught and tied up the night you were kidnapped we couldnt get free we had to wait till mrs gump came along the road next morning on her way to the cottage and call out to her by that time of course all trace of you had been lost weve had the police hunting every county in england for you we didnt dare to say gussy had gone too because we didnt want the news to get to the taurihessians we went off in a plane after a car had taken us away said philip jack hid in the boot of the car and then stowed away in the planeso he knew where we had gone we were imprisoned in borken castle with gussyand jack managed to rescue us i joined this circus with kiki explained jack pedro was a brickhe helped me no end we got toni and bingo the acrobats to help in the rescuephew it was pretty dangerous he told bill all about it bill listened in amazement these children the things that happened to themthe way they tackled everything that came along and never turned a hair and now they had got gussy safely with them disguised as a girl but billyou havent told us what youre doing here said jack fancy you coming along in a pedlars vanall dressed up as a taurihessianreally its too queer to be true well its true all right said bill you see when our government learnt that the king of taurihessia had been capturedor killed for all we knowit was absolutely essential that we should find out whether this was true or notand it was essential we should find gussy too if possible so as the taurihessian government had put gussy into my charge as you know it was decided that i should be the one to come out and make inquiries i seespy round to see how the land lay said philip did you think we might all be in taurihessia yesi came to the conclusion that wherever gussy had been taken you would be there tooto be held as hostages if our own government made any trouble about gussy said bill and as soon as the news came that the king had disappeared we felt sure that gussy would be somewhere in borken count paritolens own territoryand possibly the king might be held prisoner there tooso i and another man who speaks taurihessian well flew over straight away to do a spot of spying hence the pedlars van mother will be feeling awfully worried with you gone too said dinah ill get a message through to her sometime tomorrow said bill now i wonder if you can tell me somethinghave you any sort of an idea at all where the king might be hidden in borken castle said jack promptly im sure of it ill tell you why he told bill of how he had explored the castleand how he had overheard the count and madame tatiosa talking excitedly together that was the night before the king was known to have disappeared said jack i think their plans were going wellprobably they even had him a prisoner somewhere then and the obvious place to take him would be the counts own castlehe would then have gussy thereand the king tooright under his hand he could bargain with both if he wanted to bill listened to this long speech with the greatest interest i think youre right he said i wish we could get into the castle and find out something ronald the fellow who is with me speaks the language like a native i wonder if he could bluff his way insay hes a tradesman come to do a repair or something i know what we could do said jack with a sudden surge of excitement i know a way in billthe way i got out the first night i was there it leads through secret passages up to the big ballroom theres a way into the ballroom from behind a great picture i dont know how to move the picture away thoughso as to get into the ballroom thats the snag well find out said bill jack this is great are you game to come with meand ronald too my paland show us the way into the castle if only we could find out whether the king is alive or notor whether hes a prisonerit would be a great help theres one thing the plans of the plotters must be greatly upset now that gussy has gone no king for the countryand no prince to set in his place very difficult for them ill come bill said jack his face red with excitement ill come too said philip noyou must stay and keep an eye on the girls said bill i must have one of you with them keep an eye on gussy too pedro can help there shall we go now asked jack eagerly its a very dark night the sooner the better said bill and got up wait here ill fetch ronnie ill have to tell him a few things first though my word hell be astonished bill disappeared for a moment the five said nothing kiki broke the silence ding dong bell billys in the well she said pussys got a coldachooo idiot said jack my wordwhat a night fancy bill turning up here it was kiki who recognized him when he came crawling round the van i didnt everything will be all right now said lucyann it always is when bill comes dont talk too soon said dinah theyve not got an easy job tonight bill came back with ronnie who seemed rather overcome at meeting so many people at once he had much more to say as a pedlar than with bill in pedros van wellare we ready said bill come on then they slipped out of the caravan and jack followed the two men their van was quite near and jack guessed what they were going to do they were going to drive back to borken it wouldnt take long because it wasnt really very far away the circus procession of horsedrawn vans had gone at a walking pace the last two days and had once had to retrace their steps as well it wouldnt take more than an hour to get to borken they went off in the night ronnie driving kiki was on jacks shoulder she meant to be in everything no matter what it was they came to borken the town was in utter darkness park the van in the field where the camp was said jack and guided them to it the castle is only just up the steep slope of the hill then they parked the van behind a big bush then they made their way up the steep slope to the castle theres the belltower said jack as they came nearer better go cautiously in case there are people on guard the count must know that we escaped by means of the belltower we had to leave tonis wire rope behind stretched from tower to tower nobody seemed to be about however but jack suddenly saw lights in the castle windows high above them they blazed out of half a dozen windowssomething was going on in the castle in the middle of that night it was certain we might be able to have a look in on that said bill staring at the lights must be some kind of a conference going on theres a hole in one of the walls of the conference roomat least i think it must be a conference room said jack suddenly excited i saw a round table and chairs and writingpads and pencils all set out if we could get up to that room and look through the hole we might see something interestingand hear something too we might agreed bill come onlets get going into the belltower we go wheres that trapdoor you told us about they were soon in the belltower jack searched about for the trapdoor he found it and bill pulled it open down they went into the little cellar below bill pulled the trapdoor shut behind him lead the way jack he said and flashed on an extremely powerful torch with a jump jack saw that both men now carried revolvers too goshthis might be a serious business then this way said jack and stepped over the junk in the underground hole better be as quiet as we can nowthrough here chapter to borken castle again jack clambered through the round hole at the other end of the little cellar he was now in the very narrow lowroofed passage he remembered so well because he had had to walk through it with his head well bent he led bill and ronnie up the steeply sloping way lit by bills powerful torch jack stopped when they came to the top of the long sloping passage were very near the room where the spyhole is he whispered if there is a conference being heldor some sort of meetingwell be able to look through the hole at itor you will bill because as far as i know theres only one hole let me know when we come to it whispered bill and they went on again in a short while jack saw a little beam of light coming from the side of the righthand wallthat must be the spyhole he whispered to bill bill saw the beam of light and nodded there was not room for him to get in front of jack so the boy went on past the little spyhole and let bill stand by it behind him ronnie was by bill quite silent kiki had been tapped on the beak so she knew she was to be quiet too bill glued his eye to the spyhole he saw the same room that jack had seena room with a round table chairs pulled up to it and writing materials on the table but now there were lights blazing in the roomand every chair at the table was filled at the top sat count paritolen beside him sat his sister madame tatiosa on his other side sat someone else whom bill knew from photographsthe prime minister husband of madame tatiosa he looked illatease and grave men in military uniform were also round the table at the bottom of the table stood a tall man with a great likeness to gussyhis uncle the king bill heaved a sigh of relief so he hadnt been killed well that was one good thing at any rate if only he could be got away things could be put right very quickly and civil war would be avoided bill strained his ears to hear what was going on he could not hear very well behind the wooden panelling but he heard enough to know what was happening the king was being urged to abdicateto leave his throne go into retirement and let gussythe prince aloysiusrule in his stead if you will not sign this document of abdication then it will be the worse for you finished count paritolen you will i fear not be heard of again bill followed this with difficulty for he did not speak taurihessian well he had in fact only tried to learn it when he knew he might have to go to the country but he had no doubt that that was what the count was saying the prime minister said something in protest but the count would not listen madame tatiosa made a short angry speech and sat down the king bowed and then spoke in such a low voice that bill couldnt hear a word very well said the count you may have tonight to make up your mindtonight only we will adjourn this meeting he stood up and so did everyone else the count went out with his sister and the prime minister the king followed closely hemmed in by four men he looked sad and worried the lights in the conference room dimmed and there was silence bill turned to ronnie and repeated rapidly what he had seen and what he thought had happened as far as i can make out the kings got tonight to think things over if he says no he wont give up the throne thats the end of him i think he will say no there was a silence behind the wooden panelling for a moment or two bill debated with himself could he get back to the capital of taurihessia tell what he had seen and bring men to rescue the king nothere wouldnt be timethe capital town was too far off there was only one sure thing to doand that was to see if he himself could get the king away he whispered this to jack the boy nodded yes if only we knew where he was going to be tonight he wont be put into the towerroom im sure theyd be afraid hed escape too like gussie lets go to the ball room where that moving picture hangswe might be able to shove it aside and get into the room he led the way againup some very steep steps up and up then round a sharp corner and into a narrow dark passage running just inside the walls of the rooms but a little below the level of the floor then came a small flight of steps and jack paused these are the steps that lead up to that picture he whispered you must see if you can find out how to move it away from the hole billit slides right away from it keeping level with the wall bill and ronnie began to feel about all over the place bill suddenly found a knob ahthis must be it a pull at this might set the mechanism working that moved the picture away and left a hole in its place he listened carefully no noise came from the room within wellhed have to risk it anyhow bill pulled the knob nothing happened he twisted it still nothing happened then he pushed itand it gave beneath his hand then came a slight scraping noise and it seemed to bill as if part of the wall was disappearing but it was only the picture moving to one side leaving a hole almost as large as itselfthe secret entrance to the ballroom there was very little light in the big roommerely a dim glow from a lamp whose wick had been turned down bill peered out no one here he whispered to the others well get into the room while we can he climbed out of the hole and jumped lightly to the floor the others followed their rubber shoes made no sound wed better just go and see if the king has been put into the towerroom whispered jack ill go i know the way you stay herebehind these curtains he sped into the anteroom and saw the spiral stairway he stopped and listened no sound anywhere he ran up the steps quietly and came to the little landing he flashed his torch on the door that led into the room where philip and the others had been imprisoned it was wide open the room beyond was dark too so it was plain that the king was not imprisoned there jack went down again he tiptoed to the curtains behind which bill and ronnie were hiding no good he whispered the doors wide open hes not there listen said bill suddenly i can hear something they listened it was the clumpclump of marching feet they came nearer and nearer it sounded like two or three people bill peeped round the side of the curtain when the sound had passed by two soldiers he whispered they must have gone to relieve two others on guard somewhereand who should they be guarding but the king well wait and see if two others come back this way then we shall know the first two have gone on guard somewhereand well explore down that passage where the first two went when i was here before the sentry on guard kept disappearing down there said jack remembering its a kind of sentrybeat i think perhaps the king has been taken down there and locked into a cell listen said ronnie back came marching feet again and two different sentries went by smartly in the opposite direction from the others and disappeared the three could hear the sound of their feet for some time and then no more now said bill and keep your ears open and your eyes skinned too they all went down the dark passage where the two first sentries had gone right down to the endround a sharpangled turn and down a few stepsalong a narrower passage and round another turn but here they stopped they could hear marching feet againcoming nearer there was a room opening off near where the three stood bill pushed open the door and the three went into it hurriedly it was quite dark bill switched his torch on for a moment and they saw that it was a kind of boxroom the sentries passed right by it went a good way up the passage and then stampstamp they turned and came back again bill listened to their feet marching they seemed to go a long way down the passage a long long way before they turned to come back i should think the king must be locked up somewhere about the middle of their sentrygo said bill well let them come up here once more and when they have gone right past us up to the other end of their beat well slip down here and explore a bit we can always go and hide beyond the other end of their walk if we hear them coming back the sentries came marching back passed the three hidden in the little boxroom again and went on to the end of their beat bill ronnie and jack slipped quickly out of the boxroom and ran lightly down the passage they turned a corner and came to a deadend a stout door faced them well and truly boltedand locked too as bill found when he tried to open it sssst said ronnie suddenly and pulled them back into a dark corner bill and jack wondered what had scared himthen they saw a door was opening silently opposite to thema door they hadnt seen because it was part of the panelling itself someone came through carrying a lamp it was the count paritolen had he come to kill the king or to try once more to persuade him to give up his throne bill saw something else he saw what the count was holdinga big key the key to the kings room no doubt the count heard the sentries coming back and went back through the hidden door closing it softly he evidently meant to wait till the sentries had come up and then had gone back again ronnie said bill his mouth close to his friends ear we get that key do you understand and we get the count too will you tackle him while i open the door and find out if the kings there he mustnt make any noise he wont said ronnie grimly the sentries came right up and then turned stampstamp and went back again as soon as they had turned the first corner the hidden door opened again and the count stepped through swiftly lamp in one hand key in the other everything happened so quickly then that jack was bewildered he heard an exclamation from the count and then he saw bill running to the door with the key and ronnie dragging the count hurriedly back through the hidden door the lamp went out there was complete silence ronnie came back and switched on his torch he saw bill unlocking the door and pulling back bolts i found a nice little cell back there he said jerking his head towards the door just right for the count hes tied up and he can shout the place down if he likesnobody can hear him in that room good work said bill blow these boltsthere are half a dozen of them well have the sentries back here before we know where we are ronnie blew out the passage lamp that shone near the door dont want the sentries to see the bolts are drawn he said buck up bill theyre coming back jack and i will wait herejust in case theres trouble with the sentries do buck up chapter an exciting time bill at last got the door open and went in a shaft of light shone out from the room at once ronnie shut the door quickly jack found that his heart was beginning to thump again those sentrieswould they come back before bill had got the king the door opened again but this time no shaft of light showed bill had turned out the lamp inside the room someone was with himthe king oh good thought jack the sentries were coming back their feet could be clearly heard bill hurried the king across to the hidden door opened it and pushed him through ronnie followed and then jack just in time do you suppose theyll see the door is unbolted said jack you didnt have time to bolt it well soon know said bill im afraid they will notice itits their job to check up on that im sure jack suddenly gave a little cry kiki where is she she was on my shoulder a minute ago now shes gone i never felt her fly off in my excitement oh billshe must be out there in the passage somewhere she wasand she was very much annoyed to find that jack seemed to have disappeared where was he she could hear the sentries coming nearer and nearer and the sound of their clumpclumpclumping annoyed her she flew up to a juttingout stone in the wall and when the two men marched just below her she hooted long and loud hoooooo hooohooohooo the sound of marching feet stopped abruptly one of the men said something quickly to the other in a frightened voice kiki yapped like a dog and then snarled it sounded most extraordinary in that dark echoing passage the men looked all round where was the dog meeowowow wailed kiki like a hungry cat and then went off into a cackle of laughter wipe your feet blow your nose pop goes the weasel poppoppop the men didnt understand a word of course but that frightened them all the more they clutched each other feeling the hairs on their head beginning to prickle in fright kiki coughed and cleared her throat in a remarkably human way why that should have put the two sentries into an absolute panic she couldnt guess but it certainly did and casting their rifles away they fled down the passage at top speed howling out something in their own language jack had heard all this for he had opened the hidden door a little feeling anxious about kiki he listened to her performance with a grin good old kiki he called her softly and she flew down to his shoulder in delight bill wondered what would be the best thing to do now it would be dangerous to go back the way they had come because the scared sentries would certainly arrive back with others to probe into the mystery of the hooting and barking and mewing and coughing i wonder if the passage behind this hidden door leads anywhere except to the room you put the count in said bill to ronnie well go and ask him said ronnie cheerfully ill poke this in his ribs and see if hell talk this was his revolver bill laughed you wont need that hell talk all right when he sees the king here your majesty perhaps you would like to deal with the count and command him to show us the way out the king could talk perfect english like gussy he had been sent to england to be educated he nodded his eyes gleaming it was obvious that he would certainly enjoy a few words with the count they went to the celllike room into which ronnie had shoved the count locking him in nicely tied up count paritolen was on the floor looking furious when he saw the king he looked so thunderstruck that bill laughed undo his legs ronnie but not his arms said bill he should stand up politely before the king the counts legs were untied and he stood up his face very pale indeed the king began to address him in vigorous taurihessian the count wiltedhis head hung forwardand finally he fell on his knees a picture of misery and fright the king touched him contemptuously with his foot and said a few more words the count got up again and said ai ai ai eagerly which jack knew to mean yes yes yes hes going to show us the way out said bill good thing too i seem to hear a tremendous noise starting up somewhere in the distance no doubt our friends the sentries have brought all their buddies alongand have discovered the unbolted door and the empty room tell the count to get a move on ronnie with his arms still tied behind him the count stumbled out of the little bare room he led them to a door opposite and kicked it open a small stairway led downwards ill go first said ronnie and nipped in front of the count the steps led down to a little panelled room rather like a small study the count said a few words nodding his head at a panel ronnie stepped forward and slid the panel downwards a hole just big enough for a man to squeeze through was now showing nothing could be seen the other side because something was hanging over it tapestry hangings said bill and knocked his hand against it well wellnice lot of hideyholes and secrets youve got here count very nice indeed what do we do next get behind this tapestry he says its tapestry hanging in one of the bedrooms said ronnie if we make our way behind it a bit well come to an opening here goes he went through the hole and made his way behind endless tapestry that hung loose from ceiling to floor at last he came to where as the count had said there was an opening it was where two different pieces of tapestry met ronnie poked his way between them and found himself in a bedroom he saw beautiful furniture and carpets as he flashed his torch round the room was quite empty the others came out into the room too having made their way behind the tapestry jack sneezed because it was full of dust kiki promptly sneezed too much to the counts amazement he had not met kiki before now where said ronnie digging his revolver into the counts ribs quite suddenly the man gave a startled jump and almost fell over in fright i hardly think that poke in the ribs was necessary said bill with a grin no not necessarybut awfully good for a nasty little doublecrosser like him said ronnie people who threaten others with this that and the other when they are in power deserve a bit of a fright from my gun now then countthe quickest and best way out please this last was said in taurihessian and the count replied at once his words tumbling over one another in his desire to please this fierce englishman its easy now said ronnie we apparently go down the back stairs into the deserted kitchen quarters and just let ourselves out of the back door nothing could be simpler so down the back stairs they went and into a vast kitchen three cats were there their eyes gleaming in the light of bills torch kiki yapped like a small dog and the cats fled into corners at once kiki said jack with a laugh youre irrepressible kiki tried to repeat the word and couldnt bill was now unlocking the great back door they all went out into a big yard then down to the castle gate a massive wroughtiron affair whose keys hung most conveniently at the side bill unlocked the gate and out they went finding themselves in the main street of borken nowwhere is the place we left the van wondered bill jack could you take ronnie to it ronnie well wait here for you jack sped off with ronnie he had been in the town several times and knew the way he and ronnie were soon in the field where they had left the van and ronnie started it up at once it was not long before the van drew up beside the other three in the dark highway they got in bill was behind with the count and jack the king went in front with ronnie it was queer to sit in the back with all kinds of goods rattling on the shelves the count however took no notice he was feeling extremely gloomy i saywhere are we going this isnt the way back to the circus camp said jack suddenly no i know said bill im afraid we must go straight to the capital town of taurihessia jackthe king needs to be there at the earliest possible moment things are in a great turmoil you seenobody knows what is going to happenno kingno princethe count apparently trying to take things overthe prime minister a weak tool yes i see said jack but as soon as the king appears everything will be all right wont it it will certainly be all right after he has appeared to his people and spoken to them said bill he will have quite a lot of interesting things to tell them i think too it is essential that gussy should appear alsoso that the people will be sure that he and his uncle are on good terms and back each other up oh gussy will love that said jack do we go back to get him we do said bill and we also get the others im sure the king will want to see gussys fellowprisoners he has a lot to hear about you know the king certainly wanted to meet all the others when he heard the amazing story that bill had to tell him it was all told when they reached the palace then after a delighted and amazed welcome from a few servants on duty the king retired to a little room with bill ronnie and jack the count was sent off in disgrace with four soldiers in front of him and four behind left right left right shouted kiki after him god save the king it was still dark for the sun was not due to rise for another hour jack suddenly yawned he really couldnt help it youd better have a snooze said bill the king is sending his state car to fetch the others first tiling in the morning he will lend you some of gussys clothes he says if you want to look decent the others are being sent clothes too especially of course gussy he couldnt possibly appear in his girls things this is going to be fun from now on said jack trying to keep awake oh gosh im sleepy what are you going to do bill have a sleep too no im going to get in touch with your aunt by radio said bill and tell her youre all safe ill get her to fly out tomorrow and well all be together again jack fell on to a sofa feeling that he couldnt keep awake one moment longer good old bill he said everything comes right when youre here goodmorningi mean goodnight and in half a second more he was fast asleep what a night he had had chapter god save the king jack awoke to find a pretty taurihessian maid bringing him a most magnificent breakfast somebody had undressed him put silk pyjamas on him and popped him into a luxurious bed he was amazed to think they did all that and i never woke up he thought i must have been tired goshwhat a breakfast kiki look herethe biggest juiciest grapefruit i ever did see in my lifeand two halves not one you can have one for yourself if you dont make too much mess kiki approved of the grapefruit she settled down to it and for once in a way didnt say a word jack ate every scrap of the generous breakfast and then lay back thinking over the happenings of the night before i bet the count isnt eating a breakfast like this he told kiki what do you think the doctors got a cold fetch the king said kiki looking to see if jack had left any of his grapefruit one two howdoyoudo buckle my shoe you mean said jack i saylook do you suppose those princely clothes are for me to put on kiki old bird goodness the taurihessians wont know if im the prince or gussy bill came in looking much smartened up oh youre awake at last he said my word you dont mean to say you ate all that breakfast kiki helped me said jack with a grin have the others been sent for yet bill yes id like to see their faces when the kings state car rolls up complete with clothes for them all said bill the kings a great sport hes asked pedro toni bingo and old ma tooand sent clothes for them all goodness said jack old ma shell have the time of her life but if it hadnt been for her looking after gussy hed certainly have been caught i saythis is going to be quite a party isnt it oh quite said bill and your aunt is arriving today too its just like a pantomime ending said jack delighted everyone on the stage at the end youd better get up said bill the king is making his speech to the people at twelve oclock and its now eleven after that there is to be a really splendid luncheon laid onand youll be sorry you ate so much breakfast i can tell you jack leapt out of bed is it really eleven oclock gosh ill never be ready i dont know how to put all these clothes onbucklessashesrufflesgood gracious is it fancy dress no ordinary taurihessian festival wear said bill i dont feel able to cope with it myself nor does ronnie we feel a bit more english in our own things but you and the others will look fine jack was ready at a quarter to twelve he looked at himself in the glass graciousim like a pantomime prince i really must have my photograph taken to show the boys at schooltheyll laugh their heads off there came the sound of cheering in the street below jack opened his window and looked out a very grand state car was being driven slowly up the street followed by yet another the people were cheering each one as it went by jack nearly fell out of the window and kiki gave a loud screech look kikido you see whos in the first car cried jack lucyann philip gussy and dinah did you ever see anyone looking so grand and look in the second carpedromatoni and bingo they look as fine as if they were just going to perform in the circus ring so they did ma especially looked magnificent and she had a sudden unexpected dignity that made pedro look at her with surprise and great pride his mother old ma riding in a state car wearing silk clothes right down to her skin pedro couldnt believe it he looked very grand himself and enjoyed it he knew that nothing like this would ever happen to him again in his life and he meant to enjoy every moment of it toni and bingo looked grand but subdued they were not in the least nervous when they went into the circus ringbut they couldnt help feeling nervous nowall this cheering and shouting when they werent even performing the cars turned in at the gates and jack leaned out of the window and yelled quite forgetting that he was in a kings palace lucyann im up here kiki squawked too hiphiphiphiphurrah send for the doctor twelve oclock came the king went out on the balcony of his palace to show himself to his people and to make a speech to explain all that had happened there was dead silence as the loudspeakers relayed the simple vigorous speech bill thought that taurihessia had a very fine king he was glad that the count had not dethroned him and put gussy up as king himself gussy was just a silly little boy at presentbut perhaps when he had learnt all that the british people had to teach him at lessons and at games he would make as fine a king as his uncle gussy had a tremendous reception when his uncle called him to his side and presented him to the people after all the scares of the last few days they needed to see not only the king but the little prince too gussy looked every inch a prince as he saluted stiffly and then bowed in every direction he wore magnificent clothes and his cloak blew out in the wind showing its scarlet lining jack grinned as he thought how gussy had looked when he had seen him lastdressed as a girl with his long hair tied up in bows poor gussy nobody must ever learn of that or he would be teased about it for the rest of his lifeand gussy did not like teasing the next thing was the luncheon the children had all been put at a table together with gussy and pedro as well ma toni and bingo were at a sidetable too very conscious of their fine clothes they put on fine manners to match and ate everything with knives forks or spoons instead of using only their fingers half the time as they usually did the six children talked eagerly together exchanging news fank is up and about again said philip thank goodness he is or i couldnt have come hallo snoozy do you want to join us at last hes seen those almonds dinahdo look at him holding one and nibbling it i dont like him on the table said dinah but she was much too happy to make a fuss she told jack of the excitement when the message came that they were all to dress in state clothes and be driven to the palace we just couldnt believe it she said tell us again about last night jack and how you rescued the king and caught the count gussy was tremendously excited his eyes sparkled and he talked nineteen to the dozen

tablenapkin and flew across the luncheonroom thinking of nothing but welcoming the person she loved so much aunt allie youve come mrs cunningham was being ushered into the great room by two servants who called out her name bill went to her at once and dinah philip and jack joined lucyann in her rush across the room this was all that was needed to make things perfect bills eyes were shining as he took his wife to introduce her to the king a place had been left for her on his other side for her aeroplane had been expected for the last half hour she was quite bewildered by everything for she knew only half the story of course gussy waited till the others had made enough fuss of her and then went up himself she held out her hand to him and he bowed over it and kissed it politely just as his uncle had done somehow it seemed right in taurihessiaquite a natural thing to do and none of the children even thought of laughing after the grand lunch the children went to see over the palace my
