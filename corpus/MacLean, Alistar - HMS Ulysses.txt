night wednesday night thursday night friday morning friday afternoon friday evening saturday saturday afternoon saturday evening i saturday evening ii saturday night sunday morning epilogue chapter one prelude sunday afternoon slowly deliberately starr crushed out the butt of his cigarette the gesture captain vallery thought held a curious air of decision and finality he knew what was coming next and just for a moment the sharp bitterness of defeat cut through that dull ache that never left his forehead nowadays but it was only for a moment he was too tired really far too tired to care im sorry gentlemen genuinely sorry starr smiled thinly not for the orders i assure you the admiralty decision i am personally convinced is the only correct and justifiable one in the circumstances but i do regret yourahinability to see our point of view he paused proffered his platinum cigarette case to the four men sitting with him round the table in the rearadmirals day cabin at the four mute headshakes the smile flickered again he selected a cigarette slid the case back into the breast pocket of his doublebreasted grey suit then he sat back in his chair the smile quite gone it was not difficult to visualise beneath that pinstripe sleeve the more accustomed broad band and golden stripes of viceadmiral vincent starr assistant director of naval operations when i flew north from london this morning he continued evenly i was annoyed i was very annoyed i am well i am a fairly busy man the first sea lord i thought was wasting my time as well as his own when i return i must apologise sir humphrey was right he usually is his voice trailed off to a murmur and the flintwheel of his lighter rasped through the strained silence he leaned forward on the table and went on softly let us be perfectly frank gentlemen i expected i surely had a right to expect every support and full cooperation from you in settling this unpleasant business with all speed unpleasant business he smiled wryly mincing words wont help mutiny gentlemen is the generally accepted term for it a capital offence i need hardly remind you and yet what do i find his glance travelled slowly round the table commissioned officers in his majestys navy including a flagofficer sympathising with if not actually condoning a lowerdeck mutiny hes overstating it vallery thought dully hes provoking us the words the tone were a question a challenge inviting reply there was no reply the four men seemed apathetic indifferent four men each an individual each secure in his own personality yet at that moment so strangely alike their faces heavy and still and deeply lined their eyes so quiet so tired so very old you are not convinced gentlemen he went on softly you find my choice of words a trifleahdisagreeable he leaned back hmmutiny he savoured the word slowly compressed his lips looked round the table again no it doesnt sound too good does it gentlemen you would call it something else again perhaps he shook his head bent forward smoothed out a signal sheet below his ringers returned from strike on lofotens he read out boom passed finished with engines provisions stores lighters alongside mixed seamanstoker party detailed unload lubricating drums reported to captain stokers refused to obey cpo hartley then successively chief stoker hendry lieutenant grierson and commander ringleaders apparently stokers riley and petersen refused to obey captain master at arms and regulating po assaulted in performance of duties he looked up what duties trying to arrest the ringleaders vallery nodded silently seaman branch stopped work apparently in sympathy no violence offered broadcast by captain warned of consequences ordered to return to work order disobeyed signal to cinc duke of cumberland for assistance starr lifted his head again looked coldly across at vallery why incidentally the signal to the admiral surely your own marines my orders tyndall interrupted bluntly turn our own marines against men theyve sailed with for two and half years out of the question theres no matelotbootneck antipathy on this ship admiral starr theyve been through far too much together anyway he added dryly its wholly possible that the marines would have refused and dont forget that if we had used our own men and they had quelled thisahmutiny the ulysses would have been finished as a fighting ship starr looked at him steadily dropped his eyes to the signal again marine boarding party from cumberland no resistance offered to boarding attempted to arrest six eight suspected ringleaders strong resistance by stokers and seamen heavy fighting poopdeck stokers messdeck and engineers flat till no firearms used but dead seriously injured minor casualties starr finished reading crumpled the paper in an almost savage gesture you know gentlemen i believe you have a point after all the voice was heavy with irony mutiny is hardly the term fifty dead and injured pitched battle would be much nearer the mark the words the tone the lashing bite of the voice provoked no reaction whatsoever the four men still sat motionless expressionless unheeding in a vast indifference admiral starrs face hardened im afraid you have things just a little out of focus gentlemen youve been up here a long time and isolation distorts perspective must i remind senior officers that in wartime individual feelings trials and sufferings are of no moment at all the navy the country they come first last and all the time he pounded the table softly the gesture insistent in its restrained urgency good god gentlemen he ground out the future of the world is at stake and you with your selfish your inexcusable absorption in your own petty affairs have the colossal effrontery to endanger it commander turner smiled sardonically to himself a pretty speech vincent boy very pretty indeed although perhaps a thought reminiscent of victorian melodrama the clenched teeth act was definitely overdone pity he didnt stand for parliament hed be a terrific asset to any government front bench suppose the old boys really too honest for that he thought in vague surprise the ringleaders will be caught and punished heavily punished the voice was harsh now with a biting edge to it meantime the th aircraft carrier squadron will rendezvous at denmark strait as arranged at wednesday instead of tuesday we radioed halifax and held up the sailing you will proceed to sea at tomorrow he looked across at rearadmiral tyndall you will please advise all ships under your command at once admiral tyndall universally known throughout the fleet as farmer giles said nothing his ruddy features usually so cheerful and crinkling were set and grim his gaze heavy lidded and troubled rested on captain vallery and he wondered just what kind of private hell that kindly and sensitive man was suffering right then but vallerys face haggard with fatigue told him nothing that lean and withdrawn asceticism was the complete foil tyndall swore bitterly to himself i dont really think theres more to say gentlemen starr went on smoothly i wont pretend youre in for an easy trip you know yourselves what happened to the last three major convoyspq fr and im afraid we havent yet found the answer to acoustic torpedoes and glider bombs further our intelligence in bremen and kiel and this is substantiated by recent experience in the atlantic report that the latest uboat policy is to get the escorts first maybe the weather will save you you vindictive old devil tyndall thought dispassionately go on damn you enjoy yourself at the risk of seeming rather victorian and melodramatic impatiently starr waited for turner to stifle his sudden fit of coughing we may say that the ulysses is being given the opportunity ofahredeeming herself he pushed back his chair after that gentlemen the med but first fr to murmansk come hell or high water his voice broke on the last word and lifted into stridency the anger burring through the thin veneer of suavity the ulysses must be made to realise that the navy will never tolerate disobedience of orders dereliction of duty organised revolt and sedition rubbish starr jerked back in his chair knuckles whitening on the armrest his glance whipped round and settled on surgeoncommander brooks on the unusually vivid blue eyes so strangely hostile now under that magnificent silver mane tyndall too saw the angry eyes he saw also the deepening colour in brookss face and moaned softly to himself he knew the signs too well old socrates was about to blow his irish top tyndall made to speak then slumped back at a sharp gesture from starr what did you say commander the admirals voice was very soft and quite toneless rubbish repeated brooks distinctly rubbish thats what i said lets be perfectly frank you say well sir im being frank dereliction of duty organised revolt and sedition my foot but i suppose you have to call it something preferably something well within your own field of experience but god only knows by what strange association and sleightofhand mental transfer you equate yesterdays trouble aboard the ulysses with the only clearly cut code of behaviour thoroughly familiar to yourself brooks paused for a second in the silence they heard the thin high wail of a bosuns pipe a passing ship perhaps tell me admiral starr he went on quietly are we to drive out the devils of madness by whipping a quaint old medieval custom or maybe sir by drowning remember the gadarene swine or perhaps a month or two in cells you think is the best cure for tuberculosis what in heavens name are you talking about brooks starr demanded angrily gadarene swine tuberculosis what are you getting at man go on explain he drummed his fingers impatiently on the table eyebrows arched high into his furrowed brow i hope brooks he went on silkily that you can justify thisahinsolence of yours im quite sure that commander brooks intended no insolence sir it was captain vallery speaking for the first time hes only expressing please captain vallery starr interrupted i am quite capable of judging these things for myself i think his smile was very tight well go on brooks commander brooks looked at him soberly speculatively justify myself he smiled wearily no sir i dont think i can the slight inflection of tone the implications were not lost on starr and he flushed slightly but ill try to explain continued brooks it may do some good he sat in silence for a few seconds elbow on the table his hand running through the heavy silver hair a favourite mannerism of his then he looked up abruptly when were you last at sea admiral starr he inquired last at sea starr frowned heavily what the devil has that got to do with you brooks or with the subject under discussion he asked harshly a very great deal brooks retorted would you please answer my question admiral i think you know quite well brooks starr replied evenly that ive been at naval operations hq in london since the outbreak of war what are you implying sir nothing your personal integrity and courage are not open to question we all know that i was merely establishing a fact brooks hitched himself forward in his chair im a naval doctor admiral starr ive been a doctor for over thirty years now he smiled faintly maybe im not a very good doctor perhaps i dont keep quite so abreast of the latest medical developments as i might but i believe i can claim to know a great deal about human nature this is no time for modesty about how the mind works about the wonderfully intricate interaction of mind and body isolation distorts perspective these were your words admiral starr isolation implies a cutting off a detachment from the world and your implication was partly true but and this sir is the point there are more worlds than one the northern seas the arctic the blackout route to russia these are another world a world utterly distinct from yours it is a world sir of which you cannot possibly have any conception in effect you are completely isolated from our world starr grunted whether in anger or derision it was difficult to say and cleared his throat to speak but brooks went on swiftly conditions obtain there without either precedent or parallel in the history of war the russian convoys sir are something entirely new and quite unique in the experience of mankind he broke off suddenly and gazed out through the thick glass of the scuttle at the sleet slanting heavily across the grey waters and dun hills of the scapa anchorage no one spoke the surgeoncommander was not finished yet a tired man takes time to marshal his thoughts mankind of course can and does adapt itself to new conditions brooks spoke quietly almost to himself biologically and physically they have had to do so down the ages in order to survive but it takes time gentlemen a great deal of time you cant compress the natural changes of twenty centuries into a couple of years neither mind nor body can stand it you can try of course and such is the fantastic resilience and toughness of man that he can tolerate it for extremely short periods but the limit the saturation capacity for adaption is soon reached push men beyond that limit and anything can happen i say anything advisedly because we dont yet know the precise form the crackup will take but crackup there always is it may be physical mental spiritual i dont know but this i do know admiral starr the crew of the ulysses has been pushed to the limit and clear beyond very interesting commander starrs voice was dry sceptical very interesting indeed and most instructive unfortunately your theory and its only that of course is quite untenable brooks eyed him steadily that sir is not even a matter of opinion nonsense man nonsense starrs face was hard in anger its a matter of fact your premises are completely false starr leaned forward his forefinger punctuating every word this vast gulf you claim to lie between the convoys to russia and normal operational work at sea it just doesnt exist can you point out any one factor or condition present in these northern waters which is not to be found somewhere else in the world can you commander brooks no sir brooks was quite unruffled but i can point out a frequently overlooked fact that differences of degree and association can be much greater and have far more farreaching effects than differences in kind let me explain what i mean fear can destroy a man lets admit it fear is a natural thing you get it in every theatre of war but nowhere i suggest so intense so continual as in the arctic convoys suspense tension can break a man any man ive seen it happen too often far far too often and when youre keyed up to snapping point sometimes for seventeen days on end when you have constant daily reminders of what may happen to you in the shape of broken sinking ships and broken drowning bodies well were men not machines something has to go and does the admiral will not be unaware that after the last two trips we shipped nineteen officers and men to sanatoria mental sanatoria brooks was on his feet now his broad strong fingers splayed over the polished table surface his eyes boring into starrs hunger burns out a mans vitality admiral starr it saps his strength slows his reactions destroys the will to fight even the will to survive you are surprised admiral starr hunger you think surely thats impossible in the well provided ships of today but its not impossible admiral starr its inevitable you keep on sending us out when the russian seasons over when the nights are barely longer than the days when twenty hours out of the twentyfour are spent on watch or at action stations and you expect us to feed well he smashed the flat of his hand on the table how the hell can we when the cooks spend nearly all their time in the magazines serving the turrets or in damage control parties only the baker and butcher are excused and so we live on cornedbeef sandwiches for weeks on end cornedbeef sandwiches surgeoncommander brooks almost spat in disgust good old socrates thought turner happily give him hell tyndall too was nodding his ponderous approval only vallery was uncomfortable not because of what brooks was saying but because brooks was saying it he vallery was the captain the coals of fire were being heaped on the wrong head fear suspense hunger brookss voice was very low now these are the things that break a man that destroy him as surely as fire or steel or pestilence could these are the killers but they are nothing admiral starr just nothing at all they are only the henchmen the outriders you might call them of the three horsemen of the apocalypse cold lack of sleep exhaustion do you know what its like up there between jan mayen and bear island on a february night admiral starr of course you dont do you know what its like when theres sixty degrees of frost in the arctic and it still doesnt freeze do you know what its like when the wind twenty degrees below zero comes screaming off the polar and greenland icecaps and slices through the thickest clothing like a scalpel when theres five hundred tons of ice on the deck where five minutes direct exposure means frostbite where the bows crash down into a trough and the spray hits you as solid ice where even a torch battery dies out in the intense cold do you admiral starr do you brooks flung the words at him hammered them at him and do you know what its like to go for days on end without sleep for weeks with only two or three hours out of the twentyfour do you know the sensation admiral starr that finedrawn feeling with every nerve in your body and cell in your brain stretched taut to breaking point pushing you over the screaming edge of madness do you know it admiral starr its the most exquisite agony in the world and youd sell your friends your family your hopes of immortality for the blessed privilege of closing your eyes and just letting go and then theres the tiredness admiral starr the desperate weariness that never leaves you partly its the debilitating effect of the cold partly lack of sleep partly the result of incessantly bad weather you know yourself how exhausting it can be to brace yourself even for a few hours on a rolling pitching deck our boys have been doing it for months gales are routine on the arctic run i can show you a dozen two dozen old men not one of them a day over twenty brooks pushed back his chair and paced restlessly across the cabin tyndall and turner glanced at each other then over at vallery who sat with head and shoulders bowed eyes resting vacantly on his clasped hands on the table for the moment starr might not have existed its a vicious murderous circle brooks went on quickly he was leaning against the bulkhead now hands deep in his pockets gazing out sightlessly through the misted scuttle the less sleep you have the tireder you are the more tired you become the more you feel the cold and so it goes on and then all the time theres the hunger and the terrific tension everything interacts with everything else each single factor conspires with the others to crush a man break him physically and mentally and lay him wide open to disease yes admiral disease he smiled into starrs face and there was no laughter in his smile pack men together like herring in a barrel deprive em of every last ounce of resistance batten em below decks for days at a time and what do you get tb its inevitable he shrugged sure ive only isolated a few cases so far but i know that active pulmonary tb is rife in the lower deck i saw the breakup coming months ago he lifted his shoulders wearily i warned the fleet surgeon several times i wrote the admiralty twice they were sympathetic and thats all shortage of ships shortage of men the last hundred days did it sir on top of the previous months a hundred days of pure bloody hell and not a single hours shore leave in port only twice for ammunitioning all oil and provisions from the carriers at sea and every day an eternity of cold and hunger and danger and suffering in the name of god brooks cried were not machines he levered himself off the wall and walked over to starr hands still thrust deep in his pockets i hate to say this in front of the captain but every officer in the ship except captain vallery knows that die men would have mutinied as you call it long ago but for one thing captain vallery the intense personal loyalty of the crew to the captain the devotion almost to the other side of idolatry is something quite unique in my experience admiral starr tyndall and turned both murmured approval vallery still sat motionless but there was a limit even to that it had to come and now you talk of punishing imprisoning these men good god above you might as well hang a man for having leprosy or send him to penal servitude for developing ulcers brooks shook his head in despair our crew are equally guiltless they just couldnt help it they cant see right from wrong any more they cant think straight they just want a rest they just want peace a few days blessed quiet theyll give anything in the world for these things and they cant see beyond them cant you see that admiral starr cant you cant you for perhaps thirty seconds there was silence complete utter silence in the admirals cabin the high thin whine of the wind the swish of the hail seemed unnaturally loud then starr was on his feet his hands stretching out for his gloves vallery looked up for the first time and he knew that brooks had failed have my barge alongside captain vallery at once please starr was detached quite emotionless complete oiling provisioning and ammunitioning as soon as possible admiral tyndall i wish you and your squadron a successful voyage as for you commander brooks i quite see the point of your argument at least as far as you are concerned his lips parted in a bleak wintry smile you are quite obviously overwrought badly in need of some leave your relief will be aboard before midnight if you will come with me captain he turned to the door and had taken only two steps when vallerys voice stopped him dead poised on one foot one moment sir if you please starr swung round captain vallery had made no move to rise he sat still smiling it was a smile compounded of deference of understanding and of a curious inflexibility it made starr feel vaguely uncomfortable surgeoncommander brooks vallery said precisely is a quite exceptional officer he is invaluable virtually irreplaceable and the ulysses needs him badly i wish to retain his services ive made my decision captain starr snapped and its final you know i think the powers invested in me by the admiralty for this investigation quite sir vallery was quiet unmoved i repeat however that we cannot afford to lose an officer of brookss calibre the words the tone were polite respectful but their significance was unmistakable brooks stepped forward distress in his face but before he could speak turner cut in smoothly urbanely i assume i wasnt invited to this conference for purely decorative purposes he tilted back in his chair his eyes fixed dreamily on the deckhead i feel its time i said something i unreservedly endorse old brookss remarks every word of them starr white mouthed and motionless looked at tyndall and you admiral tyndall looked up quizzically all the tenseness and worry gone from his face he looked more like a west country farmer giles than ever he supposed wryly that his career was at stake funny he thought how suddenly unimportant a career could become as officer commanding maximum squadron efficiency is my sole concern some people are irreplaceable captain vallery suggests brooks is one of these i agree i see gentlemen i see starr said heavily two spots of colour burned high up on his cheekbones the convoy has sailed from halifax and my hands are tied but you make a great mistake gentlemen a great mistake in pointing pistols at the head of the admiralty we have long memories in whitehall we shallahdiscuss the matter at length on your return goodday gentlemen goodday shivering in the sudden chill brooks clumped down the ladder to the upper deck and turned forard past the galley into the sick bay johnson the leading sick bay attendant looked out from the dispensary how are our sick and suffering johnson brooks inquired bearing up manfully johnson surveyed the eight beds and their occupants morosely just a lot of bloody chancers sir half of them are a damned sight fitter than i am look at stoker riley there him with the broken finger and whacking great pile of readers digests going through all the medical articles he is and roaring out for sulpha penicillin and all the latest antibiotics cant pronounce half of them thinks hes dying a grievous loss the surgeoncommander murmured he shook his head what commander dodson sees in him i dont knowwhats the latest from hospital the expression drained out of johnsons face theyre just off the blower sir he said woodenly five minutes ago ordinary seaman ralston died at three oclock brooks nodded heavily sending that broken boy to hospital had only been a gesture anyway just for a moment he felt tired beaten old socrates they called him and he was beginning to feel his age these days and a bit more besides maybe a good nights sleep would help but he doubted it he sighed dont feel too good about all this johnson do you eighteen sir exactly eighteen johnsons voice was low bitter ive just been talking to burgess thats him in the next bed says ralston steps out across the bathroom coaming a towel over his arm a mob rushes past then this bloody great ape of a bootneck comes tearing up and bashes him over the skull with his rifle never knew what hit him sir and he never knew why brooks smiled faintly thats what they callahseditious talk johnson he said mildly sorry sir suppose i shouldnt its just that i never mind johnson i asked for it cant stop anyone from thinking only dont think out loud its its prejudicial to naval discipline i think your friend riley wants you better get him a dictionary he turned and pushed his way through the surgery curtains a dark head all that could be seen behind the dentists chair twisted round johnny nicholls acting surgeon lieutenant rose quickly to his feet a pile of report cards dangling from his left hand hallo sir have a pew brooks grinned an excellent thing lieutenant nicholls truly gratifying to meet these days a junior officer who knows his place thank you thank you he climbed into the chair and sank back with a groan fiddling with the neckrest if youll just adjust the footrest my boy so ah thank you he leaned back luxuriously eyes closed head far back on the rest and groaned again im an old man johnny my boy just an ancient has been nonsense sir nicholls said briskly just a slight malaise now if youll let me prescribe a suitable tonic he turned to a cupboard fished out two toothglasses and a darkgreen ribbed bottle marked poison he filled the glasses and handed one to brooks my personal recommendation good health ski brooks looked at the amber liquid then at nicholls heathenish practices they taught you at these scottish universities my boy admirable fellers some of these old heathens what is it this time johnny firstclass stuff nicholls grinned produce of the island of coll the old surgeon looked at him suspiciously didnt know they had any distilleries up there they havent i only said it was made in coll how did things go up top sir bloody awful his nibs threatened to string us all from the yardarm took a special dislike to me said i was to be booted off the ship instanter meant it too you nichollss brown eyes deepsunk just now and redrimmed from sleeplessness opened wide youre joking sir of course im not but its all right im not going old giles the skipper and turner the crazy idiots virtually told starr that if i went hed better start looking around for another admiral captain and commander as well they shouldnt have done it of course but it shook old vincent to the core departed in high dudgeon muttering veiled threats not so veiled either come to think of it damned old fool said nicholls feelingly hes not really johnny actually hes a brilliant bloke you dont become a dno for nothing master strategist and tactician giles tells me and hes not really as bad as were apt to paint him to a certain extent we cant blame old vincent for sending us out again blokes up against an insoluble problem limited resources at his disposal terrific demands for ships and men in half a dozen other theatres impossible to meet half the claims made on him half the time hes operating on little better than a shoestring but hes still an inhuman impersonal sort of cussdoesnt understand men and the upshot of it all murmansk again sailing at tomorrow what again this bunch of walking zombies nicholls was openly incredulous why they cant do that sir they they just cant theyre doing it anyway my boy the ulysses mustahredeem itself brooks opened his eyes gad the very thought appals me if theres any of that poison left my boy nicholls shoved the depleted bottle back into the cupboard and jerked a resentful thumb in the direction of the massive battleship clearly visible through the porthole swinging round her anchor three or four cablelengths away why always us sir its always us why dont they send that useless floating barracks out once in a while swinging round that bloody great anchor month in month out just the point brooks interrupted solemnly according to the kapok kid the tremendous weight of empty condensed milk cans and herringintomato sauce tins accumulated on the ocean bed over the past twelve months completely defeats all attempts to weigh anchor nicholls didnt seem to hear him week in week out months and months on end they send the ulysses out they change the carriers they rest the screen destroyers but never the ulysses theres no letup never not once but the duke of cumberland all its fit for is sending hulking great brutes of marines on board here to massacre sick men crippled men men whove done more in a week than easy boy easy the commander chided you cant call three dead men and the bunch of wounded heroes lying outside there a massacre the marines were only doing their job as for the cumberland well youve got to face it were the only ship in the home fleet equipped for carrier command nicholls drained his glass and regarded his superior officer moodily there are times sir when i positively love the germans you and johnson should get together sometime brooks advised old starr would have you both clapped in irons for spreading alarm and hallo hallo he straightened up in his chair and leaned forward observe the old duke there johnny yards of washing going up from the flagdeck and matelots running actually runningup to the focsle head unmistakable signs of activity by gad this is uncommon surprising what dye make of it boy probably learned that theyre going on leave nicholls growled nothing else could possibly make that bunch move so fast and who are we to grudge them the just rewards for their labours after so long so arduous so dangerous a spell of duty in northern waters the first shrill blast of a bugle killed the rest of the sentence instinctively their eyes swung round on the crackling humming loudspeaker then on each other in sheer shocked disbelief and then they were on their feet tense expectant the heartstopping urgency of the buglecall to action stations never grows dim oh my god no brooks moaned oh no no i not again not in scapa flow oh god no not again not in scapa flow these were the words in the mouths the minds the hearts of exhausted sleephaunted bitter men that bleak winter evening in scapa flow that they thought of and that only could they think of as the scream of the bugle stopped dead all work on decks and below decks in enginerooms and boilerrooms on ammunition lighters and fuel tenders in the galleys and in the offices and that only could the watch below think of and that with an even more poignant despair as the strident blare seared through the bliss of oblivion and brought them back sick at heart dazed in mind and stumbling on their feet to the iron harshness of reality it was in a strangely indefinite way a moment of decision it was the moment that could have broken the ulysses as a fighting ship for ever it was the moment that bitter exhausted men relaxed in the comparative safety of a landlocked anchorage could have chosen to make the inevitable stand against authority against that wordless mindless compulsion and merciless insistence which was surely destroying them if ever there was such a moment this was it the moment came and passed it was no more than a fleeting shadow a shadow that flitted lightly across mens minds and was gone lost in the rush of feet pounding to action stations perhaps selfpreservation was the reason but that was unlikely the ulysses had long since ceased to care perhaps it was just naval discipline or loyalty to the captain or what the psychologists call conditioned reflex you hear the scream of brakes and you immediately jump for your life or perhaps it was something else again whatever it was the ship all except the port watch anchor party was closed up in two minutes unanimous in their disbelief that this could be happening to them in scapa flow men went to their stations silently or vociferously according to their nature they went reluctantly sullenly resentfully despairingly but they went rearadmiral tyndall went also he was not one of those who went silently he climbed blasphemously up to the bridge pushed his way through the port gate and clambered into his highlegged armchair in the forard port corner of the compass platform he looked at vallery whats the flap in heavens name captain he demanded testily everything seems singularly peaceful to me dont know yet sir vallery swept worried eyes over the anchorage alarm signal from cinc with orders to get under way immediately get under way but why man why vallery shook his head tyndall groaned its all a conspiracy designed to rob old men like myself of their afternoon sleep he declared more likely a brainwave of starrs to shake us up a bit turner grunted no tyndall was decisive he wouldnt try that wouldnt dare besides by his lights hes not a vindictive man silence fell a silence broken only by the patter of sleet and hail and the weird haunting pinging of the asdic vallery suddenly lifted his binoculars good lord sir look at that the dukes slipped her anchor there was no doubt about it the shacklepin had been knocked out and the bows of the great ship were swinging slowly round as it got under way what in the world tyndall broke off and scanned the sky not a plane not a paratrooper in sight no radar reports no asdic contacts no sign of the german grand fleet steaming through the boom shes signalling us sir it was bentley speaking bentley the chief yeoman of signals he paused and went on slowly proceed to our anchorage at once make fast to north buoy ask them to confirm vallery snapped he took the focsle phone from the communication rating captain here number one how is she up and down good he turned to the officer of the watch slow ahead both starboard he looked over at tyndalls corner brows wrinkled in question search me tyndall growled could be the latest in parlour games a sort of nautical musical chairs you know wait a minute though look the cumberland all her s are at maximum depression vallerys eyes met his no it cant be good god do you think the blare of the asdic loudspeaker from the cabinet immediately abaft of the bridge gave him his answer the voice of leading asdic operator chrysler was clear unhurried asdicbridge asdicbridge echo red repeat red strengthening closing the captains incredulity leapt and died in the same second alert director control red all aa guns maximum depression underwater target torps this to lieutenant marshall the canadian torpedo officer depth charge stations he turned back to tyndall it cant be sir it just cant a uboat i presume it is in scapa flow impossible prien didnt think so tyndall grunted prien kapitanleutnant priengent who scuppered the royal oak it couldnt happen again the new boom defences would keep out any normal submarines tyndall finished his voice dropped to a murmur remember what we were told last month about our midget twoman subs the chariots the ones to be taken over to norway by norwegian fishingboats operating from the shetlands could be that the germans have hit on the same idea could be vallery agreed he nodded sardonically just look at the cumberland go straight for the boom he paused for a few seconds his eyes speculative then looked back at tyndall how do you like it sir like what captain playing aunt sally at the fair vallery grinned crookedly cant afford to lose umpteen million pounds worth of capital ship so the old duke hares out to sea and safety while we moor near her anchor berth you can bet german naval intelligence has the bearing of her anchorage down to a couple of inches these midget subs carry detachable warheads and if theres going to be any fitted theyre going to be fitted to us tyndall looked at him his face was expressionless asdic reports were continuous reporting steady bearing to port and closing distances of course of course the admiral murmured were the whipping boy gad it makes me feel bad his mouth twisted and he laughed mirthlessly me this is the final straw for the crew that hellish last trip the mutiny the marine boarding party from the cumberland action stations in harbour and now this risking our necks for thatthat he broke off spluttering swore in anger then resumed quietly what are you going to tell the men captain good god its fantastic i feel like mutiny myself he stopped short looked inquiringly past vallerys shoulder the captain turned round yes marshall excuse me sir thiserecho he jerked a thumb over his shoulder a sub sir possibly a pretty small one the transatlantic accent was very heavy likely enough marshall why just how ralston and i figured it sir he grinned we have an idea for dealing with it vallery looked out through the driving sleet gave helm and engine orders then turned back to the torpedo officer he was coughing heavily painfully as he pointed to the glassed in anchorage chart if youre thinking of depthcharging our stern off in these shallow waters no sir doubt whether we could get a shallow enough setting anyway my idea ralstons to be correct is that we take out the motor boat and a few lb scuttling charges second fuses and chemical igniters not much of a kick from these i know but a miniature sub aint likely to have helluvaervery thick hulls and if the crews are sitting on top of the ruddy things instead of inside well its curtains for sure itll kipper em vallery smiled not bad at all marshall i think youve got the answer there what do you think sir worth trying anyway tyndall agreed better than waiting around like a sitting duck go ahead then torps vallery looked at him quizzically who are your explosives experts i figured on taking ralston just what i thought youre taking nobody laddie said vallery firmly cant afford to lose my torpedo officer marshall looked pained then shrugged resignedly the chief tgm and ralston hes the senior lto good men both right bentley detail a man to accompany them in the boat well signal asdic bearings from here have him take a portable aldis with him he dropped his voice marshall sir ralstons young brother died in hospital this afternoon he looked across at the leading torpedo operator a tall blond unsmiling figure dressed in faded blue overalls beneath his duffel does he know yet the torpedo officer stared at vallery then looked round slowly at the lto he swore softly bitterly fluently marshall vallerys voice was sharp imperative but marshall ignored him his face a mask oblivious alike to the reprimand in the captains voice and the lashing bite of the sleet no sir he stated at length he doesnt know but he did receive some news this morning croydon was pasted last week his mother and three sisters live there lived there it was a land mine sir there was nothing left he turned abruptly and left the bridge fifteen minutes later it was all over the starboard whaler and the motorboat on the port side hit the water with the ulysses still moving up to the mooring the whaler buoyjumper aboard made for the buoy while the motor boat slid off at a tangent four hundred yards away from the ship in obedience to the flickering instructions from the bridge ralston fished out a pair of pliers from his overalls and crimped the chemical fuse the gunners mate stared fixedly at his stopwatch on the count of twelve the scuttling charge went over the side three more at different settings followed it in close succession while the motorboat cruised in a tight circle the first three explosions lifted the stern and jarred the entire length of the boat viciouslyand that was all but with the fourth a great gout of air came gushing to the surface followed by a long stream of viscous bubbles as the turbulence subsided a thin slick of oil spread over a hundred square yards of sea men fallen out from action stations watched with expressionless faces as the motorboat made it back to the ulysses and hooked on to the falls just in time the hotchkiss steeringgear was badly twisted and she was taking in water fast under the counter the duke of cumberland was a smudge of smoke over a far headland cap in hand ralston sat down opposite the captain vallery looked at him for a long time in silence he wondered what to say how best to say it he hated to have to do this richard vallery also hated war he always had hated it and he cursed the day it had dragged him out of his comfortable retirement at least dragged was how he put it only tyndall knew that he had volunteered his services to the admiralty on st september and had had them gladly accepted but he hated war not because it interfered with his lifelong passion for music and literature on both of which he was a considerable authority not even because it was a perpetual affront to his asstheticism to his sense of tightness and fitness he hated it because he was a deeply religious man because it grieved him to see in mankind the wild beasts of the primeval jungle because he thought the cross of life was already burden enough without the gratuitous infliction of the mental and physical agony of war and above all because he saw war all too clearly as the wild and insensate folly it was as a madness of the mind that settled nothing proved nothing except the old old truth that god was on the side of the big battalions but some things he had to do and vallery had clearly seen that this war had to be his also and so he had come back to the service and had grown older as the bitter years passed older and frailer and more kindly and tolerant and understanding among naval captains indeed among men he was unique in his charity in his humility captain richard vallery walked alone it was a measure of the man s greatness that this thought never occurred to him he sighed all that troubled him just now was what he ought to say to ralston but it was ralston who spoke first its all right sir the voice was a level monotone the face very still i know the torpedo officer told me vallery cleared his throat words are useless ralston quite useless your young brother and your family at home all gone im sorry my boy terribly sorry about it all he looked up into the expressionless face and smiled wryly or maybe you think that these are all words you know something formal just a meaningless formula suddenly surprisingly ralston smiled briefly no sir i dont i can appreciate how you feel sir you see my father well hes a captain too he tells me he feels the same way vallery looked at him in astonishment your father ralston did you say yes sir vallery could have sworn to a flicker of amusement in the blue eyes so quiet so selfpossessed across the table in the merchant navy sir a tanker captain tons vallery said nothing ralston went on quietly and about billy sir my young brother its its just one of these things its nobodys fault but mine i asked to have him aboard here im to blame sironly me his lean brown hands were round the brim of his hat twisting it crushing it how much worse will it be when the shattering impact of the double blow wears off vallery wondered when the poor kid begins to think straight again look my boy i think you need a few days rest time to think things over god vallery thought what an inadequate what a futile thing to say pro is making out your travelling warrant just now you will start fourteen days leave as from tonight where is the warrant made out for sir the hat was crushed now crumpled between the hands croydon of course where else vallery stopped dead the enormity of the blunder had just hit him forgive me my boy what a damnably stupid thing to say dont send me away sir ralston pleaded quietly i know it sounds well it sounds corny selfpitying but the truth is ive nowhere to go i belong here on the ulysses i can do things all the tune im busyworking sleeping i dont have to talk about things i can do things the selfpossession was only the thinnest veneer taut and frangible with the quiet desperation immediately below i can get a chance to help pay em back ralston hurried on like crimping these fuses todayitwell it was a privilege it was more than thatit wasoh i dont know i cant find the words sir vallery knew he felt sad tired defenceless what could he offer this boy in place of this hate this very human consuming flame of revenge nothing he knew nothing that ralston wouldnt despise wouldnt laugh at this was not the time for pious platitudes he sighed again more heavily this time of course you shall remain ralston go down to the police office and tell them to tear up your warrant if i can be of any help to you at any time i understand sir thank you very much good night sir good night my boy the door closed softly behind him chapter two monday morning close all watertight doors and scuttles hands to stations for leaving harbour impersonally inexorably the metallic voice of the broadcast system reached into every farthest corner of the ship and from every corner of the ship men came in answer to the call they were cold men shivering involuntarily in the icy north wind sweating pungently as the heavy falling snow drifted under collars and cuffs as numbed hands stuck to frozen ropes and metal they were tired men for fuelling provisioning and ammunitioning had gone on far into the middle watch few had had more than three hours sleep and they were still angry hostile men orders were obeyed to be sure with the mechanical efficiency of a highly trained ships company but obedience was surly acquiescence resentful and insolence lay ever close beneath the surface but divisional officers and ncos handled the men with velvet gloves vallery had been emphatic about that illogically enough the highest pitch of resentment had not been caused by the cumberlands prudent withdrawal it had been produced the previous evening by the routine broadcast mail will close at tonight mail those who werent working nonstop round the clock were sleeping like the dead with neither the heart nor the will even to think of writing leading seaman doyle the doyen of b messdeck and a venerable threebadger had summed up the matter succinctly if my old missus was helen of troy and jane russell rolled into one and all you blokes wot have seen the old dears photo know that the very ideas a shocking libel on either of them ladies i still wouldnt send her even a bleedin postcard you gotta draw a line somewhere me for my scratcher whereupon he had dragged his hammock from the rack slung it with millimetric accuracy beneath a hotair louvre seniority carries its privileges and was asleep in two minutes to a man the port watch did likewise the mail bag had gone ashore almost empty at exactly to the minute the ulysses slipped her moorings and steamed slowly towards the boom in the grey halflight under leaden lowering clouds she slid across the anchorage like an insubstantial ghost more often than not halfhidden from view under sudden heavy flurries of snow even in the relatively clear spells she was difficult to locate she lacked solidity substance definition of outline she had a curious air of impennanence of volatility an illusion of course but an illusion that accorded well with a legend for a legend the ulysses had become in her own brief lifetime she was known and cherished by merchant seamen by the men who sailed the bitter seas of the north from st johns to archangel from the shetlands to jan mayen from greenland to far reaches of spitsbergen remote on the edge of the world where there was danger where there was death there you might look to find the ulysses materialising wraithlike from a fogbank or just miraculously being there when the bleak twilight of an arctic dawn brought with it only the threat at times almost the certainty of never seeing the next a ghostship almost a legend the ulysses was also a young ship but she had grown old in the russian convoys hub and on the arctic patrols she had been there from the beginning and had known no other life at first she had operated alone escorting single ships or groups of two or three later she had operated with corvettes and frigates and now she never moved without her squadron the th escort carrier group but the ulysses had never really sailed alone death had been still was her constant companion he laid his ringer on a tanker and there was the erupting hell of a highoctane detonation on a cargo liner and she went to the bottom with her load of war supplies her back broken by a german torpedo on a destroyer and she knifed her way into the greyblack depths of the barents sea her still racing engines her own executioners on a uboat and she surfaced violently to be destroyed by gunfire or slid down gently to the bottom of the sea the dazed shocked crew hoping for a cracked pressure hull and merciful instant extinction dreading the endless gasping agony of suffocation in their iron tomb on the ocean floor where the ulysses went there also went death but death never touched her she was a lucky ship a lucky ship and a ghost ship and the arctic was her home illusion of course this ghostliness but a calculated illusion the ulysses was designed specifically for one task for one ocean and the camouflage experts had done a marvellous job the special arctic camouflage the broken slanting diagonals of grey and white and washed out blues merged beautifully imperceptibly into the infinite shades of grey and white the cold bleak grimness of the barren northern seas and the camouflage was only the outward the superficial indication of her fitness for the north technically the ulysses was a light cruiser she was the only one of her kind a ton modification of the famous dido type a forerunner of the black prince class five hundred and ten feet long narrow in her fiftyfoot beam with a raked stem square cruiser stern and long focsle deck extending well abaft the bridge a distance of over two hundred feet she looked and was a lean fast and compact warship dangerous and durable locate engage destroy these are the classic requirements of a naval ship in wartime and to do each and to do it with maximum speed and efficiency the ulysses was superbly equipped location for instance the human element of course was indispensable and vallery was far too experienced and battlewise a captain to underestimate the value of the unceasing vigil of lookouts and signalmen the human eye was not subject to blackouts technical hitches or mechanical breakdowns radio reports too had their place and asdic of course was the only defence against submarines but the ulyssess greatest strength in location lay elsewhere she was the first completely equipped radar ship in the world night and day the radar scanners atop the fore and main tripod masts swept ceaselessly in a arc combing the far horizons searching searching below in the radar rooms eight in all and in the fighter direction rooms trained eyes alive to the slightest abnormality never left the glowing screens the radars efficiency and range were alike fantastic the makers optimistically as they had thought had claimed a mile operating range for their equipment on the ulyssess first trials after her refit for its installation the radar had located a condor subsequently destroyed by a blenheim at a range of eightyfive miles engage that was the next step sometimes the enemy came to you more often you had to go after him and then one thing alone mattered speed the ulysses was tremendously fast quadruple screws powered by four great parsons singlereduction geared turbines two in the forard two in the after engineroom developed an unbelievable horsepower that many a battleship by no means obsolete could not match officially she was rated at knots off arraa in her fullpower trials bows lifting out of the water stern dug in like a hydroplane vibrating in every clydebuilt rivet and with the tortured seething water boiling whitely ten feet above the level of the poopdeck she had covered the measured mile at an incredible knots the nautical equivalent of mph and the dude engineercommander dobson had smiled knowingly said he wasnt half trying and just wait till the abdiel or the manxman came along and hed show them something but as these famous minelaying cruisers were widely believed to be capable of knots the wardroom had merely sniffed professional jealousy and ignored him secretly they were as proud of the great engines as dobson himself locate engage and destroy destruction that was the be all the end all lay the enemy along the sights and destroy him the ulysses was well equipped for that also she had four twin gunturrets two forard two aft quickfiring and dualpurpose equally effective against surface targets and aircraft these were controlled from the director towers the main one forard just above and abaft of the bridge the auxiliary aft from these towers all essential data about bearing windspeed drift range own speed enemy speed respective angles of course were fed to the giant electronic computing tables in the transmitting station the fighting heart of the ship situated curiously enough in the very bowels of the ulysses deep below the waterline and thence automatically to the turrets as two simple factors elevation and training the turrets of course could also fight independently these were the main armament the remaining guns were purely aa the batteries of multiple pompoms firing twopounders in rapid succession not particularly accurate but producing a blanket curtain sufficient to daunt any enemy pilot and isolated clusters of twin oerlikons highprecision highvelocity weapons vicious and deadly in trained hands finally the ulysses carried her depthcharges and torpedoes charges only a negligible number compared to that carried by many corvettes and destroyers and the maximum number that could be dropped in one pattern was six but one depthcharge carries lethal pounds of amatol and the ulysses had destroyed two uboats during the preceding winter the inch torpedoes each with its pound warhead of tnt lay sleek and menacing in the triple tubes on the main deck one set on either side of the after funnel these had not yet been blooded this then was the ulysses the complete the perfect fighting machine mans ultimate so far in his attempt to weld science and savagery into an instrument of destruction the perfect fighting machine but only so long as it was manned and serviced by a perfectly integrating smoothly functioning team a ship any ship can never be better than its crew and the crew of the ulysses was disintegrating breaking up the lid was clamped on the volcano but the rumblings never ceased the first signs of further trouble came within three hours of clearing harbour as always minesweepers swept the channel ahead of them but as always vallery left nothing to chance it was one of the reasons why he and the ulysses had survived thus far at he streamed paravanes the slender torpedoshaped bodies which angled out from the bows one on either side on special paravane wire in theory the wires connecting mines to their moorings on the floor of the sea were deflected away from the ship guided out to the paravanes themselves and severed by cutters the mines would then float to the top to be exploded or sunk by small arms at vallery ordered the paravanes to be recovered the ulysses slowed down the first lieutenant lieutenantcommander carrington went to the focsle to supervise operations seamen winch drivers and the subs in charge of either side closed up to their respective stations quickly the recovery booms were freed from their angled crutches just abaft the port and starboard lights swung out and rigged with recovery wires immediately the threeton winches on b gundeck took the strain smoothly powerfully the paravanes cleared the water then it happened it was ab ferrys fault that it happened and it was just illluck that the port winch was suspect operating on a power circuit with a defective breaker just illluck that ralston was the winch driver a taciturn bitter mouthed ralston to whom just then nothing mattered a damn least of all what he said and did but it was carslakes responsibility that the affair developed into what it did sublieutenant carslakes presence there on top of the carley floats directing the handling of the port wire represented the culmination of a series of mistakes a mistake on the part of his father rearadmiral rtd who had seen in his son a man of his own calibre had dragged him out of cambridge in at the advanced age of twentysix and practically forced him into the navy a weakness on the part of his first co a corvette captain who had known his father and recommended him as a candidate for a commission a rare error of judgment on the part of the selection board of the king alfred who had granted him his commission and a temporary lapse on the part of the commander who had assigned him to this duty in spite of carslakes known incompetence and inability to handle men he had the face of an overbred racehorse long lean and narrow with prominent pale blue eyes and protruding upper teeth below his scanty fair hair his eyebrows were arched in a perpetual question mark beneath the long pointed nose the supercilious curl of the upper lip formed the perfect complement to the eyebrows his speech was a shocking caricature of the kings english his short vowels were long his long ones interminable his grammar was frequently execrable he resented the navy he resented his long overdue promotion to lieutenant he resented the way the men resented him in brief sublieutenant carslake was the quintessence of the worst byproduct of the english public school system vain superior uncouth and illeducated he was a complete ass he was making an ass of himself now striving to maintain balance on the rafts feet dramatically braced at a wide angle he shouted unceasing unnecessary commands at his men cpo hartley groaned aloud but kept otherwise silent in the interests of discipline but ab ferry felt himself under no such restraints ark at his lordship he murmured to ralston all for the skippers benefit he nodded at where vallery was leaning over the bridge twenty feet above carslakes head impresses him no end so his nibs reckons just you forget about carslake and keep your eyes on that wire ralston advised and take these damned great gloves off one of these days yes yes i know ferry jeered the wires going to snag em and wrap me round the drum he fed in the hawser expertly dont you worry chum its never going to happen to me but it did it happened just then ralston watching the swinging paravane closely flicked a glance inboard he saw the broken strand inches from ferry saw it hook viciously into the gloved hand and drag him towards the spinning drum before ferry had a chance to cry out ralstons reaction was immediate the footbrake was only six inches away but that was too far savagely he spun the control wheel full ahead to full reverse in a split second simultaneously with ferrys cry of pain as his forearm crushed against the lip of the drum came a muffled explosion and clouds of acrid smoke from the winch as ј worth of electric motor burnt out in a searing flash immediately the wire began to run out again accelerating momentarily under the dead weight of the plunging paravane ferry went with it twenty feet from the winch the wire passed through a snatch block on the deck if ferry was lucky he might lose only his hand he was less than four feet away when ralstons foot stamped viciously on the brake the racing drum screamed to a shuddering stop the paravane crashed down into the sea and the wire weightless now swung idly to the rolling of the ship carslake scrambled down off the carley his sallow face suffused with anger he strode up to ralston you bloody fool he mouthed furiously youve lost us that paravane by god lto youd better explain yourself who the hell gave you orders to do anything ralstons mouth tightened but he spoke civilly enough sorry sir couldnt help it it had to be done ferrys arm to hell with ferrys arm carslake was almost screaming with rage im in charge here and i give the orders look look he pointed to the swinging wire your work ralston you you blundering idiot its gone gone do you understand gone ralston looked over the side with an air of large surprise well now so it is the eyes were bleak the tone provocative as he looked back at carslake and patted the winch and dont forget this its gone too and it costs a ruddy sight more than any paravane i dont want any of your damned impertinence carslake shouted his mouth was working his voice shaking with passion what you need is to have some discipline knocked into you and by god im going to see you get it you insolent young bastard ralston flushed darkly he took one quick step forward his fist balled then relaxed heavily as the powerful hands of cpo hartley caught his swinging arm but the damage was done now there was nothing for it but the bridge vallery listened calmly patiently as carslake made his outraged report he felt far from patient god only knew he thought wearily he had more than enough to cope with already but the unruffled professional mask of detachment gave no hint of his feelings is this true ralston he asked quietly as carslake finished his tirade you disobeyed orders swore at the lieutenant and insulted him no sir ralston sounded as weary as the captain felt its not true he looked at carslake his face expressionless then turned back to the captain i didnt disobey ordersthere were none chief petty officer hartley knows that he nodded at the burly impassive figure who had accompanied them to the bridge i didnt swear at him i hate to sound like a sealawyer sir but there are plenty of witnesses that sublieutenant carslake swore at meseveral times and if i insulted him he smiled faintly it was pure selfdefence this is no place for levity ralston vallerys voice was cold he was puzzledthe boy baffled him the bitterness the brittle composure he could understand these but not the flickering humour as it happens i saw the entire incident your promptness your resource saved that ratings arm possibly even his life and against that a lost paravane and wrecked winch are nothing carslake whitened at the implied rebuke im grateful for that thank you as for the rest commanders defaulters tomorrow morning carry on ralston ralston compressed his lips looked at vallery for a long moment then saluted abruptly and left the bridge carslake turned round appealingly captain sir he stopped at the sight of vallerys upraised hand not now carslake well discuss it later he made no attempt to conceal the dislike in his voice you may carry on lieutenant hartley a word with you hartley stepped forward fortyfour years old cpo hartley was the royal navy at its best very tough very kindly and very competent he enjoyed the admiration of all ranging from the vast awe of the youngest ordinary seaman to the warm respect of the captain himself they had been together from the beginning well chief lets have it between ourselves nothing to it really sir hartley shrugged ralston did a fine job sublieutenant carslake lost his head maybe ralston was a bit sassy but he was provoked hes only a kid but hes a professional and he doesnt like being pushed around by amateurs hartley paused and looked up at the sky especially bungling amateurs vallery smothered a smile could that be interpreted as er a criticism chief i suppose so sir he nodded forward a few ruffled feathers down there sir men are pretty sore about this shall i thanks chief play it down as much as possible when hartley had gone vallery turned to tyndall well you heard it sir another straw in the wind a straw tyndall was acid hundreds of straws more like a bloody great cornstack find out who was outside my door last night during the middle watch tyndall had heard an unusual scraping noise outside the wardroom entry to his day cabin had gone to investigate himself in his hurry to reach the door hed knocked a chair over and seconds later he had heard a clatter and the patter of running feet in the passage outside but when he had thrown the door open the passage had been empty nothing there nothing at all except a file on the deck below the case of navy colts the chain on the trigger guards was almost through vallery shook his head no idea at all sir his face was heavy with worry bad really bad tyndall shivered in an icy flurry he grinned crookedly real captain teach stuff eh pistols and cutlasses and black eyepatches storming the bridge vallery shook his head impatiently no not that you know it sir defiance maybe but well no more the point is a marine is on guard at the keyboard just round the corner of that passage night and day bound to have seen him he denies the rot has gone that far tyndall whistled softly a black day captain what does our fireeating young captain of marines say to that foster poohpoohs the very idea and just about twists the ends of his moustache off worried to hell sos evans his coloursergeant so am i said tyndall feelingly he glared into space the officer of the watch who happened to be in his direct line of vision shifted uncomfortably wonder what old socrates thinks of it all now maybe only a pillroller but the wisest head weve got well speak of the devil the gate had just swung open and a burly unhappylooking figure duffelcoated oilskinned and wearing a russian beaverskin helmet the total effect was of an elderly grizzly bear caught in a thunderstorm shuffled across the duck boards of the bridge he brought up facing the kent screen an inset circular sheet of glass which revolved at high speed and offered a clear view in all weather conditions rain hail snow for half a minute he peered miserably through this and obviously didnt like what he saw he sniffed loudly and turned away beating his arms against the cold ha a deck officer on the bridge of hm cruisers the romance the glamour hal he hunched his oilskinned shoulders and looked more miserable than ever no place this for a civilised man like myself but you know how it is gentlemen the clarion call of duty tyndall chuckled give him plenty of time captain slow starters these medics you know but brooks cut in voice and face suddenly serious some more trouble captain couldnt tell it over the phone dont know how much its worth trouble vallery broke off coughed harshly into his handkerchief sorry he apologised trouble theres nothing else old chap just had some ourselves that bumptious young fool carslake oh i know all right my spies are everywhere blokes a bloody menace however my story young nicholls was doing some path work late last night in the dispensary on tb specimens two three hours in there lights out in the bay and the patients either didnt know or had forgotten he was there heard stoker riley a real troublemaker that riley and the others planning a locked door sitdown strike in the boilerroom when they return to duty a sitdown strike in a boilerroom good lord its fantastic anyway nicholls let it slide pretended he hadnt heard what vallerys voice was sharp edged with anger and nicholls ignored it didnt report it to me happened last night you say why wasnt i told immediately get nicholls up here now no never mind he reached out to pick up the bridge phone ill get him myself brooks laid a gauntieted hand on vallerys arm i wouldnt do that sir nicholls is a smart boy very smart indeed he knew that if he let the men know they had been overheard they would know that he must report it to you and then youd have been bound to take action and open provocation of trouble is the last thing you want you said so yourself in the wardroom last night vallery hesitated yes yes of course i said that but well doc this is different it could be a focal point for spreading the idea to i told you sir brooks interrupted softly johnny nicholls is a very smart boy hes got a big notice in huge red letters outside the sick bay door keep clear suspected scarlet fever infection kills me to watch em everybody avoids the place like the plague not a hope of communicating with their pals in the stokers mess tyndall guffawed at him and even vallery smiled slightly sounds fine doc still i should have been told last night why should you be woken up and told every little thing in the middle of the night brookss voice was brusque sheer selfishness on my part but what of it when things get bad you damn well carry this ship on your back and when weve all got to depend on you we cant afford to have you anything less than as fit as possible agreed admiral tyndall nodded solemnly agreed o socrates a very complicated way of saying that you wish the captain to have a good nights sleep but agreed brooks grinned amiably well thats all gentlemen see you all at the courtmartial i hope he cocked a jaundiced eye over a shoulder into the thickening snow wont the med be wonderful gentlemen he sighed and slid effortlessly into his native galway brogue malta in the spring the beach at sliemawmi the white houses behindwhere we picnicked a hundred years ago the soft winds me darlin boys the warm winds the blue skies and chianti under a striped umbrella off tyndall roared get off this bridge brooks or ill im gone already said brooks a sitdown strike in the boilerroom ha first tiling you know therell be a rash of male suffragettes chaining themselves to the guard rails i the gate clanged shut behind him vallery turned to the admiral his face grave looks as if you were right about that comstack sir tyndall grunted noncommittally maybe trouble is the men have nothing to do right now except brood and curse and feel bitter about everything later on itll be all right perhaps when we getahbusier you mean mmm when youre fighting for your life to keep the ship afloat well you havent much time for plots and pondering over the injustices of fate selfpreservation is still the first law of nature speaking to the men tonight captain usual routine broadcast yes in the first dog when were all closed up to dusk action stations vallery smiled briefly make sure that theyre all awake good lay it on thick and heavy give em plenty to think aboutand if im any judge of vincent starrs hints were going to have plenty to think about this trip itll keep em occupied vallery laughed the laugh transformed his thin sensitive face he seemed genuinely amused tyndall lifted an interrogatory eyebrow vallery smiled back at him just passing thoughts sir as spencer faggot would have said things have come to a pretty pass things are bad indeed when only the enemy can save us chapter three monday afternoon all day long the wind blew steadily out of the nornorwest a strong wind and blowing stronger a cold wind a sharp wind full of little knives it carried with it snow and ice and the strange dead smell born of the forgotten ice caps that lie beyond the barrier it wasnt a gusty blowy wind it was a settled steady kind of wind and it stayed fine on the starboard bow from dawn to dusk slowly stealthily it was lifting a swell men like carrington who knew every sea and port in the world like vallery and hartley looked at it and were troubled and said nothing the mercury crept down and the snow lay where it fell the tripods and yardarms were great glistening xmas trees festooned with woolly stays and halliards on the mainmast a brown smear appeared now and then daubed on by a wisp of smoke from the after funnel felt rather than seen in a moment it would vanish the snow lay on the deck and drifted it softened the anchorcables on the focsle deck into great fluffy ropes of cottonwool and drifted high against the breakwater before a turret it piled up against the turrets and superstructure swished silently into the bridge and lay there slushily underfoot it blocked the great eyes of the directors rangefinder it crept unseen along passages it sifted soundlessly down hatches it sought out the tiniest unprotected chink in metal and wood and made the messdecks dank and clammy and uncomfortable it defied gravity and slid effortlessly up trouser legs up under the skirts of coats and oilskins up under duffel hoods and made men thoroughly miserable a miserable world a wet world but always and predominately a white world of softness and beauty and strangely muffled sound all day long it fell this snow fell steadily and persistently and the ulysses slid on silently through the swell a ghost ship in a ghost world but not alone in her world she never was these days she had companionship a welcome reassuring companionship the company of the th aircraft squadron a tough experienced and battlehardened escort group almost as legendary now as that fabulous force which had lately moved south to take over that other suicide run the malta convoys like the ulysses the squadron steamed nnw all day long there were no doglegs no standard course alterations tyndall abhorred the zigzag and except on actual convoy and then only in known uboat waters rarely used it he believedas many captains didthat the zigzag was a greater potential source of danger than the enemy he had seen the curayoa tons of cockleshell cruiser swinging on a routine zigzag being trampled into the grey depths of the atlantic under the mighty forefoot of the queen mary he never spoke of it but the memory stayed with him the ulysses was in her usual position the position dictated by her role of squadron flagship as nearly as possible in the centre of the thirteen warships dead ahead steamed the cruiser stirling an old cardiff class cruiser she was a solid reliable ship many years older and many knots slower than the ulysses adequately armed with five single sixinch guns but hardly built to hammer her way through the arctic gales in heavy seas her wetness was proverbial her primary role was squadron defence her secondary to take over the squadron if the flagship were crippled or sunk the carriers defender invader wrestler and blue ranger were in position to port and starboard the defender and wrestler slightly ahead of the ulysses the others slighfly astern it seemed de rigeur for these escort carriers to have names ending in er and the fact that the navy already had a wrestler a force destroyer was blithely ignored these were not the ton giants of the regular fleetships like the indefatigable and the illustriousbut ton auxiliary carriers irreverently known as banana boats they were converted merchantmen americanbuilt these had been fitted out at pascagoula mississippi and sailed across the atlantic by mixed britishamerican crews they were capable of eighteen knots a relatively high speed for a singlescrew shipthe wrestler had two screws but some of them had as many as four buschsulzer diesels geared to the one shaft their painfully rectangular flightdecks feet in length were built up above the open focsle one could see right under the flightdeck forard of the bridgeand flew off about thirty fighters grummans seafires or most often corsairs or twenty light bombers they were odd craft awkward ungainly and singularly unwarlike but over the months they had done a magnificent job of providing umbrella cover against air attack of locating and destroying enemy ships and submarines their record of kills above on and below the water was impressive and frequently disbelieved by the admiralty nor was the destroyer screen calculated to inspire confidence among the naval strategists at whitehall it was a weird hodgepodge and the term destroyer was a purely courtesy one one the nairn was a river class frigate of tons another the eager was a fleet minesweeper and a third the gannet better known as huntley and palmer was a rather elderly and very tired kingfisher corvette supposedly restricted to coastal duties only there was no esoteric mystery as to the origin of her nicknamea glance at her silhouette against the sunset was enough doubtless her designer had worked within admiralty specifications even so he must have had an off day the vectra and the viking were twinscrewed modified v and w destroyers in the superannuated class now lacking in speed and firepower but tough and durable the baliol was a diminutive hunt class destroyer which had no business in the great waters of the north the portpatrick a skeletonlean four stacker was one of the fifty lendlease world war i destroyers from the united states no one even dared guess at her age an intriguing ship at any tune she became the focus of all eyes in the fleet and a source of intense interest whenever the weather broke down rumour had it that two of her sister ships had overturned in the atlantic during a gale human nature being what it is everyone wanted a grandstand view whenever weather conditions deteriorated to an extent likely to afford early confirmation of these rumours what the crew of the portpatrick thought about it all was difficult to say these seven escorts blurred and softened by the snow kept their screening stations all day the frigate and minesweeper ahead the destroyers at the sides and the corvette astern the eighth escort a fast modern s class destroyer under the command of the captain commander orr prowled restlessly around the fleet every ship commander in the squadron envied orr his roving commission a duty which tyndall had assigned him in selfdefence against orrs continual pestering but no one objected no one grudged him his privilege the sirrus had an uncanny nose for trouble an almost magnetic affinity for uboats lying in ambush from the warmth of the ulyssess wardroom long incongruously comfortable running fifty feet along the starboard side of the focsle deck johnny nicholls gazed out through the troubled grey and white of the sky even the kindly snow he reflected blanketing a thousand sins could do little for these queer craft so angular so graceless so obviously outdated he supposed he ought to feel bitter at my lords of the admiralty with their limousines and armchairs and elevenses with their big wallmaps and pretty little flags sending out this raggletaggle of a squadron to cope with the pick of the uboat packs while they sat comfortably luxuriously at home but the thought died at birth it was he knew grotesquely unjust the admiralty would have given them a dozen brandnew destroyers if they had them things he knew were pretty bad and the demands of the atlantic and the mediterranean had first priority he supposed too he ought to feel cynical ironic at the sight of these old and wornout ships strangely he couldnt he knew what they could do what they had done if he felt anything at all towards them it was something uncommonly close to admirationperhaps even pride nicholls stirred uncomfortably and turned away from the porthole his gaze fell on the somnolent form of the kapok kid flat on his back in an armchair an enormous pair of furlined flyingboots perched above the electric fire the kapok kid lieutenant the honourable andrew carpenter rn navigator of the ulysses and his best friend he was the one to feel proud nicholls thought wryly the most glorious extrovert nicholls had ever known the kapok kid was equally at home anywhere on a dance floor or in the cockpit of a racing yacht at cowes at a garden party on a tennis court or at the wheel of his big crimson bugatti windscreen down and the loose ends of a sevenfoot scarf streaming out behind him but appearances were never more deceptive for the kapok kid the royal navy was his whole life and he lived for that alone behind that slightly inane facade lay besides a firstclass brain a deeply romantic streak an almost elizabethan love for sea and ships which he sought successfully he imagined to conceal from all his fellowofficers it was so patently obvious that no one ever thought it worth the mentioning theirs was a curious friendship nicholls mused an attraction of opposites if ever there was one for carpenters hailfellow ebullience his natural reserve and reticence were the perfect foil over against his friends nearidolatry of all things naval stood his own thoroughgoing detestation of all that the kapok kid so warmly admired perhaps because of that overdeveloped sense of individuality and independence that bane of so many highland scots nicholls objected strongly to the thousand and one pinpricks of discipline authority and bureaucratic naval stupidity which were a constant affront to his intelligence and selfrespect even three years ago when the war had snatched him from the wards of a great glasgow hospital his first years internship barely completed he had had his dark suspicions that the degree of compatibility between himself and the senior service would prove to be singularly low and so it had proved but in spite of this antipathy or perhaps because of it and the curse of a calvinistic conscience nicholls had become a firstclass officer but it still disturbed him vaguely to discover in himself something akin to pride in the ships of his squadron he sighed the loudspeaker in the corner of the wardroom had just crackled into life from bitter experience he knew that broadcast announcements seldom presaged anything good do you hear there do you hear there the voice was metallic impersonal the kapok kid slept on in magnificent oblivion the captain will broadcast to the ships company at tonight repeat the captain will broadcast to the ships company at tonight that is all nicholls prodded the kapok kid with a heavy toe on your feet vasco nows the time if you want a cuppa char before getting up there and navigating carpenter stirred opened a redrimmed eye nicholls smiled down encouragingly besides its lovely up top nowsea rising temperature falling and a young buzzard blowing just what you were born for andy boy i the kapok kid groaned his way back to consciousness struggled to a sitting position and remained hunched forward his straight flaxen hair falling over his hands whats the matter now his voice was querulous still slurred with sleep then he grinned faintly know where i was johnny he asked reminiscently back on the thames at the grey goose just up from henley it was summer johnny late in summer warm and very still dressed all in green she was indigestion nicholls cut in briskly too much easy living its fourthirty and the old mans speaking in an hours time dusk stations at any timewed better eat carpenter shook his head mournfully the man has no soul no finer feelings he stood up and stretched himself as always he was dressed from head to foot in a onepiece overall of heavy quilted kapok the silk fibres encasing the seeds of the japanese and malayan silkcotton tree there was a great golden j embroidered on the right breast pocket what it stood for was anyones guess he glanced out through the porthole and shuddered wonder whats the topic for tonight johnny no idea im curious to see what his attitude his tone is going to be how hes going to handle it the situation to say the least is somewhatahdelicate nicholls grinned but the smile didnt touch his eyes not to mention the fact that the crew dont know that theyre off to murmansk again although they must have a pretty good idea mmm the kapok kid nodded absently dont suppose the old manll try to play it down the hazards of the trip i mean or to excuse himself you know put the blame where it belongs never nicholls shook his head decisively not the skipper just not in his nature never excuses himself and never spares himself he stared into the fire for a long time then looked up quietly at the kapok kid the skippers a very sick man andy very sick indeed what the kapok kid was genuinely startled a very sick good lord youre joking you must be why im not nicholls interrupted flatly his voice very low winthrop the padre an intense enthusiastic very young man with an immense zest for life and granitic convictions on every subject under the sun was in the far corner of the wardroom the zest was temporarily in abeyance he was sunk in exhausted slumber nicholls liked him but preferred that he should not hear the padre would talk winthrop nicholls had often thought would never have made a successful priestconfessional reticence would have been impossible for him old socrates says hes pretty far through and he knows nicholls continued old man phoned him to come to his cabin last night place was covered in blood and he was coughing his lungs up acute attack of haemoptysis brooks has suspected it for a long time but the captain would never let him examine him brooks says a few more days of this will kill him he broke off glanced briefly at winthrop i talk too much he said abruptly getting as bad as the old padre there shouldnt have told you i suppose violation of professional confidence and all that all this under your hat andy of course of course there was a long pause what you mean is johnny hes dying just that come on andy char twenty minutes later nicholls made his way down to the sick bay the light was beginning to fail and the ulysses was pitching heavily brooks was in the surgery evening sir dusk stations any minute now mind if i stay in the bay tonight brooks eyed him speculatively regulations he intoned say that the action stations position of the junior medical officer is aft in the engineers flat far be it from me please why lonely lazy or just plain tired the quirk of the eyebrows robbed the words of all offence no curious i want to observe the reactions of stoker riley and hisahconfederates to the skippers speech might be most instructive sherlock nicholls eh righto johnny phone the damage control officer aft tell him youre tied up major operation anything you like our gullible public and how easily fooled shame nicholls grinned and reached for the phone when the bugle blared for dusk action stations nicholls was sitting in the dispensary the lights were out the curtains almost drawn he could see into every corner of the brightly lit sick bay five of the men were asleep two of the others petersen the giant slowspoken stoker half norwegian halfscots and burgess the dark little cockneywere sitting up in bed talking softly their eyes turned towards the swarthy heavily built patient lying between them stoker riley was holding court alfred ohara riley had at a very early age indeed decided upon a career of crime and beset though he subsequently was by innumerable vicissitudes he had clung to this resolve with an unswerving determination directed towards almost any other sphere of activity his resolution would have been praiseworthy possibly even profitable but praise and profit had passed riley by every man is what environment and heredity makes him riley was no exception and nicholls who knew something of his upbringing appreciated that life had never really given the big stoker a chance born of a drunken illiterate mother in a filthy overcrowded and feverridden liverpool slum he was an outcast from the beginning allied to that his hairy apelike figure the heavy prognathous jaw the twisted mouth the wide flaring nose the cunning black eyes squinting out beneath the negligible clearance between hairline and eyebrows that so accurately reflected the mental capacity within were all admirably adapted to what was to become his chosen vocation nicholls looked at him and disapproved without condemning for a moment he had an inkling of the tragedy of the inevitable riley was never at any time a very successful criminal his intelligence barely cleared the moron level he dimly appreciated his limitations and had left the higher more subtle forms of crime severely alone robbery preferably robbery with violence was his metier he had been in prison six times the last time for two years his induction into the navy was a mystery which bafhed both riley and the authorities responsible for his being there but riley had accepted this latest misfortune with equanimity and gone through the bomb shattered g and h blocks in the royal naval barracks portsmouth like a high wind through a field of corn leaving behind him a trail of slashed suitcases and empty wallets he had been apprehended without much difficulty done sixty days cells then been drafted to the ulysses as a stoker his career of crime aboard the ulysses had been brief and painful his first attempted robbery had been his last a clumsy and incredibly foolish rifling of a locker in the marine sergeants mess he had been caught redhanded by coloursergeant evans and sergeant macintosh they had preferred no charges against him and riley had spent the next three days in the sick bay he claimed to have tripped on the rung of a ladder and fallen twenty feet to the boilerroom floor but the actual facts of the case were common knowledge and turner had recommended his discharge to everyones astonishment not least that of stoker riley dodson the engineer commander had insisted he be given a last chance and riley had been reprieved since that date four months previously he had confined his activities to stirring up trouble illogically but understandably his brief encounter with the marines had swept away his apathetic tolerance of the navy a smouldering hatred took its place as an agitator he had achieved a degree of success denied him as a criminal admittedly he had a fertile field for operations but credit if that is the word was due also to his shrewdness his animal craft and cunning his hold over his crewmates the husky intense voice his earnestness his deepset eyes lent riley a strangly elemental power a power he had used to its maximum effect a few days previously when he had precipitated the mutiny which had led to the death of ralston the stoker and the marine mysteriously dead from a broken neck beyond any possible doubt their deaths lay at rileys door equally beyond doubt that could never be proved nicholls wondered what new devilment was hatching behind these lowering corrugated brows wondered how on earth it was that that same riley was continually in trouble for bringing aboard the ulysses and devotedly tending every stray kitten every brokenwinged bird he found the loudspeaker crackled cutting through his thoughts stilling the low voices in the sick bay and not only there but throughout the ship in turrets and magazines in enginerooms and boilerrooms above and below deck everywhere all conversation ceased then there was only the wind the regular smash of the bows into the deepening troughs the muffled roar of the great boilerroom intake fans and the hum of a hundred electric motors tension lay heavy over the ship over officers and men tangible almost in its oppression this is the captain speaking good evening the voice was calm well modulated without a sign of strain or exhaustion as you all know it is my custom at the beginning of every voyage to inform you as soon as possible of what lies in store for you i feel that you have a right to know and that it is my duty its not always a pleasant duty it never has been during recent months this time however fm almost glad he paused and the words came slow and measured this is our last operation as a unit of the home fleet in a months tune god willing we will be in the med good for you thought nicholls sweeten the pill lay it on thick and heavy but the captain had other ideas but first gentlemen the job on hand its the mixture as before murmansk again we rendezvous at wednesday north of iceland with a convoy from halifax there are eighteen ships in this convoy big and fast all fifteen knots and above our third fast russian convoy gentlemen fr in case you want to tell your grandchildren about it he added dryly these ships are carrying tanks planes aviation spirit and oilnothing else i will not attempt to minimise the dangers you know how desperate is the state of russia today how terribly badly she needs these weapons and fuel you can also be sure that the germans know too and that her intelligence agents will already have reported the nature of this convoy and the date of sailing he broke off short and the sound of his harsh muffled coughing into a handkerchief echoed weirdly through the silent ship he went on slowly there are enough fighter planes and petrol in this convoy to alter the whole character of the russian war the nazis will stop at nothing i repeat nothing to stop this convoy from going through to russia i have never tried to mislead or deceive you i will not now the signs are not good in our favour we have firstly our speed and secondly i hope the element of surprise we shall try to break through direct for the north cape there are four major factors against us you will all have noticed the steady worsening of the weather we are im afraid running into abnormal weather conditions abnormal even for the arctic it may i repeat may prevent uboat attacks on the other hand it may mean losing some of the smaller units of our screen we have no time to heave to or run before bad weather fr is going straight through and it almost certainly means that the carriers will be unable to fly off fighter cover good god has the skipper lost his senses nicholls wondered hell wreck any morale thats left not that there is any left what in the world secondly the voice went on calm inexorable we are taking no rescue ships on this convoy there will be no time to stop besides you all know what happened to the stockport and the zafaaran youre safer where you are thirdly two possibly three uboat packs are known to be strung out along latitude seventy degrees and our northern norway agents report a heavy mustering of german bombers of all types in their area finally we have reason to believe that the tirpitz is preparing to move out again he paused for an interminable time it seemed it was as if he knew the tremendous shock carried in these few words and wanted to give it time to register i need not tell you what that means the germans may risk her to stop the convoy the admiralty hope they will during the latter part of the voyage capital units of the home fleet including possibly the aircraftcarriers victorious and furious and three cruisers will parallel our course at twelve hours steaming distance they have been waiting a long time and we are the bait to spring the trap it is possible that things may go wrong the bestlaid plans or the trap may be late in springing shut this convoy must still get through if the carriers cannot fly off cover the ulysses must cover the withdrawal of fr you will know what that means i hope this is all perfectly clear there was another long bout of coughing another long pause and when he spoke again the tone had completely changed he was very quiet i know what i am asking of you i know how tired how hopeless how sick at heart you all feel i know noone knows better what you have been through how much you need how much you deserve a rest rest you shall have the entire ships company goes on ten days leave from portsmouth on the eighteenth then for refit in alexandria the words were casual as if they carried no significance for him but before that well i know it seems cruel inhuman it must seem so to you to ask you to go through it all again perhaps worse than youve ever gone through before but i cant help it no one can help it every sentence now was punctuated by long silences it was difficult to catch his words so low and far away no one has any right to ask you to do it i least of all least of all i know you will do it i know you will not let me down i know you will take the ulysses through good luck good luck and god bless you good night the loudspeakers clicked off but the silence lingered on nobody spoke and nobody moved not even the eyes moved those who had been looking at the speakers still gazed on unseeingly or stared down at their hands or down into the glowing butts of forbidden cigarettes oblivious to the acrid smoke that laced exhausted eyes it was strangely as if each man wanted to be alone to look into his own mind follow his thoughts out for himself and knew that if his eyes caught anothers he would no longer be alone a strange hush a supernatural silence the wordless understanding that so rarely touches mankind the veil lifts and drops again and a man can never remember what be has seen but knows that he has seen something and that nothing will ever be quite the same again seldom all too seldom it comes a sunset of surpassing loveliness a fragment from some great symphony the terrible stillness which falls over the huge rings of madrid and barcelona as the sword of the greatest of the matadors sinks inevitably home and the spaniards have the word for it the moment of truth the sick bay clock unnaturally loud ticked away one minute maybe two with a heavy sigh it seemed ages since he had breathed last nicholls softly pulled to the sliding door behind the curtains and switched on the light he looked round at brooks looked away again well johnny the voice was soft almost bantering i just dont know sir i dont know at all nicholls shook his head at first i thought he was going to well make a hash of it you know scare the lights out of em and good god he went on wonderingly thats exactly what he did do piled it on gales tirpitz hordes of subs and yet his voice trailed off and yet brooks echoed mockingly thats just it too much intelligence thats the trouble with the young doctors today i saw yousitting there like a bogus psychiatrist analysing away for all you were worth at the probable effect of the speech on the minds of the wounded warriors without and never giving it a chance to let it register on yourself he paused and went on quietly it was beautifully done johnny no thats the wrong wordthere was nothing premeditated about it but dont you see as black a picture as man could paint points out that this is just a complicated way of committing suicide no silver lining no promises even alex thrown in as a casual afterthought builds em up then lets em down no inducements no hope no appeal and yet the appeal was tremendous what was it johnny i dont know nicholls was troubled he lifted his head abruptly then smiled faintly maybe there was no appeal listen noiselessly he slid the door back flicked off the lights the rumble of rileys harsh voice low and intense was unmistakable just a lot of bloody claptrap alex the med not on your life mate youll never see it youll never even see scapa again captain richard vallery dsol know what that old bastard wants boys another bar to his dso maybe even a vc well by christs hes not going to have it not at my expense not if i can well help it i know you wont let me down he mimicked his voice highpitched whining old bastard he paused a moment then rushed on the tirpitz christ almighty the tirpitz were going to stop it us this bloody toy ship bait he says bait his voice rose i tell you mates nobody gives a damn about us direct for the north cape theyre throwing us to the bloody wolves and that old bastard up top shaddap it was petersen who spoke his voice a whisper low and fierce his hand stretched out and brooks and nicholls in the surgery winced as they heard rileys wristbones crack under the tremendous pressure of the giants hand often i wonder about you riley petersen went on i slowly but not now not any more you make me sick he flung rileys hand down and turned away riley rubbed his wrist in agony and turned to burgess for gods sake whats the matter with him what the hell he broke off abruptly burgess was looking at him steadily kept looking for a long time slowly deliberately he eased himself down in bed pulled the blankets up to his neck and turned his back on riley brooks rose quickly to his feet closed the door and pressed the light switch act i scene i cut lights he murmured see what i mean johnny yes sir nicholls nodded slowly at least i think so mind you my boy it wont last at least not at that intensity he grinned but maybe itll take us the length of murmansk you never know i hope so sir thanks for the show nicholls reached up for his duffelcoat well i suppose id better make my way aft off you go then and ohjohnny sir that scarletfever noticeboard of yours on your way aft you might consign it to the deep i dont think well be needing it any more nicholls grinned and closed the door softly behind him chapter four monday night dusk action stations dragged out its interminable hour and was gone that night as on a hundred other nights it was just another nagging irritation a pointless precaution that did not even justify its existence far less its meticulous thoroughness or so it seemed for although at dawn enemy attacks were routine at sunset they were all but unknown it was not always so with other ships indeed it was rarely so but then the ulysses was a lucky ship everyone knew that even vallery knew it but he also knew why vigilance was the first article of his sailors creed soon after the captains broadcast radar had reported a contact closing that it was an enemy plane was certain commander westcliffe senior air arm officer had before him in the fighter direction room a wall map showing the operational routes of all coastal and ferry command planes and this was a clear area but no one paid the slightest attention to the report other than tyndalls order for a course alteration this was as routine as dusk action stations themselves it was their old friend charlie coming to pay his respects again charlie usually a fourengine fockewulf condor was an institution on the russian convoys he had become to the seamen on the murmansk run very much what the albatross had been the previous century to sailing men far south in the roaring forties a bird of illomen half feared but almost amicably accepted and immune from destruction though with charlie for a different reason in the early days before the advent of camships and escort carriers charlie frequently spent the entire day from first light to last circling a convoy and radioing to base pinpoint reports of its position exchanges of signals between british ships and german reconnaissance planes were not unknown and apocryphal stories were legion an exchange of pleasantries about the weather was almost commonplace on several occasions charlie had plaintively asked for his position and been given highlydetailed latitude and longitude bearings which usually placed him somewhere in the south pacific and of course dozen ships claimed the authorship of the story wherein the convoy commodore sent the signal please fly the other way a round you are making us dizzy and charlie had courteously acknowledged and turned in his tracks latterly however amiability had been markedly absent and charlie grown circumspect with the passing of the months and the appearance of shipborne fighters rarely appeared except at dusk his usual practice was to make a single circle of the convoy at a prudent distance and then disappear into the darkness that night was no exception men caught only fleeting glimpses of the condor in the driving snow then quickly lost it in the gathering gloom charlie would report the strength nature and course of the squadron although tyndall had little hope that the german intelligence would be deceived as to their course a naval squadron near the sixtysecond degree of latitude just east of the faroes and heading nne camships were merchant ships with specially strengthened focsles on these were fitted foreandaft angled ramps from which fighter planes such as modified hurricanes were catapulted for convoy defence after breaking off action the pilot had either to bale out or land in the sea hazardous is rather an inadequate word to describe the duties of this handful of very gallant pilots the chances of survival were not high it wouldnt make sense to use them especially as they almost certainly knew of the departure of the convoy from halifax two and two far too obviously totted up to four no attempt was made to fly off seafiresthe only plane with a chance to overhaul the condor before it disappeared into the night to locate the carrier again in almost total darkness even on a radio beam was difficult to land at night extremely dangerous and to land by guess and by god in the snow and blackness on a pitching heaving deck a suicidal impossibility the least miscalculation the slightest error of judgment and you had not only a lost plane but a drowned pilot a ditched seafire with its slender torpedoshaped fuselage and the tremendous weight of the great rollsroyce merlin in its nose was a literal deathtrap when it went down into the sea it just kept on going back on to course again the ulysses pushed blindly into the gathering storm hands fell out from action stations and resumed normal defence stationswatch and watch four on four off not a killing routine one would think twelve hours on twelve hours off a daya man could stand that and so he could were that all but the crew also spent three hours a day at routine action stations every second morningthe forenoon watchat work and god only knew how many hours at action stations beyond all this all mealswhen there were meals were eaten in their offduty time a total of three to four hours sleep a day was reckoned unusual fortyeight hours without sleep hardly called for comment step by step fraction by menacing fraction mercury and barograph crept down in a deadly dualism the waves were higher now their troughs deeper their shoulders steeper and the bone chilling wind lashed the snow into a blinding curtain a bad night a sleepless night both above deck and below on watch and off on the bridge the first lieutenant the kapok kid signalmen the searchlight lto lookouts and messengers peered out miserably into the white night and wondered what it would be like to be warm again jerseys coats overcoats duffels oilskins scarves balaclavas helmetsthey wore them all completely muffled except for a narrow eyeslit in the woollen cocoon and still they shivered they wrapped arms and forearms round and rested their feet on the steam pipes which circled the bridge and froze pompom crews huddled miserably in the shelter of their multiple guns stamped their feet swung their arms and swore incessantly and the lonely oerlikon gunners each jammed in his lonely cockpit leaned against the builtin black heaters and fought off the oerlikon gunners most insidious enemysleep the starboard watch in the messdecks below were little happier there were no bunks for the crew of the ulysses only hammocks and these were never slung except in harbour there were good and sufficient reasons for this standards of hygiene on a naval warship are high compared even to the average civilian home the average matelot would never consider climbing into his hammock fully dressedand no one in his senses would have dreamed of undressing on the russian convoys again to an exhausted man the prospect and the actual labour of slinging and then lashing a hammock were alike appalling and the extra seconds it took to climb out of a hammock in an emergency could represent the margin between life and death while the very existence of a slung hammock was a danger to all in that it impeded quick movement and finally as on that night of a heavy head sea there could be no more uncomfortable place than a hammock slung fore and aft and so the crew slept where it could fully clothed even to duffel coats and gloves on tables and under tables on narrow nineinch stools on the floor in hammock racks anywhere the most popular place on the ship was on the warm steel deckplates in the alleyway outside the galley at nighttime a weird and spectral tunnel lit only by a garish red light a popular sleeping billet made doubly so by the fact that only a screen separated it from the upperdeck a scant ten feet away the fear of being trapped below decks in a sinking ship was always there always in the back of mens minds even below decks it was bitterly cold the hotair systems operated efficiently only on b and c messdecks and even there the temperature barely cleared freezing point deckheads dripped constantly and the condensation on the bulkheads sent a thousand little rivulets to pool on the corticene floor the atmosphere was dank and airless and terribly chillthe ideal breeding ground for the tb so feared by surgeoncommander brooks such conditions allied with the constant pitching of the ship and the sudden jarring vibrations which were beginning to develop every time the bows crashed down made sleep almost impossible at best a fitful restless unease almost to a man the crew slept or tried to sleep with heads pillowed on inflated lifebelts blown up bent double then tied with tape these lifebelts made very tolerable pillows for this purpose and for this alone were these lifebelts employed although standing orders stated explicitly that lifebelts were to be worn at all times during action and in known enemy waters these orders were completely ignored not least of all by those divisional officers whose duty it was to enforce them there was enough air trapped in the voluminous and bulky garments worn in these latitudes to keep a man afloat for at least three minutes if he wasnt picked up in that time he was dead anyway it was shock that killed the tremendous shock of a body at f being suddenly plunged into a liquid temperature some lower for in the arctic waters the sea temperature often falls below normal freezing point worse still the subzero wind lanced like a thousand stilettos through the saturated clothing of a man who had been submerged in the sea and the heart faced with an almost instantaneous change in body temperature just stopped beating but it was a quick death men said quick and kind and merciful at ten minutes to midnight the commander and marshall made their way to the bridge even at this late hour and in the wicked weather the commander was his usual self imperturbable and cheerful lean and piratical a throwback to the elizabethan buccaneers if ever there was one he had an unflagging zest for life the duffel hood as always lay over his shoulders the braided peak of his cap was tilted at a magnificent angle he groped for the handle of the bridge gate passed through stood for a minute accustoming his eyes to the dark located the first lieutenant and thumped him resoundingly on the back well watchman and what of the night he boomed cheerfully bracing yes decidedly so situation completely out of control as usual i suppose where are all our chickens this lovely evening he peered out into the snow scanned the horizon briefly then gave up all gone to hell and beyond i suppose not too bad carrington grinned an rnr officer and an exmerchant navy captain in whom vallery reposed complete confidence lieutenantcommander carrington was normally a taciturn man grave and unsmiling but a particular bond lay between him and turner the professional bond of respect which two exceptional seamen have for each other we can see the carriers now and then anyway bowden and his backroom boys have em all pinned to an inch at least thats what they say better not let old bowden hear you say that marshall advised thinks radar is the only step forward the human race has taken since the first man came down from the trees he shivered uncontrollably and turned his back on the driving wind anyway i wish to god i had his job he added feelingly this is worse than winter in alberta nonsense my boy stuff and nonsense the commander roared decadent thats the trouble with you youngsters nowadays this is the only life for a selfrespecting human being he sniffed the icy air appreciatively and turned to carrington whos on with you tonight number one a dark figure detached itself from the binnacle and approached him ah there you are well well pon my soul if it isnt our navigating officer the honourable carpenter lost as usual and dressed to kill in his natty gents suiting do you know pilot in that outfit you look like a cross between a deepsea diver and that advert for michelin tyres ha said the kapok kid aggrievedly sniff and scoff while you may sir he patted his quilted chest affectionately just wait tul were all down there in the drink together everybody else dragged down or frozen to death me drifting by warm and dry and comfortable maybe smoking the odd cigarette enough be off course number one threetwenty sir fifteen knots and the captain in the shelter carrington jerked his head towards the reinforced steel circular casing at the after end of the bridge this supported the director tower the control circuits to which ran through a central shaft in the casing a sea bunk a spartan bare settee was kept there for the captains use sleeping i hope he added but i very much doubt it gave orders to be called at midnight why turner demanded oh i dont know routine i suppose wants to see how things are cancel the order turner said briefly captains got to learn to obey orders like anybody elseespecially doctors orders ill take full responsibility good night number one the gate clanged shut and marshall turned uncertainly towards the commander the captain sir oh i know its none of my business but he hesitated well is he all right turner looked quickly around him his voice was unusually quiet if brooks had his way the old man would be in hospital he was silent for a moment then added soberly even then it might be too late marshall said nothing he moved restlessly around then went aft to the port searchlight control position for five minutes an intermittent rumble of voices drifted up to the commander he glanced up curiously on marshalls return thats ralston sir the torpedo officer explained if hed talk to anybody i think hed talk to me and does he sure but only what he wants to talk about as for the rest no dice you can almost see the big notice round his neck privatekeep off very civil very courteous and completely unapproachable i dont know what the hell to do about him leave him be turner advised theres nothing anyone can do he shook his head my god what a lousy break lifes given that boy silence fell again the snow was lifting now but the wind still strengthening it howled eerily through masts and rigging blending with a wild and eldritch harmony into the haunting pinging of the asdic weird sounds both weird and elemental and foreboding that rasped across the nerves and stirred up nameless atavistic dreads of a thousand ages past long buried under the press of civilisation an unholy orchestra and over years men grew to hate it with a deadly hatred halfpast twelve came one oclock then halfpast one turners thought turned fondly towards coffee and cocoa coffee or cocoa cocoa he decided a steaming potent brew thick with melted chocolate and sugar he turned to chrysler the bridge messenger young brother of the leading asdic operator wt bridge wt bridge the loudspeaker above the asdic cabinet crackled urgently the voice hurried insistent turner jumped for the hand transmitter barked an acknowledgment signal from sirrus echoes port bow strong closing repeat echoes port bow strong closing echoes wt did you say echoes echoes sir i repeat echoes even as he spoke turners hand cut down on the gleaming phosphorescence of the emergency action stations switch of all sounds in this earth there is none so likely to stay with a man to the end of his days as the eas there is no other sound even remotely like it there is nothing noble or martial or bloodstirring about it it is simply a whistle pitched near the upper limit of audiofrequency alternating piercing atonic alive with a desperate urgency and sense of danger knifelike it sears through the most sleepdrugged brain and has a man no matter how exhausted how weak how deeply sunk in oblivion on his feet in seconds the pulserate already accelerating to meet the latest unknown the adrenalin already pumping into his bloodstream inside two minutes the ulysses was closed up to action stations the commander had moved aft to the after director tower vallery and tyndall were on the bridge the sirrus two miles away to port remained in contact for half an hour the viking was detached to help her and belowdeck in the ulysses the peculiar tinny clanging of depthcharging was clearly heard at irregular intervals finally the sirrus reported no success contact lost trust you have not been disturbed tyndall ordered the recall of the two destroyers and the bugle blew the standdown back on the bridge again the commander sent for his long overdue cocoa chrysler departed to the seamans forard galley the commander would have no truck with the wishywashy liquid concocted for the officers mess and returned with a steaming jug and a string of heavy mugs their handles threaded on a bent wire turner watched with approval the reluctance with which the heavy viscous liquid poured glutinously over the lip of the jug and nodded in satisfaction after a preliminary taste he smacked his lips and sighed contentedly excellent young chrysler excellent you have the gift torps an eye on the ship if you please must see where we are he retired to the chartroom on the port side just aft of the compass platform and closed the blackout door relaxed in his chair he put his mug on the charttable and his feet beside it drew the first deep inhalation of cigarette smoke into his lungs then he was on his feet cursing the crackle of the wt loudspeaker was unmistakable this time it was the portpatrick for one reason and another her reports were generally treated with a good deal of reserve but this time she was particularly emphatic commander turner had no option again he reached for the eas switch twenty minutes later the standdown sounded again but the commander was to have no cocoa that night three times more during the hours of darkness all hands closed up to action stations and only minutes it seemed after the last standdown the bugle went for dawn stations there was no dawn as we know it there was a vague imperceptible lightening in the sky a bleak chill greyness as the men dragged themselves wearily back to their action stations this then was war in the northern seas no death and glory heroics no roaring guns and spitting oerkkons no exaltation of the spirit no glorious defiance of the enemy just wornout sleepless men numbed with cold and sodden duffels grey and drawn and stumbling on their feet with weakness and hunger and lack of rest carrying with them the memories the tensions the cumulative physical exhaustion of a hundred such endless nights vallery as always was on the bridge courteous kind and considerate as ever he looked ghastly his face was haggard the colour of putty his bloodshot eyes deepsunk in hollowed sockets his lips bloodless the severe haemorrhage of the previous night and the sleepless night just gone had taken terrible toll of his slender strength in the halflight the squadron came gradually into view miraculously most of them were still in position the frigate and minesweeper were together and far ahead of the fleet during the night they had been understandably reluctant to have their tails tramped on by a heavy cruiser or a carrier tyndall appreciated this and said nothing the invader had lost position during the night and lay outside the screen on the port quarter she received a very testy signal indeed and came steaming up to resume station corkscrewing violently in the heavy cross seas standdown came at at the port watch was below making tea washing queueing up at the galley for hu breakfast trays when a muffled explosion shook the ulysses towels soap cups plates and trays went flying or where left where they were blasphemous and bitter the men were on their way before vallerys hand closed on the emergency switch less than half a mile away the invader was slewing round in a violent halfcircle her flightdeck tilted over at a crazy angle it was snowing heavily again now but not heavily enough to obscure the great gouts of black oily smoke belching up forard of the invaders bridge even as the crew of the ulysses watched she came to rest wallowing dangerously in the troughs between the great waves the fools the crazy fools tyndall was terribly bitter unreasonably so even to vallery he would not admit how much he was now feeling the burden the strain of command that sparked off his now almost chronic irritability this is what happens captain when a ship loses station and its as much my fault as theirsshould have sent a destroyer to escort her back he peered through his binoculars turned to vallery make a signal please estimate of damage please inform that damned uboat must have trailed her from first light waiting for a lineup vallery said nothing he knew how tyndall must feel to see one of his ships heavily damaged maybe sinking the invader was still lying over at the same unnatural angle the smoke rising in a steady column now there was no sign of flames going to investigate sir vallery inquired tyndall bit his lip thoughtfully and hesitated yes i think wed better do it ourselves order squadron to proceed same speed same course signal the baliol and the nairn to stand by the invader vallery watching the flags fluttering to the yardarm was aware of someone at his elbow he halfturned that was no uboat sir the kapok kid was very sure of himself she cant have been torpedoed tyndall overheard him he swung round in his chair glared at the unfortunate navigator what the devil do you know about it sir he growled when the admiral addressed his subordinates as sir it was time to take to the boats the kapok kid flushed to the roots of his blond hair but he stood his ground well sir in the first place the sirrus is covering the invaders port side though well ahead ever since your recall signal shes been quartering that area for some time im sure commander orr would have picked her up also its far too rough for any sub to maintain periscope depth far less line up a firing track and if the uboat did fire it wouldnt only fire onesix more likely and from that firing angle the rest of the squadron must have been almost a solid wall behind the invader but no one else has been hit i did three years in the trade sir i did ten tyndall growled guesswork pilot just guesswork no sir carpenter persisted its not i cant swear to it he had his binoculars to his eyes but im almost sure the invader is going astern could only be because her bows below the waterline that is have been damaged or blown off must have been a mine sir probably acoustic ah of course of course tyndall was very acid moored in feet of water no doubt a drifting mine sir the kapok kid said patiently or an old acoustic torpedospent german torpedoes dont always sink probably a mine though suppose youll be telling me next what mark it is and when it was laid tyndall growled but he was impressed in spite of himself and the invader was going astern although slowly without enough speed to give her steerage way she still wallowed helplessly in the great troughs an aldis clacked acknowledgment to the winking light on the invader bentley tore a sheet off a signal pad handed it to vallery invader to admiral the captain read am badly holed starboard side forard very deep suspect drifting mine am investigating extent of damage will report soon tyndall took the signal from him and read it slowly then he looked over his shoulder and smiled faintly you were dead right my boy it seems please accept an old curmudgeons apologies carpenter murmured something and turned away brickred again with embarrassment tyndall grinned faintly at the captain then became thoughtful i think wed better talk to him personally captain barlow isnt it make a signal they climbed down two decks to the fighter direction room westcliffe vacated his chair for the admiral captain barlow tyndall spoke into the handpiece speaking the sound came from the loudspeaker above his head admiral here captain how are things well manage sir lost most of our bows im afraid several casualties oil fires but under control wt doors all holding and engineers and damage control parties are shoring up the crossbulkheads can you go ahead at all captain could do sir but riskyin this anyway think you could make it back to base with this wind and sea behind us yes still take threefour days righto then tyndalls voice was gruff off you go youre no good to us without bows damned hard luck captain barlow my commiserations and oh im giving you the baliol and nairn as escorts and radioing for an oceangoing tug to come out to meet youjust in case thank you sir we appreciate that one last thing permission to empty starboard squadron fuel tanks weve taken a lot of water cant get rid of it all only way to recover our trim tyndall sighed yes i was expecting that cant be helped and we cant take it off you in this weather good luck captain goodbye thank you very much sir goodbye twenty minutes later the ulysses was back on station in the squadron shortly afterwards they saw the invader not listing quite so heavily now head slowly round to the southeast the little hunt class destroyer and the frigate one on either side rolling wickedly as they came round with her in another ten minutes watchers on the ulysses had lost sight of them buried in a flurrying snow squall three gone and eleven left behind but it was the eleven who now felt so strangely alone chapter five tuesday the invader and her troubles were soon forgotten all too soon the th aircraft carrier squadron had enough and more than enough to worry about on their own account they had their own troubles to overcome their own enemy to face an enemy far more elemental and far more deadly than any mine or uboat tyndall braced himself more firmly against the pitching rolling deck and looked over at vallery vallery he thought for the tenth time that morning looked desperately ill what do you make of it captain prospects arent altogether healthy are they were for it sir its really piling up against us carrington has spent six years in the west indies has gone through a dozen hurricanes admits hes seen a barometer lower but never one so low with the pressure still falling so fast not in these latitudes this is only a curtainraiser this will do me nicely meantime thank you tyndall said dryly for a curtainraiser its doing not so badly it was a masterly understatement for a curtainraiser it was a magnificent performance the wind was fairly steady about force on the beaufort scale and the snow had stopped a temporary cessation only they all knewfar ahead to the northwest the sky was a peculiarly livid colour it was a dull glaring purple neither increasing nor fading faintly luminous and vaguely menacing in its uniformity and permanence even to men who had seen everything the arctic skies had to offer from pitchy darkness on a summers noon right through the magnificent displays of northern lights to that wonderfully washedout blue that so often smiles down on the stupendous calms of the milkwhite seas that lap edge of the barrier this was something quite unknown but the admirals reference had been to the sea it had been building up steadily inexorably all during the morning now at noon it looked uncommonly like an eighteenthcentury print of a barque in a stormserried waves of greenishgrey straight regular and marching uniformly along each decoratively topped with frothing caps of white only i here there were feet between crest and crest and the squadron heading almost directly into it was taking hearty punishment for the little ships already burying their bows every fifteen seconds in a creaming smother of cascading white this was bad enough but another a more dangerous and insidious enemy was at workthe cold the temperature had long sunk below freezing point and the mercury was still shrinking down close towards the zero mark the cold was now intense ice formed in cabins and mess decks freshwater systems froze solid metal contracted hatch covers jammed door hinges locked in frozen immobility the oil in the searchlight controls gummed up and made them useless to keep a watch especially a watch on the bridge was torture the first shock of that bitter wind seared the lungs left a man fighting for breath if he had forgotten to don glovesfirst the silk gloves then the woollen mittens then the sheepskin gauntletsand touched a handrail the palms of the hands seared off the skin burnt as by whitehot metal on the bridge if he forgot to duck when the bows smashed down into a trough the flying spray solidified in a second into hurtling slivers of ice lanced cheek and forehead open to the bone hands froze the very marrow of the bones numbed the deadly chill crept upwards from feet to calves to thighs nose and chin turned white with frostbite and demanded immediate attention and then by far the worst of all the end of the watch the return below deck the writhing excruciating agony of returning circulation but for all this words are useless things pale shadows of reality some things lie beyond the knowledge and the experience of the majority of mankind and here imagination finds itself in a world unknown but all these things were relatively trifles personal inconveniences to be shrugged aside the real danger lay elsewhere it lay in the fact of ice there were over three hundred tons of it already on the decks of the ulysses and more forming every minute it lay in a thick even coat over the main deck the focsle the gundecks and the bridges it hung in long jagged icicles from coamings and turrets and rails it trebled the diameter of every wire stay and halliard and turned slender masts into monstrous trees ungainly and improbable it lay everywhere a deadly menace and much of the danger lay in the slippery surface it presenteda problem much more easily overcome on a coalfired merchant ship with clinker and ashes from its boilers than in the modern oilfired warships on the ulysses they spread salt and sand and hoped for the best but the real danger of the ice lay in its weight a ship to use technical terms can be either stiff or tender if shes stiff she has a low centre of gravity rolls easily but whips back quickly and is extremely stable and safe if shes tender with a high centre of gravity she rolls reluctantly but comes back even more reluctantly is unstable and unsafe and if a ship were tender and hundreds of tons of ice piled high on its decks the centre of gravity rose to a dangerous height it could rise to a fatal height the escort carriers and the destroyers especially the portpatrick were vulnerable terribly so the carriers already unstable with the great height and weight of their reinforced flightdecks provided a huge smooth flat surface to the falling snow ideal conditions for the formation of ice earlier on it had been possible to keep the flightdecks relatively clearworking parties had toiled incessantly with brooms and sledges salt and steam hoses but the weather had deteriorated so badly now that to send out a man on that wildly pitching staggering flightdeck glassy and infinitely treacherous would be to send him to his death the wrestler and blue ranger had modified heating systems under the flightdecksmodified because unlike the british ships these mississippi carriers had planked flightdecks in such extreme conditions they were hopelessly inefficient conditions aboard the destroyers were even worse they had to contend not only with the ice from the packed snow but with ice from the sea itself as regularly as clockwork huge clouds of spray broke over the destroyers focsles as the bows crashed solidly shockingly into the trough and rising shoulder of the next wave the spray froze even as it touched the deck even before it touched the deck piling up the solid ice in places over a foot thick from the stem aft beyond the breakwater the tremendous weight of the ice was pushing the little ships down by their heads deeper with each successive plunge ever deeper they buried their noses in the sea and each time more and more sluggishly more and more reluctantly they staggered laboriously up from the depths like the carrier captains the destroyer skippers could only look down from their bridges helpless hoping two hours passed two hours in which the temperature fell to zero hesitated then shrank steadily beyond it two hours in which the barometer tumbled crazily after it curiously strangely the snow still held off the livid sky to the northwest was as far away as ever and the sky to the south and east had cleared completely the squadron presented a fantastic picture now little toyboats of sugaricing dazzling white gleaming and sparkling in the pale winter sunshine pitching crazily through the everlengthening everdeepening valleys of grey and green of the cold norwegian sea pushing on towards that far horizon far and weird and purply glowing the horizon of another world it was an incredibly lovely spectacle rearadmiral tyndall saw nothing beautiful about it a man who was wont to claim that he never worried he was seriously troubled now he was gruff to those on the bridge gruff to the point of discourtesy and the old geniality of the farmer giles of even two months ago was all but gone ceaselessly his gaze circled the fleet constantly uncomfortably he twisted in his chair finally he climbed down passed through the gate and went into the captains shelter vallery had no light on and the shelter was in semidarkness he lay there on his settee a couple of blankets thrown over him in the halflight his face looked ghastly corpselike his right hand clutched a balled handkerchief spotted and stained he made no attempt to hide it with a painful effort and before tyndall could stop him he had swung his legs over the edge of the settee and pulled forward a chair tyndall choked off his protest sank gracefully into the seat i think your curtains just about to go up dick what on earth ever induced me to become a squadron commander vallery grinned sympathetically i dont particularly envy you sir what are you going to do now what would you do tyndall countered dolefully vallery laughed for a moment his face was transformed boyish almost then the laugh broke down into a bout of harsh dry coughing the stain spread over his handkerchief then he looked up and smiled the penalty for laughing at a superior officer what would i do heave to sir better still tuck my tail between my legs and run for it tyndall shook his head you never were a very convincing liar dick both men sat in silence for a moment then vallery looked up how far to go exactly sir young carpenter makes it miles more or less one hundred and seventy vallery looked at his watch twenty hours to go in this weather we must make it tyndall nodded heavily eighteen ships sitting out there nineteen counting the sweeper from hvalfjord not to mention old starrs blood pressure he broke off as a hand rapped on the door and a head looked in two signals captain sir just read them out bentley will you first is from the portpatrick sprung bowplates making water fast pumps coming fear further damage please advise tyndall swore vallery said calmly and the other from the gannet sir breaking up yes yes and the rest of the message just that sir breaking up ha i one of these taciturn characters tyndall growled wait a minute chief will you he sank back in his chair hand rasping his chin gazing at his feet forcing his tired mind to think vallery murmured something in a low voice and tyndall looked up his eyebrows arched troubled waters sir perhaps the carriers tyndall slapped his knee two minds with but a single thought bentley make two signals one to all screen vessels tell em to take positionasternclose astern of the carriers other to the carriers oil hose one each through port and starboard loading ports aboutahhow much would you say captain twenty gallons a minute sir twenty gallons it is understand chief righto get em off at once and chief tell the navigator to bring his chart here bentley left and he turned to vallery weve got to fuel later on and we cant do it here looks as if this might be the last chance of shelter this side of murmansk and if the next twentyfour hours are going to be as bad as carrington forecasts i doubt whether some of the little ships could live through it anyway ah here you are pilot lets see where we are hows the wind by the way force sir bracing himself against the wild lurching of the ulysses the kapok kid smoothed out the chart on the captains bunk backing slightly northwest would you say pilot tyndall rubbed his hands excellent now my boy our position west north said the kapok kid precisely he didnt even trouble to consult the chart tyndall lifted his eyebrows but made no comment course sir now if it were necessary for us to seek shelter for fuelling course exactly sir ive pencilled it in there four and a half hours steaming approximately how the devil tyndall exploded who told you toto he spluttered into a wrathful silence i worked it out five minutes ago sir iterseemed inevitable would take us a few miles inside the langanes peninsula there should be plenty shelter there carpenter was grave unsmiling seemed inevitable tyndall roared would you listen to him captain vallery inevitable and its only just occurred to me of all the get out take yourself and that damned comicopera fancy dress elsewhere the kapok kid said nothing with an air of injured innocence he gathered up his charts and left tyndalls voice halted him at the door pilot sir the kapok kids eyes were fixed on a point above tyndalls head as soon as the screen vessels have taken up position tell bentley to send them the new course yes sir certainly he hesitated and tyndall chuckled all right all right he said resignedly ill say it again im just a crusty old curmudgeon and shut that damned door were freezing in here the wind was rising more quickly now and long ribbons of white were beginning to streak the water wave troughs were deepening rapidly their sides steepening their tops blown off and flattened by the wind gradually but perceptibly to the ear now the thin lonely whining in the rigging was climbing steadily up the register from time to time large chunks of ice shaken loose by the increasing vibration broke off from the masts and stays and spattered on the deck below the effect of the long oilslicks trailing behind the carriers was almost miraculous the destroyers curiously mottled with oil now were still plunging astern but the surface tension of the fuel held the water and spray from breaking aboard tyndall justifiably was feeling more than pleased with himself towards halfpast four in the afternoon with shelter still a good fifteen miles away the elation had completely worn off there was a whole gale blowing now and tyndall had been compelled to signal for a reduction in speed from deck level the seas now were more than impressive they were gigantic frightening nicholls stood with the kapok kid off watch now on the main deck under the port whaler sheltering in the lee of the focsle deck nicholls clinging to a davit to steady himself and leaping back now and then to avoid a deluge of spray looked over to where the defender the vultra and viking tailing behind were pitching madly grotesquely under that serene blue sky the blue sky above the tremendous seas below there was something almost evil something literally spinechilling in that macabre contrast they never told me anything about this in the medical school nicholls observed at last my god andy he added in awe have you ever seen anything like this once just once we were caught in a typhoon off the nicobars i dont think it was as bad as this and number one says this is damn all compared to whats coming tonight and he knows god i wish i was back in henley nicholls looked at him curiously cant say i know the first lieutenant well not a veryahapproachable customer is he but everyone old giles the skipper the commander yourself they all talk about him with bated breath whats so extra special about him i respect him mind you everyone seems to but dammit to hell hes no superman seas beginning to break up the kapok kid murmured absently notice how every now and again were beginning to get a wave half as big again as the others every seventh wave the old sailors say no johnny hes not a superman just the greatest seaman youll ever see holds two masterstickets squarerigged and steam he was going round the horn in finnish barques when we were still in our prams commander could tell you enough stories about him to fill a book he paused then went on quietly he really is one of the few great seamen of today old blackbeard turner is no slouch himself but hell tell anyone that he cant hold a candle to jimmy im no heroworshipper johnny you know that but you can say about carrington what they used to say about shackleton when theres nothing left and all hope is gone get down on your knees and pray for him believe me johnny im damned glad hes here nicholls said nothing surprise held him silent for the kapok kid flippancy was a creed derogation second nature seriousness was a crime and anything that smacked of adulation bordered on blasphemy nicholls wondered what manner of man carrington must be the cold was vicious the wind was tearing great gouts of water off the wavetops driving the atomised spray at bullet speed against focsle and sides it was impossible to breathe without turning ones back without wrapping layers of wool round mouth and nose faces blue and white shaking violently with the cold neither suggested neither even thought of going below men hypnotised men fascinated by the tremendous seas the towering waves feet in length long sloping on the lee side steepwalled and terrifying on the other pushed up by a sixty knot wind and by some mighty force lying far to the northwest in these gigantic troughs a church steeple would be lost for ever both men turned round as they heard the screen door crashing behind them a duffelcoated figure cursing fluently fought to shut the heavy door against the pitching of the ulysses finally succeeded in heaving the clips home it was leading seaman doyle and even though his beard hid threequarters of what could be seen of his face he still looked thoroughly disgusted with life carpenter grinned at him he and doyle had served a commission together on the china station doyle was a very privileged person well well the ancient mariner himself how are things down below doyle bloody desperate sir his voice was as lugubrious as his face cold as charity sir and everything all over the bloody place cups saucers plates in smithereens half the crew he broke off suddenly eyes slowly widening in blank disbelief he was staring out to sea between nicholls and carpenter well what about half the crew whats the matter doyle christ almighty doyles voice was slow stunned it was almost a prayer oh christ almighty the voice rose sharply on the last two syllables the two officers twisted quickly round the defender was climbingall feet of her was literally climbing up the lee side of a wave that staggered the imagination whose immensity completely defied immediate comprehension even as they watched before shocked minds could grasp the significance of it all the defender reached the crest hesitated crazily tilted up her stern till screw and rudder were entirely clear of the water then crashed down down down even at two cablelengths distance in that high wind the explosive smash of the plummeting bows came like a thunderclap an aeon ticked by and still the defender seemed to keep on going under completely buried now right back to the bridge island in a sea of foaming white how long she remained like that arrowed down into the depths of the arctic no one could afterwards say then slowly agonisingly incredibly great rivers of water cascaded off her bows she broke surface again broke surface to present to frankly disbelieving eyes a spectacle entirely without precedent anywhere at any time the tremendous instantaneous upthrusting pressure of unknown thousands of tons of water had torn the open flightdeck completely off its mountings and bent it backwards in a great sweeping u almost as far as the bridge it was a sight to make men doubt their sanity to leave them stupefied to leave them speechless all that is except the kapok kid he rose magnificently to the occasion my word i he murmured thoughtfully that is unusual another such wave another such shattering impact and it would have been the end for the defender the finest ships the stoutest most powerful vessels are made only of thin incredibly thin sheets of metal and metal twisted and tortured as was the defenders could never have withstood another such impact but there were no more such waves no more such impacts it had been a freak wave one of these massive inexplicable contortions of the sea which have occurred with blessed infrequency from time immemorial in all the great seas of the world whenever nature wanted to show mankind an irreverent overventuresome mankind just how puny and pitifully helpless a thing mankind really is there were no more such waves and by five oclock although land was still some eight to ten miles away the squadron had moved into comparative shelter behind the tip of the langanes peninsula from time to time the captain of the defender who seemed to be enjoying himself hugely sent reassuring messages to the admiral he was making a good deal of water but he was managing nicely thank you he thought the latest shape in flightdecks very fashionable and a vast improvement on the old type straight flightdeccs lacked imagination he thought and didnt the admiral think so too the vertical type he stated provided excellent protection against wind and weather and would make a splendid sail with the wind in the right quarter with his last message to the effect that he thought that it would be rather difficult to fly off planes a badlyworried tyndall lost his temper and sent back such a blistering signal that all communications abruptly ceased shortly before six oclock the squadron hoveto under the shelter of langanes less than two miles offshore langanes is lowlying and the wind still climbing the scale swept over it and into the bay beyond without a brpak but the sea compared to an hour ago was mercifully calm although the ships still rolled heavily at once the cruisers and the screen vesselsexcept the portpatrick and the gannetmoved alongside the carriers took oil hoses aboard tyndall reluctantly and after much heartsearching had decided that the portpatrick and gannet were suspect a potential liability they were to escort the crippled carrier back to scapa exhaustion an exhaustion almost physical almost tangible lay heavily over the messdecks and the wardroom of the ulysses behind lay another sleepless night another twentyfour hours with peace unknown and rest impossible with dull tired minds men heard the broadcast that the defender the portpatrick and the gannet were to return to scapa when the weather moderated six gone now only eight lefthalf the carrier force gone little wonder that men felt sick at heart felt as if they were being deserted as if in rileys phrase they were being thrown to the wolves but there was remarkably little bitterness a puzzling lack of resentment which perhaps sprung only from sheer passive acceptance brooks was aware of it this inaction of feeling this unnatural extinction of response and was lost for a reason to account for it perhaps he thought this was the nadir the last extremity when sick men and sick minds cease altogether to function the last slowdown of all vital processes both human and animal perhaps this was just the final apathy his intellect told him that was reasonable more it was inevitable and all the time some fugitive intuition some evanescent insight was thrusting upon him an awareness a dim shadowy awareness of something altogether different but his mind was too tired to grasp it whatever it was it wasnt apathy for a brief moment that evening a whitehot anger ran through the ship like a flame then resentment of the injustice which had provoked it that there had been cause for anger even vallery admitted but his hand had been forced it had all happened simply enough during routine evening tests it had been discovered that the fighting lights on the lower yardarm were not working ice was at once suspected as being the cause the lower yardarm on this evening dazzling white and heavily coated with snow and ice paralleled the deck sixty feet above it eighty feet above the waterline the fighting lights were suspended below the outer tip to work on these a man had either to sit on the yardarma most uncomfortable position as the heavy steel wt transmission aerial was bolted to its upper lengthor in a bosuns chair suspended from the yardarm it was a difficult enough task at any time tonight it had to be done with the maximum speed because the repairs would interrupt radio transmissionthe volt steel safetotransmit boards had to be withdrawn and left in the keeping of the officer of the watch during the repair it had to be donevery precise finicky work had to be donein that subzero temperature it had to be done on that slippery glasssmooth yardarm with the ulysses rolling regularly through a thirtydegree arc the job was more than ordinarily difficult it was highly dangerous marshall did not feel justified in detailing the duty lto for the job especially as that rating was a middleaged and very much overweight reservist long past his climbing prime he asked for volunteers it was inevitable that he should have picked ralston for that was the kind of man ralston was the task took half an hour twenty minutes to climb the mast edge out to the yardarm tip fit the bosuns chair and lifeline and ten minutes for the actual repair long before he was finished a hundred two hundred tired men robbing themselves of sleep and supper had come on deck and huddled there in the bitter wind watching in fascination ralston swung in a great arc across the darkening sky the gale plucking viciously at his duffel and hood twice wind and wave flung him out still in his chair parallel to the yardarm forcing him to wrap both arms around the yardarm and hang on for his life on the second occasion he seemed to strike his face against the aerial for he held his head for a few seconds afterwards as if he were dazed it was then that he lost his gauntletshe must have had them in his lap while making some delicate adjustment they dropped down together disappeared over the side a few minutes later while vallery and turner were standing amidships examining the damage the motor boat had suffered in scapa flow a short stocky figure came hurriedly out of the after screen door made for the focsle at an awkward stumbling run he pulled up abruptly at the sight of the captain and the commander they saw it was hastings the masteratarms whats the matter hastings vallery asked curtly he always found it difficult to conceal his dislike for the masteratarms his dislike for his harshness his uncalledfor severity trouble on the bridge sir hastings jerked out breathlessly vallery could have sworn to a gleam of satisfaction in his eye dont know exactly whatcould hardly hear a thing but the wind on the phone i think youd better come sir they found only three people on the bridge etherton the gunnery officer one hand still clutching a phone worried unhappy ralston his hands hanging loosely by his sides the palms raw and torn the face ghastly the chin with the dead pallor of frostbite the forehead masked in furrowed frozen blood and lying in a corner sublieutenant carslake moaning in agony only the whites of his eyes showing stupidly fingering his smashed mouth the torn bleeding gaps in his prominent upper teeth good god vallery ejaculated good god above he stood there his hand on the gate trying to grasp tre significance of the scene before him then his mouth clamped shut and he swung round on the gunnery officer what the devils happened here etherton he demanded harshly what is all this has carslake ralston hit him sir etherton broke in dont be so bloody silly guns turner grunted exactly vallerys voice was impatient we can see that why a wt messenger came up for the safetotransmit boards carslake gave them to him about ten minutes ago ii think you think where were you etherton and why did you permit it you know very well vallery broke off short remembering the presence of ralston and the maa etherton muttered something his words were inaudible in the gale vallery bent forward what did you say etherton i was down below sir etherton was looking at the deck justjust for a moment sir i see you were down below vallerys voice was controlled now quiet and even his eyes held an expression that promised ill for etherton he looked round at turner is he badly hurt commander hell survive said turner briefly he had carslake on his feet now still moaning his hand covering his smashed mouth for the first time the captain seemed to notice ralston he looked at him for a few seconds an eternity on that bitter storm lashed bridge then spoke monosyllabic ominous thirty years of command behind the word well ralstons face was frozen expressionless his eyes never left carslake yes sir i did it i hit him the treacherous murdering bastard ralston the maas voice was a whiplash suddenly ralstons shoulders sagged with an effort he looked away from carslake looked wearily at vallery im sorry i forgot hes got a stripe on his arm only ratings are bastards vallery winced at the bitterness but he youve got frostbite rub your chin man turner interrupted sharply slowly mechanically ralston did as he was told he used the back of his hand vallery winced again as he saw the palm of the hand raw and mutilated skin and flesh hanging in strips the agony of that barehanded descent from the yardarm he tried to murder me sir it was deliberate ralston sounded tired do you realise what you are saying vallerys voice was as icy as the wind that swept over langanes but he felt the first faint chill of fear he tried to murder me sir ralston repeated tonelessly he returned the boards five minutes before i left the yardarm wt must have started transmitting just as soon as i reached the mast coming down nonsense ralston how dare you hes right sir it was etherton speaking he was replacing the receiver carefully his voice unhappy ive just checked the chill of fear settled deeper on vallerys mind almost desperately he said anyone can make a mistake ignorance may be culpable but ignorance the weariness had vanished from ralston as if it had never been he took two quick steps forward ignorance i i gave him these boards sir when i came to the bridge i asked for the officer of the watch and he said he was i didnt know the gunnery officer was on duty sir when i told him that the boards were to be returned only to me he said i dont want any of your damned insolence ralston i know my job you stick to yours just you get up there and perform your heroics he knew sir carslake burst from the commanders supporting arm turned and appealed wildly to the captain the eyes were white and staring the whole face working thats a lie sir its a damned filthy lie he mouthed the words slurred them through smashed lips i never said the words crescendoed into a coughing choking scream as ralstons fist smashed viciously terribly into the torn bubbling mouth he staggered drunkenly through the port gate crashed into the chart house slid down to lie on the deck huddled and white and still both turner and the maa had at once leapt forward to pinion the ltos arms but he made no attempt to move above and beyond the howl of the wind the bridge seemed strangely silent when vallery spoke his voice was quite expressionless commander you might phone for a couple of our marines have carslake taken down to his cabin and ask brooks to have a look at him masteratarms sir take this rating to the sick bay let him have any necessary treatment then put him in cells with an armed guard understand i understand sir there was no mistaking the satisfaction in hastingss voice vallery turner and the gunnery officer stood in silence as ralston and the maa left in silence as two burly marines carried carslake still senseless off the bridge and below vallery moved after them broke step at ethertons voice behind him sir vallery did not even turn round ill see you later etherton no sir please this is important something in the gunnery officers voice held vallery he turned back impatiently im not concerned with excusing myself sir theres no excuse the eyes were fixed steadily on vallery i was standing at the asdic door when ralston handed the boards to carslake i overheard them every word they said vallerys face became very still he glanced at turner saw that he too was waiting intently and ralstons version of the conversation in spite of himself vallerys voice was rough edged with suspense completely accurate sir the words were hardly audible in every detail ralston told the exact truth vallery closed his eyes for a moment turned slowly heavily away he made no protest as he felt turners hand under his arm helping him down the steep ladder old socrates had told him a hundred times that he carried the ship on his back he could feel the weight of it now the crushing burden of every last ounce of it vallery was at dinner with tyndall in the admirals day cabin when the message arrived sunk in private thought he gazed down at his untouched food as tyndall smoothed out the signal the admiral cleared his throat on course on time sea moderate wind freshening expect rendezvous as planned commodore he laid the signal down good god seas moderate fresh winds do you reckon hes in the same damned ocean as us vallery smiled faintly this is it sir this is it tyndall echoed he turned to the messenger make a signal you are running into severe storm rendezvous unchanged you may be delayed will remain at rendezvous until your arrival that clear enough captain should be sir radio silence oh yes add radio silence admiral th acs get it off at once will you then tell wt to shut down themselves the door shut softly tyndall poured himself some coffee looked across at vallery that boy still on your mind dick vallery smiled noncommittally lit a cigarette at once he began to cough harshly sorry sir he apologised there was silence for some time then he looked up quizzically what mad ambition drove me to become a cruiser captain he asked sadly tyndall grinned i dont envy you i seem to have heard this conversation before what are you going to do about ralston dick what would you do sir vallery countered keep him locked up till we return from russia on a breadandwater diet in irons if you like vallery smiled you never were a very good liar john tyndall laughed touche he was warmed secretly pleased rarely did richard vallery break through his selfimposed code of formality a heinous offence we all know to clout one of hm commissioned officers but if ethertons story is true my only regret is that ralston didnt give brooks a really largescale job of replanning that young swines face its true all right im afraid said vallery soberly what it amounts to is that naval discipline oh how old starr would love this compels me to punish a would be murderers victim i he broke off in a fresh paroxysm of coughing and tyndall looked away he hoped the distress wasnt showing in his face the pity and anger he felt that vallery that very perfect gentle knight the finest gentleman and friend he had ever known should be coughing his heart out visibly dying on his feet because of the blind inhumanity of an sno in london two thousand miles away a victim vallery went on at last who has already lost his mother brother and three sisters i believe he has a father at sea somewhere and carslake i shall see him tomorrow i should like you to be there sir i will tell him that he will remain an officer of this ship till we return to scapa then resign his commission i dont think hed care to appear at a court martial even as a witness he finished dryly not if hes sane which i doubt tyndall agreed a sudden thought struck him do you think he is sane he frowned carslake vallery hesitated yes i think so sir at least he was brooks isnt so sure says he didnt like the look of him tonight something queer about him he thinks and in these abnormal conditions small provocations are magnified out of all proportion vallery smiled briefly not that carslake is liable to regard the twin assaults on pride and person as a small provocation tyndall nodded agreement hell bear watching oh damn i wish the ship would stay still half my coffee on the tablecloth young spicer he looked towards the pantry will be as mad as hell nineteen years old and a regular tyrant i thought these would be sheltered waters dick so they are compared to whats waiting for us listen he cocked his head to the howling of the wind outside lets see what the weather man has to say about it he reached for the desk phone asked for the transmitting station after a brief conversation he replaced the receiver ts says the anemometer is going crazy ousting up to eighty knots still northwest temperature steady at ten below he shivered ten below then looked consideringly at tyndall barometer almost steady at what thats what they say its impossible but thats what they say he glanced at his wristwatch fortyfive minutes sir this is a very complicated way of committing suicide they were silent for a minute then tyndall spoke for both of them answering the question in both their minds we must go dick we must and by the way our fireeating young captain cd the doughty orr wants to accompany us in the sirrus well let him tag along a while he has things to learn that young man at all ships had completed oiling hove to they had had the utmost difficulty in keeping position in that great wind but they were infinitely safer than in the open sea they were given orders to proceed when the weather moderated the defender and escorts to scapa the squadron to a position miles ene of rendezvous radio silence was to be strictly observed at the ulysses and sirrus got under way to the east lights winked after them messages of good luck fluently tyndall cursed the squadron for the breach of darkenship regulations realised that barring themselves there was no one on gods earth to see the signals anyway and ordered a courteous acknowledgment at still two miles short of langanes point the sirrus was plunging desperately in mountainous seas shipping great masses of water over her entire focsle and main deck and in the darkness looking far less like a destroyer than a porpoising submarine at at reduced speed she was observed to be moving in close to such slight shelter as the land afforded there at the same time her sixinch aldis flashed her signal screen doors stove in a turret not tracking flooding port boilerroom intake fans and on the sirruss bridge commander orr swore in chagrin as he received the ulyssess final message lesson without words no rejoin squadron at once you cant come out to play with the big boys but he swallowed his disappointment signalled wilco just you wait till i grow up pulled the sirrus round in a madly swinging halfcircle and headed thankfully back for shelter aboard the flagship it was lost to sight almost immediately at the ulysses moved out into the denmark strait chapter six tuesday night it was the worst storm of the war beyond all doubt had the records been preserved for admiralty inspection that would have proved to be incomparably the greatest storm the most tremendous convulsion of nature since these recordings began living memory aboard the ulysses that night a vast accumulation of experience in every corner of the globe could certainly recall nothing even remotely like it nothing that would even begin to bear comparison as a parallel or precedent at ten oclock with all doors and hatches battened shut with all traffic prohibited on the upper deck with all crews withdrawn from gunturrets and magazines and all normal deck watchkeeping stopped for the first time since her commissioning even the taciturn carrington admitted that the caribbean hurricanes of the autumns of and when hed run out of searoom been forced to heaveto in the dangerous righthand quadrant of both these murderous cycloneshad been no worse than this but the two ships he had taken through thesea ton tramp and a superannuated tanker on the new york asphalt runhad not been in the same class for seaworthiness as the ulysses he had little doubt as to her ability to survive but what the first lieutenant did not know what nobody had any means of guessing was that this howling gale was still only the deadly overture like some mindless and dreadful beast from an ancient and other world the polar monster crouched on its own doorstep waiting at the ulysses crossed the arctic circle the monster struck it struck with a feral ferocity with an appalling savagery that smashed minds and bodies into a stunned unknowingness its claws were hurtling rapiers of ice that slashed across a mans face and left it welling red its teeth were that subzero wind gusting over knots that ripped and tore through the tissue paper of arctic clothing and sunk home to the bone its voice was the devils orchestra the roar of a great wind mingled with the banshee shrieking of tortured rigging a requiem for fiends its weight was the crushing power of the hurricane wind that pinned a man helplessly to a bulkhead fighting for breath or flung him off his feet to crash in some distant corner brokenlimbed and senseless baulked of prey in its mile sweep across the frozen wastes of the greenland icecap it goaded the cruel sea into homicidal alliance and flung itself titanic in its energy ravenous in its howling upon the cockleshell that was the ulysses the ulysses should have died then nothing built by man could ever have hoped to survive she should just have been pressed under to destruction or turned turtle or had her back broken or disintegrated under these mighty hammerblows of wind and sea but she did none of these things how she ever survived the insensate fury of that first attack god only knew the great wind caught her on the bow and flung her round in a arc and pressed her far over on her side as she fellliterally fellforty heartstopping feet over and down the precipitous walls of a giant trough she crashed into the valley with a tremendous concussion that jarred every plate every clydebuilt rivet in her hull the vibration lasted an eternity as overstressed metal fought to readjust itself as steel compressed and stretched far beyond specified breaking loads miraculously she held but the sands were running out she lay far over on her starboard side the gunwales dipping half a mile away towering high above the masttop a great wall of water was roaring down on the helpless ship the dude saved the day the dude alternatively known as persil but officially as engineercommander dodson immaculately clad as usual in overalls of the most dazzling white had been at his control position in the engineroom when that tremendous gust had struck he had no means of knowing what had happened he had no means of knowing that the ship was not under command that no one on the bridge had as yet recovered from that first shattering impact he had no means of knowing that the quartermaster had been thrown unconscious into a corner of the wheelhouse that his mate almost a child in years was too panicstricken to dive for the madlyspinning wheel but he did know that the ulysses was listing crazily almost broadside on and he suspected the cause his shouts on the bridge tube brought no reply he pointed to the port controls roared slow in the ear of the engineer wo then leapt quickly for the starboard wheel fifteen seconds later and it would have been too late as it was the accelerating starboard screw brought her round just far enough to take that roaring mountain of water under her bows to dig her stern in to the level of the depthcharge rails till forty feet of her airborne keel lay poised above the abyss below when she plunged down again tnat same shuddering vibration enveloped the entire hull the focsle disappeared far below the surface the sea flowing over and past the armoured side of aturret but she was bows on again at once the dude signalled his wo for more revolutions cut back the starboard engine below decks everything was an unspeakable shambles on the mess decks steel lockers in their scores had broken adrift been thrown in a dozen different directions bursting hasps and locks spilling their contents everywhere hammocks had been catapulted from their racks smashed crockery littered the decks tables were twisted and smashed broken stools stuck up at crazy angles books papers teapots kettles and crockery were scattered in insane profusion and amidst this jumbled sliding wreckage hundreds of shouting cursing frightened and exhausted men struggled to their feet or knelt or sat or just lay still surgeoncommander brooks and lieutenant nicholls with an inspired untiring padre as good as a third doctor were worked off their feet the veteran leading sba johnson oddly enough was almost uselesshe was violently sick much of the time seemed to have lost all heart no one knew why it was just one of these things and he had taken all he could men were brought in to the sick bay in their dozens in their scores a constant trek that continued all night long as the ulysses fought for her life a trek that soon overcrowded the meagre space available and turned the wardroom into an emergency hospital bruises cuts dislocations concussions fracturesthe exhausted doctors experienced everything that night serious injuries were fortunately rare and inside three hours there were only nine bedpatients in the sick bay including ab ferry his already mangled arm smashed in two placesa bitterly protesting riley and his fellowmutineers had been unceremoniously turfed out to make room for the more seriously injured about nicholls was called to treat the kapok kid lurching falling and staggering in the wildly gyrating ship he finally found the navigator in his cabin he looked very unhappy nicholls eyed him speculatively saw the deep ugly gash on his forehead the swollen ankle peeping out below the kapok kids martian survival suit bad enough but hardly a borderline case although one wouldnt have thought so from the miserable worried expression nicholls grinned inwardly well horatio he said unkindly whats supposed to be the matter with you been drinking again its my back johnny he muttered he turned facedown on the bunk have a look at it will you nicholls expression changed he moved forward then stopped short how the hell can i he demanded irritably when youre wearing that damned ugly suit of yours that what i mean said the kapok kid anxiously i was thrown against the searchlight controls all knobs and nasty sharp projections is it torn is it ripped cut in any way are the seams well for gods sake do you mean to tell me nicholls sank back incredulously on a locker the kapok kid looked at him hopefully does that mean its all right of course its all right if its a blasted tailor you want why the hell enough the kapok kid swung briskly on to the side of his bunk lifting an admonitory hand there is work for you sawbones he touched his bleeding forehead stitch this up and waste no time about it a man of my calibre is urgently needed on the bridge im the only man on this ship who has the faintest idea where we are busy with a swab nicholls grinned and where are we i dont know said the kapok kid frankly thats whats so urgent about it but i do know where i was back in henley did i ever tell you the ulysses did not die time and again that night hove to with the wind fine of her starboard bow as her bows crashed into and under the far shoulder of a trough it seemed that she could never shake free from the great press of water but time and again she did just that shuddering i quivering under the fantastic strain a thousand times before dawn officers and men blessed the genius of the clyde shipyard that had made her a thousand times they cursed the blind malevolence of that great storm that put the ulysses on the rack perhaps blind was not the right word the storm wielded its wild hate with an almost human cunning shortly after the first onslaught the wind had veered quickly incredibly so and in defiance of all the laws back almost to the north again the ulysses was on a lee shore forced to keep pounding into gigantic seas gigantic and cunning also roaring by the ulysses a huge comber would suddenly whip round and crash on deck smashing a boat to smithereens inside an hour the barge motor boat and two whalers were gone their shattered timbers swept away in the boiling cauldron carley rafts were broken off by the sudden hammerblows of the same cunning waves swept over the side and gone for ever four of the balsa floats went the same way but the most cunning attack of all was made right aft on the poopdeck at the height of the storm a series of heavy explosions half a dozen in as many seconds almost lifted the stern out of the water panic spread like wildfire in the after messdecks practically every light abaft the after engineroom smashed or failed in the darkness of the messdecks above the clamour highpitched cries of torpedoed mined shes breaking up galvanised exhausted injured men even thosemore than halfin various degrees of prostration from seasickness into frantic stampeding towards doors and hatches only to find doors and hatches jammed solidly by the intense cold here and there the automatic battery lamps had clicked on when the lighting circuits failed glowing little pinpoints they played on isolated groups of white contorted faces sunkeneyed and straining as they struggled through the yellow pools of light conditions were ripe for disaster when a voice harsh mocking cut cleanly through the bedlam the voice was ralstons he had been released before nine oclock on the captains orders the cells were in the very forepeak of the ship and conditions there were impossible in a head sea even so hastings had freed him only with the worst possible grace its our own depth charges do you hear me you bloody fools its our own depth charges it was not so much the words as the biting mockery that stopped short the panic halted dazed unthinking men in their tracks theyre our depth charges i tell you they must have been washed over the side he was right the entire contents of a rack had broken adrift lifted from their cradles by some freak wave and tumbled over the side through some oversight they had been left set at their shallow setting those put on for the midget submarine in scapa and had gone off almost directly under the ship the damage it seemed was only minor up in a mess deck right forard conditions were even worse there was more wreckage on the decks and far more seasicknessnot the greenfaced slightly ludicrous malaise of the crosschannel steamer but tearing rendering conversions dark and heavy with bloodfor the bows had been rearing and plunging rearing and plunging thirty forty fifty feet at a time for endless hopeless hours but there was an even more sinister agent at work rapidly making the messdeck untenable at the forard end of the capstan flat which adjoined the messdeck was the batteryroom in here were stored or on charge a hundred and one different batteries ranging from the heavy leadacid batteries weighing over a hundred pounds to the tiny nickelcalmium cells for the emergency lighting here too were stored earthenware jars of prepared acid and big glass carboys of undiluted sulphuric these last were permanently stored in heavy weather the big batteries were lashed down no one knew what had happened it seemed likelycertain indeedthat acid spilt from the batteries by the tremendous pitching had eaten through the lashings then a battery must have broken loose and smashed another and another and another and then the jars and carboys until the entire floorfortunately of acidresisting materialwas awash to a depth of five or six inches in sulphuric acid a young torpedoman on a routine check had opened the door and seen the splashing sea of acid inside panicking and recalling vaguely that caustic soda stored in quantities just outside was a neutraliser for sulphuric he had emptied a fortypound carton of it into the batteryroom he was in the sick bay now blinded the acid fumes saturated the capstan flat making entry impossible without breathing equipment and was seeping back slowly insidiously into the messdeck more deadly still hundreds of gallons of salt water from sprung deckplates and broken capstan speaking tubes were surging crazily around the flat already the air was tainted with the first traces of chlorine gas on the deck immediately above hartley and two seamen belayed with ropes had made a brief hopelessly gallant attempt to plug the gaping holes all three battered into near senselessness by the great waves pounding the focsle were dragged off within a minute for the men below it was discomfort danger and desperate physical illness for the bare handful of men above the officers and ratings on the bridge it was pure undiluted hell but a hell not of our latterday imagining a strictly eastern and biblical conception but the hell of our ancient northeuropean ancestors of the vikings the danes the jutes of beowulf and the monsterhaunted meresthe hell of eternal cold true the temperature registered a mere below zero of frost men have been known to live even to work in the open at far lower temperatures what is not so well known what is barely realised at all is that when freezing point has been passed every extra mile per hour of wind is equivalent in terms of pure cold as it reacts on a human being to a drop in temperature not once but several times that night before it had finally raced itself to destruction the anemometer had recorded gusts of over mph waveflattening gusts that sundered stays and all but tore the funnels off for minutes on end the shrieking screaming wind held steady at mph and above the total equivalent for these numbed paralysed creatures on the bridge of something well below a below zero five minutes at a time was enough for any man on the bridge then he had to retire to the captains shelter not that manning the bridge was more than a gesture anyway it was impossible to look into that terrible wind the cold would have seared the eyeballs blind the ice would have gouged them out and it was impossible even to see through the kent clearview windscreens they still spun at high speed but uselessly the iceladen storm a gigantic sandblaster had starred and abraded the plate glass until it was completely opaque it was not a dark night it was possible to see above abeam and astern above patches of nightblue sky and handfuls of stars could be seen at fleeting intervals obscured as soon as seen by the scudding shredded cloudwrack abeam and astern the sea was an inky black laced with boiling white gone now were the serried ranks of yesterday gone too the decorative whitecaps here now were only massive mountains of water broken and confused breaking this way and that but always tending south some of these moving ranges of waterby no stretch of the imagination only by proxy could they be called waveswere small insignificantin size of a suburban house others held a million tons of water towered seventy to eighty feet looming terrifyingly against the horizon big enough to drown a cathedral as the kapok kid remarked the best thing to do with these waves was to look the other way more often than not they passed harmlessly by plunging the ulysses into the depths rarely they curled over and broke their tops into the bridge soaking the unfortunate officer of the watch he had then to be removed at once or he would literally have frozen solid within a minute so far they had survived far beyond the expectation of any man but as they were blind ahead there was always the worry of what would come next would the next sea be normalfor that storm that wasor some nameless juggernaut that would push them under for ever the suspense never lifted a suspense doubled by the fact that when the ulysses reared and crashed down it did so soundlessly sightlessly they could judge its intensity only by movement and vibration the sound of the sea everything was drowned in the satanic cacophony of that howling wind in the upper works and rigging about two in the morningit was just after the depthcharge explosionssome of the senior officers had staged their own private mutiny the captain who had been persuaded to go below less than an hour previously exhausted and shaking uncontrollably with cold had been wakened by the depthcharging and had returned to the bridge he found his way barred by the commander and commander westcliffe who bundled him quietly but firmly into the shelter turner heaved the door to switched on the light vallery was more puzzled than angry what what in the world does this mean he demanded mutiny boomed turner happily his face was covered in blood from flying splinters of ice on the high seas is the technical term i believe isnt that so admiral exactly the admiral agreed vallery swung round startled tyndall was lying in state on the bunk mind you ive no jurisdiction over a captain in his own ship but i cant see a thing he lay back on the bunk eyes elaborately closed in seeming exhaustion only tyndall knew that he wasnt pretending vallery said nothing he stood there clutching a handrail his face grey and haggard his eyes bloodred and drugged with sleep turner felt a knife twist inside him as he looked at him when he spoke his voice was low and earnest so unusual for him that he caught and held vallerys attention sir this is no night for a naval captain danger from any quarter except the sea itself just doesnt exist agreed vallery nodded silently its a night for a seaman sir with all respect i suggest that neither of us is in the class of carrington hes just a different breed of man nice of you to include yourself commander vallery murmured and quite unnecessary the first lieutenant will remain on the bridge all night so will westcliffe here so will i me too grunted tyndall but im going to sleep he looked almost as tired as haggard as vallery turner grinned thank you sir well captain im afraid its going to be a bit overcrowded here tonight well see you after breakfast but but me no buts westcliffe murmured please turner insisted you will do us a favour vallery looked at him as captain of the ulysses his voice tailed off i dont know what to say i do said turner briskly his hand on vallerys elbow lets go below dont think i can manage by myself eh vallery smiled faintly i do but im taking no chances come along sir all right all right he sighed tiredly anything for a quiet life and a nights sleep i reluctantly with a great effort lieutenant nicholls dragged himself up from the mistfogged depths of exhausted sleep slowly reluctantly he opened his eyes the ulysses he realised was still rolling as heavily plunging as sickeningly as ever the kapok kid forehead swathed in bandages the rest of his face pocked with blood was bending over him he looked disgustingly cheerful hark hark the lark etcetera the kapok kid grinned and how are we this morning he mimicked unctuously the hon carpenter held the medical profession in low esteem nicholls focused blurred eyes on him whats the matter andy anything wrong with messrs carrington and carpenter in charge said the kapok kid loftily nothing could be wrong want to come up top see carrington do his stuff hes going to turn the ship round in this little lot it should be worth seeing what dammit to belli have you woken me just brother when this ship turns you would wake up anyway probably on the deck with a broken neck but as it so happens jimmy requires your assistance at least he requires one of these heavy plateglass squares which i happen to know you have in great numbers in the dispensary but the dispensarys locked i tried it he added shamelessly but what i mean plate glass come and see for yourself the kapok kid invited it was dawn now a wild and terrible dawn fit epilogue for a nightmare strange trailing bands of mistywhite vapour swept by barely at masttop level but high above the sky was clear the seas still gigantic were shorter now much shorter and even steeper the ulysses was slowed right down with barely enough steerage way to keep her head up and even then taking severe punishment in the precipitous head seas the wind had dropped to a steady fifty knots gale force even at that it seared like fire in nichollss lungs as he stepped out on the flapdeck blinded him with ice and cold hastily he wrapped scarves over his entire face clambered up to the bridge by touch and instinct the kapok kid followed with the glass as they climbed they heard the loudspeakers crackling some unintelligible message turner and carrington were alone on the twflit bridge swathed like mummies not even their eyes were visible they wore goggles morning nicholls boomed the commander it is nicholls isnt it he pulled off his goggles his back turned to the bitter wind threw them away in disgust cant see damn all through these bloody things ah number one hes got the glass nicholls crouched in the forard lee of the compass platform in a corner the duckboards were littered with goggles eyeshields and gasmasks he jerked his head towards them whats this a clearance sale were turning round doc it was carrington who answered his voice calm and precise as ever without a trace of exhaustion but weve got to see where were going and as the commander says all these damn things there are useless mist up immediately theyre put on its too cold if youll just hold it so and if you would wipe it andy nicholls looked at the great seas he shuddered excuse my ignorance but why turn round at all because it will be impossible very shortly carrington answered briefly then he chuckled this is going to make me the most unpopular man in the ship weve just broadcast a warning ready sir stand by engineroom stand by wheelhouse ready number one for thirty seconds fortyfive a whole minute carrington stared steadily unblinkingly through the glass nichollss hands froze the kapok kid rubbed industriously then halfahead port halfahead port turner echoed starboard starboard nicholls risked a glance over his shoulder in the split second before bis eyes blinded filled with tears he saw a huge wave bearing down on them the bows already swinging diagonally away from it good godl why hadnt carrington waited until that was past the great wave flung the bows up pushed the ulysses far over to starboard then passed under the ulysses staggered over the top corkscrewed wickedly down the other side her masts great gleaming tree trunks thick and heavy with ice swinging in a great arc as she rolled over burying her port rails in the rising shoulder of the next sea fullahead port full ahead port starboard starboard the next sea passing beneath merely straightened the ulysses up and then at last nicholls understood incredibly because it had been impossible to see so far ahead carrington had known that two opposing wave systems were due to interlock in an area of comparative calm how he had sensed it no one knew would ever know not even carrington himself but he was a great seaman and he had known for fifteen twenty seconds the sea was a seething white mass of violently disturbed conflicting wavesof the type usually found on a small scale in tidal races and overfallsand the ulysses curved gratefully through and then another great sea towering almost to bridge height caught her on the far turn of the quarter circle it struck the entire length of the ulysses for the first time that night with tremendous weight it threw her far over on her side the lee rails vanishing nicholls was flung off his feet crashed heavily into the side of the bridge the glass shattering he could have sworn he heard carrington laughing he clawed his way back to the middle of the compass platform and still the great wave had not passed it towered high above the trough into which the ulysses now heeeled far over to had been so contemptuously flung bore down remorselessly from above and sought in a lethal silence and with an almost animistic savagery to press her under the inclinometer swung relentlessly over and hung there an eternity while men stood on the side of the ship braced with their hands on the deck numbed minds barely grasping the inevitable this was the end the ulysses could never come back a lifetime ticked agonisingly by nicholls and carpenter looked at each other blankfaced expressionless tilted at that crazy angle the bridge was sheltered from the wind carringtons voice calm conversational carried with amazing clarity shed go to and still come back he said matteroffactly hang on to your hats gentlemen this is going to be interesting just as he finished the ulysses shuddered then imperceptibly then slowly then with vicious speed lurched back and whipped through an arc of then back again once more nicholls found himself in the corner of the bridge but the ulysses was almost round the kapok kid grinning with relief picked himself up and tapped carrington on the shoulder dont look now sir but we have lost our mainmast it was a slight exaggeration but the top fifteen feet which had carried the after radar scanner were undoubtedly gone that wicked double whiplash with the weight of the ice had been too much slow ahead both midships slow ahead both midships steady as she goes the ulysses was round the kapok kid caught nichollss eye nodded at the first lieutenant see what i mean johnny yes nicholls was very quiet yes i see what you mean then he grinned suddenly next time you make a statement ill just take your word for it if you dont mind these demonstrations of proof take too damn much out of a person running straight before the heavy stern sea the ulysses was amazingly steady the wind too was dead astern now the bridge in magical shelter the scudding mist overhead had thinned out was almost gone far away to the southeast a dazzling white sun climbed up above a cloudless horizon the long night was over an hour later with the wind down to thirty knots radar reported contacts to the west after another hour with the wind almost gone and only a heavy swell running smoke plumes tufted above the horizon at in position on time the ulysses rendezvoused with the convoy from halifax chapter seven wednesday night the convoy came steadily up from the west rolling heavily in cross seas a rich argosy a magnificent prize for any german wolfpack eighteen ships in this argosy fifteen big modern cargo ships three ton tankers carrying a freight far more valuable infinitely more vital than any fleet of quinqueremes or galleons had ever known tanks planes and petrolwhat were gold and jewels silks and the rarest of spices compared to these ј јthe total worth of that convoy was difficult to estimate in any event its real value was not to be measured in terms of money aboard the merchant ships crews lined the decks as the ulysses steamed up between the port and centre lines lined the decks and looked and wonderedand thanked their maker they had been wide of the path of that great storm the ulysses seen from another deck was a strange sight brokenmasted stripped of her rafts with her boat falls hauled taut over empty cradles she glistened like crystal in the morning light the great wind had blown away all snow had abraded and rubbed and polished the ice to a satinsmooth transparent gloss but on either side of the bows and before the bridge were huge patches of crimson where the hurricane sandblaster of that long night had stripped off camouflage and base coats exposing the red lead below the american escort was small a heavy cruiser with a seaplane for spotting two destroyers and two near frigates of the coastguard type small but sufficient there was no need of escort carriers because the luftwaffe could not operate so far west and the wolfpacks in recent months had moved north and east of iceland there they were not only nearer basethey could more easily lie astride the converging convoy routes to murmansk ene they sailed in company freighters american warships and the ulysses until late in the afternoon the boxlike silhouette of an escort carrier bulked high against the horizon half an hour later at the american escorts slowed dropped astern and turned winking farewell messages of good luck aboard the ulysses men watched them depart with mixed feelings they knew these ships had to go that another convoy would already be mustering off the st lawrence there was none of the envy the bitterness one might expectand had indeed been common enough only a few weeks agoamong these exhausted men who carried the brunt of the war there was instead a careless acceptance of things as they were a quasicynical bravado often a queer high nameless pride that hid itself beneath twisted jests and endless grumbling the th aircraft carrier squadronor what was left of itwas only two miles away now tyndall coming to the bridge swore fluently as he saw that a carrier and minesweeper were missing an angry signal went out to captain jeffries of the stirling asking why orders had been disobeyed where the missing ships were an aldis nickered back its reply tyndall sat grimfaced and silent as bentley read out the signal to him the wrestlers steering gear had broken down during the night even behind langanes the weather position had been severe had worsened about midnight when the wind had veered to the north the wrestler even with two screws had lost almost all steering command and in zero visibility and an effort to maintain position had gone too far ahead and grounded on the vejle bank she had grounded on the top of the tide she had still been there with the minesweeper eager in attendance when the squadron had sailed shortly after dawn tyndall sat in silence for some minutes he dictated a wt signal to the wrestler hesitated about breaking radio silence countermanded the signal and decided to go to see for himself after all it was only three hours steaming distance he signalled the stirling take over squadron command will rejoin in the morning and ordered vallery to take the ulysses back to langanes vallery nodded unhappily gave the necessary orders he was worried badly so was trying hard not to show it the least of his worries was himself although he knew but never admitted to anyone that he was a very sick man he thought wryly that he didnt have to admit it anywayhe was amused and touched by the elaborate casualness with which his officers sought to lighten his load to show their concern for him he was worried too about his crewthey were in no fit state to do the lightest work to survive that killing cold far less sail the ship and fight her through to russia he was depressed also over the series of misfortunes that had befallen the squadron since leaving scapa it augured ill for the future and he had no illusions as to what lay ahead for the crippled squadron and always a gnawing torment at the back of his mind he worried about ralston ralstonthat tall throwback to his scandinavian ancestors with his flaxen hair and still blue eyes ralston whom nobody understood with whom nobody on the ship had an intimate friendship who went his own unsmiling selfpossessed way ralston who had nothing left to fight for except memories who was one of the most reliable men in the ulysses extraordinarily decisive competent and resourceful in any emergencyand who again found himself under lock and key and for nothing that any reasonable and just man could call fault of his own on the bridge of the ulysses tyndall watched the carrier vanish into the night zigzagging as the captain tried to balance the steering on the two screws no doubt theyll get the hang of it before they get to scapa he growled he felt cold exhausted and only the way an admiral can feel when he has lost threequarters of his carrier force he sighed wearily and turned to vallery when do you reckon well overtake the convoy vallery hesitated not so the kapok kid he answered readily and precisely at twentyseven knots on the intersection course ive just pencilled out oh my god tyndall groaned that stripling again what did i ever do to deserve him as it happens young man its imperative that we overtake before dawn yes sir the kapok kid was imperturbable i thought so myself on my alternative course knots thirty minutes before dawn i thought so myself take him away tyndall raved take him away or ill wrap his damned dividers round he broke off climbed stiffly out of his chair took vallery by the arm come on captain lets go below what the hells the use of a couple of ancient hasbeens like us getting in the way of youth he passed out the gate behind the captain grinning tiredly to himself the ulysses was at dawn action stations as the shadowy shapes of the convoy a bare mile ahead lifted out of the greying gloom the great bulk of the blue ranger on the starboard quarter of the convoy was unmistakable there was a moderate swell running but not enough to be uncomfortable the breeze was light from the west the temperature just below zero the sky chill and cloudless the time was exactly at the blue ranger was torpedoed the ulysses was two cablelengths away on her starboard quarter those on the bridge felt the physical shock of the twin explosions heard them shattering the stillness of the dawn as they saw two searing columns of flame fingering skywards high above the blue rangers bridge and well aft of it a second later they heard a signalman shouting something unintelligible saw him pointing forwards and downwards it was another torpedo running astern of the carrier trailing its evil phosphorescent wake across the heels of the convoy before spending itself in the darkness of the arctic vallery was shouting down the voicepipe pulling round the ulysses still doing upwards of twenty knots in a madly heeling skidding turn to avoid collision with the slewing carrier three sets of aldis lamps and the fighting lights were already stuttering out the maintain position code signal to ships in the convoy marshall on the phone was giving the standby order to the depthcharge lto gun barrels were already depressing peering hungrily into the treacherous sea the signal to the sirrus stopped short unneeded the destroyer a halfseen blue in the darkness was already knifing its way through the convoy white water piled high at its bows headed for the estimated position of the uboat the ulysses sheered by parallel to the burning carrier less than feet away travelling so fast heeling so heavily and at such close range it was impossible to gather more than a blurred impression a tangled confused memory of heavy black smoke laced with roaring columns of flame appalling in that neardarkness of a drunkenly listing flightdeck of grummans and corsairs cartwheeling grotesquely over the edge to splash icy clouds of spray in shocked faces as the cruiser slewed away and then the ulysses was round heading back south for the kill within a minute the signallamp of tine vectra up front with the convoy started winking contact green closing contact green closing acknowledge tyndall ordered briefly the aldis had barely begun to clack when the vectra cut through the signal contacts repeat contacts green green closing very close repeat contacts contacts tyndall cursed softly acknowledge investigate he turned to vallery lets join him captain this is it wolfpack number oneand in force no bloody right to be here he added bitterly so much for admiralty intelligence the ulysses was round again heading for the vectra it should have been growing lighter now but the blue ranger her squadron fuel tanks on fire a gigantic torch against the eastern horizon had the curious effect of throwing the surrounding sea into heavy darkness she lay almost athwart of the flagships course for the vectra looming larger every minute tyndall had his night glasses to his eyes kept on muttering the poor bastards the poor bastards the blue ranger was almost gone she lay dead in the water heeled far over to starboard ammunition and petrol tanks going up in a constant series of crackling reports suddenly a succession of dull heavy explosions rumbled over the sea the entire bridge island structure lurched crazily sideways held then slowly ponderously deliberately the whole massive body of it toppled majestically into the glacial darkness of the sea god only knew how many men perished with it deep down in the arctic trapped in its iron walls they were the lucky ones the vectra barely two miles ahead now was pulling round south in a tight circle vallery saw her altered course to intercept he heard bentley shouting something unintelligible from the fore corner of the compass platform vallery shook his head heard him shouting again his voice desperate with some nameless urgency his arm pointing frantically over the windscreen and leapt up beside him the sea was on fire flat calm burdened with hundreds of tons of fuel oil it was a vast carpet of licking twisting flames that much for a second and that only vallery saw then with heartstopping shock with physically sickening abruptness he saw something else again the burning sea was alive with swimming struggling men not a handful not even dozens but literally hundreds soundlessly screaming agonisingly dying in the barbarous contrariety of drowning and cremation signal from vectra sir it was bentley speaking his voice abnormally matteroffact depthcharging repeat contacts request immediate assistance tyndall was at vallerys side now he heard bentley looked a long second at vallery following his sick fascinated gaze into the sea ahead for a man in the sea oil is an evil thing it clogs his movements burns his eyes sears his lungs and tears away his stomach in uncontrollable paroxysms of retching but oil on fire is a hellish thing death by torture a slow shrieking death by drowning by burning by asphyxiationfor the flames devour all the lifegiving oxygen on the surface of the sea and not even in the bitter arctic is there the merciful extinction by cold for the insulation of an oilsoaked body stretches a dying man on the rack for eternity carefully preserves him for the last excruciating refinement of agony all this vallery knew he knew too that for the ulysses to stop starkly outlined against the burning carrier would have been suicide and to come sharply round to starboard even had there been time and room to clear the struggling dying men in the sea ahead would have wasted invaluable minutes time and to spare for the uboats ahead to line up firingtracks on the convoy and the ulyssess first responsibilty was to the convoy again all this vallery knew but at that moment what weighed most heavily with him was common humanity fine off the port bow close in to the blue ranger the oil was heaviest the flames fiercest the swimmers thickest vallery looked back over his shoulder at the officer of the watch port port sir midships midships sir steady as she goes for ten fifteen seconds the ulysses held her course arrowing through the burning sea to the spot where some gregariously atavistic instinct for selfpreservation held two hundred men knotted together in a writhing seething mass gasping out their lives in hideous agony for a second a great gout of flame leapt up in the centre of the group like a giant incandescent magnesium flare a flame that burnt the picture into the hearts and minds of the men on the bridge with a permanence and searing clarity that no photographic plate could ever have reproduced men on fire human torches beating insanely at the flames that licked scorched and then incinerated clothes hair and skin men flinging themselves almost out of the water backs arched like tautened bows grotesque in convulsive crucifixion men lying dead in the water insignificant featureless little oilstained maunds in an oilsoaked plain and a handful of fearmaddened men faces inhumanly contorted who saw the ulysses and knew what was coming as they frantically thrashed their way to a safety that offered only a few more brief seconds of unspeakable agony before they gladly died starboard vallerys voice was low barely a murmur but it carried clearly through the shocked silence on the bridge starboard sir for the third time in ten minutes the ulysses slewed crazily round in a racing turn turning thus a ship does not follow through the line of the bows cutting the water there is a pronounced sideways or lateral motion and the faster and sharper the turn the more violent the broadside skidding motion like a car on ice the side of the ulysses still at an cttte attgte caught the edge of the group on the port bow almost on the instant the entire length of the swinging hull smashed into the heart of the fire into the thickest press of dying men for most of them it was just extinction swift and glad and merciful the tremendous concussion and pressure waves crushed the life out of them thrust them deep down into the blessed oblivion of drowning thrust them down and sucked them back into the thrashing vortex of the four great screws on board the ulysses men for whom death and destruction had become the stuff of existence to be accepted with the callousness and jesting indifference that alone kept them sanethese men clenched impotent fists mouthed meaningless useless curses over and over again and wept heedlessly like little children they wept as pitiful charred faces turned up towards the ulysses and alight with joy and hope petrified into incredulous staring horror as realisation dawned and the water closed over them as hatefilled men screamed insane invective both arms raised aloft shaking fists whiteknuckled through the dripping oil as the ulysses trampled them under as a couple of young boys were sucked into the maelstrom of the propellers still giving the thumbsup sign as a particularly shocking case who looked as if he had been barbecued on a spit and had no right to be alive lifted a scorified hand to the blackened hole that had been his mouth flung to the bridge a kiss in token of endless gratitude and wept oddly most of all at the inevitable humorist who lifted his fur cap high above his head and bowed gravely and deeply his face into the water as he died suddenly mercifully the sea was empty the air was strangely still and quiet heavy with the sickening stench of charred flesh and burning diesel and the ulyssess stern was swinging wildly almost under the black pall overhanging the blue ranger amidships when the shells struck her the shellsthree scame from the blue ranger certainly no living guncrews manned these sthe heat must have ignited the bridge fuses in the cartridge cases the first shell exploded harmlessly against the armourplating the second wrecked the bosuns store fortunately empty the third penetrated no low power room via the deck there were nine men in therean officer seven ratings and chieftorpedo gunners mate noyes in that confined space death was instantaneous only seconds later a heavy rumbling explosion blew out a great hole along the waterline of the blue ranger and she fell slowly wearily right over on her starboard side her flightdeck vertical to the water as if content to die now that dying she had lashed out at the ship that had destroyed her crew on the bridge vallery still stood on the yeomans platform leaning over the starred opaque windscreen his head hung down his eyes were shut and he was retching desperately the gushing bloodarterial bloodominously bright and scarlet in the erubescent glare of the sinking carrier tyndall stood there helplessly beside him not knowing what to do his mind numbed and sick suddenly he was brushed unceremoniously aside by the surgeoncommander who pushed a white towel to vallerys mouth and led him gently below old brooks everyone knew should have been at his action stations position in the sick bay no one dared say anything carrington straightened the ulysses out on course while he waited for turner to move up from the after director tower to take over the bridge in three minutes the cruiser was up with the vectra methodically quartering for a lost contact twice the ships regained contact twice they dropped heavy patterns a heavy oil slick rose to the surface possibly a kill probably a ruse but in any event neither ship could remain to investigate further the convoy was two miles ahead now and only the stirling and viking were there for its protectiona wholly inadequate cover and powerless to save the convoy from any determined attack it was the blue ranger that saved fr in these high latitudes dawn comes slowly interminably even so it was more than halfligljt and the merchant ships line ahead through that very gentle swell lifted clear and sharp against a cloudless horizon a uboat commanders dreamor would have been had he been able to see them but by this time the convoy was completely obscured from the wolfpack lying to the south the light westerly wind carried the heavy black smoke from the blazing carrier along the southern flank of the convoy at sea level the perfect smokescreen dense impenetrable why the uboats had departed from their almost invariable practice of launching dawn attacks from the north so as to have their targets between themselves and the sunrise could only be guessed tactical surprise probably but whatever the reason it was the saving of the convoy within an hour the thrashing screws of the convoy had left the wolfpack far behindand fr having slipped the pack was far too fast to be overtaken again aboard the flagship the wt transmitter was chattering out a coded signal to london there was little point tyndall had decided in maintaining radio silence now the enemy knew their position to a mile tyndall smiled grimly as he thought of the rejoicing in the german naval high command at the news that fr was without any air cover whatsoever as a starter they could expect charlie within the hour the signal read admiral acs to dnc london rendezvoused fr yesterday weather conditions extreme severe damage to carriers defender wrestler unserviceable returning base under escort blue ranger torpedoed sunk today convoy escorts now ulysses stirling sirrus vectra viking no minesweeperseager to base minesweeper from hvalfjord failed rendezvous urgently require air support can you detach carrier battle squadron alternatively permission return base please advise immediately the wording of the message tyndall pondered could have been improved especially the bit at the endprobably sounded sufficiently like a threat to infuriate old starr who would only see in it pusillanimous confirmation of his conviction of the ulyssessand tyndallsunfitness for the job besides for almost two years nowsince long before the sinking of the hood by the bismarckit had been admiralty policy not to break up the home fleet squadrons by detaching capital ships or carriers old battleships too slow for modern internaval surface actionvessels such as the ramillies and the malayawere used for selected arctic convoys with that exception the official strategy was based on keeping the home fleet intact containing the german grand fleetand risking the convoys tyndall took a last look round the convoy sighed wearily and eased himself down to the duckboards what the hell he thought let it go if it wasted his time sending it it would also waste old starrs time reading it he clumped his way heavily down the bridge ladders eased his bulk through the door of the captains cabin hard by the fdr vallery partly undressed was lying in his bunk between very clean very white sheets their knifeedged ironing creasemarks contrasted oddly with the spreading crimson stain vallery himself gauntcheeked and cadaverous beneath dark stubble of beard red eyes sunk deep in great hollow sockets looked corpselike already dead from one corner of his mouth blood trickled down a parchment cheek as tyndall shut the door vallery lifted a wasted hand all ivory knuckles and blue veins in feeble greeting tyndall closed the door carefully quietly he took his time tune and to spare to allow the shock to drain out of his face when he turned round his face was composed but he made no attempt to disguise bis concern thank god for old socrates he said feelingly only man in the ship who can make you see even a modicum of sense he parked himself on the edge of the bed how do you feel dick vallery grinned crookedly there was no humour in his smile all depends what you mean sir physically or mentally i feel a bit worn outnot really ill you know doc says he can fix me uptemporarily anyway hes going to give me a plasma transfusionsays ive lost too much blood plasma plasma whole blood would be a better coagulant but he thinks it may preventor minimisefuture attacks he paused wiped some froth off his lips and smiled again as mirthlessly as before its not really a doctor and medicine i need johnits a padreand forgiveness his voice trailed off into silence the cabin was very quiet tyndall shifted uncomfortably and cleared his throat noisily rarely had he been so conscious that he was first and last a man of action forgiveness what on earth do you mean dick he hadnt meant to speak so loudly so harshly you know damn well what i mean vallery said mildly he was a man who was rarely heard to swear to use the most innocuous oath you were with me on the bridge this morning for perhaps two minutes neither man said a word then vallery broke into a fresh paroxysm of coughing the towel in his hand grew dark sodden and when he leaned back on his pillow tyndall felt a quick stab of fear he bent quickly over the sick man sighed in soundless relief as he heard the quick shallow breathing vallery spoke again his eyes still closed its not so much the men who were killed in the low power room he seemed to be talking to himself his voice a drifting murmur my fault i supposei took the ulysses too near the ranger foolish to go near a sinking ship especially if shes burning but just one of these things just one of the risks they happen the rest was a blurred dying whisper tyndall couldnt catch it he rose abruptly to his feet pulling his gloves on sorry dick he apologised shouldnt have come shouldnt have stayed so long old socrates will give me hell its the others the boys in the water vallery might never have heard him i hadnt the right i mean perhaps some of them would again his voice was lost for a moment then he went on strongly captain richard vallery dso judge jury and executioner tell me john what am i going to say when my turn comes tyndall hesitated heard the authoritative rap on the door and jerked round his breath escaping in a long inaudible sigh of thankfulness come in he called the door opened and brooks walked in he stopped short at the sight of the admiral turned to the whitecoated assistant behind him a figure weighed down with stands bottles tubing and various paraphernalia remain outside johnson will you he asked ill call you when i want you he closed the door crossed the cabin and pulled a chair up to the captains bunk vallerys wrist between his fingers he looked coldly across at tyndall nicholls brooks remembered was insistent that the admiral was far from well he looked tired certainly but more unhappy than tired the pulse was very fast irregular youve been upsetting him brooks accused me good god nol tyndall was injured so help me doc i never said not guilty doc it was vallery who spoke his voice stronger now he never said a word im the guilty man guilty as hell brooks looked at him for a long moment then he smiled smiled in understanding and compassion forgiveness sir thats it isnt it tyndall started in surprise looked at him in wonder vallery opened his eyes socrates he murmured you would know forgiveness brooks mused forgiveness from whom the living the dead or the judge again tyndall started have you have you been listening outside how can you from all three doc a tall order im afraid from the dead sir you are quite right there would be no forgiveness only their blessing for there is nothing to forgive im a doctor dont forgeti saw those boys in the water you sent them home the easy way as for the judge you know the lord giveth the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the lord the old testament conception of the lord who takes away in his own time and his own way and to hell with mercy and charity he smiled at tyndall dont look so shocked sir im not being blasphemous if that were the judge captain neither you nor inor the admiral would ever want any part of him but you know it isnt so vallery smiled faintly propped himself up on his pillow you make good medicine doctor its a pity you cant speak for the living also oh cant i brooks smacked his hand on his thigh guffawed in sudden recollection oh my word it was magnificent he laughed again in genuine amusement tyndall looked at vallery in mock despair sorry brooks apologised just fifteen minutes ago a bunch of sympathetic stokers deposited on the deck of the sick bay the prone and extremely unconscious form of one of their shipmates guess who none other than our resident nihilist our old friend riley slight concussion and assorted facial injuries but he should be restored to the bosom of his mess deck by nightfall anyway he insists on it claims his kittens need him vallery looked up amused curious fallen down the stokehold again i presume exactly the question i put siralthough it looked more as if he had fallen into a concrete mixer no sir says one of the stretcherbearers he tripped over the ships cat ships cat i says what ships cat so he turns to his oppo and says aint we got a ships cat nobby where upon the stoker nobby looks at him pityingly and says es got it all wrong sir poor old riley just came all over queer took a weak turn e did i ope e aint urt isself he sounded quite anxious what had happened tyndall queried i let it go at that young nicholls took two of them aside promised no action and had it out of them in a minute flat seems that riley saw in this mornings affair a magnificent opportunity for provoking trouble cursed you for an inhuman coldblooded murderer and i regret to say cast serious aspersions on your immediate ancestors and all of this mind you where he thought he was safeamong his own friends his friends halfkilled him you know sir i envy you he broke off rose abruptly to his feet now sir if youll just lie down and roll up your sleeve oh damn come in it was tyndall who answered the knock ah for me young chrysler thank you he looked up at vallery from londonin reply to my signal he turned it over in his hand two or three times i suppose i have to open it some time he said reluctantly the surgeoncommander halfrose to his feet shall i no no brooks why should you besides its from our mutual friend admiral starr im sure youd like to hear what hes got to say wouldnt you no i wouldnt brooks was very blunt i cant imagine itll be anything good tyndall opened the signal smoothed it out dno to admiral commanding acs he read slowly tirpitz reported preparing to move out impossible detach fleet carrier fr vital proceed murmansk all speed good luck starr tyndall paused his mouth twisted good luck he might have spared us that for a long time the three men looked at each other silently without expression characteristically it was brooks who broke the silence speaking of forgiveness he murmured quietly what i want to know is who on gods earth above or below it is ever going to forgive that vindictive old bastard chapter eight thursday night it was still only afternoon but the grey arctic twilight was already thickening over the sea as the ulysses dropped slowly astern the wind had died away completely again the snow was falling steadily heavily and visibility was down to a bare cablelength it was bitterly cold in little groups of three and four officers and men made their way aft to the starboard side of the poopdeck exhausted bonechilled men mostly sunk in private and bitter thought they shuffled wordlessly aft dragging feet kicking up little puffs of powdery snow on the poop they ranged themselves soundlessly behind the captain or in a line inboard and aft of the long symmetrical row of snowcovered hummocks that heaved up roundly from the unbroken whiteness of the poop the captain was flanked by three of his officerscarslake etherton and the surgeoncommander carslake was by the guardrail the lower half of his face swathed in bandages to the eyes for the second time in twentyfour hours he had waylaid vallery begged him to reconsider the decision to deprive him of his commission on the first occasion vallery had been adamant almost contemptuous ten minutes ago he had been icy and abrupt had threatened carslake with close arrest if he annoyed him again and now carslake just stared unseeingly into the snow and gloom paleblue eyes darkened and heavy with hate etherton stood just behind vallerys left shoulder shivering uncontrollably above the white jerking line of compressed mouth cheek and jaw muscles were working incessantly only his eyes were steady dulled in sick fascination at the curious mound at his feet brooks too was tightlipped but there the resemblance ended red of face and wrathful blue of eye he fumed and seemed as can only a doctor whose orders have been openly flouted by the critically ill vallery as brooks had told him forcibly and insubordinately had no bloody right to be there was all sorts of a damned fool for leaving his bunk but as vallery had mildly pointed out somebody had to conduct a funeral service and that was the captains duty if the padre couldnt do it and this day the padre couldnt do it for it was the padre who lay dead at his feet at his feet and at the feet of ethertonthe man who had surely killed him the padre had died four hours ago just after charlie had gone tyndall had been far out in his estimate charlie had not appeared within the hour charlie had not appeared until midmorning but when he did come he had the company of three of his kind a long haul indeed from the norwegian coast to this the th degree west of longitude but nothing for these giant condors fockewulf s who regularly flew the great dawn to dusk halfcircle from trondheim to occupied france round the west coast of the british isles condors in company always meant trouble and these were no exception they flew directly over the convoy approaching from astern the barrage from merchant ships and escorts was intense and the bombing attack was pressed home with a marked lack of enthusiasm the condors bombed from a height of feet in that clear cold morning air the bombs were in view almost from the moment they cleared the bombbays there was time to spare to take avoiding action almost at once the condors had broken off the attack and disappeared to the east impressed but apparently unharmed by the warmth of their reception in the circumstances the attack was highly suspicious circumspect charlie might normally be on reconnaissance but on the rare occasions that he chose to attack he generally did so with courage and determination the recent sally was just too timorous the tactics too obviously hopeless possibly of course recent entrants to the luftwaffe were given to a discretion so signally lacking in their predecessors or perhaps they were under strict orders not to risk their valuable craft but probably almost certainly it was thought that futile attack was only diversionary and the main danger lay elsewhere the watch over and under the sea was intensified five ten fifteen minutes passed and nothing had happened radar and asdic screens remained obstinately clear tyndall finally decided that there was no justification for keeping the entire ships company so desperately in need of rest at action stations for a moment longer and ordered the standdown to be sounded normal defence stations were resumed all forenoon work had been cancelled and officers and ratings off watch almost to a man went to snatch what brief sleep they could but not all brooks and nicholls had their patients to attend to the navigator returned to the charthouse marshall and his commissioned gunner mr peters resumed their interrupted routine rounds and etherton nervous anxious oversensitive and desperately eager to redeem himself for his share in the carslakeralston episode remained huddled and watchful in the cold lonely eyrie of the director tower the sharp urgent call from the deck outside came to marshall and peters as they were talking to the leading wireman in charge of no electrical shop the shop was on the port side of the focsle deck crosspassage which ran athwartships forard of the wardroom curving aft round the trunking of b turret four quick steps had them out of the shop through the screen door and peering over the side through the freshly falling snow following the gesticulating finger of an excited marine marshall glanced at the man recognised him immediately it was charteris the only ranker known personally to every officer in the shipin port he doubled as wardroom barman what is it charteris he demanded what are you seeing quickly man there sir look out there no a bit more to your right its its a sub sir a uboat what whats that a uboat marshall halfturned as the rev winthrop the padre squeezed to the rail between himself and charteris where where is it show me show me straight ahead padre i can see it now but its a damned funny shape for a uboatif youll excuse the language marshall added hastily he caught the warlike unchristian gleam in winthrops eyes smothered a laugh and peered through the snow at the strange squat shape which had now drifted almost abreast of them high up in the tower ethertons restless hunting eyes had already seen it even before charteris like charteris he immediately thought it was a uboat caught surfacing in a snow storm the payoff of the attack by the condors the thought that asdic or radar would certainly have picked it up never occurred to him time speed that was the essence before it vanished unthinkingly he grabbed the phone to the forard multiple pompom directorpompom he barked urgently uboat port range yards moving aft repeat port can you see it no no port now he shouted desperately oh good good commence tracking on target sir the receiver crackled in his ear open firecontinuous sirbut sir kingstons not here he went never mind kingston etherton shouted furiously kingston he knew was captain of the gun open fire you fools now ill take full responsibility he thrust the phone back on the rest moved across to the observation panel then realisation sickening shocking fear seared through his mind and he lunged desperately for the phone belay the last order he shouted wildly cease fire cease fire oh my god my god my god through the receiver came the staccato angry bark of the twopounder the receiver dropped from his hand crashed against the bulkhead it was too late it was too late because he had committed the cardinal sin he had forgotten to order the removal of the muzzlecovers the metal plates that sealed off the flashcovers of the guns when not in use and the shells were fused to explode on contact the first shell exploded inside its barrel killing the trainer and seriously wounding the communication number the other three smashed through their flimsy covers and exploded within a second of each other a few feet from the faces of the four watchers on the focsle deck all four were untouched miraculously untouched by the flying screaming metal it flew outwards and downwards a redhot iron hail sizzling into the sea but the blast of the explosion was backwards and the power of even a few pounds of high explosive detonating at arms length is lethal the padre died instantly peters and charteris within seconds and all from the same causetelescoped occiputs the blast hurled them backwards off their feet as if flung by a giant hand the backs of their heads smashing to an eggshell pulp against the bulkhead the blood seeped darkly into the snow was obliterated in a moment marshall was lucky fantastically so the explosion he said afterwards that it was like getting in the way of the driving piston of the coronation scotflung him through the open door behind him ripped off the heels of both shoes as they caught on the stormsill he braked violently in midair described a complete somersault slithered along the passage and smashed squarely into the trunking of b turret his back framed by the four big spikes of the butterfly nuts securing an inspection hatch had he been standing a foot to the right or the left had his heels been two inches higher as he catapulted through the doorway had he hit the turret a hairsbreadth to the left or right lieutenant marshall had no right to be alive the laws of chance said so overwhelmingly as it was marshall was now sitting up in the sick bay strapped broken ribs making breathing painful but otherwise unharmed the upturned lifeboat mute token of some earlier tragedy on the russian convoys had long since vanished into the white twilight captain vallerys voice low and husky died softly away he stepped back closing the prayer book and the forlorn notes of the bugle echoed briefly over the poop and died in the blanketing snow men stood silently unmovingly as one by one the thirteen figures shrouded in weighted canvas slid down the tipped plank down from under the union flag splashed heavily into the arctic and were gone for long seconds no one moved the unreal hypnotic effect of that ghostly ritual of burial held tired sluggish minds in unwilling thrall held men oblivious to cold and discomfort even when etherton halfstepped forward sighed crumpled down quietly unspectacularly in the snow the trancelike hiatus continued some ignored him others glanced his way incuriously it seemed absurd but it struck nicholls standing in the background that they might have stayed there indefinitely the minds and the blood of men slowing up coagulating freezing while they turned to pillars of ice then suddenly with exacerbating abruptness the spell was shattered the strident scream of the emergency stations whistle seared through the gathering gloom it took vallery about three minutes to reach the bridge he rested often pausing on every second or third step of the four ladders that reached up to the bridge even so the climb drained the last reserves of his frail strength brooks had to halfcarry him through the gate vallery clung to the binnacle fighting for breath through foamflecked lips but his eyes were alive alert as always probing through the swirling snow contact closing closing steady on course interception course speed unchanged the radar loudspeaker was muffled impersonal but the calm precise tones of lieutenant bowden were unmistakable good good well fox him yet tyndall his tired sagging face lit up in almost beaming anticipation turned to the captain the prospect of action always delighted tyndall something coming up from the ssw captain good god above man what are you doing here he was shocked at vallerys appearance brooks why in heavens name suppose you try talking to him brooks growled wrathfully he slammed the gate shut behind him stalked stiffly off the bridge whats the matter with him tyndall asked of no one in particular what the hell am i supposed to have done nothing sir vallery pacified him its all my fault disobeying doctors orders and what have you you were saying ah yes trouble im afraid captain vallery smiled secretly as he saw the satisfaction the pleased anticipation creep back into the admirals face radar reports a surface vessel approaching big fast more or less on interception course for us and not ours of course vallery murmured he looked up suddenly by jove sir it couldnt be the tirpitz tyndall finished for him he shook his head in decision my first thought too but no admiralty and air force are watching her like a broody hen over her eggs if she moves a foot well know probably some heavy cruiser closing closing course unaltered bowdens voice clipped easy was vaguely reminiscent of a cricket commentators estimated speed repeat knots his voice crackled into silence as the wt speaker came to life wt bridge wt bridge signal from convoy stirling admiral understood wilco out excellent excellent from jeffries tyndall explained i sent him a signal ordering the convoy to alter course to nnw that should take em well clear of our approaching friend vallery nodded how far ahead is the convoy sir pilot tyndall called and leaned back expectantly six six and a half miles the kapok kids face was expressionless hes slipping tyndall said mournfully the strains telling a couple of days ago hed have given us the distance to the nearest yard six miles far enough captain hell never pick em up bowden says he hasnt even picked us up yet that the intersection of courses must be pure coincidence i gather lieutenant bowden has a poor opinion of german radar i know i hope hes right for the first time the question is of rather more than academic interest vallery gazed to the south his binoculars to his eyes there was only the sea the thinning snow anyway this came at a good time tyndall arched a bushy eyebrow it was strange down there on the poop vallery was hesitant there was something weird uncanny in the air i didnt like it sir it was desperately well almost frightening the snow the silence the dead men thirteen dead men i can only guess how the men felt about etherton about anything but it wasnt good dont know how it would have ended five miles the loudspeaker cut in repeat five miles course speed constant five miles tyndall repeated in relief intangibles bothered him time to trail our coats a little captain well soon be in what bowden reckons is his radar range due east i think itll look as if were covering the tail of the convoy and heading for the north cape starboard vallery ordered the cruiser came gradually round met settled on her new course engine revolutions were cut down till the ulysses was cruising along at knots one minute five passed then the loudspeaker blared again radarbridge constant distance altering on interception course excellent really excellent the admiral was almost purring we have him gentlemen hes missed the convoy commence firing by radar vallery reached for the director handset director ah its you courtney good good you just do that vallery replaced the set looked across at tyndall smart as a whip that boy hes had x and y lined up tracking for the past ten minutes just a matter of pressing a button he says sounds uncommon like our friends here tyndall jerked his head in the direction of the kapok kid then looked up in surprise courtney did you say courtney wheres guns in his cabin as far as i know collapsed on the poop anyway hes in no fit state to do his job thank god im not in that boys shoes i can imagine the ulysses shuddered and the whiplike crash of x turret drowned vallerys voice as the shells screamed away into the twilight seconds later the ship shook again as the guns of y turret joined in thereafter the guns fired alternately one shell at a time every halfminute there was no point in wasting ammunition when the fall of shot could not be observed but it was probably the bare minimum necessary to infuriate the enemy and distract his attention from everything except the ship ahead the snow had thinned away now to a filmy curtain of gauze that blurred rather than obscured the horizon to the west the clouds were lifting the sky lightening in sunset vallery ordered x turret to cease fire to load with starshell abruptly the snow was gone and the enemy was there big and menacing a black featureless silhouette with the sudden flush of sunset striking incongruous golden gleams from the water creaming high at her bows starboard vallery snapped full ahead smokescreen tyndall nodded compliance it was no part of his plan to become embroiled with a german heavy cruiser or pocket battleship especially at an almost pointblank range of four miles on the bridge half a dozen pairs of binoculars peered aft trying to identify the enemy but the foreandaft silhouette against the reddening sky was difficult to analyse exasperatingly vague and ambiguous suddenly as they watched white gouts of flame lanced out from the heart of the silhouette simultaneously the starshell burst high up in the air directly above the enemy bathing him in an intense merciless white glare so that he appeared strangely naked and defenceless an illusory appearance everyone ducked low in reflex instinct as the shells whistled just over their heads and plunged into the sea ahead everyone that is except the kapok kid he bent an impassive eye on the admiral as the latter slowly straightened up hipper class sir he announced tons inch guns carries aircraft tyndall looked at his unsmiling face in long suspicion he cast around in his mind for a suitably crushing reply caught sight of the german cruisers turrets belching smoke in the sinking glare of the starshell my oath he exclaimed not wasting much time are they and damned good shooting he added in professional admiration as the shells hissed into the sea through the ulyssess boiling wake about feet astern bracketed in the first two salvoes theyll straddle us next time the ulysses was still heeling round the black smoke beginning to pour from the after funnel when vallery straightened clapped his binoculars to his eyes heavy clouds of smoke were mushrooming from the enemys starboard deck just forard of the bridge oh well done young courtney he burst out well done indeed well done indeed tyndall echoed a beauty still i dont think well stop to argue the point with them ah just in time gentlemen gad that was close the stern of the ulysses swinging round now almost to the north disappeared from sight as a salvo crashed into the sea dead astern one of the shells exploding in a great eruption of water the next salvoobviously the hit on the enemy cruiser hadnt affected her firepower fell a cable lengths astern the german was now firing blind engineer commander dodson was making smoke with a vengeance the oily black smoke flattening down on the surface of the sea rolling thick impenetrable vallery doubled back on course then headed east at high speed for the next two hours in the dusk and darkness they played cat and mouse with the hipper class cruiser firing occasionally appearing briefly tantalisingly then disappearing behind a smokescreen hardly needed now in the coming night all the time radar was their eyes and their ears and never played them false finally satisfied that all danger to the convoy was gone tyndall laid a double screen in a great curving u and vanished to the southwest firing a few final shells not so much in token of farewell as to indicate direction of departure ninety minutes later at the end of a giant halfcircle to port the ulysses was sitting far to the north while bowden and his men tracked the progress of the enemy he was reported as moving steadily east then just before contact was lost as altering course to the southeast tyndall climbed down from his chair numbed and stiff he stretched himself luxuriantly not a bad nights work captain not bad at all what do you bet our friend spends the night circling to the south and east at high speed hoping to come up ahead of the convoy in the morning tyndall felt almost jubilant in spite of his exhaustion and by that time fr should be miles to the north of him i suppose pilot you have worked out intersection courses for rejoining the convoy at all speeds up to a hundred knots i think we should be able to regain contact without much difficulty said the kapok kid politely its when he is at his most modest tyndall announced that he sickens me most heavens above im froze to death oh damn not more trouble i hope the communication rating behind the compass platform picked up the jangling phone listened briefly for you sir he said to vallery the surgeon lieutenant just take the message chrysler sorry sir insists on speaking to you himself chrysler handed the receiver into the bridge vallery smothered an exclamation of annoyance lifted the receiver to his ear captain here yes what is it what what i oh god no why wasnt i told oh i see thank you thank you vallery handed the receiver back turned heavily to tyndall in the darkness the admiral felt rather than saw the sudden weariness the hunched defeat of the shoulders that was nicholls vallerys voice was flat colourless lieutenant etherton shot himself in his cabin five minutes ago at four oclock in the morning in heavy snow but in a calm sea the ulysses rejoined the convoy by midmorning of that next day a bare six hours later admiral tyndall had become an old weary man haggard haunted by remorse and bitter selfcriticism close very close to despair miraculously in a matter of hours the chubby cheeks had collapsed in shrunken flaccidity draining blood had left the florid cheeks a parchment grey the sunken eyes had dulled in blood and exhaustion the extent and speed of the change wrought in that tough and jovial sailor a sailor seemingly impervious to the most deadly vicissitudes of war was incredible incredible and disturbing in itself but infinitely more so in its wholly demoralising effect on the men to every arch there is but one keystone or so any man must inevitably think any impartial court of judgment would have cleared tyndall of all guilt would have acquitted him without a trial he had done what he thought right what any commander would have done in his place but tyndall sat before the merciless court of his own conscience he could not forget that it was he who had rerouted the convoy so far to the north that it was he who had ignored official orders to break straight for the north cape that it was exactly on latitude n where their lordships had told him they would be that fr had on that cold clear windless dawn blundered straight into the heart of the heaviest concentration of uboats encountered in the arctic during the entire course of the war the wolfpack had struck at its favourite hourthe dawn and from its favourite position the northeast with the dawn in its eyes it struck cruelly skilfully and with a calculated ferocity admittedly the era of kapitan leutnant prienhis uboat long ago sent to the bottom with all hands by the destroyer wolverine and his illustrious contemporaries the heyday of the great uboat commanders the high noon of individual brilliance and great personal gallantry was gone but in its placeand generally acknowledged to be even more dangerous more deadly were the concerted highly integrated mass attacks of the wolfpacks methodical machinelike almost reduced to a formula under a single directing command the cochella third vessel in the port line was the first to go sister ship to the vytura and the varella also accompanying her in fr the cochella carried over gallons of octane petrol she was hit by at least three torpedoes the first two broke her almost in half the third triggered off a stupendous detonation that literally blew her out of existence one moment she was there sailing serenely through the limpid twilight of sunrise the next moment she was gone gone completely utterly gone with only a seething ocean convulsed in boiling white to show where she had been gone while stunned eardrums and stupefied minds struggled vainly to grasp the significance of what had happened gone while blind reflex instinct hurled men into whatever shelter offered as a storm of lethal metal swept over the fleet two ships took the full force of the explosion a huge mass of metalit might have been a winchpassed clear through the superstructure of the sinus a cablelength away on the starboard it completely wrecked the radar office what happened to the other ship immediately astern the impossiblynamed tennessee adventurer was not clear but almost certainly her wheelhouse and bridge had been severely damaged she had lost steering control was not under command tragically this was not at first understood simply because it was not apparent tyndall recovering fast from the sheer physical shock of the explosion broke out the signal for an emergency turn to port the wolfpack obviously lay on the port hand and the only action to take to minimise further losses to counter the enemy strategy was to head straight towards them he was reasonably sure that the uboats would be bunchedgenerally they strung out only for the slow convoys besides he had adopted this tactic several times in the past with a high degree of success finally it cut the uboats target to an impossible tenth forcing on them the alternative of diving or the risk of being trampled under with the immaculate precision and coordination of olympic equestrians the convoy heeled steadily over to starboard slewed majestically round trailing curved white wakes phosphorescently alive in the neardarkness that still clung to the surface of the sea too late it was seen that the tennessee adventurer was not under command slowly then with dis maying speed she came round to the east angling directly for another merchantman the tobacco planter there was barely time to think to appreciate the inevitable frantically the planters helm went hard over in an attempt to clear the other astern but the wildly swinging adventurer obviously completely out of control matched the planters tightening circle foot by inexorable foot blind malice at the helm she struck the planter with sickening violence just forard of the bridge the adventurers bows crumpling as they went bit deeply into her side fifteen twenty feet in a chaos of tearing rending metal the stopping power of tons deadweight travelling at knots is fantastic the wound was mortal and the planters own momentum carrying her past wrenched her free from the lethal bows opening the wound to the hungry sea and hastened her own endalmost at once she began to fill to list heavily to starboard aboard the adventurer someone must have taken over command her engine stopped she lay almost motionless alongside the sinking ship slightly down by the head the rest of the convoy cleared the drifting vessels steadied west by north far out on the starboard hand commander orr in the sirrus clawed his damaged destroyer round in a violent turn headed back towards the crippled freighters he had gone less than half a mile when he was recalled by a vicious signal from the flagship tyndall was under no illusions the adventurer he knew might remain there all day unharmedit was obvious that the planter would be gone in a matter of minutesbut that would be a guarantee neither of the absence of uboats nor of the sudden access of misguided enemy chivalry the enemy would be there would wait to the last possible second before dark in the hope that some rescue destroyer would heave to alongside the adventurer in that respect tyndall was right the adventurer was torpedoed just before sunset threequarters of the ships company escaped in lifeboats along with twenty survivors picked up from the planter a month later the frigate esher found them in three lifeboats tied line ahead off the bitter iron coast of bear island heading steadily north the captain alert and upright was still sitting in the sternsheets empty eyesockets searching for some lost horizon a withered claw locked to the tiller the rest were sitting or lying about the boats one actually standing his arm cradled around the mast and all with shrunken sunblackened lips drawn back in hideous mirth the logbook lay beside the captain empty all had frozen to death on that first night the young frigate commander had cast them adrift watched them disappear over the northern rim of the world steering for the barrier and the barrier is the region of the great silence the seas of incredible peace so peaceful so calm so cold that they may be there yet the dead who cannot rest a mean and shabby end for the temple of the spirit it is not known whether the admiralty approved the action of the captain of the frigate but in the major respect that of anticipating enemy disposition the admiral was utterly wrong the wolfpack commander had outguessed him and it was arguable that tyndall should have foreseen this his tactic of swinging an fast highly manoeuvrable impeccably handled bobbed and weaved their way to safety with almost contemptuous ease straightened up and headed south under maximum power the merchant ships big clumsy relatively slow were less fortunate two ships in the port line a tanker and a freighter were struck miraculously both just staggered under the numbing shock then kept on coming not so the big freighter immediately behind them her holds crammed with tanks her decks lined with them she was torpedoed three times in three seconds there was no smoke no fire no spectacular afterexplosion sieved and ripped from stern to stem she sank quickly quietly still on even keel dragged down by the sheer weight of metal no one below decks had even the slightest chance of escaping a merchantman in the centre line the belle me was torpedoed amidships there were two separate explosions probably she had been struck twiceand she was instantly on fire within seconds the list to port was pronounced increasing momentarily gradually her rails dipped under the outslung lifeboats almost touching the surface of the sea a dozen fifteen men were seen to be slipping sliding down the sheering decks and hatch covers already halfsubmerged towards the nearest lifeboat desperately they hacked at bellyband securing ropes piled into the lifeboat in grotesquely comical haste pushed it clear of the dipping davits seized the oars and pulled frantically away from beginning to end hardly a minute had elapsed half a dozen powerful strokes had them clear beyond their ships counter two more took them straight under the swinging bows of the walter a baddeley her companion tankcarrier in the starboard line the consummate seamanship that had saved the baddeley could do nothing to save the lifeboat the little boat crumpled and splintered like a matchwood toy catapulting screaming men into the icy sea as the big grey hull of the baddeley slid swiftly by them they struck out with insane strength that made nothing of their heavy arctic clothing at such times reason vanishes the thought that if by some godgiven miracle they were to escape the guillotine of the baddeleys single great screw they would do so only to die minutes later in the glacial cold of the arctic never occurred to them but as it happened death came by neither metal nor cold they were still struggling almost abreast the poop vainly trying to clear the rushing sucking vortex of water when the torpedoes struck the baddeley close together and simultaneously just forard of the rudder for swimming men who have been in the close vicinity of an underwater high explosion there can be no shadow of hope the effect is inhuman revolting shocking beyond conception in such cases experienced doctors pathologists even can with difficulty bring themselves to look upon what were once human beings but for these men as so often in the arctic death was kind for they died unknowing the walter a baddeleys stern had been almost completely blown off hundreds of tons of water were already rushing in the great gaping hole below the counter racing through crossbulkheads fractured by the explosion smashing open engineboiler room watertight doors buckled by the blast pulling her down by the stern steadily relentlessly till her taffrail dipped salute to the waiting arctic for a moment she hung there then in quick succession from deep inside the hull came a muffled explosion the earshattering frightening roar of escaping highpressure steam and the thunderous crash of massive boilers rending away from their stools as the ship upended almost immediately the shattered stern lurched heavily sunk lower and lower till the poop was completely gone till the dripping forefoot was tilted high above the sea foot by foot the angle of tilt increased the stern plunged a hundred two hundred feet under the surface of the sea the bows rearing almost as high against the blue of the sky buoyed up by half a million cubic feet of trapped air the ship was exactly four degrees off the vertical when the end came it was possible to establish this angle precisely for it was just at that second half a mile away aboard the ulysses that the shutter clicked the shutter of the camera in lieutenant nichollss gauntleted hands a camera that captured an unforgettable picturea stark simple picture of a sinking ship almost vertically upright against a paleblue sky a picture with a strange lack of detail with the exception only of two squat shapes improbably suspended in midair these were ton tanks broken loose from their foredeck lashings caught in midnight as they smashed down on the bridge structure awash in the sea in the background was the stern of the belle isle the screw out of the water the red duster trailing idly in the peaceful sea bare seconds after the camera had clicked the camera was blown from nichollss hands the case crumpling against a bulkhead the lens shattering but the film still intact panicstricken the seamen in the lifeboat may have been but it wasnt unreasoning panic in no hold just forard of the fire the belle isle had been carrying over tons of tank ammunition broken cleanly in two she was gone inside a minute the baddeleys bows riddled by the explosion slid gently down behind her the echoes of the explosion were still rolling out over the sea in ululating diminuendo when they were caught up and flung back by a series of muffled reports from the south less than two miles away the sirrus vectra and viking dazzling white in the morning sun were weaving a crazily intricate pattern over the sea depthcharges cascading from either side of their poopdecks from time to time one or other almost disappeared behind towering mushrooms of erupting water and spray reappearing magically as the white columns fell back into the sea to join in the hunt to satisfy the flaming primitive lust for revengethat was tyndalls first impulse the kapok kid looked at him furtively and wondered wondered at the hunched rigidity the compressed lipless mouth the face contorted in white and bitter ragea bitterness directed not least against himself tyndall twisted suddenly in his seat bentley signal the stirlingascertain damage the stirling was more than a mile astern now but coming round fast her speed at least twenty knots making water after engineroom bentley read eventually storerooms flooded but hull damage slight under control steering gear jammed on emergency steering am all right thank god for that signal take over proceed east come on captain lets give orr a hand to deal with these murdering hounds the kapok kid looked at him in sudden dismay sir yes yes pilot what is it tyndall was curt impatient how about that first uboat carpenter ventured cant be much more than a mile to the south sir shouldnt we god almighty tyndall swore his face was suffused with anger are you trying to tell me he broke off abruptly stared at carpenter for a long moment what did you say pilot the boat that sunk the tanker sir the kapok kid said carefully she could have reloaded by now and shes in a perfect position of course of course tyndall muttered he passed a hand across his eyes flickered a glance at vallery the captain had his head averted again the hand passed across the tired eyes youre quite right pilot quite right he paused then smiled as usual damn you the ulysses found nothing to the north the uboat that had sunk the cochella and sprung the trap had wisely decamped while they were quartering the area they heard the sound of gunfire saw the smoke erupting from the sinuss s ask him what all the bloody fuss is about tyndall demanded irritably the kapok kid smiled secretly the old man had life in him yet vectra and viking damaged probably destroyed uboat the message read vectra and self sunk surfaced boat how about you how about you tyndall exploded damn his confounded insolence how about you hell have the oldest bloody minesweeper in scapa for his next command this is all your fault pilot yes sir sorry sir maybe hes only asking in a spirit ofahanxious concern how would you like to be his navigator in his next command said tyndall dangerously the kapok kid retired to his charthouse carrington sir the first lieutenant was his invariable self cleareyed freshly shaven competent alert the sallow skin hallmark of all men who have spent too many years under tropical sunswas unshadowed by fatigue he hadnt slept for three days what do you make of that he pointed to the northwest curiously woolly grey clouds were blotting out the horizon before them the sea dusked to indigo under wandering catspaws from the north hard to say sir carrington said slowly not heavy weather thats certain ive seen this before sir low twisting cloud blowing up on a fine morning with a temperature rise very common in the aleutians and the bering sea sir and there it means fog heavy mist and you captain no idea sir vallery shook his head decisively the plasma transfusion seemed to have helped him new to me never seen it before thought not tyndall granted neither have i thats why i asked number one first if you think its fog thats coming up number one let me know will you cant afford to have convoy and escorts scattered over half the arctic if the weather closes down although mind you he added bitterly i think theyd be a damned sight safer without us i can tell you now sir carrington had that rare gift the ability to make a confident quietly unarguable assertion without giving the slightest offence its fog fair enough tyndall never doubted him lets get the hell out of it bentleysignal the destroyers break off engagement rejoin convoy and bentley add the word immediate he turned to vallery for commander orrs benefit within the hour merchant ships and escorts were on station again on a northeast course at first to clear any further packs on latitude to the southeast the sun was still bright but the first thick writhing tendrils of the mist chill and dank were already swirling round the convoy speed had been reduced to six knots all ships were streaming fogbuoys tyndall shivered climbed stiffly from his chair as the standdown sounded he passed through the gate stopped in the passage outside he laid a glove on chryslers shoulder kept it there as the boy turned round in surprise just wanted a squint at these eyes of yours laddie he smiled we owe them a lot thank you very muchwe will not forget he looked a long time into the young face forgot his own exhaustion and swore softly in sudden compassion as he saw the redrimmed eyes the white maculated cheeks stained with embarrassed pleasure how old are you chrysler he asked abruptly eighteen sir in two days time the soft west country voice was almost defiant hell be eighteenin two days time tyndall repeated slowly to himself good god good god above he dropped his hand walked wearily aft to the shelter entered closed the door behind him hell be eighteenin two days time he repeated like a man in a daze vallery propped himself up on the settee who young chrysler tyndall nodded unhappily i know vallery was very quiet i know how it is he did a fine job today tyndall sagged down in a chair his mouth twisted in bitterness the only one dear god what a mess he drew heavily on a cigarette stared down at the floor ten green bottles hanging on a wall he murmured absently i beg your pardon sir fourteen ships left scapa eighteen st johnthe two components of fr tyndall said softly thirtytwo ships in all and now he paused now there are seventeen and three of these damaged im counting the tennessee adventurer as a dead duck he swore savagely hells teeth how i hateleaving ships like that sitting targets for any murdering he stopped short drew on his cigarette again deeply doing wonderfully amnt i ah nonsense sir vallery interrupted impatient almost angry it wasnt any fault of yours that the carriers had to return meaning that the rest was my fault tyndall smiled faintly lifted a hand to silence the automatic protest sorry dick i know you didnt meant thatbut its true its true six merchant boys gone in ten minutessix and we shouldnt have lost one of them head bent elbows on knees he screwed the heels of his palms into exhausted eyes rearadmiral tyndall master strategist he went on softly alters convoy course to run smack into a heavy cruiser alters it again to run straight into the biggest wolfpack ive ever knownand just where the admiralty said they would be no matter what old starr does to me when i get back ive no kick coming not now not after this he rose heavily to his feet the light of the single lamp caught his face vallery was shocked at the change where to now sir he asked the bridge no no stay where you are dick he tried to smile but the smile was a grimace that flickered only to die leave me in peace while i ponder my next miscalculation he opened the door stopped dead as he heard the unmistakable whistling of shells close above heard the eas signal screaming urgently through the fog tyndall turned his head slowly looked back into the shelter it looks he said bitterly as if ive already made it chapter nine friday morning the fog tyndall saw was all around them now since that last heavy snowfall during the night the temperature had risen steadily quickly but it had beguiled only to deceive the clammy icy feathers of the swirling mist now struck doubly chill he hurried through the gate vallery close behind him turner steel helmet trailing was just leaving for the after tower tyndall stretched out his hand stopped him what is it commander he demanded who fired where where did it come from i dont know sir shells came from astern more or less but ive a damned good idea who it is his eyes rested on the admiral a long speculative moment our friend of last night is back again he turned abruptly hurried off the bridge tyndall looked after him perplexed uncomprehending then he swore softly savagely and jumped for the radar handset bridge admiral speaking lieutenant bowden at once the loudspeaker crackled into immediate life bowden speaking sir what the devil are you doing down there tyndalls voice was low vicious asleep or what we are being attacked lieutenant bowden by a surface craft this may be news to you he broke off ducked low as another salvo screamed overhead and crashed into the water less than half a mile ahead the spray cascaded over the decks of a merchantman glimpsed momentarily in a clear lane between two rolling fogbanks tyndall straightened up quickly snarled into the mouthpiece hes got our range and got it accurately in gods name bowden where is he sorry sir bowden was cool unruffled we cant seem to pick him up we still have the adventurer on our screens and there appears to be a very slight distortion on his bearing sir approximately i suggest the enemy ship is still screened by the adventurer or if shes closer is on the adventurers direct bearing how near tyndall barked not near sir very close to the adventurer we cant distinguish either by size or distance tyndall dangled the transmitter from his hand he turned to vallery does bowden really expect me to believe that yarn he asked angrily a million to one coincidence like that an enemy ship accidentally chose and holds the only possible course to screen her from our radar fantastic vallery looked at him his face without expression well tyndall was impatient isnt it no sir vallery answered quietly its not not really and it wasnt accidental the upack would have radioed her given our bearing and course the rest was easy tyndall gazed at him through a long moment of comprehension screwed his eyes shut and shook his head in short fierce jerks it was a gesture compounded of selfcriticism the death of disbelief the attempt to clear a woolly exhausted mind hell a sixyearold could have seen that a shell whistled into the sea a bare fifty yards to port tyndall didnt flinch might never have seen or heard it bowden he had the transmitter to his mouth again sir any change in the screen no sir none and are you still of the same opinion yes sir cant be anything else and close to the adventurer you say very close i would say but good god man the adventurer must be ten miles astern by now yes sir i know so is the bandit what ten miles but but hes firing by radar sir bowden interrupted suddenly the metallic voice sounded tired he must be hes also tracking by radar which is why hes keeping himself in line with our bearing on the adventurer and hes extremely accurate im afraid admiral that his radar is at least as good as ours the speaker clicked off in the sudden strained silence on the bridge the crash of breaking ebonite sounded unnaturally loud as the transmitter slipped from tyndalfs hand fractured in a hundred pieces the hand groped forward he clutched at a steam pipe as if to steady himself vallery stepped towards him arms outstretched in concern but tyndall brushed by unseeingly like an old spent man like a man from whose ancient bones and muscles all the pith has long since drained he shuffled slowly across the bridge oblivious of a dozen mystified eyes dragged himself up on to his high stool you fool he told himself bitterly savagely oh you bloody old fool he would never forgive himself never never never all along the line he had been outthought outguessed and outmanceuvred by the enemy they had taken him for a ride made an even bigger bloody fool out of him than his good maker had ever intended radar of course that was it the blind assumption that german radar had remained the limited elementary thing that admiralty and air force intelligence had reported it to be last year i radar and as good as the british as good as the ulyssess and everybody had believed that the ulysses was incomparably the most efficient indeed the only efficient radar ship in the world as good as our ownprobably a damned sight better but had the thought ever occurred to him tyndall writhed in sheer chagrin in agony of spirit and knew the bitter taste of selfloathing and so this morning the payoff six ships three hundred men gone to the bottom may god forgive you tyndall he thought dully may god forgive you you sent them there radar last night for instance when the ulysses had been laying a false trail to the east the german cruiser had obligingly tagged behind the perfect foil to his tyndalls genius tyndall groaned in mortification had tagged behind firing wildly erratically each time the ulysses had disappeared behind a smokescreen had done so to conceal the efficiency of her radar to conceal the fact that during the first halfhour at least she must have been tracking the escaping convoy as it disappeared to the nnw a process made all the easier by the fact that he tyndall had expressly forbidden the use of the zigzag and then when the ulysses had so brilliantly circled first to the south and then to the north again the enemy must have had her on his screenconstantly and later the biter bit with a vengeance the faked enemy withdrawal to the southeast almost certainly he too had circled to the north again picked up the disappearing british cruiser on the edge of his screen worked out her intersection course as a cross check on the convoys and radioed ahead to the wolfpack positioning them almost to the foot and now finally the last galling blow to whatever shattered remnants of his pride were left him the enemy had opened fire at extreme range but with extreme accuracy a dead giveaway to the fact that the firing was radarcontrolled and the only reason for it must be the enemys conviction that the ulysses by this time must have come to the inevitable conclusion that the enemy was equipped with a highly sensitive radar transmitter the inevitable conclusion tyndall had never even begun to suspect it slowly oblivious to the pain he pounded his fist on the edge of the windscreen god what a blind crazily stupid fool hed been six ships three hundred men hundreds of tanks and planes millions of gallons of fuel lost to russia how many more thousands of dead russians soldiers and civilians did that represent and the broken sorrowing families he thought incoherently families throughout the breadth of britain the telegram boys cycling to the little houses in the welsh valleys along the wooded lanes of surrey to the lonely reek of the peatfire remote in the western isles to the limewashed cottages of donegal and antrim the empty homes across the great reaches of the new world from newfoundland and maine to thefar slopes of the pacific these families would never know that it was he tyndall who had so criminally squandered the lives of husbands brothers sonsand that was worse than no consolation at all captain vallery tyndalls voice was only a husky whisper vallery crossed over stood beside him coughing painfully as the swirling fog caught nose and throat incinated inflamed lungs it was a measure of tyndalls distressed preoccupation that vallerys obvious suffering quite failed to register ah there you are captain this enemy cruiser must be destroyed vallery nodded heavily yes sir how how tyndalls face framed in the moisturebeaded hood of his duffel was haggard and grey but he managed to raise a ghost of a smile as well hung for a sheep i propose to detach the escorts including ourselves and nail him he stared out blindly into the fog his mouth bitter a simple tactical exercise maybe within even my limited compass he broke off suddenly stared over the side then ducked hurriedly a shell had exploded in the watera rare thingonly yards away erupting spray showering down on the bridge we the stirling and ourselves will take him from the south he continued soak up his fire and radar orr and his deathorglory boys will approach from the north in this fog theyll get very close before releasing their torpedoes conditions are all against a single ship he shouldnt have much chance all the escorts vallery said blankly you propose to detach all the escorts thats exactly what i propose to do captain but but perhaps thats exactly what he wants vallery protested suicide a glorious death for the fatherland dont you believe it tyndall scoffed that sort of thing went out with langesdorff and middelmann no sir vallery was impatient he wants to pull us off to leave the convoy uncovered well what of it tyndall demanded whos going to find them in this lot he waved an arm at the rolling twisting fogbanks dammit man if it werent for their fogbuoys even our ships couldnt see each other so im damned sure no one else could either no vallery countered swiftly how about another german cruiser fitted with radar or even another wolfpack either could be in radio contact with our friend astern and hes got our course to the nearest minute in radio contact surely to god our wt is monitoring all the time yes sir they are but im told its not so easy on the vhf ranges tyndall grunted noncommittally said nothing he felt desperately tired and confused he had neither the will nor the ability to pursue the argument further but vallery broke in on the silence the vertical lines between his eyebrows etched deep with worry and whys our friend sitting steadily on our tails pumping the odd shell among us unless hes concentrating on driving us along a particular course it reduces his chance of a hit by per cent and cuts out half his guns maybe hes expecting us to reason like that to see the obvious tyndall was forcing himself to think to fight his way through a mental fog no less nebulous and confusing than the dank mist that swirled around him perhaps hes hoping to panic us into altering course to the north of course where a upack may very well be possible possible vallery conceded on the other hand he may have gone a step further maybe he wants us to be too clever for our own good perhaps he expects us to see the obvious to avoid it to continue on our present course and so do exactly what he wants us to do hes no fool sir we know that now what was it that brooks had said to starr back in scapa a lifetime ago that finedrawn feeling that exquisite agony every cell in the brain stretched taut to breaking point pushing you over the screaming edge of madness tyndall wondered dully how brooks could have known could have been so damnably accurate in his description anyway he knew now knew what it was to stand on the screaming edge tyndall appreciated dimly that he was at the limit that aching muzzy forehead where to think was to be a blind man wading through a sea of molasses vaguely he realised that this must be the first or was it the last symptom of a nervous breakdown god only knew there had been plenty of them aboard the ulysses during the past months but he was still the admiral he must do something say something its no good guessing dick he said heavily vallery looked at him sharplynever before had old giles called him anything but captain on the bridge and weve got to do something well leave the vectra as a sop to our consciences no more he smiled wanly we must have at least two destroyers for the dirty work bentley take this signal for wt to all escort vessels and commander fletcher on the cape hatteras within ten minutes the four warships boring southeast through the impenetrable wall of fog had halved the distance that lay between them and the enemy the stirling viking and sirrus were in constant radio communication with the ulysses they had to be for they travelled as blind men in an invious world of grey and she was their eyes and their ears radarbridge radarbridge automatically every eye swung round riveted on the loundspeaker enemy altering course to south increasing speed too late tyndall shouted hoarsely his fists were clenched his eyes alight with triumph hes left it too late vallery said nothing the seconds ticked by the ulysses knifed her way through cold fog and icy sea suddenly the loudspeaker called again enemy turn heading southeast speed knots knots hes on the run tyndall seemed to have gained a fresh lease on life captain i propose that the sirrus and ulysses proceed southeast at maximum speed engage and slow the enemy ask wt to signal orr ask radar enemys course he broke off waited impatiently for the answer radarbridge course steady on course repeat steady on course steady on course tyndall echoed captain commence firing by radar we have him we have him he cried exultantly hes waited too long we have him captain again vallery said nothing tyndall looked at him half in perplexity half in anger well dont you agree i dont know sir vallery shook his head doubtfully i dont know at all why did he wait so long why didnt he turn and run the minute we left the convoy too damn sure of himself tyndall growled or too sure of something else vallery said slowly maybe he wanted to make good and sure that we would follow him tyndall growled again in exasperation made to speak then lapsed into silence as the ulysses shuddered from the recoil of a turret for a moment the billowing fog on the focsle cleared atomised by the intense heat and flash generated by the exploding cordite in seconds the grey shroud had fallen once more then magically it was clear again a heavy fogbank had rolled over them and through a gap in the next they caught a glimpse of the sirrus dead on the beam a monstrous bone in her teeth scything to the southeast at something better than knots the stirling and the viking were already lost in the fog astern hes too close tyndall snapped why didnt bowden tell us we cant bracket the enemy this way signal the sirrus steam five minutes captain same for us south then back on course he had hardly sunk back in his chair and the ulysses mistshrouded again was only beginning to answer her helm when the wt loudspeaker switched on wtbridge wtbridge the twin s of b turret roared in deafening unison flame and smoke lancing out through the fog simultaneously a tremendous crash and explosion heaved up the duckboards beneath the feet of the men in the bridge catapulting them all ways into each other into fleshbruising bonebreaking metal into the dazed confusion of numbed minds and bodies fighting to reorientate themselves under the crippling handicap of stunning shock of eardrums rended by the blast of throat and nostrils stung by acrid fumes of eyes blinded by dense black smoke throughout it all the calm impersonal voice of the wt transmitter repeated its unintelligible message gradually the smoke cleared away tyndall pulled himself drunkenly to his feet by the rectifying arm of the binnacle the explosion had blown him clean out of his chair into the centre of the compass platform he shook his head dazed uncomprehending must be tougher than hed imagined all that wayand he couldnt remember bouncing and that wrist nowthat lay over at a damned funny angle his own wrist he realised with mild surprise funny it didnt hurt a bit and carpenters face there rising up before him the bandages were blown off the gash received on the night of the great storm gaping wide again the face masked with blood that girl at henley the one he was always talking abouttyndall wondered inconsequently what she would say if she saw him now why doesnt the wt transmitter stop that insane yammering suddenly his mind was clear my god oh god he stared in disbelief at the twisted duckboards the fractured asphalt beneath his feet he released his grip on the binnacle lurched forward into the windscreen his sense of balance had confirmed what his eyes had rejected the whole compass platform tilted forward at an angle of degrees what is it pilot his voice was hoarse strained foreign even to himself in gods name whats happened a breech explosion in b turret no sir carpenter drew his forearm across his eyes the kapok sleeve came away covered in blood a direct hit sir smack in the superstructure hes right sir carrington had hoisted himself far over the windscreen was peering down intently even at that moment tyndall marvelled at the mans calmness his almost inhuman control and a heavy one its wrecked the forard pompom and theres a hole the size of a door just below us it must be pretty bad inside sir tyndall scarcely heard the last words he was kneeling over vallery cradling his head in his one good arm the captain lay crumpled against the gate barely conscious his stertorous breathing interrupted by rasping convulsions as he choked on his own blood his face was deathly white get brooks up here chryslerthe surgeoncommander i mean tyndall shouted at once wtbridge wtbridge please acknowledge please acknowledge the voice was hurried less impersonal anxiety evident even in its metallic anonymity chrysler replaced the receiver looked worriedly at the admiral well tyndall demanded is he on his way no reply sir the boy hesitated i think the lines gone hells teeth tyndall roared what are you doing standing there then go and get him take over number one will you bentleyhave the commander come to the bridge wtbridge wtbridge tyndall glared up at the speaker in exasperation then froze into immobility as the voice went on we have been hit aft damage control reports codingroom destroyed number and radar offices destroyed canteen wrecked after control tower severely damaged the after control tower tyndall swore pulled off his gloves wincing at the agony of his broken hand carefully he pillowed vallerys head on the gloves rose slowly to his feet the after tower and turners there i hope to god he broke off made for the after end of the bridge at a stumbling run once there he steadied himself his hand on the ladder rail and peered apprehensively aft at first he could see nothing not even the after funnel and mainmast the grey writhing fog was too dense too maddeningly opaque then suddenly for a mere breath of time an icy catspaw cleared away the mist cleared away the dark convoluted smokepall above the after superstructure tyndalls hand tightened convulsively on the rail the knuckles whitening to ivory the after superstructure had disappeared in its place was a crazy mass of jumbled twisted steel with x turret normally invisible from the bridge showing up clearly beyond apparently unharmed but the rest was goneradar offices codingroom police office canteen probably most of the after galley nothing nobody could have survived there miraculously the truncated main mast still stood but immediately aft of it perched crazily on top of this devils scrapheap the after tower fractured and grotesquely askew lay over at an impossible angle of its rangefinder gone and commander turner had been in there tyndall swayed dangerously on top of the steel ladder shook his head again to fight off the fog clamping down on his mind there was a heavy peculiarly dull ache just behind his forehead and the fog seemed to be spreading from there a lucky ship they called the ulysses twenty months on the worst run and in the worst waters in the world and never a scratch but tyndall had always known that some time some place her luck would run out he heard hurried steps clattering up the steel ladder forced his blurred eyes to focus themselves he recognised the dark lean face at once it was leading signalman davies from the flag deck his face was white his breathing short and quick he opened his mouth to speak then checked himself his eyes staring at the handrail your hand sir i he switched his startled gaze from the rail to tyndalls eyes your hand youve no gloves on sir no tyndall looked down as if faintly astonished he had a hand no i havent have i thank you davies he pulled his hand off the smooth frozen steel glanced incuriously at the raw bleeding flesh it doesnt matter what is it boy the fighter direction room sir daviess eyes were dark with remembered horror the shell exploded in there its its just gone sir and the plot above he stopped short his jerky voice lost in the crash of the guns of aturret somehow it seemed strangely unnatural that the main armament still remained effective ive just come from the fdr and the plot sir davies continued more calmly now they well they never had a chance including commander westcliffe dimly tyndall realised the futility of clutching at straws i dont know sir itsits just bits and pieces in the fdr if you follow me but if he was there he would be tyndall interrupted heavily he never left it during action stations he stopped abruptly broken hands clenched involuntarily as the highpitched scream and impact explosion of he shells blurred into shattering cacophony appalling in its closeness my god tyndall whispered that was close davies what the hell his voice choked off in an agonised grunt arms flailing wildly at the empty air as his back crashed against the deck of the bridge driving every last ounce of breath from his body wordlessly convulsively propelled by desperately thrusting feet and launched by the powerful backthrust of arms pivoting on the handrails davies had just catapulted himself up the last three steps of the ladder head and shoulders socketing into the admirals body with irresistible force and now davies too was down stretched his length on the deck spreadeagled across tyndalls legs he lay very still slowly the cruel breath rasping his tortured lungs tyndall surfaced from the black depths of unconsciousness blindly instinctively he struggled to sit up but his broken hand collapsed under the weight of his body his legs didnt seem to be much help either they were quite powerless as if he were paralysed from the waist down the fog was gone now and blinding flashes of colour red green and white were coruscating brilliantly across the darkening sky starshells was the enemy using a new type of starshell dimly with a great effort of will he realised that there must be some connection between these dazzling flashes and the now excruciating pain behind his forehead he reached up the back of his right hand his eyes were still screwed tightly shut then the realisation faded and was gone are you all right sir dont move well soon have you out of this the voice deep authoritative boomed directly above the admirals head tyndall shrank back shook his head in imperceptible despair it was turner who was speaking and turner he knew was gone was this then what it was like to be dead he wondered dully this frightening confused world of blackness and blinding light at the same time a darkbright world of pain and powerlessness and voices from the past then suddenly of their own volition almost his eyelids flickered and were open barely a foot above him were the lean piratical features of the commander who was kneeling anxiously at his side turner turner a questioning hand reached out in tentative hope clutched gratefully oblivious to the pain at the reassuring solidity of the commanders arm turner it is you i thought the after tower eh turner smiled briefly no sir i wasnt within a mile of it i was coming here just climbing up to the focsle deck when that first hit threw me back down to the main deck how are you sir thank god thank god i dont know how i am my legs what in the name of heaven is that his eyes focusing normally again widened in baffled disbelief just above turners head angling forard and upward to port a great white tree trunk stretched as far as he could see in either direction reaching up he could just touch the massive bole with his hand the foremast sir turner explained it was sheared clean off by that last shell just above the lower yardarm the back blast flung it on to the bridge took most of the aa tower with it im afraidand caved in the main tower i dont think young courtney could have had much chance davies saw it coming i was just below him at the time he was very quick davies tyndalls dazed mind had forgotten all about him of course davies it must be davies who was pinioning his legs he craned his neck forward saw the huddled figure at his feet the great weight of the mast lying across his back for gods sake commander get him out of that just lie down sir till brooks gets here davies is all right all right all right tyndall was almost screaming oblivious to the silent figures who were gathering around him are you mad turner the poor bastard must be in agony he struggled frantically to rise but several pairs of hands held him down firmly carefully hes all right sir turners voice was surprisingly gentle really he is sir hes all right davies doesnt feel a thing not any more and all at once the admiral knew and he fell back limply to the deck his eyes closed in shocked understanding his eyes were still shut when brooks appeared doubly welcome in his confidence and competence within seconds almost the admiral was on his feet shocked badly bruised but otherwise unharmed doggedly and in open defiance of brooks tyndall demanded that he be assisted back to the bridge his eyes lit up momentarily as he saw vallery standing shakily on his feet a white towel to his mouth but fie said nothing his head bowed he hoisted himself painfully into his chair wtbridge wtbridge please acknowledge signal is that bloody idiot still there tyndall demanded querulously why doesnt someone youve only been gone a couple of minutes sir the kapok kid ventured two minutes tyndall stared at him lapsed into silence he glanced down at brooks busy bandaging his right hand have you nothing better to do brooks he asked harshly no i havent brooks replied truculently when shells explode inside four walls there isnt much work left for a doctor except signing death certificates he added brutally vallery and turner exchanged glances vallery wondered if brooks had any idea how far through tyndall was wtbridge wtbridge vectra repeats request for instruction urgent urgent the vectra vallery glanced at the admiral silent now and motionless and turned to the bridge messenger chrysler get through to wt any way you can ask them to repeat the first message he looked again at turner following the admirals sick gaze over the side he looked down recoiled in horror fighting down the instant nausea the gunner in the sponson belowjust another boy like chryslermust have seen the falling mast must have made a panicstricken attempt to escape he had barely cleared his cockpit when the radar screen a hundred square feet of meshed steel carrying the crushing weight of the mast as it had snapped over the edge of the bridge had caught him fairly and squarely he lay still now mangled broken something less than human spreadeagled in outflung crucifixion across the twin barrels of his oerlikon vallery turned away sick in body and mind god the craziness the futile insanity of war damn that german cruiser damn those german gunners damn them damn them but why should he they too were only doing a joband doing it terribly well he gazed sightlessly at the wrecked shambles of his bridge what damnably accurate gunnery he wondered vaguely if the ulysses had registered any hits probably not and now of course it was impossible it was impossible now because the ulysses still racing southeast through the fog was completely blind both radar eyes gone victims to the weather and the german guns worse still all the fire control towers were damaged beyond repair if this goes on he thought wryly all well need is a set of grappling irons and a supply of cutlasses in terms of modern naval gunnery even although her main armament was intact the ulysses was hopelessly crippled she just didnt have a chance what was it that stoker riley was supposed to have said being thrown to the wolves yes that was it thrown to the wolves but only a nero he reflected wearily would have blinded a gladiator before throwing him into the arena all firing had ceased the bridge was deadly quiet silence complete silence except for the sound of rushing water the muffled roar of the great engineroom intake fans the monotonous nervedrilling pinging of the asdicand these oddly enough only served to deepen the great silence every eye vallery saw was on admiral tyndall old giles was mumbling something to himself too faint to catch his face shockingly grey haggard and blotched still peered over the side he seemed fascinated by the sight of the dead boy or was it the smashed radar screen had the full significance of the broken scanner and wrecked director towers dawned on him yet vallery looked at him for a long moment then turned away he knew that it had wtbridge wtbridge everyone on the bridge jumped swung round in nervejangled startlement everyone except tyndall he had frozen into a graven immobility signal from vectra first signal received vallery glanced at his watch only six minutes ago impossible signal reads contacts contacts repeat amend to heavy concentration of uboats ahead and abeam am engaging every eye on the bridge swung back to tyndall his they knew the responsibility his the decisiontaken alone against the advice of his senior officer to leave the convoy almost unguarded impersonally vallery admired the baiting the timing the springing of the trap how would old giles react to this the culmination of a series of disastrous miscalculations miscalculations for which in all fairness he could not justly be blamed but he would be held accountable the iron voice of the loudspeaker broke in on his thoughts second signal reads in close contact depthcharging depthcharging one vessel torpedoed sinking tanker torpedoed damaged still afloat under command please advise please assist urgent urgent the speaker clicked off again that hushed silence strained unnatural five seconds it lasted ten twenty then everyone stiffened looked carefully away tyndall was climbing down from his chair his movements were stiff slow with the careful faltering shuffle of the very old he limped heavily his right hand startling white in its snowy sheath of bandage cradled his broken wrist there was about him a queer twisted sort of dignity and if his face held any expression at all it was the faroff echo of a smile when he spoke he spoke as a man might talk to himself aloud i am not well he said i am going below chrysler not too young to have an inkling of the tragedy held open the gate caught tyndall as he stumbled on the step he glanced back over his shoulder a quick pleading look caught and understood vallerys compassionate nod side by side the old and the young they moved slowly aft gradually the shuffling died away and they were gone the shattered bridge was curiously empty now the men felt strangely alone giles the cheerful buoyant indestructible giles was gone the speed the extent of the collapse was not for immediate comprehension the only sensation at the moment was that of being unprotected and defenceless and alone out of the mouths of babes and sucklings inevitably the first to break the silence was brooks nicholls always maintained that he stopped short his head shaking in slow incredulity i must see what i can do he finished abruptly and hurried off the bridge vallery watched him go then turned to bentley the captains face haggard shadowed with grizzled beard the colour of death in the weird halflight of the fog was quite expressionless three signals chief first to vectra steer do not disperse repeat do not disperse am coming to your assistance he paused then went on sign it admiral acs got it right no time to code it plain language send one of your men to the wt at once second to stirling sirrus and viking abandon pursuit immediate course northeast maximum speed plain language also he turned to the kapok kid hows your forehead pilot can you carry on of course sir thank you boy you heard me convoy rerouted northsay in a few minutes time at knots give me an intersection course as soon as possible third signal bentley to stirling sirrus and viking radar out of action cannot pick you up on screen stream fogbuoys siren at twominute intervals have that message coded all acknowledgements to the bridge at once commander i sir turner was at his elbow hands to defence stations its my guess the pack will have gone before we get there wholl be off watch lord only knows said turner frankly lets call it port vallery smiled faintly port it is organise two parties first of port to clear away all loose wreckage over the side with the lotkeep nothing youll need the blacksmith and his mate and im sure dodson will provide you with an oxyacetylene crew take charge yourself second of port as burial party nicholls in charge all bodies recovered to be laid out in the canteen when its clear perhaps you could give me a full report of casualties and damage inside the hour long before that sir could i have a word with you in private they walked aft as the shelter door shut behind them vallery looked at the commander curiously halfhumorously another mutiny perhaps commander no sir turner unbuttoned his coat his hand struggling into the depths of a hippocket he dragged out a flat halfbottle held it up to the light thank the lord for that he said piously i was afraid it got smashed when i fell rum sir neat i know you hate the stuff but never mind come on you need this vallerys brows came down in a straight line rum look here commander do you to hell with krs and afos turner interrupted rudely take ityou need it badly youve been hurt youve lost a lot more blood and youre almost frozen to death he uncorked it thrust the bottle into vallerys reluctant hands face facts we need youmore than ever nowand youre almost dead on your feetand i mean dead on your feet he added brutally this might keep you going a few more hours you put things so nicely vallery murmured very well against my better judgment he paused the bottle to his mouth and you give me an idea commander have the bosun break out the rum pipe up spirits double ration to each man they too are going to need it he swallowed pulled the bottle away and the grimace was not for the rum especially he added soberly the burial party chapter ten friday afternoon the switch clicked on and the harsh fluorescent light flooded the darkening surgery nicholls woke with a start one hand coming up automatically to shield exhausted eyes the light hurt he screwed his eyes to slits peered painfully at the hands of his wristwatch four oclock had he been asleep that long god it was bitterly cold he hoisted himself stiffly forward in the dentists chair twisted his head round brooks was standing with his back to the door snowcovered hood framing his silver hair numbed fingers fumbling with a packet of cigarettes finally he managed to pull one out he looked up quizzically over a flaring matchhead hallo there johnny sorry to waken you but the skipper wants you plenty of time though he dipped the cigarette into the dying flame looked up again nicholls he thought with sudden compassion looked ill desperately tired and overstrained but no point in telling him so how are you on second thoughts dont tell me im a damned sight worse myself have you any of that poison left poison sir the levity was almost automatic part of their relationship with each other just because you make one wrong diagnosis the admiral will be all right gad the intolerance of the very youngespecially on the providentially few occasions that they happen to be right i was referring to that bottle of bootleg hooch from the isle of mull coll nicholls corrected not that it matters youve drunk it all anyway he added unkindly he grinned tiredly at the commanders crestfallen face then relented but we do have a bottle of talisker left he crossed over to the poison cupboard unscrewed the top of a bottle marked lysol he heard rather than saw the clatter of glass against glass wondered vaguely with a kind of clinical detachment why his hands were shaking so badly brooks drained his glass sighed in bliss as he felt the grateful warmth sinking down inside him thank you my boy thank you you have the makings of a firstclass doctor you think so sir i dont not any longer not after today he winced remembering fortyfour of them sir over the side in ten minutes one after the other likelike so many sacks of rubbish fortyfour brooks looked up so many johnny not really sir that was the number of missing about thirty rather and god only knows how many bits and pieces it was a brush and shovel job in the fdr he smiled mirthlessly i had no dinner today i dont think anybody else in the burial party had either id better screen that porthole he turned away quickly walked across the surgery low on the horizon through the thinlyfalling snow he caught intermittent sight of an evening star that meant that the fog was gonethe fog that had saved the convoy had hidden them from the uboats when it had turned so sharply to the north he could see the vectra her depthcharge racks empty and nothing to show for it he could see the vytura the damaged tanker close by almost awash in the water hanging grimly on to the convoy he could see four of the victory ships big powerful reassuring so pitifully deceptive in their indestructible permanence he slammed the scuttle screwed home the last butterfly nut then swung round abruptly why the hell dont we turn back he burst out who does the old man think hes kiddingus or the germans no air cover no radar not the faintest chance of helpl the germans have us pinned down to an inch nowand itll be easier still for them as we go on and theres a thousand miles to go his voice rose and every bloody enemy ship uboat and plane in the arctic smacking thek lips and waiting to pick us off at thek leisure he shook his head in despair ill take my chance with anybody else sir you know that but this is just murderor suicide take your pick sir its all the same when youre dead now johnny youre not why doesnt he turn back nicholls hadnt even heard the interruption hes only got to give the order what does he want death or glory whats he after immortality at my expense at our expense he swore bitterly maybe riley was right wonderful headlines captain richard vallery dso has been posthumously awardshut up brookss eye was as chill as the arctic ice itself his voice a biting lash you dare to talk of captain vallery like that he said softly you dare to besmkch the name of the most honourable he broke off shook his head in wrathful wonder he paused to pick his words carefully his eyes never leaving the others white strained face he is a good officer lieutenant nicholls maybe even a great officer and that just doesnt matter a damn what does matter is that he is the finest gentleman i say gentleman ive ever known that ever walked the face of this graceless godforsaken earth he is not like you or me he is not like anybody at all he walks alone but he is never lonely for he has company all the way men like peter like bede like st francis of assisi he laughed shortly funny isnt it to hear an old reprobate like myself talk like this blasphemy even you might call it except that the truth can never be blasphemy and i know nicholls said nothing his face was like a stone death glory immortality brooks went on relentlessly these were your words werent they death he smiled and shook his head again for richard vallery death doesnt exist glory sure he wants glory we all want glory but all the london gazettes and buckingham palaces in the world cant give him the kind of glory he wants captain vallery is no longer a child and only children play with toys as for immortality he laughed without a trace of rancour now laid a hand on nichollss shoulder i ask you johnnywouldnt it be damned stupid to ask for what he has already nicholls said nothing the silence lengthened and deepened the rush of the air from the ventilation louvre became oppressively loud finally brooks coughed looked meaningfully at the lysol bottle nicholls filled the glasses brought them back brooks caught his eyes held them and was filled with sudden pity what was that classical understatement of cunninghams during the german invasion of crete it is inadvisable to drive men beyond a certain point trite but true true even for men like nicholls brooks wondered what particular private kind of hell that boy had gone through that morning digging out the shattered torn bodies of what had once been men and as the doctor in charge he would have had to examine them allor all the pieces he could find next step up and ill be in the gutter nichollss voice was very low i dont know what to say sir i dont know what made me say it im sorry me too brooks said sincerely shooting off my mouth like that and i mean it he lifted his glass inspected the contents lovingly to our enemies johnny their downfall and confusion and dont forget admiral starr he drained the glass at a gulp set it down looked at nicholls for a long moment i think you should hear the rest too johnny you know why vallery doesnt turn back he smiled wryly its not because there are as many of these damned uboats behind us as there are in frontwhich there undoubtedly are he lit a fresh cigarette went on quietly the captain radioed london this morning gave it as his considered opinion that fr would be a goner annihilated was the word he used and as a word they dont come any strongerlong before it reached the north cape he asked at least to be allowed to go north about instead of east for the cape pity there was no sunset tonight johnny he added halfhumourously i would have liked to see it yes yes nicholls was impatient and the answer eh oh the answer vallery expected it immediately brooks shrugged it took four hours to come through he smiled but there was no laughter in the eyes theres something big something on a huge scale brewing up somewhere it can only be some major invasionthis under your hat johnny of course sir what it is i havent a clue maybe even the longawaited second front anyway the support of the home fleet seems to be regarded as vital to success but the home fleet is tied up by the tirpitz and so the orders have gone out get the tirpitz get it at all costs brooks smiled and his face was very cold were big fish johnny were important people were the biggest juiciest bait ever offered up the biggest juiciest prize in the world todayalthough im afraid the traps a trifle rusty at the hinges the signal came from the first sea lordand starr the decision was taken at cabinet level we go on we go east we are the all costs said nicholls flatly we are expendable we are expendable brooks agreed the speaker above his head clicked on and he groaned hells bells here we go again he waited until the clamour of the dusk action stations bugle had died away stretched out a hand as nicholls hurried for the door not you johnny not yet i told you the skipper wants you on the bridge ten minutes after stations begin what on the bridge what the hell for your language is unbecoming to a junior officer said j brooks solemnly how did the men strike you today he went on inconsequently you were working with them all morning their usual selves nicholls blinked then recovered i suppose so he hesitated funny they seemed a lot better a couple of days ago butwell now theyre back to the scapa stage walking zombies only more sothey can hardly walk now he shook his head five six men to a stretcher kept tripping and falling over things asleep on their feeteyes not focusing too damned tired to look where theyre going brooks nodded i know johnny i know ive seen it myself nothing mutinous nothing sullen about them any more nicholls was puzzled seeking tiredly to reduce nebulous scattered impressions to a homogeneous coherence theyve neither the energy nor the initiative left for a mutiny now anyway i suppose but its not that kept muttering to themselves in the fdr lucky bastard he died easy things like that or old gilesoff his bleedin rocker and you can imagine the shake of the head but no humour none not even the grisly variety you usually he shook his own head i just dont know sir apathetic indifferent hopeless call em what you like id call em lost brooks looked at him a long moment then added gently would you now he mused and do you know johnny i think youd be right anyway he continued briskly get up there captains going to make a tour of the ship what nicholls was astounded during action stations leave the bridge just that but but he cant sir its its unprecedented sos captain vallery thats what ive been trying to tell you all evening but hell kill himself nicholls protested wildly thats what i said brooks agreed wryly clinically hes dying he should be dead what keeps him going god only knowsliterally it certainly isnt plasma or drugs once in a while johnny its salutary for us to appreciate the limits of medicine anyway i talked him into taking you with him better not keep him waiting for lieutenant nicholls the next two hours were borrowed from purgatory two hours the captain took to his inspection two hours of constant walking of climbing over stormsills and tangled wreckage of steel of squeezing and twisting through impossibly narrow apertures of climbing and descending a hundred ladders two hours of exhausting torture in the bitter heartsapping cold of a subzero temperature but it was a memory that was to stay with him always that was never to return without filling him with warmth with a strange and wonderful gratitude they started on the poopvallery nicholls and chief petty officer hartleyvallery would have none of hastings the masteratarms who usually accompanied the captain on his rounds there was something oddly reassuring about the big competent chief he worked like a trojan that night opening and shutting dozens of watertight doors lifting and lowering countless heavy hatches knocking off and securing the thousand clips that held these doors and hatches in place and before ten minutes had passed lending a protesting vallery the support of his powerful arm they climbed down the long vertical ladder to y magazine a dim and gloomy dungeon thinly lit with pinpoints of garish light here were the butchers bakers and candlestick makersthe nonspecialists in the purely offensive branches hostilities only ratings almost to a man in charge of a trained gunner they had a cold dirty and unglamorous job strangely neglected and forgotten strangely because so terribly dangerous the fourinch armour encasing them offered about as much protection as a sheet of newspaper to an eightinch armourpiercing shell or a torpedo the magazine wallswalls of shells and cartridge cases were soaking wet dripping constantly visibly with icy condensation half the crew were leaning or lying against the racks blue pinched shivering with cold their breath hanging heavily in the chill air the others were trudging heavily round and round the hoist feet splashing in pools of water lurching stumbling with sheer exhaustion gloved hands buried in their pockets drawn exhausted faces sunk on their chests zombies nicholls thought wonderingly just living zombies why dont they lie down gradually everyone became aware of vallerys presence stopped walking or struggling painfully erect eyes too tired minds too spent for either wonder or surprise as you were as you were vallery said quickly whos in charge here i am sir a stocky overalled figure walked slowly forward halted in front of vallery ah yes gardiner isnt it he gestured to the men circling the hoist what in the world is all this for gardiner ice said gardiner succinctly we have to keep the water moving or itll freeze in a couple of minutes we cant have ice on the magazine floor sir no no of course not butbut the pumps the draincocks solid but surelythis doesnt go on all the time in flat weatherall the time sir good god vallery shook his head incredulously splashed his way to the centre of the group where a slight boyish figure was coughing cruelly into a corner of an enormous green and white muffler vallery placed a concerned arm across the shaking shoulders are you all right boy yes sir course ah am he lifted a thin white face racked with pain ahm fine he said indignantly whats your name mcquater sir and whats your job mcquater assistant cook sir how old are you eighteen sir merciful heavens vallery thought this isnt a cruiser im runningits a nursery from glasgow eh he smiled yes sir defensively i see he looked down at the deck at mcquaters boots halfcovered in water why arent you wearing your seaboots he asked abruptly we dont get issued with them sir but your feet man they must be soaking ah dont know sir ah think so anyway mcquater said simply it doesna matter ah canna feel them vallery winced nicholls looking at the captain wondered if he realised the distressing pathetic picture he himself presented with his sunken bloodless face red inflamed eyes his mouth and nose daubed with crimson the inevitable dark and sodden handtowel clutched in his left glove suddenly unaccountably nicholls felt ashamed of himself that thought he knew could never occur to this man vallery smiled down at mcquater tell me son honestlyare you tired ah am thatah mean aye aye sir me too vallery confessed but you can carry on a bit longer he felt the frail shoulders straighten under his arm course ah can sir the tone was injured almost truculent course ah can vallerys gaze travelled slowly over the group his dark eyes glowing as he heard a murmured chorus of assent he made to speak broke off in a harsh coughing and bent his head he looked up again his eyes wandering once more over the circle of nowanxious faces then turned abruptly away we wont forget you he murmured indistinctly i promise you we wont forget you he splashed quickly away out of the pool of water out of the pool of light into the darkness at the foot of the ladder ten minutes later they emerged from y turret the night sky was cloudless now brilliant with diamantine stars little chips of frozen fire in the dark velvet of that fathomless floor the cold was intense captain vallery shivered involuntarily as the turret door slammed behind them hartley sir i smelt rum in there yes sir so did i the chief was cheerful unperturbed proper stinking with it dont worry about it though sir half the men in the ship bottle their rum ration keep it for action stations completely forbidden in regulations chief you know that as well as i do i know but theres no harm sir warms em upand if it gives them dutch courage all the better remember that night the forard pompom got two stukas of course canned to the wide never have done it otherwise and now sir they need it suppose youre right chief they do and i dont blame them he chuckled and dont worry about my knowing ive always known but it smelled like a saloon bar in there they climbed up to x turretthe marine turret then down to the magazine wherever he went as in y magazine vallery left the men the better for his coming in personal contact he had some strange indefinable power that lifted men above themselves that brought out in them something they had never known to exist to see dull apathy and hopelessness slowly give way to resolution albeit a kind of numbed and desperate resolve was to see something that baffled the understanding physically and mentally nicholls knew these men had long since passed the point of no return vaguely he tried to figure it out to study the approach and technique but the approach varied every time he saw was no more than a natural reaction to different sets of cirr cumstances as they presented themselves a reaction utterly lacking in calculation or finesse there was no technique was pity then the activating force pity for the neartreaјing gallantry of a man so clearly dying or was it shame if he can do it if he can still drive that wasted mockery of a body if he can kill himself just to come to see if were all rightif he can do that and smilethen by god we can stick it out too thats it nicholls said to himself thats what it is pity and shame and he hated himself for thinking it and not because of the thought but because he knew he lied he was too tired to think anyway his mind was woolly fuzzy round the edges his thoughts disjointed uncontrolled like everyone elses even andy carpenter the last man you would suspect of ithe felt that way too and admitted it he wondered what the kapok kid would have to say to this the kid was probably wandering too but wandering in his own way back as always on the banks of the thames he wondered what the girl in henley was like her name started with j joan jean he didnt know the kapok kid had a big golden j on the right breast of his kapok suit she had put it there but what was she like blonde and gay like the kid himself or dark and kind and gentle like st francis of assisi st francis of assisi why in the world did heah yes old socrates had been talking about him wasnt he the man of whom axel munthe nicholls are you all right vallerys voice was sharp with anxiety yes of course sir nicholls shook his head as if to clear it just gathering wool where to now sir engineers flat damage control parties switchboard number low power roomno of course thats gone noyes was killed there wasnt he hartley id appreciate it if youd let my feet touch the deck occasionally all these places they visited in turn and a dozen others besidesnot even the remotest corner the most impossible of access did vallery pass by if he knew a man was there closed up to his action station they came at last to the engine and boilerrooms to the gulping pressure changes on unaccustomed eardrums as they went through the airlocks to the antithetically breathtaking blast of heat as they passed inside in aboilerroom nicholls insisted on vallerys resting for some minutes he was grey with pain and weakness his breathing very dishu f tressed nicholls noticed hartley talking in a corner was dimly aware of someone leaving the boilerroom then his eyes caught sight of a burly swarthy stoker with bruised cheeks and the remnants of a gorgeous black eye stalking across the floor he carried a canvas chair set it down with a thump behind vallery a seat sir he growled thank you thank you vallery lowered himself gratefully then looked up in surprise riley he murmured then switched his glance to hendry the chief stoker doing his duty with a minimum of grace eh hendry stirred uncomfortably he did it off his own bat sir im sorry vallery said sincerely forgive me riley thank you very much he stared after him in puzzled wonder looked again at hendry eyebrows lifted in interrogation hendry shook his head search me sir ive no idea hes a queer fish does things like that hed bend a lead pipe over your skull without batting an eyelidand hes got a mania for looking after kittens and lame dogs or if you get a bird with a broken wingrileys your man but hes got a low opinion of his fellowmen sir vallery nodded slowly without speaking leaned against the canvas back and closed his eyes in exhaustion nicholls bent over him look sir he urged quietly why not give it up frankly sir youre killing yourself cant we finish this some other time im afraid not my boy vallery was very patient you dont understand some other time will be too late he turned to hendry so you think youll manage all right chief dont you worry about us sir the soft devon voice was grim and gentle at the same time just you look after yourself the stokers wont let you down sir vallery rose painfully to his feet touched him lightly on the arm do you know chief i never thought you would ready hartley he stopped short seeing a giant duffel coated figure waiting at the foot of the ladder the face below the hood dark and sombre whos that oh i know never thought stokers got so cold he smiled j yes sir its petersen hartley said softly hes coming with us who said so andand petersen wasnt that yes sir rileyserlieutenant in the scapa business surgeon commanders orders sir petersens going to give us a hand us me you mean there was no resentment no bitterness in vallerys voice hartley take my advice never let yourself get into the hands of the doctors you think hes safe he added halfhumorously hed probably kill the man who looked sideways at you hartley stated matteroffactly hes a good man sir simple easily ledbut good at the foot of the ladder petersen stepped aside to let them pass but vallery stopped looked up at the giant towering six inches above him into the grave blue eyes below the flaxen hair hallo petersen hartley tells me youre coming with us do you really want to you dont have to you know please captain the speech was slow and precise the face curiously dignified in unhappiness i am very sorry for what has happened no no vallery was instantly contrite you misunderstand its a bitter night up top but i would like it very much if you would come will you petersen stared at him then began slowly to smile his face darkening with pleasure as the captain set foot on the first step the giant arm came round him the sensation as vallery described it later was very much like going up in a lift from there they visited engineer commander dodson in his engineroom a cheerful encouraging immensely competent dodson an engineer to his fingertips in his singleminded devotion to the great engines under his care then aft to the engineers flat up the companionway between the wrecked canteen and the police office out on to the upper deck after the heat of the boilerroom the drop in temperature a drop that strangled breath with the involuntary constriction of the throat and made a skincrawling mockery of arctic clothing was almost literally paralysing the starboard torpedo tubesthe only ones at the standby were only four paces away the crew huddled in the lee of the wrecked bosuns storethe one destroyed by the blue rangers shellswere easily located by the stamping of frozen feet the uncontrollable chattering of teeth vallery peered into the gloom lto there captain sir surprise doubt in the voice yes how are things going all right sir he was still offbalance hesitant i think young smiths left foot is gone sirfrostbite take him belowat once and organise your crew into ten minute watches one to keep a telephone watch here the other four in the engineers flat from now on you understand he hurried away as if to avoid the embarrassment of thanks the murmurs of smiling gladness they passed the torpedo shop where the spare torpedoes and compressed air cylinders were stored climbed the ladder to the boatdeck vallery paused a moment one hand on the boatwinch the other holding the bloody scarf already frozen almost solid to mouth and nose he could just distinguish the shadowy bulkiness of merchantmen on either side their masts though were oddly visible swinging lazily gently against the stars as the ships rolled to a slight swell just beginning he shuddered pulled his scarf higher round his neck god it was cold he moved forard leaning heavily on petersons arm the snow three to four inches deep cushioned his footsteps as he came up behind an oerlikon gun quietly he laid a hand on the shoulder of the hooded gunner hunched forward in his cockpit things all right gunner no reply the man appeared to stir moved forward then fell still again i said are you all right vallerys voice had hard i ened he shook the gunner by the shoulder turned impatiently to hartley asleep chief at action stations were all dead from lack of sleep i knowbut his mates below are depending on him theres no excuse take his name take his name nicholls echoed softly bent over the i cockpit he shouldnt speak like this he knew but he couldnt help it take his name he repeated what for his next of kin this man is dead the snow was beginning to fall again cold and wet and feathery the wind lifting a perceptible fraction vallery felt the first icy flakes unseen in the darkness brushing his cheeks heard the distant moan of the wind in the rigging lonely and forlorn he shivered his heaters gone hartley withdrew an exploratory hand straightened up he seemed tired these oerlikons have black heaters bolted to the side of the cockpit the gunners lean against them sir for hours at a time im afraid the fuse must have blown theyve been warned against this sir a thousand times good god good god vallery shook his head slowly he felt old terribly tired what a useless futile way to die have him taken to the canteen hartley no good sir nicholls straightened up also itll have to wait what with the cold and the quick onset of rigor mortiswell itll have to wait vallery nodded assent turned heavily away all at once the deck speaker aft of the winch blared into raucous life a rude desecration that shattered the chilled hush of the evening do you hear there do you hear there captain or notify captain to contact bridge immediately please three times the message was repeated then the speaker clicked off quickly vallery turned to hartley wheres the nearest phone chief right here sir hartley turned back to the oerlikon stripped earphones and chest mouthpiece from the dead man that is if the aa tower is still manned whats left of it is tower captain to speak to bridge put me through he handed the receiver to vallery here you are sir thank you bridge yes speaking yes yes very good detail the sirrus no commander nothing i can do anywayjust maintain position thats all he took the handset off handed it back to hartley asdic contact from viking he said briefly red he turned looked out over the dark sea realised the futility of his instinctive action and shrugged weve sent the sirrus after him come on their tour of the boatdeck gunsites completed with a visit to the midships pompom crew bonechilled and shaking with cold under the command of the bearded doyle respectfully sulphurous in his outspoken comments on the weather they dropped down to the main deck again by this time vallery was making no protest at all not even of the most token kind against petersens help and support he was too glad of them he blessed brooks for his foresight and thoughtfulness and was touched by the rare delicacy and consideration that prompted the big norwegian to withdraw his supporting arm whenever they spoke to or passed an isolated group of men inside the port screen door and just forard of the galley vallery and nicholls waiting as the others knocked the clamps off the hatch leading down to the stokers mess heard the muffled roar of distant depthchargesthere were four in allfelt the pressure waves strike the hull of the ulysses at the first report vallery had stiffened head cocked in attention eyes fixed on infinity in the immemorial manner of a man whose ears are doing the work for all the senses hesitated a moment shrugged bent his arm to hook a leg over the hatch coaming there was nothing he could do in the centre of the stokers mess was another heavier hatch this too was opened the ladder led down to the steering position which as in most modern warships was far removed from the bridge deep in the heart of the ship below the armourplating here for a couple of minutes vallery talked quietly to the quartermaster while petersen working in the confined space just outside opened the massive hatch ibs of steel actuated by a counterbalancing pulley weightwhich gave access to the hold to the very bottom of the ulysses to the transmitting station and no low power room a mazing confusing mystery of a place this low power room confusing to the eye and ear round every bulkhead interspersed with scores of switches breakers and rheostats were ranged tiered banks of literally hundreds of fuses baffling to the untrained eye in their myriad complexity baffling too was the function of a score or more of lowpower generators nervedrilling in the frenetic dissonance of i their highpitched hums nicholls straightened up at the foot of the ladder and shuddered involuntarily a bad place this how easily could mind and nerves slide over the edge of insanity under the pounding insistent clamour of the desynchronised cacophony just then there were only two men therean electric artificer and his assistant bent over the big sperry master gyro making some latitude adjustment to the highly complex machinery of the compass they looked up quickly tired surprise melting into tired pleasure vallery had a few words with themspeech was difficult in that bedlam of soundthen moved over to the door of the ts he had his glove on the door handle when he froze to complete stillness another pattern had exploded much closer this time two cable lengths distant at most depthcharges they knew but only because reason and experience told them deep down in the heart of an armourplated ship there is no sense of explosion no roar of erruption from a detonating depthcharge instead there is a tremendous metallic clang peculiarly tinny in calibre as if some giant with a giant sledge had struck the ships side and found the armour loose the pattern was followed almost immediately by another two explosions and the ulysses was still shuddering under the impact of the second when vallery turned the handle and walked in the others filed in after the captain petersen closing the door softly behind him at once the clamour of the electric motors died gratefully away in the hushed silence of the ts the ts fighting heart of the ship lined like the low power room though it was by banks of fuses was completely dominated by the two huge electronic computing tables occupying almost half the floor space these the vital links between the fire control towers and the turrets were generally the scene of intense controlled activity but the almost total destruction of the towers that morning had made them all but useless and the undermanned ts was strangely quiet altogether there were only eight ratings and an officer manning the tables the air in the ts a ts prominently behung with no smoking notices was blue with tobacco smoke hanging in a flat lazily drifting cloud near the deckhead a cloud which spiralled thinly down to smouldering cigarette ends for nicholls there was something oddly reassuring in these burning cigarettes in the unnatural bowtaut stillness in the inhuman immobility of the men it was the only guarantee of life he looked in a kind of detached curiosity at the rating nearest him a thin darkhaired man he was sitting hunched forward his elbow on the table the cigarette clipped between his fingers a bare inch from his halfopen mouth the smoke was curling up lacing its smarting path across vacant sightless eyes oblivious to the irritation the ash on the cigarette itself almost two inches in length drooping slightly vaguely nicholls wondered how long he had been sitting there motionless utterly motionless and why expectancy of course that was itexpectancy it was too obvious waiting just waiting waiting for what for the first time it struck nicholls struck him with blinding clarity what it was to wait to wait with the bowstring of the nerves strung down at inhuman tension strung down far beyond quivering to the tautened immobility of snapping point to wait for the torpedo that would send them crashing into oblivion for the first time he realised why it was that men who could invariably it seemd find something complainingly humorous in any place and every place never joked about the ts a death trap is not funny the ts was twenty feet below water level forard of it was b magazine aft of it a boilerroom on either side of it were fuel tanks and below it was the unprotected bottom prime target for acoustic mines and torpedoes they were ringed surrounded by the elements the threat of death and it needed only a flash a wandering spark to trigger off the annihilating reality and above them in the one in a thousand chance of survival was a series of hatches which could all too easily warp and lock solid under the metaltwisting shock of an explosion besides the primary idea was that the hatches deliberately heavy in construction should stay shut in the event of damage to seal off the flooded compartments below the men in the ts knew this goodevening everything all right down here vallerys voice quiet and calm as ever sounded unnaturally loud startled faces white and strained twisted round eyes opening in astonishment the depthcharging nicholls realised had masked their approach wouldnt worry too much about the racket outside vallery went on reassuringly a wandering uboat and the sirrus is after him you can thank your stars youre here and not in that sub no one else had spoken nicholls watching them saw their eyes flickering back from vallerys face to the forbidden cigarettes understood their discomfort their embarrassment at being caught redhanded by the captain any reports from the main tower brierley he asked the officer in charge he seemed unaware of the strain no sir nothing at all all quiet above fine vallery sounded positively cheerful no news is good news he brought his hand out from his pocket proffered his cigarette case to brierley smoke and you nicholls he took one himself replaced the case absently picked up a box of matches lying in front of the nearest gunner and if he noticed the gunners startled disbelief the slow beginnings of a smile the tired shoulders slumping fractionally in a long soundless sigh of relief he gave no sign the thunderous clanging of more depthcharges drowned the rasping of the hatch drowned vallerys harsh convulsive coughing as the smoke reached his lungs only the reddening of the sodden handtowel betrayed him as the last vibration died away he looked up concern in his eyes good god does it always sound like that down here brierley smiled faintly more or less sir usually more vallery looked slowly round the men in the ts nodded forard b magazine there isnt it yes sir and nice big fuel tanks all around you brierley nodded every eye was on the captain i see frankly id rather have my own jobwouldnt have yours for a pension nicholls i think well spend a few minutes down here have our smoke in peace besides he grinned think of the increased fervour with which well count our blessings when we get out of here he stayed five minutes talking quietly to brierley and his men finally he stubbed out his cigarette took his leave and started for the door sir the voice stopped him on the threshold the voice of the thin dark gunner whose matches he had borrowed yes what is it i thought you might like this he held out a clean white towel that one youve got is well sir i mean thank you vallery took the towel without any hesitation thank you very much despite petersens assistance the long climb up to the upper deck left vallery very weak his feet were dragging heavily look sir this is madness nicholls was desperately anxious sorry sir i didnt mean that butwdl come and see commander brooks please certainly the reply was a husky whisper our next port of call anyway half a dozen paces took them to the door of the sick bay vallery insisted on seeing brooks alone when he came out of the surgery after some time he seemed curiously refreshed his step lighter he was smiling and so was brooks nicholls lagged behind as the captain left give him anything sir he asked honest to god hes killing himself he took something not much brooks smiled softly i know hes killing himself so does he but he knows why and i know why and he knows i know why anyway he feels better not to worry johnny i nicholls waited at the top of the ladder outside the sick bay waited for the captain and others to come up from the telephone exchange and no low power room he stood aside as they climbed the coaming but vallery took his arm walked him slowly forard past the torpedo office nodding curtly to carslake in nominal charge of a damage control party carslake face still swathed in white looked back with eyes wild and staring and strange his gaze almost devoid of recognition vallery hesitated shook his head then turned to nicholls smiling bma in secret session eh he queried never mind nicholls and dont worry im the one who should be worrying indeed sir why vallery shook his head again rum in the gun turrets cigarettes in the ts and now a fine old whisky in a lysol bottle thought commander brooks was going to poison me and what a glorious death excellent stuff and the surgeon commanders apologies to you for broaching your private supplies nicholls flushed darkly began to stammer an apology but vallery cut him off forget it boy forget it what does it matter but it makes me wonder what were going to find next an opium den in the capstan flat perhaps or dancing girls in b turret but they found nothing in these or any other places except cold misery and hungerhaunted exhaustion as ever nicholls saw theyor rather valleryleft the men the better of their coming but they themselves were now in a pretty bad state nicholls realised his own legs were made of rubber he was exhausted by continuous shivering where vallery found the strength to carry on he couldnt even begin to imagine even petersens great strength was flagging not so much from halfcarrying vallery as from the ceaseless hammering of clips frozen solid on doors and hatches leaning against a bulkhead breathing heavily after the ascent from amagazine nicholls looked hopefully at the captain vallery saw the look interpreted it correctly and shook his head smiling might as well finish it boy only the capstan flat nobody there anyway i expect but we might as well have a look they walked slowly round the heavy machinery in the middle of the capstan flat forard past the battery room and sailmakers shop past the electrical workshop and cells to the locked door of the painters shop the most forard compartment in the ship vallery reached his hand forward touched the door symbolically smiled tiredly and turned away passing the cell door he casually flicked open the inspection port glanced in perfunctorily and moved on then he stopped dead wheeled round and flung open the inspection port again what in the name ofralston what on earth are you doing here he shouted ralston smiled even through the thick plate glass it wasnt a pleasant smile and it never touched the blue eyes he gestured to the barred grille indicating that he could not hear impatiently vallery twisted the grille handle what are you doing here ralston he demanded the brows were drawn down heavily over blazing eyes in the cellsand at this time speak up man tell me nicholls looked at vallery in slow surprise the old manangry it was unheard of shrewdly nicholls decided that hed rather not be the object of vallerys fury i was locked up here sir the words were innocuous enough but their tone said what a damned silly question vallery flushed faintly when at this morning sir and by whom may i inquire by the masteratarms sir on what authority vallery demanded furiously ralston looked at him a long moment without speaking his face was expressionless on yours sir mine vallery was incredulous i didnt tell him to lock you up you never told him not to said ralston evenly vallery winced the oversight the lack of consideration was his and that hurt badly wheres your night action station he asked sharply port tubes sir that vallery realised explained why only the starboard crew had been closed up and whywhy have you been left here during action stations dont you know its forbidden against all regulations yes sir again the hint of the wintry smile i know but does the masteratarms know he paused a second smiled again or maybe he just forgot he suggested hartley vallery was on balance again his tone level and grim the masteratarms here immediately see that he brings his keys he broke into a harsh bout of coughing spat some blood into the towel looked at ralston again im sorry about this my boy he said slowly genuinely sorry hows the tanker ralston asked softly what what did you say vallery was unprepared for the sudden switch what tanker the one that was damaged this morning sir still with us vallery was puzzled still with us but low in the water any special reason for asking just interested sir the smile was wry but this time it was a smile you see he stopped abruptly as a deep muffled roar crashed through the silent night the pressure blast listing the ulysses sharply to starboard vallery lurched staggered and would have fallen but for petersens sudden arm he braced himself against the righting roll looked at nicholls in sudden dismay the sound was all too familiar nicholls gazed back at him sorry to his heart for this fresh burden for a dying man and nodded slowly in reluctant agreement with the unspoken thought in vallerys eyes afraid youre right sir torpedo somebodys stopped a packet do you hear there the capstan flat speaker was hurried intense unnaturally loud in the aftermath of silence do you hear there captain on the bridge urgent captain on the bridge urgent captain on the bridge urgent chapter eleven friday evening bent almost double captain vallery clutched the handrail of the port ladder leading up to the focsle deck desperately he tried to look out over the darkened water but he could see nothing a mist a dark and swirling and roaring mist flecked with blood a mist shot through with dazzling light swam before his eyes and he was blind his breath came in great whoopings gasps that racked his tortured lungs his lower ribs were clamped in giant pincers pincers that were surely crushing him that stumbling lurching run from the forepeak he dimly realised had all but killed him close too damn close he thought i must be more careful in future slowly his vision cleared but the brilliant light remained heavens above vallery thought a blind man could have seen all there was to see here for there was nothing to be seen but the tenebrous silhouette so faint as to be almost imagined of a tanker deep deep in the waterand a great column of flame hundreds of feet in height streaking upwards from the heart of the dense mushroom of smoke that obscured the bows of the torpedoed ship even at the distance of half a mile the roaring of the flames was almost intolerable vallery watched appalled behind him he could hear nicholls swearing softly bitterly continuously vallery felt petersens hand on his arm does the captain wish to go up to the bridge in a moment petersen in a moment just hang on his mind was functioning again his eyes conditioned by forty years training automatically sweeping the horizon funny he thought you can hardly see the tankerthe vytura it must beshes shielded by that thick pall of smoke probably but the other ships in the convoy white ghostlike sharply etched against the indigo blue of the sky were bathed in that deadly glare even the stars had died he became aware that nicholls was no longer swearing in repetitious monotony that he was talking to him a tanker isnt it sir hadnt we better take shelter remember what happened to that other one what one vallery was hardly listening the cochella a few days ago i think it was good god no it was only this morning when tankers go up they go up nicholls vallery seemed curiously far away if they just burn they may last long enough tankers die hard terribly hard my boy they live where any other ship would sink butbut she must have a hole the size of a house in her side nicholls protested no odds vallery replied he seemed to be waiting watching for something tremendous reserve buoyancy in these ships maybe sealed tanks not to mention cofferdams pumprooms enginerooms never heard of the nelson device for pumping compressed air into a tankers oil tanks to give it buoyancy to keep it afloat never heard of captain dudley mason and the ohiot never heard of he broke off suddenly and when he spoke again the dreaming lethargy of the voice was gone i thought so he exclaimed his voice sharp with excitement i thought so the vyturas still under way still under command good god she must still be doing almost knots the bridge quick vallerys feet left the deck barely touched it again till petersen set him down carefully on the duckboards in front of the startled commander vallery grinned faintly at turners astonishment at the bushy eyebrows lifting over the dark lean buccaneers face leaner more recklessly chiselled than ever in the glare of the blazing tanker if ever a man was born years too late vallery thought inconsequentially but what a man to have around its all right commander he laughed shortly brooks thought i needed a man friday thats stoker petersen overenthusiastic maybe a trifle apt to take orders too literally but he was a godsend to me tonight but never mind me he jerked his thumb towards the tanker blazing even more whitely now difficult to look at almost as the noonday sun how about him makes a bloody fine lighthouse for any german ship or plane that happens to be looking for us turner growled might as well send a signal to trondheim giving our lat and long exactly vallery nodded besides setting up some beautiful targets for the sub that got the vytura just now a dangerous fellow commander that was a brilliant piece of workin almost total darkness too probably a scuttle somebody forgot to shut we havent the ships to keep checking them all the time and it wasnt so damned brilliant at least not for him the vikings in contact right now sitting over the top of him i sent her right away good man vallery said warmly he turned to look at the burning tanker looked back at turner his face set shell have to go commander turner nodded slowly shell have to go he echoed it is the vytura isnt it thats her same one that caught it this morning whos the master havent the foggiest turner confessed number one pilot any idea where the sailing list is no sir the kapok kid was hesitant oddly unsure of himself admiral had them i know probably gone now what makes you think that vallery asked sharply spicer his pantry steward was almost choked with smoke this afternoon found him making a whacking great fire in his bath the kapok kid said miserably said he was burning vital documents that must not fall into enemy hands old newspapers mostly but i think the list must have been among them its nowhere else poor old turner remembered just in time that he was speaking of the admiral broke off shook bis head in compassionate wonder shall i send a signal to fletcher on the cape hatterasl never mind vallery was impatient theres no time bentleyto the master vytura please abandon ship immediately we are going to sink you suddenly vallery stumbled caught hold of turners arm sorry he apologised im afraid my legs are going gone rather he smiled up wryly at the anxious faces no good pretending any longer is there not when your legs start a mutiny on their own oh dear god im done and no bloody wonder turner swore i wouldnt treat a mad dog the way you treat yourself come on sir admirals chair for younow if you dont ill get petersen to you he threatened as vallery made to protest the protest died in a smile and vallery meekly allowed himself to be helped into a chair he sighed deeply relaxed into the godsent support of the back and arms of the chair he felt ghastly powerless his wasted body a wide sea of pain and deadly cold all these things but also proud and grateful turner had never even suggested that he go below he heard the gate crash behind him the murmur of voices then turner was at his side the masteratarms sir did you send for him i certainly did vallery twisted in his chair his face grim comehere hastings the masteratarms stood at attention before him as always his face was a mask inscrutable expressionless almost inhuman in that fierce light listen carefully vallery had to raise his voice above the roar of the flames the effort even to speak was exhausting i have no time to talk to you now i will see you in the morning meantime you will release leading seaman ralston immediately you will then hand over your duties your papers and your keys to regulating petty officer perrat twice now you have overstepped the limits of your authority that is insolence but it can be overlooked but you have also kept a man locked in cells during action stations the prisoner would have died like a rat in a trap you are no longer masteratarms of the ulysses that is all for a couple of seconds hastings stood rigidly in shocked unbelieving silence then the iron discipline snapped he stepped forward arms raised in appeal the mask collapsed in contorted bewilderment relieved of my duties relieved of my duties but sir you cant do that you cant his voice broke off in a gasp of pain as turners iron grip closed over his elbow dont say cant to the captain he whispered silkily in his ear you heard him get off the bridge the gate clicked behind him carrington said conversationally somebodys using his head aboard the vytura fitted a red filter to his aldis couldnt see it otherwise immediately the tension eased all eyes were on the winking red light a hundred feet aft of the flames and even then barely distinguishable suddenly it stopped what does he say bentley vallery asked quickly bentley coughed apologetically message reads are you hell try it and i will ram you engine intact we can make it vallery closed his eyes for a moment he was beginning to appreciate how old giles must have felt when he looked up again he had made his decision signal you are endangering entire convoy abandon ship at once repeat at once he turned to the commander his mouth bitter i take off my hat to him how would you like to sit on top of enough fuel to blow you to kingdom come must be oil in some of his tanks god how i hate to have to threaten a man like that i know sir turner murmured i know how it is wonder what the vikings doing out there should be hearing from her now send a signal vallery ordered ask for information he peered aft searched briefly for the torpedo lieutenant wheres marshall marshall turner was surprised in the sick bay of course still on the injured list rememberfour ribs gone of course of course vallery shook his head tiredly angry with himself and the chief torpedo gunners matenoyes isnt ithe was killed yesterday in number how about vickers he was in the fdr in the fdr vallery repeated slowly he wondered why his heart didnt stop beating he was long past the stage of chilled bone and coagulating blood his whole body was a great block of ice he had never known that such cold could exist it was very strange he thought that he was no longer shivering ill do it myself sir turner interrupted his wandering ill take over the bridge torpedo controlused to be the worst torps officer on the china station he smiled faintly perhaps the hand has not lost what little cunning it ever possessed thank you vallery was grateful you just do that well have to take him from starboard turner reminded him port control was smashed this morningforemast didnt do it any good ill go check the dumaresq good god his hand gripped vallerys shoulder with a strength that made him wince its the admiral sir hes coming on the bridge incredulously vallery twisted round in his chair turner was right tyndall was coming through the gate heading purposefully towards him in the deep shadow cast by the side of the bridge he seemed disembodied the bare head sparsely covered with thin straggling wisps of white the grey pitifullyshrunken face the suddenly stooped shoulders unaccountably thin under black oilskins all these were thrown into harsh relief by the flames below nothing was visible silently tyndall padded his way across the bridge stood waiting at vallerys side slowly leaning on turners ready arm vallery climbed down unsmiling tyndall looked at him nodded gravely hoisted himself into his seat he picked up the binoculars from the ledge before him slowly quartered the horizon it was turner who noticed it first sir youve no gloves on sir i what what did you say tyndall replaced the glasses looked incredulously at his bloodstained bandaged hands ah do you know i knew i had forgotten something thats the second time thank you commander he smiled courteously picked up the binoculars again resumed hs quartering of the horizon all at once vallery felt another deadlier chill pass through him and it had nothing to do with the bitter chill of the arctic night turner hesitated helplessly for a second then turned quickly to the kapok kid pilot havent i seen gauntlets hanging in your charthouse yes sir right away the kapok kid hurried off the bridge turner looked up at the admiral again your head siryouve nothing on wouldnt you like a duffel coat a hood sir a hood tyndall was amused what in the world for im not cold if youll excuse me commander he turned the binoculars full into the glare of the blazing vytura turner looked at him again looked at vallery hesitated then walked aft carpenter was on his way back with the gloves when the wt loudspeaker clicked on wtbridge wtbridge signal from viking lost contact am continuing search lost contact vallery exclaimed lost contactthe worst possible thing that could have happened a uboat out there loose unmarked and the whole of fr lit up like a fairground a fairground he thought bitterly clay pipes in a shooting gallery and with about as much chance of hitting back once contact had been lost any second now he wheeled round clutched at the binnacle for support he had forgotten how weak he was how the tilting of the shattered bridge affected balance bentley no reply from the vytura yet no sir bentley was as concerned as the captain as aware of the desperate need for speed maybe his powers goneno no no there he is now sir captain sir vallery looked round yes commander what is it not more bad news i hope fraid so sir starboard tubes wont trainjammed solid wont train vallery snapped irritably thats nothing new surely ice frozen snow chip it off use boiling water blowlamps any old sorry sir turner shook his head regretfully not that rack and turntable buckled must have been either the shell that got the bosuns store or number low power roomimmediately below anywaykaput very well then vallery was impatient itll have to be the port tubes no bridge control left sir turner objected unless we fire by local control no reason why not is there vallery demanded after all thats what torpedo crews are trained for get on to the port tubesi assume the communication line there is still intacttell them to stand by yes sir and turner sir im sorry he smiled crookedly as old giles used to say of himself im just a crusty old curmudgeon bear with me will you turner grinned sympathetically then sobered quickly he jerked his head forward how is he sir vallery looked at the commander for a long second shook his head almost imperceptibly turner nodded heavily and was gone well bentley what does he say bit confused sir bentley apologised couldnt get it all says hes going to leave the convoy proceed on his own something like that sir proceed on his own that was no solution vallery knew he might still burn for hours a dead giveaway even on a different course but to proceed on his own an unprotected crippled blazing tankerand a thousand miles to murmansk the worst thousand miles in all the world vallery closed his eyes he felt sick to his heart a man like that and a ship like thatand he had to destroy them both suddenly tyndall spoke port he ordered his voice was loud authoritative vallery stiffened in dismay port theyd turn into the vytura there was a couple of seconds silence then carrington officer of the watch bent over the speakingtube repeated port vallery started forward stopped short as he saw carrington gesturing at the speakingtube hed stuffed a gauntlet down the mouthpiece midships midships sir steady captain sir that light hurts my eyes tyndall complained cant we put that fire out well try sir vallery walked across spoke softly you look tired sir wouldnt you like to go below what go below me yes sir well send for you if we need you he added persuasively tyndall considered this for a moment shook his head grimly wont do dick not fair to you his voice trailed away and he muttered something that sounded like admiral tyndall but vallery couldnt be sure sir i didnt catch nothing tyndall was very abrupt he looked away towards the vytura exclaimed in sudden pain flung up an arm to protect his eyes vallery too started back eyes screwed up to shut out the sudden blinding flash of flame from the vytura the explosion crashed in their ears almost simultaneously the blast of the pressure wave sent them reeling the vytura had been torpedoed again right aft close to her engineroom and was heavily on fire there only the bridge island amidships was miraculously free from smoke and flames even in the moment of shock vallery thought she must go now she cant last much longer but he knew he was deluding himself trying to avoid the inevitable the decision he must take tankers as hed told nicholls died hard terribly hard poor old giles he thought unaccountably poor old giles he moved aft to the port gate turner was shouting angrily into the telephone youll damn well do what youre told do you hear get them out immediately yes i said immediately vallery touched his arm in surprise whats the matter commander of all the bloody insolence i turner snorted telling me what to do who the lto on the tubes your friend ralston said turner wrathfully ralston of course vallery remembered now he told me that was his night action stations whats wrong whats wrong says he doesnt think he can do it doesnt like to doesnt wish to do it if you please blasted insubordination turner fumed vallery blinked at him ralston are you sure but of course you are i wonder that boys been through a very private hell turner do you think i dont know what to think turner lifted the phone again tubes nineoh at last what what did you say why dont we gunfire gunfire he hung up the receiver with a crash swung round on vallery asks me pleads with me for gunfire instead of torpedoes hes mad he must be but mad or not im going down there to knock some sense into that mutinous young devil turner was angrier than vallery had ever seen him can you get carrington to man this phone sir yes yes of course vallery himself had caught up some of turners anger whatever his sentiments this is no time to express them he snapped straighten him up maybe ive been too lenient too easy perhaps he thinks were in his debt at some psychological disadvantage for the shabby treatment hes received all right all right commander turners mounting impatience was all too evident os you go going in to attack in three or four minutes he turned abruptly passed in to the compass platform bentley sir last signal better have a look sir carrington interrupted hes slowing up vallery stepped forward peered over the windscreen the vytura a roaring mass of flames was falling rapidly astern clearing the davits sir the kapok kid reported excitedly i thinkyes yes i can see the boat coming down thank god for that vallery whispered he felt as though he had been granted a new lease of life head bowed he clutched the screen with both handsreaction had left him desperately weak after a few seconds he looked up wt code signal to sirrus he ordered quietly circle well astern pick up survivors from the vyturas lifeboat he caught carringtons quick look and shrugged its a better than even risk number one so to hell with admiralty orders god he added with sudden bitterness wouldnt i love to see a boatload of the nosurvivorswillbepickedup whitehall warriors drifting about in the barents sea he turned away caught sight of nicholls and petersen still here are you nicholls hadnt you better get below if you wish sir nicholls hesitated nodded forward towards tyndall i thought perhaps perhaps youre right perhaps youre right vallery shook his head in weary perplexity well see just wait a bit will you he raised his voice pilot sir slow ahead both slow ahead both sir gradually then more quickly way fell off the ulysses and she dropped slowly astern of the convoy soon even the last ships in the lines were ahead of her thrashing their way to the northeast the snow was falling more thickly now but still the ships were bathed in that savage glare frighteningly vulnerable in their naked helplessness seething with anger turner brought up short at the port torpedoes the tubes were out their evil gaping mouths highlighted by the great flames pointing out over the intermittent refulgence of the rolling swell ralston perched high on the unprotected control position above the central tube caught his eye at once ralston turners voice was harsh imperious i want to speak to you ralston turned round quickly rose jumped on to the deck he stood facing the commander they were of a height their eyes on a level ralstons still blue troubled turners dark and stormy with anger what the hells the matter with you ralston turner ground out refusing to obey orders is that it no sir ralstons voice was quiet curiously strained thats not true not true turners eyes were narrowed his fury barely in check then whats all this bloody claptrap about not wanting to man the tubes are you thinking of emulating stoker riley or have you just taken leave of your senses if any ralston said nothing the silence a silence all too easily interpreted as dumb insolence infuriated turner his powerful hands reached out grasped ralstons duffel coat he pulled the rating towards him thrust his face close to the others i asked a question ralston he said softly i havent had an answer im waiting what is all this nothing sir distress in his eyes perhaps but no fear ii just dont want to sir i hate to do itto send one of our own ships to the bottom the voice was pleading now blurred with overtones of desperation turner was deaf to them why does she have to go sir i he cried why why why none of your bloody businessbut as it so happens shes endangering the entire convoy turners face was still within inches of ralstons youve got a job to do orders to obey just get up there and obey them go on he roared as ralston hesitated get up there i he fairly spat the words out ralston didnt move there are other ltos sir his arms lifted high in appeal something in the voice cut through turners blind anger he realised almost with shock that this boy was desperate couldnt they let someone else do the dirty work eh thats what you mean isnt it turner was bitingly contemptuous get them to do what you wont do yourself youyou contemptible young bastard communications number give me your set ill take over from the bridge he took the phone watched ralston climb slowly back up and sit hunched forward head bent over the dumaresq number one commander speaking all set here captain there yes sir ill call him carrington put down the phone walked through the gate captain sir commanders on the just a moment the upraised hand the tenseness of the voice stopped him have a look no i what do you think vallery pointed towards the vytura past the oilskinned figure of the admiral tyndalls head was sunk on his chest and he was muttering incoherently to himself carrington followed the pointing finger the lifeboat dimly visible through the thickening snow had slipped her falls while the vytura was still under way crammed with men she was dropping quickly astern under the great twisting column of flamedropping far too quickly astern as the first lieutenant suddenly realised he turned round found vallerys eyes bleak and tired and old on his own carrington nodded slowly shes picking up sir under way under command what are you going to do sir god help me ive no choice nothing from the viking nothing from the sirrus nothing from our asdicand that uboats still out there tell turner whats happened bentley sir signal the vytura the mouth whitely compressed belied the eyeseyes dark and filled with pain abandon ship torpedoing you in three minutes last signal port pilot port it is sir the vytura was breaking off tangentially heading north slowly the ulysses came round almost paralleling her course now a little astern of her halfahead pilot halfahead it is sir pilot sir whats admiral tyndall saying can you make it out carpenter bent forward listened shook his head little flurries of snow fell off his fur helmet sorry sir cant make him out too much noise from the vytura i think hes humming sir oh god vallery bent his head looked up again slowly painfully even so slight an effort was labour intolerable he looked across to the vytura stiffened to attention the red aldis was winking again he tried to read it but it was too fast or perhaps his eyes were just too old or tired or perhaps he just couldnt think any more there was something weirdly hypnotic about that tiny crimson light flickering between these fantastic curtains of flame curtains sweeping slowly ominously together majestic in their inevitability and then the little red light had died so unexpectedly so abruptly that bentleys voice reached him before the realisation signal from the vytura sir vallery tightened his grip on the binnacle bentley guessed the nod rather than saw it message reads why dont you off nuts to the senior service tell him i send all my love the voice died softly away and there was only the roaring of the flames the lost pinging of the asdic all my love vallery shook his head in silent wonderment all my love hes crazy he must be all my love and im going to destroy him number one sir tell the commander to stand by turner repeated the message from the bridge turned to ralston stand by lto he looked out over the side saw that the vytura was slightly ahead now that the ulysses was still angling in on an interception course about two minutes now i should say he felt the vibration beneath his feet dying away knew the ulysses was slowing down any second now and shed start slewing away to starboard the receiver crackled again in his ear the sound barely audible above the roaring of the flames he listened looked up x and y only medium settings target knots he spoke into the phone how long how long sir carrington repeated ninety seconds vallery said huskily pilotstarboard he jumped startled as he heard the crash of falling binoculars saw the admiral slump forward face and neck striking cruelly on the edge of the windscreen the arms dangling loosely from the shoulders pilot but the kapok kid was already there he slipped an arm under tyndall took most of the dead weight off the biting edge of the screen whats the matter sir his voice was urgent blurred with anxiety whats wrong tyndall stirred slightly his cheek lying along the edge of the screen cold cold cold he intoned the quavering tones were those of an old a very old man what what did you say sir the kapok kid begged cold im cold im terribly cold my feet my feet the old voice wandered away and the body slipped into a corner of the bridge the grey face upturned to the falling snow intuition an intuition amounting to a sudden sick certainty sent the kapok kid plunging to his knees vallery heard the muffled exclamation saw him straighten up and swing round his face blank with horror heshes got nothing on sir he said unsteadily hes barefoot theyre frozenfrozen solid barefoot vallery repeated unbelievingly barefoot its not possible and pyjamas sir thats all hes wearing vallery lurched forward peeling off his gloves he reached down felt his stomach turn over in shocked nausea as his fingers closed on icechilled skin bare feet and pyjamas bare feetno wonder hed padded so silently across the duckboards numbly he remembered that the last temperature reading had shown of frost and tyndall feet caked in frozen snow and slush had been sitting there for almost five minutes he felt great hands under his armpits felt himself rising effortlessly to his feet petersen it could only be petersen of course and nicholls behind him leave this to me sir right petersen take him below nichollss brisk assured voice the voice of a man competent in his own element steadied vallery brought him back to the present and the demands of the present more surely than anything else could have done he became aware of carringtons clipped measured voice reeling off course speed directions saw the vytura off the port bow dropping slowly steadily aft even at that distance the blast of heat was barely tolerablewhat in the name of heaven was it like on the bridge of the vytural set course number one he called local control set course local control carrington might have been on a peacetime exercise in the solent local control turner repeated he hung up the set looked round youre on your own ralston he said softly there was no reply the crouched figure on the control position immobile as graved stone gave no sign that he had heard thirty seconds turner said sharply all lined up yes sir the figure stirred all lined up suddenly he swung round in desperate final appeal for gods sake sir is there no other twenty seconds turner said viciously do you want a thousand lives on your lilylivered conscience and if you miss ralston swung slowly back for a mere breath of time his face was caught full in the harsh glare of the vytura with sudden shock turner saw that the eyes were masked with tears then he saw the lips move dont worry sir i wont miss the voice was quite toneless heavy with nameless defeat perplexed now rather than angry and quite uncomprehending turner saw the left sleeve come up to brush the eyes saw the right hand stretch forward close round the grip of x firing lever incongruously there sprang to turners mind the famous line of chaucer in goon the spears full sadly in arrest in the closing of that hand there was the same heartstopping decision the same irrevocable finality suddenly so suddenly that turner started in spite of himself the hand jerked convulsively back he heard the click of the tripping lever the muffled roar in the explosion chamber the hiss of compressed air and the torpedo was gone its evil sleekness gleaming fractionally in the light of the flames before it crashed below the surface of the sea it was hardly gone before the tubes shuddered again and the second torpedo was on its way for five ten seconds turner stared out fascinated watching the arrowing wakes of bubbles vanish in the distance a total of ibs of amatol in these warheadsgod help the poor bastards aboard the vytura the deck speaker clicked on do you hear there do you hear there take cover immediately take cover immediately turner stirred tore his eyes away from the sea looked up saw that ralston was still crouched in his seat come down out of there you young fool he shouted want to be riddled when the vytura goes up do you hear me silence no word no movement only the roaring of the flames ralston im all right sir ralstons voice was muffled he did not even trouble to turn his head turner swore leapt up on the tubes dragged ralston from hiis seat pulled him down to the deck and into shelter ralston offered no resistance he seemed sunk in a vast apathy an uncaring indifference both torpedoes struck home the end was swift curiously unspectacular listenersthere were no watcherson the ulysses tensed themselves for the shattering detonation but the detonation never came brokenbacked and tired of fighting the vytura simply collapsed in on her stricken midships lay gradually wearily over on her side and was gone three minutes later turner opened the door of the captains shelter pushed ralston in before him here you are sir he said grimly thought you might like to see what a conscientious objecter looks like i certainly do vallery laid down the logbook turned a cold eye on the torpedoman looked him slowly up and down a fine job ralston but it doesnt excuse your conduct just a minute commander he turned back to the kapok kid yes that seems all right pilot itll make good reading for their lordships he added bitterly the ones the germans dont get we finish off for them remember to signal the hatteras in the morning ask for the name of the master of the vytura hes dead you neednt trouble yourself said ralston bitterly then staggered as the commanders open hand smashed across his face turner was breathing heavily his eyes dark with anger you insolent young devil he said softly that was just a little too much from you ralstons hand came up slowly fingering the reddening weal on his cheek you misunderstand me sir there was no anger the voice was a fading murmur they had to strain to catch his words the master of the vytura i can tell you his name its ralston captain michael ralston he was my father chapter twelve saturday to all things an end to every night its dawn even to the longest night when dawn never comes there comes at last the dawn and so it came for fr as grey as bitter as hopeless as the night had been long but it came it came to find the convoy some miles north of the arctic circle steaming due east along the nd parallel of latitude halfway between jan mayen and the north cape east the kapok kid reckoned but he couldnt be sure in heavy snow and with tententh cloud he was relying on dead reckoning he had to for the shell that had destroyed the fdr had wrecked the automatic pilot but roughly nautical miles to go miles hours and the convoyor what would be left of it by that time would be in the kola inlet steaming upriver to polyarnoe and murmansk hours it came to find the convoy ships left in allscattered over three square miles of sea and rolling heavily in the deepening swell from the nne ships for another had gone in the deepest part of the night mine torpedo nobody knew nobody ever would know the sirrus had stopped searched the area for an hour with hooded teninch signalling lamps there had been no survivors not that commander orr had expected to find anynot with the air temperature below zero it came after a sleepless night of neverending alarms of continual asdic contacts of constant depthcharging that achieved nothing nothing that is from the escorts point of view but for the enemy it achieved a doubleedged victory it kept exhausted men at action stations all night long blunting irreparably perhaps the last vestiges of the knifeedged vigilance on which the only hope it was never more of survival in the arctic depended more deadly still it had emptied the last depthcharge rack in the convoy it was a measure of the intensity of the attack of the relentlessness of the persecution that this had never happened before but it had happened now there was not a single depthcharge leftnot one the fangs were drawn the defences were down it was only a matter of time before the wolfpacks discovered that they could strike at will and with the dawn of course came dawn action stations or what would have been dawn stations had the men not already been closed up for fifteen hours fifteen endless hours of intense cold and suffering fifteen hours during which the crew of the ulysses had been sustained by cocoa and one bullybeef sandwich thin sliced and stale for there had been no time to bake the previous day but dawn stations were profoundly significant in themselves they prolonged the waiting another interminable two hoursand to a man rocking on his feet from unimaginable fatigue literally holding convulsively jerking eyelids apart with finger and thumb while a starving brain which is less a brain than a well of finedrawn agony begs him to let go let go just for a second just this once and never again even a minute is brutal eternity and they were still more important in that they were recognised as the ithuriel hour of the russian convoys the testing time when every man stood out clearly for what he was and for the crew of a mutiny ship for men already tried and condemned for physically broken and mentally scourged men who neither could nor would ever be the same again in body or mind the men of the ulysses had no need to stand in shame not all of course they were only human but many had found or were finding that the point of no return was not necessarily the edge of the precipice it could be the bottom of the valley the beginning of the long climb up the far slope and when a man had once begun that climb he never looked back to that other side for some men neither precipice nor valley ever existed men like carrington for instance eighteen consecutive hours on the bridge now he was still his own indestructible self alert with that relaxed watchfulness that never flagged a man of infinite endurance a man who could never crack who you knew could never crack for the imagination baulked at the very idea why he was what he was no man could tell such too were men like chief petty officer hartley like chief stoker hendry like coloursergeant evans and sergeant macintosh four men strangely alike big tough kindly no longer young steeped in the traditions of the service taciturn never heard to speak of themselves they were under no illusions as to their importance they knew as any naval officer would be the first to admitthat as the senior ncos they and not any officer were the backbone of the royal navy and it was from their heavy sense of responsibility that sprung their rocklike stability and then of course there were mena handful onlylike turner and the kapok kid and dodson whom dawn found as men above themselves men revelling in danger and exhaustion for only thus could they realise themselves for only this had they been born and finally men like vallery who had collapsed just after midnight and was still asleep in the shelter and surgeon commander brooks wisdom was their sheet anchor a clear appreciation of the relative insignificance both of themselves and the fate of fr a coldly intellectual appraisal of married to an infinite compassion for the follies and suffering of mankind at the other end of the scale dawn found mena few dozen perhapsgone beyond recovery gone in selfishness in selfpity and in fear like carslake gone because their armour the trappings of authority had been stripped off them like hastings or gone like leading sba johnson and a score of others because they had been pushed too far and had no sheet anchor to hold them and between the two extremes were thosethe bulk of the menwho had touched zero and found that endurance can be infiniteand found in this realisation the springboard for recovery the other side of the valley could be climbed but not without a staff for nicholls tired beyond words from a long night standing braced against the operating table in the surgery the staff was pride and shame for leading seaman doyle crouched miserably into the shelter of the forard funnel watching the pinched agony the perpetual shivering of his young midships pompom crew it was pity he would of course have denied this blasphemously for young spicer tyndalls devoted pantryboy it was pity toopity and a savage grief for the dying man in the admirals cabin even with both legs amputated below the knee tyndall should not have been dying but the fight the resistance was gone and brooks knew old giles would be glad to go and for scores perhaps for hundreds for men like the tubercularridden mcquater chilled to death in sodden clothes but no longer staggering drankenly round the hoist in y turret for the heavy rolling kept the water on the move like petersen recklessly squandering his giant strength in helping his exhausted mates like chrysler whose keen young eyes invaluable now that radar was gone never ceased to scan the horizons for men like these the staff was vallery the tremendous respect and affection in which he was held the sure knowledge that they could never let him down these then were the staffs the intangible sheet anchors that held the ulysses together that bleak and bitter dawn pride pity shame affection griefand the basic instinct for selfpreservation although the last by now was an almost negligible factor two things were never taken into the slightest account as the springs of endurance never mentioned never even considered they did not exist for the crew of the ulysses two things the sentimentalists at home the gallant leader writers of the popular press the propagandising purveyors of nationalistic claptrap would have had the world believe to be the source of inspiration and endurance hatred of the enemy love of kinsfolk and country there was no hatred of the enemy knowledge is the prelude to hate and they did not know the enemy men cursed the enemy respected him feared him and killed him if they could if they didnt the enemy would kill them nor did men see themselves as fighting for king and country they saw the necessity for war but objected to camouflaging this necessity under a spurious cloak of perf ervid patriotism they were just doing what they were told and if they didnt they would be stuck against a wall and shot love of kinsfolkthat had some validity but not much it was natural to want to protect your kin but this was an equation where the validity varied according to the factor of distance it was a trifle difficult for a man crouched in his icecoated oerlikon cockpit off the shores of bear island to visualise himself as protecting that rosecovered cottage in the cotswolds but for the rest the synthetic national hatreds and the carefully cherished myth of king and country these are nothing and less than nothing when mankind stands at the last frontier of hope and endurance for only the basic simple human emotions the positive ones of love and grief and pity and distress can carry a man across that last frontier noon and still the convoy closed up in tight formation now rolled eastwards in the blinding snow the alarm halfway through dawn stations had been the last that morning thirtysix hours to go now only thirtysix hours and if this weather continued the strong wind and blinding snow that made flying impossible the nearzero visibility and heavy seas that would blind any periscope there was always that chance only thirtysix hours admiral john tyndall died a few minutes after noon brooks who had sat with him all morning officially entered the cause of death as postoperative shock and exposure the truth was that giles had died because he no longer wished to live his professional reputation was gone his faith his confidence in himself were gone and there was only remorse for the hundreds of men who had died and with both legs gone the only life he had ever known the life he had so loved and cherished and to which he had devoted fortyfive glad and unsparing years that life too was gone for ever giles died gladly willingly just on noon he recovered consciousness looked at brooks and vallery with a smile from which every trace of madness had vanished brooks winced at that grey smile mocking shadow of the famous guffaw of the giles of another day then he closed his eyes and muttered something about his familybrooks knew he had no family his eyes opened again he saw vallery as if for the first time rolled ms eyes till he saw spicer a chair for the captain my boy then he died he was buried at two oclock in the heart of a blizzard the captains voice reading the burial service was shredded away by snow and wind the union flag was flapping emptily on the tilted board before the men knew he was gone the bugle notes were broken and distant and lost far away and fading like the horns of elfland and then the men two hundred of them at least turned silently away and trudged back to their frozen messdecks barely half an hour later the blizzard had died vanished as suddenly as it had come the wind too had eased and though the sky was still dark and heavy with snow though the seas were still heavy enough to roll ton ships through a arc it was clear that the deterioration in the weather had stopped on the bridge in the turrets in the messdecks men avoided each others eyes and said nothing just before the vectra picked up an asdic contact vallery received the report hesitated over his decision if he hu g sent the vectra to investigate and if the vectra located the uboat accurately and confined herself as she would have to do to describing tight circles above the submarine the reason for this freedom from depthcharging would occur to the uboat captain within minutes and then it would only be a matter of time until he decided it was safe to surface and use his radio that every uboat north of the circle would know that fr could be attacked with impunity further it was unlikely that any torpedo attack would be made under such weather conditions not only was periscope observation almost impossible in the heavy seas but the uboat itself would be a most unstable firing platform wave motion is not confined to the surface of the water the effects can be highly uncomfortable and unstabilising thirty forty fifty feet down and are appreciable under extreme conditions at a depth of almost a hundred feet on the other hand the uboat captain might take a chance might strike home with a lucky hit vallery ordered the vectra to investigate he was too late the order would have been too late anyway the vectra was still winking acknowledgment of the signal had not begun to turn when the rumble of a heavy explosion reached the bridge of the ulysses all eyes swept round a full circle of the horizon searching for smoke and flame for the canted deck and slewing ship that would show where the torpedo had gone home they found no sign none whatsoever until almost half a minute had passed then they noticed almost casually that the electro leading ship in the starboard line was slowing up coming to a powerless stop already settling in the water on an even keel with no trace of tilt either forard or aft almost certainly she had been holed in the engineroom the aldis on the sirrus had begun to flash bentley read the message turned to vallery commander orr requests permission to go alongside port side take off survivors port is it turner nodded the subs blind side its a fair chance sir in a calm sea as it is he looked over at the sirrus rolling heavily in the beam sea and shrugged wont do her paintwork any good her cargo vallery asked any idea explosives he looked round saw the mute headshakes turned to bentley ask electro if shes carrying any explosives as cargo bentleys aldis chattered fell silent after half a minute it was clear that there was going to be no reply power gone perhaps or his aldis smashed the kapok kid ventured how about one flag for explosives two for none vallery nodded in satisfaction you heard bentley he looked over the starboard quarter as the message went out the vectra was almost a mile distant rolling one minute pitching the next as she came round in a tight circle she had found the killer and her depthcharge racks were empty vallery swung back looked across to the electro still no reply nothing then he saw two flags fluttering up to the yardarm signal the sirrus he ordered go ahead exercise extreme care suddenly he felt turners hand on his arm can you hear em turner asked hear what vallery demanded lord only knows its the vectra look vallery followed the pointing finger at first he could see nothing then all at once he saw little geysers of water leaping up in the vectras wake geysers swiftly extinguished by the heavy seas then faintly his straining ear caught the faraway murmur of underwater explosions all but inaudible against the wind what the devils the vectra doing vallery demanded and whats she using looks like fireworks to me turner grunted what do you think number one scuttling chargespounders carrington said briefly hes right sir turner admitted of course thats what they are mind you he might as well be using fireworks he added disparagingly but the commander was wrong a scuttling charge has less than a tenth part of the disruptive power of a depthcharge but one lodged snugly in the conningtower or exploding alongside a steering plane could be almost as lethal turner had hardly finished speaking when a uboat the first the ulysses had seen above water for almost six monthsporpoised high above the surface of the sea hung there for two or three seconds then crashed down on even keel wallowing wickedly in the troughs between the waves the dramatic abruptness of her appearance one moment the empty sea the next a uboat rolling in full view of the entire convoy took every ship by surprise including the vectra she was caught on the wrong foot moving away on the outer leg of a figureofeight turn her pompom opened up immediately but the pompom a notoriously inaccurate gun in the best of circumstances is a hopeless proposition on the rolling heeling deck of a destroyer making a fast turn in heavy weather the oerlikons registered a couple of hits on the conningtower twin lewises peppered the hull with as much effect as a horde of angry hornets but by the time the vectra was round her main armament coming to bear the uboat had disappeared slowly under the surface in spite of this the vectras s opened up firing into the sea where the uboat had submerged but stopping almost immediately when two shells in succession had ricocheted off the water and whistled dangerously through the convoy she steadied on course raced over the position of the submerged uboat watchers on the ulysses binoculars to their vectras poopdeck hurling more scuttling charges over the eyes could just distinguish duffelcoated figures on the side almost at once the vectras helm went hard over and she clawed her way back south again guns at maximum depression pointing down over her starboard side the uboat must have been damaged more severely this time by either the shells or the last charges again she surfaced even more violently than before in a seething welter of foam and again the vectra was caught on the wrong foot for the submarine had surfaced off her port bow three cablelengths away and this time the uboat was up to stay whatever captain and crew lacked it wasnt courage the hatch was open and men were swarming over the side of the conningtower to man the gun in a token gesture of defiance against crushing odds the first two men over the side never reached the gun breaking sweeping waves waves that towered high above the submarines deck washed them over the side and they were gone but others flung themselves forward to take their place frantically training their gun through a arc to bear on the onrushing bows of the vectra incredibly for the seas were washing over the decks seas which kept tearing the men from their posts and the submarine was rolling with impossible speed and violencetheir first shell fired over open sights smashed squarely into the bridge of the vectra the first shell and the last shell for the crew suddenly crumpled and died sinkiag down by the gua or pitching convulsively over the side it was a massacre the vectra had two boltoapaul defiant nightfighter turrets quadruple hydraulic turrets complete with astrodome bolted to her focsle and these had opened up simultaneously firing between them something like a fantastic total of shells every ten seconds that often misused cliche hail of lead was completely accurate here it was impossible for a man to live two seconds on the exposed deck of that uboat to hope to escape that lethal storm man after man kept flinging himself over the coaming in suicidal gallantry but none reached the gun afterwards no one aboard the ulysses could say when they first realised that the vectra pitching steeply through the heavy seas was going to ram the uboat perhaps her captain had never intended to do so perhaps he had expected the uboat to submerge had intended to carry away conningtower and periscope standard to make sure that she could not escape again perhaps he had been killed when that shell had struck the bridge or perhaps he had changed his mind at the last second for the vectra which had been arrowing in on the conningtower suddenly slewed sharply to starboard for an instant it seemed that she might just clear the uboats bows but the hope died the second it was born plunging heavily down the sheering side of a gaping trough the vectras forefoot smashed down and through the hull of the submarine some thirty feet aft of the bows slicing through the toughened steel of the pressure hull as if it were cardboard she was still plunging still driving down when two shattering explosions so close together as to be blurred into one giant blast completely buried both vessels under a skyrocketing mushroom of boiling water and twisted steel the why of the explosion was pure conjecture but what had happened was plain enough some freak of chance must have triggered off the tntnormally an extremely stable and inert disruptive in a warhead in one of the uboats tubes and then the torpedoes in the storage racks behind and possibly probably even the forard magazine of the vectra had gone up in sympathetic detonation slowly deliberately almost the great clouds of water fell back into the sea and the vectra and the uboator what little was left of themcame abruptly into view to the watchers on the ulysses it was inconceivable that either of them should still be afloat the uboat was very deep in the water seemed to end abruptly just forards of the gun platform the vectra looked as if some great knife had sheared her athwartships just forard of the bridge the rest was gone utterly gone and throughout the convoy unbelieving minds were still wildly rejecting the evidence of their eyes when the shattered hull of the vectra lurched into the same trough as the uboat rolled heavily wearily over on top of her bridge and mast cradling the conningtower of the submarine and then the water closed over them and they were gone locked together to the bottom of the sea the last ships in the convoy were two miles away now and in the broken seas at that distance it was impossible to see whether there were any survivors it did not seem likely and if there were if there were men over there struggling swimming shouting for help in the murderous cold of that glacial sea they would be dying already and they would have been dead long before any rescue ship could even have turned round the convoy steamed on beating steadily east all but two that isthe electro and the sirrus the electro lay beam on to the seas rolling slowly sluggishly dead in the water she had now a list of almost to port her decks fore and aft of the bridge were lined with waiting men they had given up their attempt to abandon ship by lifeboat when they had seen the sirrus rolling up behind them fine on the port quarter a boat had been swung out on its davits and with the listing of the electra and the rolling of the sea it had proved impossible to recover it it hung now far out from the ships side swinging wildly at the end of its davits about twenty feet above the sea on his approach orr had twice sent angry signals asking the falls to be cut but the lifeboat remained there a menacing pendulum in the track of the sirrus panic possibly but more likely winch brakes jammed solid with ice in either event there was no time to be lost another ten minutes and the electra would be gone the sirrus made two runs past in all orr had no intention of stopping alongside of being trampled under by the ton deadweight of a toppling freighter on his first run he steamed slowly by at five knots at a distance of twenty feetthe nearest he dared go with the set of the sea rolling both ships towards each other at the same instant as the sirruss swinging bows slid up past the bridge of the electro the waiting men began to jump they jumped as the sirruss focsle reared up level with their deck they jumped as it plunged down fifteen twenty feet below one man carrying a suitcase and burberry stepped nonchalantly across both sets of guardrails during the split second that they were relatively motionless to each other others crashed sickeningly on to the icecoated steel deck far below twisting ankles fracturing legs and thighs dislocating hipjoints and two men jumped and missed above the bedlam of noise men heard the bloodchilling bubbling scream of one as the swinging hulls crushed the life out of him the desperate terrorstricken cries of the other as the great iron wall of the electra guided him into the screws of the sirrus it was just then that it happened and there could be no possible reflection on commander orrs seamanship he had handled the sirrus brilliantly but even his skill was helpless against these two successive freak waves twice the size of the others the first flung the sirrus close in to the electra then passing under the electra lurched her steeply to port as the second wave heeled the sirrus far over to starboard there was a grinding screeching crash the sirruss guardrails and upper side plates buckled and tore along a foot length simultaneously the lifeboat smashed endwise into the front of the bridge shattering into a thousand pieces immediately the telegraphs jangled the water boiled whitely at the sirruss sternshocked realisation of its imminence and death itself must have been only a merciful hairsbreadth apart for the unfortunate man in the water and then the destroyer was clear sheering sharply away from the electra in five minutes the sirrus was round again it was typical of orrs icecold calculating nerve and of the luck that never deserted him that he should this time choose to rub the sirruss shattered starboard side along the length of the electra she was too low in the water now to fall on him and that he should do so in a momentary spell of slack water willing hands caught men as they jumped cushioned their fall thirty seconds and the destroyer was gone again and the decks of the electra were deserted two minutes later and a muffled roar shook the sinking ship her boilers going and then she toppled slowly over on her side masts and smokestack lay along the surface of the sea dipped and vanished the straightback of bottom and keel gleamed fractionally blackly against the grey of sea and sky and was gone for a minute great gouts of air rushed turbulently to the surface by and by the bubbles grew smaller and smaller and then there were no more the sirrus steadied on course crowded decks throbbing as she began to pick up speed to overtake the convoy convoy no fr the convoy the royal navy would always want to forget thirtysix ships had left scapa and st johns now there were twelve only twelve and still almost thirtytwo hours to the kola inlet moodily even his tremendous vitality and zest temporarily subdued turner watched the sirrus rolling up astern abruptly he turned away looked furtively pityingly at captain vallery no more now than a living skeleton driven by god only knew what mysterious force to wrest hour after impossible hour from death and for vallery now death even the hope of it turner suddenly realised must be infinitely sweet he looked and saw the shock and sorrow in that grey mask and he cursed bitterly silently and then these tired dull eyes were on him and turner hurriedly cleared his throat how many survivors does that make in the sirrus now he asked vallery lifted weary shoulders in the ghost of a shrug no idea commander a hundred possibly more why a hundred turner mused and nosurvivorswillbepickedup im just wondering what old orrs going to say when he dumps that little lot in admiral starrs lap when we get back to scapa flow chapter thirteen saturday afternoon the sirrus was still a mile astern when her aldis started flickering bentley took the message turned to vallery signal sir have injured men aboard three very serious cases perhaps dying urgently require doctor acknowledge vallery said he hesitated a moment then my compliments to surgeonlieutenant nicholls ask him to come to the bridge he turned to the commander grinned faintly i somehow dont see brooks at his athletic best in a breeches buoy on a day like this its going to be quite a crossing turner looked again at the sirrus occasionally swinging through a arc as she rolled and crashed her way up from the west itll be no picnic he agreed besides breeches buoys arent made to accommodate the likes of our venerable chief surgeon funny turner thought how matteroffact and offhand everyone was nobody had as much as mentioned the vectra since shed rammed the uboat the gate creaked vallery turned round slowly acknowledged nichollss sketchy salute the sirrus needs a doctor he said without preamble how do you fancy it nicholls steadied himself against the canted bridge and the rolling of the cruiser leave the ulyssessuddenly he hated the thought was amazed at himself for his reaction he johnny nicholls unique among the officers anyway in his thoroughgoing detestation and intolerance of all things navalto feel like that must be going soft in the head and just as suddenly he knew that his mind wasnt slipping knew why he wanted to stay it was not a matter of pride or principle or sentiment it was just thatwell just that he belonged the feeling of belongingeven to himself he couldnt put it more accurately more clearly than that but it affected him strangely powerfully suddenly he became aware that curious eyes were on him looked out in confusion over the rolling sea well vallerys voice was edged with impatience i dont fancy it at all nicholls said frankly but of course ill go sir right now as soon as you can get your stuff together vallery nodded thats now we have an emergency kit packed all the time he cast a jaundiced eye over the heavy sea again what am i supposed to do sirjump perish the thought turner clapped him on the back with a large and jovial hand you havent a thing to worry about he boomed cheerfully you positively wont feel a thing these if i recall rightly were your exact words to me when you extracted that old molar of mine twothree weeks back he winced in painful recollection breeches buoy laddie breeches buoy breeches buoy nicholls protested havent noticed the weather have you ill be going up and down like a blasted yoyo the ignorance of youth turner shook his head sadly well be turning into the sea of course itll be like a ride in a rolls my boy were going to rig it now he turned away chryslerget on to chief petty officer hartley ask him to come up to the bridge chrysler gave no sign of having heard he was in his usual favourite position these daysgloved hands on the steam pipes the top half of his face crushed into the rubber eyepiece of the powerful binoculars on the starboard searchlight control every few seconds a hand would drop revolve the milled training rack a fraction then again the complete immobility chrysler turner roared are you deaf three four five more seconds passed in silence every eye was on chrysler when he suddenly jerked back glanced down at the bearing indicator then swung round his face was alive with excitement green onedoubleoh he shouted green onedouble oh aircraft just on the horizon he fairly flung himself back at his binoculars four sevenno ten ten aircraft he yelled green onedoubleoh turner had his glasses to his eyes cant see a thing are you sure boy he called anxiously still the same sir there was no mistaking the agitated conviction in the young voice turner was through the gate and beside him in four swift steps let me have a look he ordered he gazed through the glasses twisted the training rack once or twice then stepped back slowly heavy eyebrows lowering in anger theres something bloody funny here young man he growled either your eyesight or your imagination and if you ask me hes right carrington interrupted calmly ive got em too so have i sir bentley shouted turner wheeled back to the mounted glasses looked through them briefly stiffened looked round at chrysler remind me to apologise some day he smiled and was back on the compass platform before he had finished speaking signal to convoy vallery was saying rapidly code h full ahead number one bosuns mate broadcaster stand by all guns commander sir independent targets independent fire all aa guns agreed and the turrets couldnt say yet chrysler can you make out condors sir chrysler anticipated him condors turner stared in disbelief a dozen condors are you sure that oh all right all right he broke off hastily condors they are he shook his head in wonderment turned to vallery wheres my bloody tin hat condors he says so condors they are vallery repeated smiling turner marvelled at the repose the unruffled calm bridge targets independent fire control for all turrets vallery went on i think so sir turner looked at the two communication ratings just aft of the compass platformone each on the group phones to the forard and after turrets ears pinned back you two and hop to it when you get the word vallery beckoned to nicholls better get below young man he advised sorry your little trips been postponed im not nicholls said bluntly no vallery was smiling scared no sir nicholls smiled back not scared and you know i wasnt i know you werent vallery agreed quietly i know and thank you he watched nicholls walk off the bridge beckoned to the wt messenger then turned to the kapok kid when was our last signal to the admiralty pilot have a squint at the log noon yesterday said the kapok kid readily dont know what ill do without you vallery murmured present position north east thank you he looked at turner no point in radio silence now commander turner shook his head take this message vallery said quickly to dno london how are our friends doing commander circling well to the west sir usual high altitude gambit from the stern i suppose he added morosely still he brightened cloud levels barely a thousand feet vallery nodded fr steady on force north heavy swell situation desperate deeply regret admiral tyndall died today tanker vytura torpedoed last night sunk by self washington state sunk today vectra sunk collision uboat electro sunk am being heavily attacked by twelve minimum twelve fockewulf s a reasonable assumption i think commander he said wryly and itll shake their lordships theyre of the opinion there arent so many condors in the whole of norway imperative send help air cover essential advise immediately get that off at once will you your nose sir turner said sharply thank you vallery rubbed the frostbite dead white in the haggard grey and blue of his face gave up after a few seconds the effort was more trouble than it was worth drained away too much of his tiny reserves of strength my god its bitter commander he murmured quietly shivering he pulled himself to his feet swept his glasses over fr code h was being obeyed the ships were scattered over the sea apparently at random broken out from the two lines ahead which would have made things far too simple for bombaimers in aircraft attacking from astern they would have to aim now for individual targets scattered but not too scatteredclose enough together to derive mutual benefit from the convoys concerted barrage vallery nodded to himself in satisfaction and twisted round his glasses swivelling to the west there was no mistaking them now he thoughtthey were condors all right almost dead astern now massive wingtips dipping the big fourengined planes banked slowly ponderously to starboard then straightened on a overtaking course and they were climbing steadily climbing two things were suddenly clear to vallery two things the enemy obviously knew they had known where to find fr the luftwaffe was not given to sending heavy bombers out over the arctic on random hazard they hadnt even bothered to send charlie on reconnaissance for a certainty some submarine had located them earlier on given their position and course at any distance at all their chance of seeing a periscope in that heavy sea had been remote further the germans knew that the ulyssess radar was gone the fockewulfs were climbing to gain the low cloud would break cover only seconds before it was time to bomb against radarcontrolled fire at such close range it would have been near suicide but they knew it was safe even as he watched the last of the labouring condors climbed through the low heavy ceiling was completely lost to sight vallery shrugged wearily lowered his binoculars bentley sir code r immediate the flags fluttered up for fifteen twenty seconds it seemed ten times as long as that to the impatient captain nothing happened and then like rolling toy marionettes under the hand of a master puppeteer the bows of every ship in the convoy began to swing roundthose to the port of the ulysses to the north those to the starboard to the south when the condors broke throughtwo minutes at the most vallery reckoned they would find beneath them only the empty sea empty that is except for the ulysses and the stirling ships admirably equipped to take care of themselves and then the condors would find themselves under heavy crossfire from the merchant ships and destroyers and too lateat that low altitude much too lateto alter course for foreandaft bombing runs on the freighters vallery smiled wryly to himself as a defensive tactic it was little enough but the best he could do in the circumstances he could hear turner barking orders through the loudspeaker was more than content to leave the defence of the ship in the commanders competent hands if only he himself didnt feel so tired ninety seconds passed a hundred two minutes and still no sign of the condors a hundred eyes stared out into the cloudwrack astern it remained obstinately tantalisingly grey and featureless two and a half minutes passed still there was nothing anybody seen anything vallery asked anxiously his eyes never left that patch of cloud astern nothing nothing at all the silence remained oppressive unbroken three minutes three and a half four vallery looked away to rest his straining eyes caught turner looking at him caught the growing apprehension the slow dawn and strengthening of surmise in the lean face wordlessly at the same instant they swung round staring out into the sky ahead thats it vallery said quickly youre right commander you must be he was aware that everyone had turned now was peering ahead as intently as himself theyve bypassed us theyre going to take us from ahead warn the guns dear god they almost had us he whispered softly eyes skinned everyone turner boomed the apprehension was gone the irrepressible joviality the gratifying anticipation of action was back again and i mean everyone were all in the same boat together no joke intended fourteen days leave to the first man to sight a condor effective as from when the kapok kid asked dryly turner grinned at him then the smile died the head lifted sharply in sudden attention can you hear em he asked his voice was soft almost as if he feared the enemy might be listening theyre up there somewhere damned if i can tell where though if only that wind the vicious urgent thudding of the boatdeck oerlikons stopped him dead in midsentence had him whirling round and plunging for the broadcast transmitter in one galvanic concerted movement but even then he was too latehe would have been too late anyway the condorsthe first three in line ahead were already visiblewere already through the cloud feet up and barely half a mile away dead astern astern the bombers must have circled back to the west as soon as they had reached the clouds completely fooled them as to their intentions six seconds six seconds is time and to spare for even a heavy bomber to come less than half a mile in a shallow dive there was barely time for realisation for the first bitter welling of mortification and chagrin when the condors were on them it was almost dusk now the weird halflight of the arctic twilight tracers glowing hot pinpoints of light streaking out through the darkening sky were clearly seen at first swinging erratically fading away to extinction in the far distance then steadying miraculously dying in the instant of birth as they sank home into the fuselages of the swooping condors but time was too shortthe guns were on target for a maximum of two secondsand these giant fockewulfs had a tremendous capacity for absorbing punishment the leading condor levelled out about three hundred feet its medium kilo bombs momentarily parallelling its line of flight then arching down lazily towards the ulysses at once the condor pulled its nose up in maximum climb the four great engines labouring in desynchronised clamour as it sought the protection of the clouds the bombs missed they missed by about thirty feet exploding on contact with the water just abaft the bridge for the men in the ts engineand boilerrooms the crash and concussion must have been frightfulliterally earshattering waterspouts twenty feet in diameter at their turbulent bases streaked up whitely into the twilight high above the truncated masts hung there momentarily then collapsed in drenching cascades on the bridge and boatdeck aft soaking saturating every gunner on the pompom and in the open oerlikon cockpits the temperature stood at above zero of frost more dangerously the blinding sheets of water completely unsighted the gunners apart from a lone oerlikon on a sponson below the starboard side of the bridge the next condor pressed home its attack against a minimum of resistance the approach was perfect dead foreandaft on the centre line but the pilot overshot probably in his anxiety to hold course three bombs this time for a second it seemed that they must miss but the first smashed into the focsle between the breakwater and the capstan exploding in the flat below heaving up the deck in a tangled wreckage of broken steel even as the explosion died the men on the bridge could hear a curious clanking rattle the explosion must have shattered the focsle capstan and blake stopper simultaneously and sheared the retaining shackle on the anchor cable and the starboard anchor completely out of control was plummeting down to the depths of the arctic the other bombs fell into the sea directly ahead and from the stirling a mile ahead it seemed that the ulysses disappeared under the great column of water but the water subsided and the ulysses steamed on apparently unharmed from dead ahead the sweeping lift of the bows hid all damage and there was neither flame nor smokehundreds of gallons of water falling from the sky and pouring in through the great jagged holes in the deck had killed any fire there was the ulysses was still a lucky ship and then at last after twenty months of the fantastic escapes the fabulous good fortune that had made her a legend a byword for immunity throughout all the north the luck of the ulysses ran out ironically the ulysses brought disaster on herself the main armament the s aft had opened up now was pumping its lb shells at the diving bombers at pointblank range and over equivalent of open sights the very first shell from x turret sheared away the starboard wing of the third condor between the engines tore it completely away to spin slowly like a fluttering leaf into the darklyrolling sea for a fraction of a second the folkewulf held on course then abruptly the nose tipped over and the giant plane screamed down in an almost vertical dive her remaining engines inexplicably accelerating to a deafening crescendo as she hurtled arrowstraight for the deck of the ulysses there was no time to take any avoiding action no time to think no time even to hope a cluster of jettisoned bombs crashed in to the boiling wakethe ulysses was already doing upwards of thirty knotsand two more crashed through the poopdeck the first exploding in the after seamens messdeck the other in the marines messdeck one second later with a tremendous roar and in a blinding sheet of gasoline flame the condor itself at a speed of upwards of three hundred mph crashed squarely into the front of y turret incredibly that was the last attack on the ulyssesincredibly because the ulysses was defenceless now wide open to any air attack from astern y turret was gone x turret still magically undamaged was halfburied under the splintered wreckage of the condor blinded by the smoke and leaping flame the boatdeck oerlikons too had fallen silent the gunners halfdrowned under the deluge of less than a minute ago were being frantically dragged from their cockpits a difficult enough task at any time it was almost impossible with their clothes already frozen solid their duffels cracking and crackling like splintering matchwood as the men were dragged over the side of their cockpits with all speed they were rushed below thrust into the galley passage to thaw literally to thaw agony excruciating agony but the only alternative to the quick and certain death which would have come to them in their icebound cockpits the remaining condors had pulled away in a slow climbing turn to starboard they were surrounded bracketed fore and aft and on either side by scores of woolly expanding puffs of exploding aa shells but they flew straight through these charmed unhurt already they were beginning to disappear into the clouds to settle down on a southeast course for home strange vallery thought vaguely one would have expected them to hammer home their initial advantage of surprise to concentrate on the crippled ulysses certainly thus far the condor crews had shown no lack of courage he gave it up turned his attention to more immediate worries and there was plenty to worry about the ulysses was heavily on fire afta deck and messdeck fire admittedly but potentially fatal for all that x nd y magazines were directly below already dozens of men from the damage control parties were running aft stumbling and falling on the rolling icecovered deck unwinding the hose drums behind them occasionally falling flat on their faces as two icebound coils locked together the abruptly tightening hose jerking them off their feet others stumbled past them carrying the big red foamextinguishers on their shoulders or under their arms one unfortunate seamanab ferry who had left the sick bay in defiance of strict ordersrunning down the port alley past the shattered canteen slipped and fell abreast x turret the port wing of the condor even as it had sheared off and plunged into the sea had torn away the guardrails here and ferry hands and feet scrabbling frantically at the smooth ice of the deck his broken arm clawing uselessly at one of the remaining stanchions slid slowly inevitably over the side and was gone for a second the highpitched fearstricken shriek rose thin and clear above the roaring of the flames died abruptly as the water closed over him the propellers were almost immediately below the men with the extinguishers were the first into action as indeed they had to be when fighting a petrol firewater would only have made matters worse have increased the area of the fire by washing the petrol in all directions and the petrol being lighter than water immiscible and so floating to the top would have burned as furiously as ever but the foamextinguishers were of only limited efficiency not so much because several release valves had jammed solid in the intense cold as because of the intense white heat which made close approach almost impossible while the smaller carbontet extinguishers directed against electrical fires below were shockingly ineffective these extinguishers had never been in action before and the crew of the ulysses had known for a long time of the almost magical properties of the extinguisher liquid for removing the most obstinate stains and marks in clothes you may convince a wt rating of the lethal nature of volts you may convince a gunner of the madness of matches in a magazine you may convince a torpedoman of the insanity of juggling with fulminate of mercury but you will never convince any of them of the criminal folly of draining off just a few drops of carbontetrachloride despite stringent periodical checks most of the extinguishers were only halffull some were completely empty the hoses were little more effective two were coupled up to the starboard mains and the valves turned the hoses remained lifeless empty the starboard saltwater line had frozen solidcommon enough with freshwater systems this but not with salt a third hose on the port side was coupled up but the release valve refused to turn attacked with hammers and crowbars it sheered off at the baseat extremely low temperatures molecular changes occur in metals cut tensile strength to a fractionthe highpressure water drenching everyone in the vicinity spicer the dead admirals pantryboy a strickeneyed shadow of his former cheerful self flung away his hammer and wept in anger and frustration the other port valve worked but it took an eternity for the water to force its way through the flattened frozen hose gradually the deck fire was brought under controlless through the efforts of the firefighters than the fact that there was little inflammable material left after the petrol had burnt off hoses and extinguishers were then directed through the great jagged rents on the poop to the fires roaring in the messdeck below while two asbestossuited figures clambered over and struggled through the redhot jangled mass of smoking wreckage on the poop nicholls had one of the suits leading telegraphist brown a specialist in rescue work the other brown was the first on the scene picking his way gingerly he climbed up to the entrance of y turret watchers in the port and starboard alleyways saw him pause there fighting to tie back the heavy steel doorit had been crashing monotonously backwards and forwards with the rolling of the cruiser then they saw him step inside less than ten seconds later they saw him appear at the door again on his knees and clutching desperately at the side for support his entire body was arching convulsively and he was being violently sick into his oxygen mask nicholls saw this wasted time neither on y turret nor on the charred skeltons still trapped in the incinerated fuselage of the condor he climbed quickly up the vertical steel ladders to x gundeck moved round to the back and tried to open the door the clips were jammed immovable whether from cold or metal distortion he did not know he looked round for some lever stepped aside as he saw doyle duffel coat smouldering haggard face set and purposeful under the beard approaching with a sledge in his hand a dozen heavy welldirected blowsthe clanging nicholls thought must be almost intolerable inside the hollow amplifier of the turretand the door was open doyle secured it stepped aside to let nicholls enter nicholls climbed inside there had been no need to worry about that racket outside he thought wryly every man in the turret was stone dead coloursergeant evans was sitting bolt upright in his seat rigid and alert in death as he had been in life beside him lay foster the dashing fiery captain of marines whom death became so ill the rest were all sitting or lying quietly at their stations apparently unharmed and quite unmarked except for an occasional tiny trickle of blood from ear and mouth trickles already coagulated in the intense coldthe speed of the ulysses had carried the flames aft away from the turret the concussion must have been tremendous death instantaneous heavily nicholls bent over the communications number gently detached his headset and called the bridge vallery himself took the message turned back to turner he looked old defeated that was nicholls he said despite all he could do the shock and sorrow showed clearly in every deeplyetched line in that pitiably wasted face y turret is gone no survivors x turret seems intact but everyone inside is dead concussion he says fires in the after messdeck still not under control yes boy what is it y magazine sir the seaman said uncertainly they want to speak to the gunnery officer tell them hes not available vallery said shortly we havent time he broke off looked up sharply did you say y magazine here let me have that phone he took the receiver pushed back the hood of his duffel coat captain speaking y magazine what is it what speak up man i cant hear you oh damn he swung round on the bridge lto can you switch this receiver on to the relay amplifier i cant hear a ah thats better the amplifier above the charthouse crackled into lifea peculiarly throaty husky life doubly difficult to understand under the heavy overlay of a slurred glasgow accent j can ye hear me now the speaker boomed i can hear you vallerys own voice echoed loudly over the amplifier mcquater isnt it aye its me sir how did ye ken even through the speaker the surprise was unmistakable shocked and exhausted though he was vallery found himself smiling never mind that now mcquater whos in charge down theregardiner isnt it yes sir gardiner put him on will you there was a pause ah canna sir gardiners deid dead vallery was incredulous did you say dead mcquater aye and hes no the only one the voice was almost truculent but vallerys ear caught the faint tremor below ah was knocked oot masel but ahm fine now vallery paused waited for the boys bout of hoarse harsh coughing to pass butbutwhat happened how should ah knowah mean ah dinna kenah dont know sir a helluva bang and thenach ahm no sure whit happened gardiners mooths all blood howhow many of you are left just barker williamson and masel sir naebody else just us andand theyre all right mcquater ach theyre fine but barker thinks hes deein hes in a gey bad wey ah think hes gone clean aff his trolley sir hes what loony sir mcquater explained patiently daft some bluidy nonsense aboot goin to meet his maker and him wi naething behind him but a lifetime o swindlin his fellowman vallery heard turners sudden chuckle remembered that barker was the canteen manager williamsons busy shovin cartridges back into the racksfloors littered with the bluidy things mcquater vallerys voice was sharp automatic in reproof aye ahm sorry sir ah clean forgot whits to be done sir done about what vallery demanded impatiently this place sir y magazine is the boat on fire ootside its bilin in herehotter than the hinges o hell what what did you say vallery shouted this time he forgot to reprimand mcquater hot did you say how hot quickly boy ah canna touch the after bulkheid sir mcquater answered simply it ud tak the fingers aff me but the sprinklerswhats the matter with them vallery shouted arent they working good god boy the magazine will go up any minute aye mcquaters voice was noncommittal aye ah kinna thought that might be the wey o it no sir the sprinklers arena workinand its akeady degrees above the operatin temperature sir dont just stand there vallery said desperately turn them on by hand the water in the sprinklers cant possibly be frozen if its as hot as you say it is hurry man hurry if the mag goes up the ulysses is finished for gods sake hurry ahve tried them sir mcquater said softly its nae bluidy use theyre solid then break them open there must be a tommy bar lying about somewhere smash them open man hurry aye richt ye are sir butbut if ah do that sir how am ah to shut the valves aff again there was a note almost of quiet desperation in the boys voice some trick of reproduction in the amplifier vallery guessed you cant its impossible but never mind that vallery said impatiently his voice ragged with anxiety well pump it all out later hurry mcquater hurry there was a brief silence followed by a muffled shout and a soft thud then they heard a thin metallic clanging echoing through the amplifier a rapid staccato succession of strokes mcquater must have been raining a veritable hail of blows on the valve handles abruptly the noise ceased vallery waited until he heard the phone being picked up called anxiously well how is it sprinklers all right goin like the clappers sir there was a new note in his voice a note of pride and satisfaction ahve just crowned barker wi the tommy bar he added cheerfully youve wharf laid oot old barker said mcquater distinctly he tried to stop me windy auld bastard ach hes no worth mentionin my they sprinklers are grand things sir ahve never seen them workin before place is ankle deep aready and the steams fair sizzlin aff the bulkheid thats enough vallerys voice was sharp get out at once and make sure that you take barker with you ah saw a picture once in the paramount in glasgow ah think ah mustve been flush the tone was almost conversational pleasurably reminiscent vallery exchanged glances with turner saw that he too was fighting off the feeling of unreality rain it was cried but it wasnae hauf as bad as this there certainly wisnae hauf as much bluidy steam talk aboot the hothouse in the botanic gardens mcquater vallery roared did you hear me leave at once i say at once do you hear up to ma knees aready mcquater said admiringly its gey cauld did you say somethin sir i said leave at once vallery ground out get out aye ah see get oot aye ah thought that was what ye said get oot well its no that easy as a matter o fact we canna hatchways buckled and the hatch cover too jammed deid solid sir the echo from the speaker boomed softly over the shattered bridge died away in frozen silence unconsciously vallery lowered the telephone his eyes wandering dazedly over the bridge turner carrington the kapok kid bentley chrysler and the othersthey were all looking at him all with the same curiously blank intensity blurring imperceptibly into the horror of understandingand he knew that their eyes and faces only mirrored his own just for a second as if to clear his mind he screwed his eyes tightly shut then lifted the phone again mcquater mcquater are you still there of course ahm here even through the speaker the voice was peevish the asperity unmistakable where the hell are you sure its jammed boy vallery cut in desperately maybe if you took a tommybar to the clips ah could take a stick o dynamite to the bluidy thing and it ud make no difference mcquater said matteroffactly onywey its just aboot redhot areadythe hatch ah mean there must be a bluidy great fire directly ootside it hold on a minute vallery called he turned round commander have dodson send a stoker to the main magazine flooding valve aft stand by to shut off he crossed over to the nearest communication number are you on to the poop phone just now good give it to me hallo captain here isah its you hartley look give me a report on the state of the messdeck fires its desperately urgent there are ratings trapped in y magazine the sprinklers are on and the hatch covers jammed yes yes ill hold on he waited impatiently for the reply gloved hand tapping mechanically on top of the phone box his eyes swept slowly over the convoy saw the freighters steaming in to take up position again suddenly he stiffened eyes unseeing yes captain speaking yes yes half an hour maybe an hour oh gd no youre quite certain no thats all he handed the receiver back looked up slowly his face drained of expression fire in the seamens mess is under control he said dully the marines mess is an infernodirectly on top of y magazine hartley says there isnt a chance of putting it out for an hour at least i think youd better get down there number one a whole minute passed a minute during which there was only the pinging of the asdic the regular crash of the sea as the ulysses rolled in the heavy troughs maybe the magazines cool enough now the kapok kid suggested at length perhaps we could shut off the water long enough his voice trailed away uncertainly cool enough turner cleared his throat noisily how do we know only mcquater could tell us he stopped abruptly as he realised the implications of what he was saying well ask him vallery said heavily he picked up the phone again mcquater hallo perhaps we could shut off the sprinklers outside if its safe do you think the temperature he broke off unable to complete the sentence the silence stretched out taut and tangible heavy with decision vallery wondered numbly what mcquater was thinking what he himself would have thought in mcquaters place hing on a minute the speaker boomed abruptly ahll have a look up top again that silence again that tense unnatural silence lay heavily over the bridge vallery started as the speaker boomed again jings ahm b d ah couldna climb that ladder again for twentyfour points in the treble chance ahm on the ladder now but ahm thinkin ahll no be on it much longer never mind vallery checked himself aghast at what he had been about to say if mcquater fell off hed drown like a rat in that flooded magazine oh aye the magazine in the intervals between the racked bouts of coughing the voice was strangely composed the shells up top are just aboot meltin worse than ever sir i see vallery could think of nothing else to say his eyes were closed and he knew he was swaying on his feet with an effort he spoke again hows williamson it was all he could think of near gone up to his neck and hangin on to the racks mcquater coughed again says hes a message for the commander and carslake aa message uhhuh tell old blackbeard to take a turn to himself and lay off the bottle he said with relish the message for carslake was unprintable vallery didnt even feel shocked and yourself mcquater he said no message nothing you would like he stopped conscious of the grotesque inadequacy the futility of what he was saying me ach theres naething ahd like well maybe a transfer to the spartiate but ahm thinking maybe its a wee bit ower late for that williamson the voice had risen to a sudden urgent shout williamson hang on boy ahm coming they heard the booming clatter in the speaker as mcquaters phone crashed against metal and then there was only the silence mcquater vallery shouted into the phone mcquater answer me man can you hear me mcquater hms spartiate was a shore establishment naval hq for the west of scotland it was at st enochs hotel glasgow but the speaker above him remained dead finally irrevocably dead vallery shivered in the icy wind that magazine that flooded magazine less than twentyfour hours since he had been there he could see it now see it as clearly as he had seen it last night only now he saw it dark cavernous with only the pinpoints of emergency lighting the water welling darkly slowly up the sides saw that little pitifully wasted scots boy with the thin shoulders and painfilled eyes struggling desperately to keep his mates head above that icy water exhausting his tiny reserves of strength with the passing of every second even now the tune must be running out and vallery knew hope was gone with a sudden clear certainty he knew that when those two went down they would go down together mcquater would never let go eighteen years old just eighteen years old vallery turned away stumbling blindly through the gate on to the shattered compass platform it was beginning to snow again and the darkness was falling all around them chapter fourteen saturday evening i the ulysses rolled on through the arctic twilight she rolled heavily awkwardly in seas of the wrong critical length a strange and stricken sight with both masts gone with all boats and rafts gone with shattered foreandaft superstructure with a crazily tilted bridge and broken mangled after turret halfburied in the skeleton of the condors fuselage but despite all that despite too the great garish patches of red lead and gaping black holes in focsle and poopthe latter welling with dark smoke laced with flickering lances of flameshe still remained uncannily ghostlike and graceful a creature of her own element inevitably at home in the arctic ghostlike graceful and infinitely enduring and still deadly she still had her gunsand her engines above all she had these great engines engines strangely blessed with endless immunity so at least it seemed five minutes dragged themselves interminably by five minutes during which the sky grew steadily darker during which reports from the poop showed that the firefighters were barely holding their own five minutes during which vallery recovered something of his normal composure but he was now terribly weak a bell shrilled cutting sharply through the silence and the gloom chrysler answered it turned to the bridge captain sir after engineroom would like to speak to you turner looked at the captain said quickly shall i take it sir thank you vallery nodded his head gratefully turner nodded in turn crossed to the phone commander speaking who is it lieutenant grierson what is it grierson couldnt be good news for a change for almost a minute turner remained silent the others on the bridge could hear the faint crackling of the earpiece sensed rather than saw the taut attention the tightening of the mouth will it hold turner asked abruptly yes yes of course tell him well do our best up here do that halfhourly if you please it never rains et cetera turner growled replacing the phone engine running rough temperature hotting up distortion in inner starboard shaft dodson himself is in the shaft tunnel right now bent like a banana he says vallery smiled faintly knowing dodson i suppose that means a couple of thou out of alignment maybe turner was serious what does matter is that the main shaft bearings damaged and the lubricating line fractured as bad as that vallery asked softly dodson is pretty unhappy says the damage isnt recent thinks it began the night we lost our depthcharges turner shook his head lord knows what stresses that shafts undergone since i suppose tonights performance brought it to a head the bearing will have to be lubricated by hand wants engine revs at a minimum or engine shut off altogether theyll keep us posted and no possibility of repair vallery asked wryly no sir none very well then convoy speed and commander sir hands to stations all night you neednt tell em sobut well i think it would be wise i have a feeling whats that turner shouted look what the hells she doing his finger was stabbing towards the last freighter in the starboard line her guns were blazing away at some unseen target the tracers lancing whitely through the twilight sky even as he dived for the broadcaster he caught sight of the vikings main armament belching smoke and jagged flame all guns green aircraft independent fire independent targets independent fire independent targets he heard vallery ordering starboard helm knew he was going to bring the forard turrets to bear they were too late even as the ulysses began to answer her helm the enemy planes were pulling out of their approach dives great clumsy shapes these planes forlorn and insubstantial in the murky gloom but identifiable in a sickening flash by the clamour of suddenly racing engines condors without a shadow of doubt condors that had outguessed them again that gliding approach throttles cut right back muted roar of the engines drifting downwind away from the convoy their timing their judgment of distance had been superb the freighter was bracketed twice directly hit by at least seven bombs in the neardarkness it was impossible to see the bombs going home but the explosions were unmistakable and as each plane passed over the decks were raked by savage bursts of machinegun fire every gun position on the freighter was wide open lacking all but the most elementary frontal protection the dems naval ratings on the la guns royal marine artillerymen on the ha weapons were under no illusions as to their life expectancy when they joined the merchant ships on the russian run for such few gunners as survived the bombing the vicious stuttering of these machineguns was almost certainly their last sound on earth as the bombs plummeted down on the next ship in line the first freighter was already a brokenbacked mass of licking twisting flames almost certainly too her bottom had been torn out she had listed heavily and now slowly and smoothly broke apart just aft of the bridge as if both parts were hinged below the waterline and was gone before the clamour of the last aero engine had died away in the distance tactical surprise had been complete one ship gone a second slewing wildly to an uncontrolled stop deep in the water by the head and strangely disquieting and ominous in the entire absence of smoke flame or any movement at all a third heavily damaged but still under command not one condor had been lost turner ordered the ceasefiresome of the gunners were still firing blindly into the darkness triggerhappy perhaps or just that the imagination plays weird tricks on woolly minds and sunken bloodred eyes that had known no rest for more hours and days than turner could remember and then as the last oerlikon fell silent he heard it againthe drone of the heavy aero engines the sound welling then ebbing again like breakers on a distant shore as the wind gusted and died there was nothing anyone could do about it the fockewulf although lost in the low cloud was making no attempt to conceal its presence the ominous drone was never lost for long clearly it was circling almost directly above what do you make of it sir turner asked i dont know vallery said slowly i just dont know at all no more visits from the condors im sure of that its just that little bit too darkand they know they wont catch us again tailing us like as not tailing us itll be black as tar in half an hour turner disagreed psychological warfare if you ask me god knows vallery sighed wearily all i know is that id give all my chances here and to come for a couple of corsairs or radar or fog or another such night as we had in the denmark straits he laughed shortly broke down in a fit of coughing did you hear me he whispered i never thought id ask for that again how long since we left scapa commander turner thought briefly fivesix days sir six days he shook his head unbelievingly six days andand thirteen shipswe have thirteen ships now twelve turner corrected quietly anothers almost gone seven freighters the tanker and ourselves twelve i wish theyd have a go at the old stirling once in a while he added morosely vallery shivered in a sudden flurry of snow he bent forward head bent against the bitter wind and slanting snow sunk in unmoving thought presently he stirred we will be off the north cape at dawn he said absently things may be a little difficult commander theyll throw in everything theyve got weve been round there before turner conceded fiftyfifty on our chances vallery did not seem to have heard him seemed to be talking to himself ulysses and the sirens it may be that the gulfs will wash us down i wish you luck commander turner stared at him what do you mean oh myself too vallery smiled his head lifting up ill need all the luck too his voice was very soft turner did what he had never done before never dreamed he would do in the neardarkness he bent over the captain pulled his face round gently and searched it with troubled eyes vallery made no protest and after a few seconds turner straightened up do me a favour sir he said quietly go below i can take care of thingsand carrington will be up before long theyre gaining control aft no not tonight vallery was smiling but there was a curious finality about the voice and its no good dispatching one of your minions to summon old socrates to the bridge please commander i want to stay herei want to see things tonight yes yes of course suddenly strangely turner no longer wished to argue he turned away chrysler ill give you just ten minutes to have a gallon of boiling coffee in the captains shelter and youre going to go in there for half an hour he said firmly turning to vallery and drink the damned stuff oror delighted vallery murmured laced with your incomparable rum of course of course ehoh yes damn that williamson turner growled irritably he paused went on slowly shouldnt have said that poor bastards theyll have had it by this time he fell silent then cocked his head listening i wonder how long old charlie means to keep stooging around up there he murmured vallery cleared his throat coughed and before he could speak the wt broadcaster clicked on wtbridge wtbridge two messages one from the dashing orr for a fiver turner grunted first from the sirrus request permission to go alongside take off survivors as well hung for a sheep as a lamb vallery stared through the thinly falling snow through the darkness of the night and over the rolling sea in this sea he murmured and as near dark as makes no difference hell kill himself thats nothing to what old starrs going to do to him when he lays hands on him turner said cheerfully he hasnt a chance ii could never ask a man to do that theres no justification for such a risk besides the merchantmans been badly hit there cant be many left alive aboard turner said nothing make a signal vallery said clearly thank you permission granted good luck and tell wt to go ahead there was a short silence then the speaker crackled again second signal from london for captain decoding messenger leaving for bridge immediately to officer commanding acs fr the speaker boomed after a few seconds deeply distressed at news imperative maintain battle squadron steaming sse at full speed on interception course rendezvous approx tomorrow their lordships expressly command best wishes rearadmiral repeat rearadmiral vallery dno london the speaker clicked off and there was only the lost pinging of the asdic the throbbing monotony of the prowling condors engines the lingering memory of the gladness in the broadcasters voice uncommon civil of their lordships murmured the kapok kid rising to the occasion as usual downright decent one might almost say bloody long overdue turner growled congratulations sir he added warmly signs of grace at last along the banks of the thames a murmur of pleasure ran round the bridge discipline or not no one made any attempt to hide his satisfaction thank you thank you vallery was touched deeply touched promise of help at long long last a promise which might holdalmost certainly heldfor each and every member of his crew the difference between life and deathand they could only think to rejoice in his promotion dead mens shoes he thought and thought of saying it but dismissed the idea immediately a rebuff a graceless affront to such genuine pleasure thank you very much he repeated but gentlemen you appear to have missed the only item of news of any real significance oh no we havent turner growled battle squadron ha too late as usual oh to be sure theyll be in at the deathor shortly afterwards anyway perhaps in time for a few survivors i suppose the illustrious and the furious will be with them perhaps i dont know vallery shook his head smiling despite my recentahelevation i am not yet in their lordships confidence but therell be some carriers and they could fly off a few hours away give us air cover from dawn oh no they wont said turner prophetically the weather will break down make flying off impossible see if im not right perhaps cassandra perhaps vallery smiled well see what was that pilot i didnt quite the kapok kid grinned its just occurred to me that tomorrows going to be a big day for our junior doctorhes convinced that no battleship ever puts out to sea except for a spithead review in peacetime that reminds me vallery said thoughtfully didnt we promise the sirrus young nicholls is up to his neck in work turner cut in doesnt love usthe navy ratherovermuch but he sure loves his job borrowed a firefighting suit and carrington says hes already he broke off looked up sharply into the thin driving snow hallo charlies getting damned nosy dont you think the roar of the condors engines was increasing every second the sound rose to a clamouring crescendo as the bomber roared directly overhead barely a couple of hundred feet above the broken masts died away to a steady drone as the plane circled round the convoy wt to escorts vallery called quickly let him go dont touch him no starshellsnothing hes trying to draw us out to have us give away our position its not likely that the merchant ships oh god the fools the fools too late too late a merchantman in the port line had opened upoerlikons or bofors it was difficult to say they were firing blind completely blind and in a high wind snow and darkness the chance of locating a plane by sound alone was impossibly remote the firing did not last longten fifteen seconds at the outside but long enoughand the damage was done charlie had pulled off and straining apprehensive ears caught the sudden deepening of the note of the engines as the boosters were cut in for maximum climb what do you make of it sir turner asked abruptly trouble vallery was quiet but certain this has never happened beforeand its not psychological warfare as you call it commander he doesnt even rob us of our sleep not when were this close to the north cape and he cant hope to trail us long a couple of quick course alterations and ah he breathed softly what did i tell you commander with a suddenness that blocked thought with a dazzling glare that struck whitely cruelly at singeing eyeballs night was transformed into day high above the ulysses a flare had burst into intense life a flare which tore apart the falling snow like filmy transparent gauze swinging wildly under its parachute with the gusting of the wind the flare was drifting slowly seawards towards a sea no longer invisible but suddenly black as night towards a sea where every ship in its glistening sheath of ice and snow was silhouetted in dazzling whiteness against the inky backdrop of sea and sky get that flare turner was barking into the transmitter all oerlikons all pompoms get that flare he replaced the transmitter might as well throw empty beer bottles at it with the old girl rolling like this he muttered lord gives you a funny feeling this i know the kapok kid supplied like one of these dreams where youre walking down a busy street and you suddenly realise that all youre wearing is a wristwatch naked and defenceless is the accepted term i believe for the nonliterary caught with the pants down absently he brushed the snow off the quilted kapok exposing the embroidered j on the breast pocket while his apprehensive eyes probed into the circle of darkness outside the pool of light i dont like this at all he complained neither do i vallery was unhappy and i dont like charlies sudden disappearance either he hasnt disappeared turner said grimly listen they listened ears straining intently caught the intermittent distant thunder of the heavy engines hes way astern of us closing less than a minute later the condor roared overhead again higher this time lost in the clouds again he released a flare higher much higher than the last and this time squarely over the heart of the convoy again the roar of the engines died to a distant murmur again the desynchronised clamour strengthened as the condor overtook the convoy a second time glimpsed only momentarily in the inverted valleys between the scudding clouds it flew wide this time far out on the port hand riding clear above the pitiless glare of the sinking flares and as it thundered by flares exploded into blazing life four of them just below cloud level at foursecond intervals the northern horizon was alive with light glowing and pulsating with a fierce flame that threw every tiny detail into the starkest relief and to the south there was only the blackness the rim of the pool of light stopped abruptly just beyond the starboard line of ships it was turner who first appreciated the significance the implications of this realisation struck at him with the galvanic effect of sheer physical shock he gave a hoarse cry fairly flung himself at the broadcast transmitter there was no time to await permission b turret he roared starshells to the south green green urgent urgent starshells green maximum elevation close settings fire when you are ready he looked quickly over his shoulder pilot can you b turret training sir good good he lifted the transmitter again all guns all guns stand by to repel air attack from starboard probable bearing green hostiles probably torpedobombers even as he spoke he caught sight of the intermittent flashing of the fighting lights on the lower yardarm vallery was sending out an emergency signal to the convoy youre right commander vallery whispered in the gaunt pallor in the skin taut stretched across the sharp and fleshless bones his face in that blinding glare was a ghastly travesty of humanity it was a deathshead redeemed only by the glow of the deepsunken eyes the sudden flicker of bloodless lids as the whiplash crash of b turret shattered the silence you must be he went on slowly every ship silhouetted from the northand a maximum runin from the south under cover of darkness he broke off suddenly as the shells exploded in great overlapping globules of light two miles to the south you are right he said gently here they come hu h they came from the south wingtip to wingtip flying in three waves with four or five planes in each wave they were coming in at about feet and even as the shells burst their noses were already dipping into the plane of the shallow attack dive of the torpedobomber and as they dived the bombers fanned out as if in search of individual targetsor what seemed at first sight to be individual targets but within seconds it became obvious that they were concentrating on two ships and two ships alonethe stirling and the ulysses even the ideal double target of the crippled merchantman and the destroyer sirrus almost stopped alongside her was strictly ignored they were flying under orders b turret pumped out two more starshells at minimum settings reloaded with he by this time every gun in the convoy had opened up the barrage was intense the torpedobomberscuriously difficult to identify but looking like heinkelshad to fly through a concentrated lethal curtain of steel and high explosive the element of surprise was gone the starshells of the ulysses had gained a priceless twenty seconds five bombers were coming at the ulysses now fanned out to disperse fire but arrowing in on a central point they were levelling off running in on firing tracks almost at wavetop height when one of them straightened up a fraction too late brushed lightly against a cresting wavetop glanced harmlessly off then catapulted crazily from wavetop to wavetopthey were flying at right angles to the set of the seabefore disappearing in a trough misjudgment of distance or the pilots windscreen suddenly obscured by a flurry of snowit was impossible to say a second later the leading plane in the middle disintegrated in a searing burst of flamea direct hit on its torpedo warhead a third plane behind and to the west sheered off violently to the left to avoid the hurtling debris and the subsequent dropping of its torpedo was no more than an empty gesture it ran half a cable length behind the ulysses spent itself in the empty sea beyond two bombers left now pressing home their attack with suicidal courage weaving violently from side to side to avoid destruction two seconds passed three fourand still they came on through the falling snow and intensely heavy fire miraculous in their immunity theoretically there is no target so easy to hit as a plane approaching directly head on in practice it never worked out that way in the arctic the mediterranean the pacific the relative immunity of the torpedobombers the high percentage of successful attacks carried out in the face of almost saturation fire never failed to confound the experts tension overanxiety fearthese were part of the trouble at least there are no half measures about a torpedobomberyou get him or he gets you and there is nothing more nerverackingalways of course with the outstanding exception of the screaming nearvertical powerdive of the gullwinged stuka divebomberthan to see a torpedobomber looming hugely terrifyingly over the open sights of your gun and know that you have just five inexorable seconds to live and with the ulysses of course the continuous rolling of the cruiser in the heavy crosssea made accuracy impossible these last two bombers came in together wingtip to wingtip the plane nearer the bows dropped its torpedo less than two hundred yards away pulled up in a maximum climbing turn to starboard a fusillade of light cannon and machinegun shells smashing into the upper works of the bridge the torpedo hit the water obliquely porpoised high into the air then crashed back again nose first into a heavy wave diving steeply into the sea it passed under the ulysses but seconds before that the last torpedobomber had made its attackmade its attack and failed and died it had come roaring in less than ten feet above the waves had come straight on without releasing its torpedo without gaining an inch in height until the crosses on the upper sides of the wings could be clearly seen until it was less than a hundred yards away suddenly desperately the pilot had begun to climb it was immediately obvious that the torpedo release mechanism had jammed either through mechanical failure or icing in the intense cold obviously too the pilot had intended to release the torpedo at the last minute had banked on the sudden decrease of weight to lift him over the ulysses the nose of the bomber smashed squarely into the forard funnel the starboard wing shearing off like cardboard as it scythed across the after leg of the tripod mast there was an instantaneous blinding sheet of gasoline flame but neither smoke nor explosion a moment later the crumpled shattered bomber no longer a machine but a torn and flaming crucifix plunged into the hissing sea a dozen yards away the water had barely closed over it when a gigantic underwater explosion heeled the ulysses far over to starboard a vicious hammerblow that flung men off their feet and shattered the lighting system on the port side of the cruiser commander turner hoisted himself painfully to his feet shook his head to clear it of the cordite fumes and the dazed confusion left by cannon shells exploding almost at arms length the shock of the detonating torpedo hadnt thrown him to the duckboardshed hurled himself there five seconds previously as the flaming guns of the other bomber had raked the bridge from pointblank range his first thought was for vallery the captain was lying on his side crumpled strangely against the binnacle drymouthed cold with a sudden chill that was not of that polar wind turner bent quickly turned him gently over vallery lay still motionless lifeless no sign of blood no gaping woundthank god for that turner peeled off a glove thrust a hand below duffel coat and jacket thought he detected a faint a very faint beating of the heart gently he lifted the head off the frozen slush then looked up quickly the kapok kid was standing above him get brooks up here pilot he said swiftly its urgent unsteadily the kapok kid crossed over the bridge the communication rating was leaning over the gate telephone in his hand the sick bay quickly the kapok kid ordered tell the surgeon commander he stopped suddenly guessed that the man was still too dazed to understand here give me that phone impatiently he stretched out his hand and grabbed the telephone then stiffened in horror as the man slipped gradually backwards extended arms trailing stiffly over the top of the gate until they disappeared carpenter opened the gate stared down at the dead man at his feet there was a hole the size of his gloved fist between the shoulderblades he lay alongside the asdic cabinet a cabinet the kapok kid now saw for the first time riddled and shattered with machinegun bullets and shells his first thought was the numbing appreciation that the set must be smashed beyond recovery that their last defence against the uboats was gone hard on the heels of that came the sickening realisation that there had been an asdic operator inside there his eyes wandered away caught sight of chrysler rising to his feet by the torpedo control he too was staring at the asdic cabinet his face drained of expression before the kapok kid could speak chrysler lurched forward fists battering frantically blindly at the jammed door of the cabinet like a man in a dream the kapok kid heard him sobbing and then he remembered the asdic operatorhis name was chrysler too sick to his heart the kapok kid lifted the phone again turner pillowed the captains head moved across to the starboard corner of the compass platform bentley quiet unobtrusive as always was sitting on the deck his back wedged between two pipes his head pillowed peacefully on his chest his hand under bentleys chin turner gazed down into the sightless eyes the only recognisable feature of what had once been a human face turner swore in savage quiet tried to prise the dead fingers locked round the handgrip of the aldis then gave up the barred beam shone eerily across the darkening bridge methodically turner searched the bridgedeck for further casualties he found three others and it was no consolation at all that they must have died unknowing five dead men for a threesecond bursta very fair return he thought bitterly standing on the after ladder his face stilled in unbelief as he realised that he was staring down into the heart of the shattered forard funnel more he could not see the boat deck was already blurred into featureless anonymity in the dying glare of the last of the flares he swung on his heel returned to the compass platform at least he thought grimly there was no difficulty in seeing the stirling what was it that he had saidsaid less than ten minutes ago i wish theyd have a go at the stirling once in a while something like that his mouth twisted theyd had a go all right the stirling a mile ahead was slewing away to starboard to the southeast her forard superstructure enveloped in a writhing cocoon of white flame he stared through his night glasses tried to assess the damage but a solid wall of flame masked the superstructure from the focsle deck clear abaft the bridge he could see nothing there just nothingbut he could see even in that heavy swell that the stirling was listing to starboard it was learned later that the stirling had been struck twice she had been torpedoed in the forard boilerroom and seconds later a bomber had crashed into the side of her bridge her torpedo still slung beneath the belly of her fuselage almost certainly in the light of the similar occurrence on the ulysses severe icing had jammed the release mechanism death must have been instantaneous for every man on the bridge and the decks below among the dead were captain jeffries the first lieutenant and the navigator the last bomber was hardly lost in the darkness when carrington replaced the poop phone turned to hartley think you can manage now chief im wanted on the bridge i think so sir hartley blackened and stained with smoke and extinguisher foam passed his sleeve wearily across his face the worst is over wheres lieutenant carslake shouldnt he forget him carrington interrupted brusquely i dont know where he is nor do i care theres no need for us to beat about the bush chief were better without him if he returns youre still in charge look after things he turned away walked quickly forard along the port alley on the packed snow and ice the pad of his rubber seaboots was completely soundless he was passing the shattered canteen when he saw a tall shadowy figure standing in the gap between the snow covered lip of the outer torpedo tube and the end stanchion of the guard rails trying to open a jammed extinguisher valve by striking it against the stanchion a second later he saw another blurred form detach itself stealthily from the shadows creep up stealthily behind the man with the extinguisher a heavy bludgeon of wood or metal held high above his head look out carrington shouted behind you it was all over in two seconds the sudden flailing rush of the attacker the crash as the victim lightning fast in his reactions dropped his extinguisher and fell crouched to his knees the thin piercing scream of anger and terror as the attacker catapulted over the stooping body and through the gap between tubes and rails the splash and then the silence carrington ran up to the man on the deck helped him to his feet the last flare had not yet died and it was still light enough for him to see who it was ralston the lto carrington gripped his arms looked at him anxiously are you all right did he get you good god who on earth thank you sir ralston was breathing quickly but his face was almost expressionless again that was too close i thank you very much sir but who on earth carrington repeated in wonder never saw him sir ralston was grim but i know who it wassublieutenant carslake hes been following me around all night never let me out of his sight not once now i know why it took much to disturb the first lieutenants iron equanimity but now he shook his head in slow disbelief i knew there was bad blood he murmured but that it should come to this what the captain will say to this i just why tell him ralston said indifferently why tell anyone perhaps carslake had relations what good will it do to hurt them to hurt anyone let anyone think what they like he laughed shortly let them think he died a heros death firefighting fell over the side anything he looked down into the dark rushing water then shivered suddenly let him go sir please hes paid for a long second carrington too stared down over the side looked back at the tall boy before him then he clapped his arm nodded slowly and turned away turner heard the clanging of the gate lowered the binoculars to find carrington standing by his side gazing wordlessly at the burning cruiser just then vallery moaned softly and carrington looked down quickly at the prone figure at his feet my god the old man is he hurt badly sir i dont know number one if not its a bloody miracle he added bitterly he stooped down raised the dazed captain to a sitting position are you all right sir he asked anxiously do you have you been hit vallery shuddered in a long exhausting paroxysm of coughing then shook his head feebly im all right he whispered weakly he tried to grin a pitiful ghastly travesty of a smile in the reflected light from the burning aldis i dived for the deck but i think the binnacle got in my way he rubbed his forehead already bruised and discoloured hows the ship commander to hell with the ship turner said roughly he passed an arm round vallery raised him carefully to his feet how are things aft number one under control still burning but under control i left hartley in charge he made no mention of carslake good take over radio stirling sirrus see how they are come on sir shelter for you vallery protested feebly a token protest only for he was too weak to stand he checked involuntarily as he saw the snow falling whitely through the barred beam of the aldis slowly followed the beam back to its source bentley he whispered dont tell me he barely caught the commanders wordless nod turned heavily away they passed by the dead man stretched outside the gate then stopped at the asdic cabinet a sobbing figure was crouched into the angle between the shelter and the jammed and shattered door of the hut head pillowed on the forearm resting high against the door vallery laid a hand on the shaking shoulder peered into the averted face what is it oh its you boy the white face had been lifted towards him whats the matter chrysler the door sir chryslers voice was muffled quivering the door i cant open it for the first time vallery looked at the cabinet at the gashed and torn metal his mind was still dazed exhausted and it was almost by a process of association that he suddenly horrifyingly thought of the gashed and mangled operator that must lie behind that locked door yes he said quietly the doors buckled theres nothing anyone can do chrysler he looked more closely at the grief dulled eyes come on my boy theres no need my brothers in there sir the words the hopeless despair struck vallery like a blow dear god he had forgotten of course leading asdic operator chrysler he stared down at the dead man at his feet already covered with a thin layer of snow have that aldis unplugged commander will you he asked absently and chrysler yes sir a flat monotone go below and bring up some coffee please coffee sir he was bewildered uncomprehending coffee but butmymy brother i know vallery said gently i know bring some coffee will you chrysler stumbled off when the shelter door closed behind them clicking on the light vallery turned to the commander cue for moralising on the glories of war he murmured quietly dulce et decorum and the proud privilege of being the sons of nelson and drake its not twentyfour hours since ralston watched his father die and now this boy perhaps ill take care of things turner nodded he hadnt yet forgiven himself for what he had said and done to ralston last night in spite of ralstons quick friendliness the ready acceptance of his apologies ill keep him busy out of the way till we open up the cabinet sit down sir have a swig of this he smiled faintly friend williams having betrayed my guilty secret hallo company the light clicked off and a burly figure bulked momentarily against the grey oblong of the doorway the door shut and brooks stood blinking in the sudden light red of face and gasping for breath his eyes focused on the bottle in turners hand ha he said at length having a bottle party are we all contributions gratefully received i have no doubt he opened his case on a convenient table was rummaging inside when someone rapped sharply on the door come in vallery called a signalman entered handed a note to vallery from london sir chief says there may be some reply thank you ill phone down the door opened and closed again vallery looked up at an empty handed turner thanks for removing the guilty evidence so quickly he smiled then he shook his head my eyes they dont seem so good perhaps you would read the signal commander and perhaps you would like some decent medicine brooks boomed instead of that filthy muck of turners he fished in his bag produced a bottle of amber liquid with all the resources of modern medicine well practically all anyway at my disposal i can find nothing to equal this have you told nicholls vallery was stretched out on the settee now eyes closed the shadow of a smile on his bloodless lips well no brooks confessed but plenty of time have some thanks lets have the good news turner good news the sudden deadly quiet of the commanders voice fell chilly over the waiting men no sir its not good news rearadmiral vallery commanding acs fr the voice was drained of all tone and expression tirpitz escorting cruisers destroyers reported moving out alta fjord sunset intense activity alta fjord airfield fear sortie under air cover all measures avoid useless sacrifice merchant naval ships dno london with deliberate care turner folded the paper laid it on the table isnt that just wonderful he murmured whatever next vallery was sitting bolt upright on the settee blind to the blood trickling down crookedly from one corner of his mouth his face was calm unworried i think ill have that glass now brooks if you dont mind he said quietly the tirpitz the tirpitz he shook his head tiredly like a man in a dream the tirpitz the name that no man mentioned without a far off echo of awe and fear the name that had completely dominated north atlantic naval strategy during the past two years moving out at last an armoured colossus sister ship to that other titan that had destroyed the hood with one single savage blow the hood the darling of the royal navy the most powerful ship in the world or so men had thought what chance had their tiny cockleshell cruiser again he shook his head angrily this time forced himself to think of the present well gentlemen i suppose time bringeth all things even the tirpitz it had to come some day just our ill luck the bait was too close too tempting my young colleague is going to be just delighted brooks said grimly a real battleship at long long last sunset turner mused sunset my god he said sharply even allowing for negotiating the fjord theyll be on us in four hours on this course exactly vallery nodded and its no good running north theyd overtake us before were within a hundred miles of them them our big boys up north turner scoffed i hate to sound like a gramophone record but youll recall my earlier statement about them too late as usual he paused swore again i hope that old bastard starrs satisfied at last he finished bitterly why all the gloom vallery looked up quizzically went on softly we can still be back safe and sound in scapa in fortyeight hours avoid useless sacrifice merchant naval ships he said the ulysses is probably the fastest ship in the world today its simple gentlemen no no brooks moaned too much of an anticlimax i couldnt stand it do another pq pq a large mixed convoy it included over british american and panamanian ships left iceland for russia under the escort of half a dozen destroyers and perhaps a dozen smaller craft with a mixed angloamerican cruiser and destroyer squadron in immediate support a shadow covering forceagain angloamericancomprising one aircraft carrier two battleships three cruisers and a flotilla of destroyers lay to the north as with fr they formed the spring of the trap that closed too late the time was midsummer a suicidal season for the attempt for in june and july in these high latitudes there is no night about longitude east the convoy was heavily attacked by uboats and aircraft on the same day as the attack began th july the covering cruiser squadron was radioed that the tirpitz had just sailed from alta fjord the support squadron and convoy escorts immediately withdrew to the west at high speed leaving pq to their fate leaving them to scatter and make then unescorted way to russia as best they could the feelings of the crews of the merchant ships at this savetheirownskins desertion and betrayal by the royal navy can be readily imagined their fears too can be readily imagined but even their darkest forebodings never conceived the dreadful reality merchant ships were sent to the bottom by uboats and aircraft the tirpitz was not seen never came anywhere near the convoy but even the threat had driven the naval squadrons to flight the author does not know all the facts concerning pq nor does he seek to interpret those he does know still less does he seek to assign blame curiously enough the only definite conclusion is that no blame can be attached to the commander of the squadron admiral hamilton he had no part of the decision to withdraw the order came from the admiralty and was imperative but one does not envy him it was a melancholy and bitter incident all the more unpalatable in that it ran so directly counter to the traditions of a great service one wonders what sir philip sydney would have thought or in more modern times kennedy of the rawalpindi or fegen of the jervis bay but there was no doubt what the merchant navy thought what they still think from most of the few survivors there can be no hope of forgiveness they will probably always remember the royal navy would desperately like to forget it is difficult to blame either turner smiled but the smile never touched his eyes the royal navy could never stand it captain rearadmiral vallery would never permit it and speaking for myself and im fairly certain this bunch of cutthroat mutineers of ours well i dont think wed ever sleep so sound o nights again gad brooks murmured the mans a poet youre right turner vallery drained his glass lay back exhausted we dont seem to have much option what if we receive orders for aahhighspeed withdrawal you cant read turner said bluntly remember you just said your eyes are going back on you souls that have toiled and wrought and fought with me vallery quoted softly thank you gentlemen you make things very easy for me he propped himself on an elbow his mind made up he smiled at turner and his face was almost boyish again inform all merchant ships all escorts tell them to break north turner stared at him north did you say north but the admiralty north i said vallery repeated quietly the admiralty can do what they like about it weve played along long enough weve sprung the trap what more can they want this way theres a chance an almost hopeless chance perhaps but a fighting chance to go east is suicide he smiled again almost dreamily the end is not all important he said softly i dont think ill have to answer for this not now not ever turner grinned at him his face lit up north you said inform cinc vallery went on ask pilot for an interception course tell the convoy well tag along behind give em as much cover as we can as long as we can as long as we can let us not delude ourselves to at the outside nothing else we can do commander pray turner said succinctly and sleep brooks added why dont you have half an hour sir sleep vallery seemed genuinely amused well have all the time in the world to sleep just by and by you have a point brooks conceded you are very possibly right chapter fifteen saturday evening ii messages were pouring in to the bridge now messages from the merchant ships messages of dismayed unbelief asking for confirmation of the tirpitz breakout from the stirling replying that the superstructure fire was now under control and that the engine room watertight bulkheads were holding and one from orr of the sirrus saying that his ship was making water to the capacity of the pumps he had been in heavy collision with the sinking merchantman that they had taken off fortyfour survivors that the sirrus had already done her share and couldnt she go home the signal had arrived after the sirruss receipt of the bad news turner grinned to himself no inducement on earth he knew could have persuaded orr to leave now the messages kept pouring in by visual signal or wt there was no point in maintaining radio silence to outwit enemy monitor positions the enemy knew where they were to a mile nor was there any need to prohibit light signalling not with the stirling still burning furiously enough to illuminate the sea for a mile around and so the messages kept on comingmessages of fear and dismay and anxiety but for turner the most disquieting message came neither by lamp nor by radio fully quarter of an hour had elapsed since the end of the attack and the ulysses was rearing and pitching through the head seas on her new course of when the gate of the bridge crashed open and a panting exhausted man stumbled on to the compass platform turner back on the bridge again peered closely at him in the red glare from the stirling recognised him as a stoker his face was masked in sweat the sweat already caking to ice in the intense cold and in spite of that cold he was hatless coatless clad only in a pair of thin dungarees he was shivering violently shivering from excitement and not because of the icy windhe was oblivious to such things turner seized him by the shoulder what is it man he demanded anxiously the stoker was still too breathless to speak whats wrong quickly the ts sir the breathing was so quick so agonised that the words blurred into a gasping exhalation its full of water the ts turner was incredulous flooded when did this happen im not sure sir he was still gasping for breath but there was a bloody awful explosion sir just about amid i know i know turner interrupted impatiently bomber carried away the forard funnel exploded in the water port side but that was fifteen minutes ago man fifteen minutes good god they would have ts switchboards gone sir the stoker was beginning to recover to huddle against the wind but frantic at the commanders deliberation and delay he straightened up and grasped turners duffel without realising what he was doing the note of urgency deepened still further all the powers gone sir and the hatch is jammed the men cant get out the hatch cover jammed turners eyes narrowed in concern what happened he rapped out buckled the counterweights broken off sir its on top of the hatch we can only get it open an inch you see sir number one turner shouted here sir carrington was standing just behind him i heard why cant you open it its the ts hatch the stoker cried desperately a quarter of a bloody ton if its an ounce sir you know the one below the ladder outside the wheelhouse only two men can get at it at the same time weve tried hurry sir please just a minute carrrington was calm unruffled infuriatingly so hartley no still firefighting evans macintosh dead he was obviously thinking aloud bellamy perhaps what is it number one turner burst out he himself had caught up the anxiety the impatience of the stoker what are you trying hatch cover plus pulley ibs carrington murmured a special man for a special job petersen sir the stoker had understood immediately petersen of course carrington clapped gloved hands together were on our way sir acetylene no time stoker crow bars sledges perhaps if you would ring the engineroom sir but turner already had the phone in his hand aft on the poop deck the fire was under control all but in a few odd corners where the flames were fed by a fierce through draught in the mess decks bulkheads ladders mess partitions lockers had been twisted and buckled into strange shapes by the intense heat on deck the gasoline fed flames incinerating the two and three quarter inch deck plating and melting the caulking as by some gigantic blowtorch had cleanly stripped all covering and exposed the steel deck plates plates dull red and glowing evilly plates that hissed and spat as heavy snowflakes drifted down to sibilant extinction on and below decks hartley and his crews freezing one moment reeling in the blast of heat the next toiled like men insane where their wasted exhausted bodies found the strength god only knew from the turrets from the masteratarmss office from mess decks and emergency steering position they pulled out man after man who had been there when the condor had crashed pulled them out looked at them swore wept and plunged back into the aftermath of that holocaust oblivious of pain and danger tearing aside wreckage wreckage still burning still red hot with charred and broken gloves and when the gloves fell off they used their naked hands as the dead were ranged in the starboard alleyway leading seaman doyle was waiting for them less than half an hour previously doyle had been in the forard galley passage rolling in silent agony as frozen body and clothes thawed out after the drenching of his pompom five minutes later he had been back on his gun rock like unflinching as he pumped shell after shell over open sights into the torpedo bombers and now steady and enduring as ever he was on the poop a man of iron and a face of iron too that night the bearded leonine head still and impassive as he picked up one dead man after the other walked to the guard rail and dropped his burden gently over the side how many times he repeated that brief journey that night doyle never knew he had lost count after the first twenty or so he had no right to do this of course the navy was very strong on decent burial and this was not decent burial but the sailmakers were dead and no man would or could have sewn up these ghastly charred heaps in the weighted and sheeted canvas the dead dont care doyle thought dispassionately let them look after themselves so too thought carrington and hartley and they made no move to stop him beneath their feet the smouldering mess decks rang with hollow reverberating clangs as nicholls and leading telegraphist brown still weirdly garbed in their white asbestos suits swung heavy sledges against the securing clips of y magazine hatch in the smoke and gloom and their desperate haste they could hardly see each other much less the clips as often as not they missed their strokes and the hammers went spinning out of numbed hands into the waiting darkness time yet nicholls thought desperately perhaps there is time the main flooding valve had been turned off five minutes ago it was possible barely possible that the two trapped men inside were clinging to the ladder above water level one clip one clip only was holding the hatch cover now with alternate strokes of their sledges they struck it with vicious strength suddenly unexpectedly it sheared off at fts base and the hatch cover crashed open under the explosive upsurge of the compressed air beneath brown screamed in agony a single coughing shout of pain as the bone crashing momentum of the swinging hatch crashed into his right hip then fell to the deck where he lay moaning quietly nicholls did not even spare him a glance he leant far through the hatch the powerful beam of his torch stabbing downwards into the gloom and he could see nothing nothing at all not what he wanted to see all he saw was the water dark and viscous and evil water rising and falling water flooding and ebbing in the eerie oilbound silence as the ulysses plunged and lifted in the heavy seas below nicholls called loudly the voice a voice he noted impersonally cracked and shaken with strain boomed and echoed terrifyingly down the iron tunnel below he shouted again is there anybody there he strained his ears for the least sound for the faintest whisper of an answer but none came mcquater he shouted a third time williamson can you hear me again he looked again he listened but there was only the darkness and the muffled whisper of the oilslicked water swishing smoothly from side to side he stared again down the light from the torch marvelled that any surface could so quickly dissipate and engulf the brilliance of that beam and beneath that surface he shivered the water even the water seemed to be dead old and evil and infinitely horrible in sudden anger he shook his head to clear it of these stupid primitive fears his imagination hed have to watch it he stepped back straightened up gently carefully he closed the swinging hatch the mess deck echoed as his sledge swung down on the clips again and again and again engineercommander dodson stirred and moaned he struggled to open his eyes but his eyelids refused to function at least he thought that they did for the blackness around remained as it was absolute impenetrable almost palpable he wondered dully what had happened how long he had been there what had happened and the side of his head just below the ear that hurt abominably slowly with clumsy deliberation he peeled oflf his glove reached up an exploratory hand it came away wet and sticky his hair he realised with mild surprise was thickly matted with blood it must be blood he could feel it trickling slowly heavily down the side of his cheek and that deep powerful vibration a vibration overlain with an indefinable note of strain that set his engineers teeth on edge he could hear it almost feel it immediately in front of him his bare hand reached out recoiled in instant reflex as it touched something smooth and revolving and burning hot the shaft tunnel of course thats where he was the shaft tunnel theyd discovered fractured lubricating pipes on the port shafts too and hed decided to keep this engine turning he knew theyd been attacked down here in the hidden bowels of the ship sound did not penetrate he had heard nothing of the aircraft engines he hadnt even heard their own guns firing but there had been no mistaking the jarring shock of the s surging back on their hydraulic recoils and then a torpedo perhaps or a near miss by a bomb thank god hed been sitting facing inboard when the ulysses had lurched the other way round and it would have been curtains for sure when hed been flung across the shaft coupling and wrapped round the shaft dear god the shaft it was running almost red hot on dry bearings frantically he pawed around picked up his emergency lamp and twisted its base there was no light he twisted it again with all his strength reached up felt the jagged edges of broken screen and bulb and flung the useless lamp to the deck he dragged out his pocket torch that too was smashed desperate now he searched blindly around for his oil can it was lying on its side the patent spring top beside it the can was empty no oil none heaven only knew how near that overstressed metal was to the critical limit he didnt he admitted that even to the best engineers metal fatigue was an incalculable unknown but like all men who had spent a lifetime with machines he had developed a sixth sense for these things and right now that sixth sense was jabbing at him mercilessly insistently oil he would have to get oil but he knew he was in bad shape dizzy weak from shock and loss of blood and the tunnel was long and slippery and dangerous and unlighted one slip one stumble against or over that merciless shaft gingerly the engineercommander stretched out his hand again rested his hand for an instant on the shaft drew back sharply in sudden pain he lifted his hand to his cheek knew that it was not friction that had flayed and burnt the skin off the tips of his fingers there was no choice resolutely he gathered his legs under him swayed dizzily to his feet his back bent against the arching convexity of the tunnel it was then that he noticed it for the first tune a light a swinging tiny pinpoint of light imponderably distant in the converging sides of that dark tunnel although he knew it could be only yards away he blinked closed his eyes and looked again the light was still there advancing steadily and he could hear the shuffling of feet now all at once he felt weak lightheaded gratefully he sank down again his feet safely braced once more against the bearing block the man with the light stopped a couple of feet away hooked the lamp on to an inspection bracket lowered himself carefully and sat beside dodson the rays of the lamp fell full on the dark heavy face the jagged brows and prognathous jaw dodson stiffened in sudden surprise riley stoker riley his eyes narrowed in suspicion and conjecture what the devil are you doing here ive brought a two gallon drum of lubricating oil riley growled he thrust a thermos flask into the engineercommanders hands and heres some coffee ill tend to this you drink that suffering christ this bloody bearings red hot dodson set down the thermos with a thump are you deaf he asked harshly why are you here who sent you your stations in b boiler room grierson sent me riley said roughly his dark face was impassive said he couldnt spare his engine room men too bloody valuable too much the oil thick viscous was pouring slowly on to the overheated bearing lieutenant grierson dodson was almost vicious his voice a whiplash of icy correction and thats a damned lie riley lieutenant grierson never sent you i suppose you told him that somebody else had sent you drink your coffee riley advised sourly youre wanted in the engineroom the engineercommander clenched his fist restrained himself with difficulty you damned insolent bastard he burst out abruptly control came back and he said evenly commanders defaulters in the morning youll pay for this riley no i wont confound him dodson thought furiously hes actually grinning the insolent he checked his thought why not he demanded dangerously because you wont report me riley seemed to be enjoying himself hugely oh so thats it dodson glanced swiftly round the darkened tunnel and his lips tightened as he realised for the first time how completely alone they were in sudden certainty he looked back at riley big and hunched and menacing smiling yet but no smile dodson thought could ever transform that ugly brutal face the smile on the face of the tiger fear exhaustion never ending strain they did terrible things to a man and you couldnt blame him for what he had become or for what he was born but his dodsons first responsibility was to himself grimly he remembered how turner had berated him called him all sorts of a fool for refusing to have riley sent to prison so thats it eh he repeated softly he turned himself feet thrusting solidly against the block dont be so sure riley i can give you twenty five years but oh for christs sake riley burst out impatiently what are you talking about sir drink your coffee please youre wanted in the engineroom i tell you he repeated impatiently uncertainly dodson relaxed unscrewed the cap of the thermos he had a sudden peculiar feeling of unreality as if he were a spectator some bystander in no way involved in this scene this fantastic scene his head he realised still hurt like hell tell me riley he asked softly what makes you so sure i wont report you oh you can report me all right riley was suddenly cheerful again but i wont be at the commanders table tomorrow morning no it was halfchallenge halfquestion no riley grinned cos therell be no commander and no table tomorrow morning he clasped his hands luxuriously behind his head in fact therell be no nothin something in the voice rather than in the words caught and held dodsons attention he knew with instant conviction that though riley might be smiling he wasnt joking dodson looked at him curiously but said nothing commanders just finished broadcastin riley continued the tirpitz is out we have four hours left the bald flat statement the complete lack of histrionics of playing for effect left no possible room for doubt the tirpitz out the tirpitz out dodson repeated the phrase to himself over and over again four hours just four hours to go he was surprised at his own reaction his apparent lack of concern well riley was anxious now restive are you goin or arent you im not kiddin sir youre wanted urgent youre a liar dodson said pleasantly why did you bring the coffee for myself the smile was gone the face set and sullen but i thought you needed it you dont look so good to me theyll fix you up back in the engineroom and thats just where youre going right nowl dodson said evenly riley gave no sign that he had heard on your way riley dodson said curtly thats an order off riley growled im stayin you dont require to have three great gold stripes on your sleeve to handle a bloody oil can he finished derisively possibly not dodson braced against a sudden violent pitch but too late to prevent himself lurching into riley sorry riley weathers worsening im afraid well we ahappear to have reached an impasse whats that riley asked suspiciously a dead end a nodecision fight tell me riley he asked quietly what brought you here i told you riley was aggrieved grierson lieutenant grierson sent me what brought you here dodson persisted it was as if riley had not spoken thats my business riley answered savagely what brought you here oh for christs sake leave me alone riley shouted his voice echoed loudly along the dark tunnel suddenly he turned round full face his mouth twisted bitterly you know bloody well why i came to do me in perhaps riley looked at him a long second then turned away his shoulders were hunched his head held low youre the only bastard in this ship that ever gave me a break he muttered the only bastard ive ever known who ever gave me a chance he amended slowly bastard dodson supposed was rileys accolade of friendship and he felt suddenly ashamed of his last remark if it wasnt for you riley went on softly id a been in cells the first time in a civvy jail the second remember sir dodson nodded you were rather foolish riley he admitted why did you do it the big stoker was intense worried god everyone knows what im like do they i wonder i thought you had the makings of a better man than you dont give me that bull riley scoffed know what im like i know what i am im no good everybody says im no good and theyre right he leaned forward do you know somethin im a catholic four hours from now he broke off i should be on my knees shouldnt i he sneered repentance lookin for what do they call it absolution aye thats it absolution and do you know what he spoke slowly emphatically i dont give a single solitary damn maybe you dont have to dodson murmured for the last time get back to that engineroom no the engineercommander sighed picked up the thermos in that case perhaps you would care to join me in a cup of coffee riley looked up grinned and when he spoke it was in a very creditable imitation of colonel chinstrap of the famous itma radio programme ectually i dont mind if i do vallery rolled over on his side his legs doubled up his hand automatically reaching for the towel his emaciated body shook violently and the sound of the harsh retching cough beat back at him from the iron walls of his shelter god he thought oh god its never been as bad as this before funny he thought it doesnt hurt any more not even a little bit the attack eased he looked at the crimson sodden towel flung it in sudden disgust and with what little feeble strength was left him into the darkest corner of the shelter you carry this damned ship on your back unbidden old socratess phrase came into his mind and he smiled faintly well if ever they needed him it was now and if he waited any longer he knew he could never be able to go he sat up sweating with the effort swung his legs carefully over the side as his feet touched the deck the ulysses pitched suddenly steeply and he fell forward against a chair sliding helplessly to the floor it took an eternity of time an infinite effort to drag himself to his feet again another effort like that he knew would surely kill him and then there was the door that heavy steel door somehow he had to open it and he knew he couldnt but he laid hold of the handle and the door opened and suddenly miraculously he was outside gasping as the cruel subzero wind seared down through his throat and wasted lungs he looked fore and aft the fires were dying he saw the fires on the stirling and on his own poopdeck thank god for that at least beside him two men had just finished levering the door off the asdic cabinet were flashing a torch inside but he couldnt bear to look he averted his head staggered with outstretched hands for the gate of the compass platform turner saw him coming hurried to meet him helped him slowly to his chair youve no right to be here he said quietly he looked at vallery for a long moment how are you feeling sir im a good deal better now thanks vallery replied he smiled and went on we rearadmirals have our responsibilities you know commander its time i began to earn my princely salary stand back there carrington ordered curtly into the wheelhouse or up on the ladder all of you lets have a look at this he looked down at the great steel hatch cover looking at it he realised hed never before appreciated just how solid how massive that cover was the hatch cover open no more than an inch was resting on a tommybar he noticed the broken stranded pulley the heavy counterweight lying against the sill of the wheelhouse so thats off he thought thank the lord for that anyway have you tried a block and tackle he asked abruptly yes sir the man nearest him replied he pointed to a tangled heap in a corner no use sir the ladder takes the strain all right but we cant get the hook under the hatch except sideways and then it slips off all the time he gestured to the hatch and every clips either bent they were opened by sledges or at the wrong angle i think i know how to use a block and tackle sir im sure you do carrington said absently here give me a hand will you he hooked his fingers under the hatch took a deep breath the seaman at one side of the cover the other side was hard against the after bulkhead did the same together they strained thighs and backs quivering under the strain carrington felt his face turning crimson with effort heard the blood pounding in his ears and relaxed they were only killing themselves and that damned cover hadnt shifted a fraction someone had done remarkably well to open it even that far but even though they were tired and anything but fit carrington thought two men should have been able to raise an edge of that hatch he suspected that the hinges were jammed or the deck buckled if that were so he mused even if they could hook on a tackle it would be of little help a tackle was of no use when a sudden immediate application of force was required it always yielded that fraction before tightening up he sank to his knees put his mouth to the edge of the hatch below there he called can you hear me we can hear you the voice was weak muffled for gods sake get us out of here were trapped like rats is that you brierley dont worry well get you out hows the water down there water more bloody oil than water there must be a fracture right through the port oil tank i think the ring main passage must be flooded too how deep is it three quarters way up already were standing on generators hanging on to switchboards one of our boys is gone already we couldnt hold him even muffled by the hatch the strain the near desperation in the voice was all too obvious for pitys sake hurry up i said wed get you out carringtons voice was sharp authoritative the confidence was in his voice only but he knew how quickly panic could spread down there can you push from below at all theres room for only one on the ladder brierley shouted its impossible to get any pressure any leverage upwards there was a sudden silence then a series of muffled oaths whats up carrington called sharply its difficult to hang on brierley shouted there are waves two feet high down there one of the men was washed off there i think hes back again its pitch dark down here carrington heard the clatter of heavy footsteps above him and straightened up it was petersen in that narrow space the blond norwegian stoker looked gigantic carrington looked at him looked at the immense span of shoulder the great depth of chest one enormous hand hanging loosely by his side the other negligently holding three heavy crowbars and a sledge as if they were so many lengths of cane carrington looked at him looked at the still grave eyes so startlingly blue under the flaxen hair and all at once he felt oddly confident reassured we cant open this petersen carrington said baldly can you i will try sir he laid down his tools stooped caught the end of the tommybar projecting beneath the corner of the cover he straightened quickly easily the hatch lifted a fraction then the bar putty like in its apparent malleability bent over almost to a right angle i think the hatch is jammed petersen wasnt even breathing heavily it will be the hinges sir he walked round the hatch peered closely at the hinges then grunted in satisfaction three times the heavy sledge swung with accuracy and all the power of these great shoulders behind them smashed squarely into the face of the outer hinge on the third stroke the sledge snapped petersen threw away the broken shaft in disgust picked up another much heavier crowbar again the bar bent but again the hatch cover lifted an inch this time petersen picked up the two smaller sledges that had been used to open clips hammered at the hinges till these sledges too were broken and useless this time he used the last two crowbars together thrust under the same corner of the hatch for five ten seconds he remained bent over them motionless he was breathing deeply quickly now then suddenly the breathing stopped the sweat began to pour off his face his whole body to quiver under the titanic strain then slowly incredibly both crowbars began to bend carrington watched fascinated he had never seen anything remotely like this before he was sure no one else had either neither of these bars he would have sworn would have bent under less than half a ton of pressure it was fantastic but it was happening and as the giant straightened they were bending more and more then suddenly so unexpectedly that everyone jumped the hatch sprang open five or six inches and petersen crashed backwards against the bulkhead the bars falling from his hand and splashing into the water below petersen flung himself back at the hatch tigerish in his ferocity his fingers hooked under the edge the great muscles of his arms and shoulders lifted and locked as he tugged and pulled at that massive hatch cover three times he heaved four times then on the fifth the hatch almost literally leapt up with a screech of tortured metal and smashed shudderingly home into the retaining latch of the vertical stand behind the hatch was open petersen just stood there smiling no one had seen petersen smile for a long time his face bathed in sweat his great chest rising and falling rapidly as his starved lungs sucked in great draughts of air the water level in the low power room was within two feet of the hatch sometimes when the ulysses plunged into a heavy sea the dark oily liquid splashed over the hatch coaming into the flat above quickly the trapped men were hauled to safety soaked in oil from head to foot their eyes gummed and blinded they were men overcome by reaction utterly spent and on the verge of collapse so far gone that even their fear could not overcome their exhaustion three in particular could do no more than cling helplessly to the ladder would almost certainly have slipped back into the surging blackness below but petersen bent over and plucked them clean out of the low power room as if they had been little children take these men to the sick bay at once carrington ordered he watched the dripping shivering men being helped up the ladder then turned to the giant stoker with a smile well all thank you later petersen were not finished yet this hatch must be closed and battened down it will be difficult sir petersen said gravely difficult or not it must be done carrington was emphatic regularly now the water was spilling over the coaming was lapping the sill of the wheelhouse the emergency steering position is gone if the wheelhouse is flooded were finished petersen said nothing he lifted the retaining latch pulled the protesting hatch cover down a foot then he braced his shoulder against the latter planted his feet on the cover and straightened his back convulsively the cover screeched down to he paused bent his back like a bow his hands taking his weight on the ladder then pounded his feet again and again on the edge of the cover fifteen inches to go we need heavy hammers sir petersen said urgently no time carrington shook his head quickly two more minutes and itll be impossible to shut the hatch cover against the water pressure hell he said bitterly if it were only the other way round closing from below even i could lever it shut again petersen said nothing he squatted down by the side of the hatch gazed into the darkness beneath his feet i have an idea sir he said quickly if two of you would stand on the hatch push against the ladder yes sir that way but you could push harder if you turned your back to me carrington laid the heels of his hands against the iron steps of the ladder heaved with all his strength suddenly he heard a splash then a metallic clatter whirled round just in time to see a crowbar clutched in an enormous hand disappear below the edge of the hatch there was no sign of petersen like many big powerful men he was lithe and cat like in his movements hed gone down over the edge of that hatch without a sound petersen carrington was on his knees by the hatch what the devil do you think youre doing come out of there you bloody fool do you want to drown there was no reply complete silence below a silence deepened by the gentle sussuration of the water suddenly the quiet was broken by the sound of metal striking against metal then by a jarring screech as the hatch dropped six inches before carrington had time to think the hatch cover dropped farther still desperately the first lieutenant seized a crowbar thrust it under the hatch cover a split second later the great steel cover thudded down on top of it carrington had his mouth to the gap now in the name of god petersen he shouted are you sane open up open up at once do you hear i cant the voice came and went as the water surged over the stokers head i wont you said yourself there is no time this was the only way but i never meant i know it does not matter it is better this way it was almost impossible to make out what he was saying tell captain vallery that petersen says he is very sorry i tried to tell the captain yesterday sorry i sorry for what madly carrington flung all his strength against the iron bar the hatch cover did not even quiver the dead marine in scapa flow i did not mean to kill him i could never kill any man but he angered me the big norwegian said simply he killed my friend for a second carrington stopped straining at the bar petersen of course who but petersen could have snapped a mans neck like that petersen the big laughing scandinavian who had so suddenly changed overnight into a grave unsmiling giant who stalked the deck the mess decks and alleyways by day and by night who was never seen to smile or sleep with a sudden flash of insight carrington saw clear through into the tortured mind of that kind and simple man listen petersen he begged i dont give a damn about that nobody shall ever know i promise you please petersen just it is better this way the muffled voice was strangely content it is not good to kill a man it is not good to go on living i know please it is important you will tell my captain petersen is sorry and filled with shame i do this for my captain without warning the crowbar was plucked from carringtons hand the cover clanged down in position for a minute the wheelhouse flat rang to a succession of muffled metallic blows suddenly the clamour ceased and there was only the rippling surge of the water outside the wheelhouse and the creak of the wheel inside as the ulysses steadied on course the clear sweet voice soared high and true above the subdued roar of the engineroom fans above the whine of a hundred electric motors and the sound of the rushing of the waters not even the metallic impersonality of the loudspeakers could detract from the beauty of that singing voice it was a favourite device of vallerys when the need for silence was not paramount to pass the long dark hours by coupling up the record player to the broadcast system almost invariably the musical repertoire was strictly classical or what is more often referred to foolishly and disparagingly as the popular classics bach beethoven tchaikovski lehar verdi delius these were the favourites no in b flat minor air on a g string moonlight on the alster claire de lune the skaters waltz the crew of the ulysses could never have enough of these ridiculous impossible it is all too easy to imagine the comments of those who equate the matelots taste in music with the popular conception of his ethics and morals but those same people have never heard the hushed cathedral silence in the crowded hangar of a great aircraft carrier in scapa flow as yehudi menuhins magic bow sang across the strings of the violin swept a thousand men away from the harsh urgencies of reality from the bitter memories of the last patrol or convoy into the golden land of music but now a girl was singing it was deanna durbin and she was singing beneath the lights of home that most heartbreakingly nostalgic of all songs below decks and above bent over the great engines or huddled by their guns men listened to the lovely voice as it drifted through the darkened ship and the falling snow and turned their minds inwards and thought of home thought of the bitter contrast and the morning that would not come suddenly halfway through the song stopped do you hear there the speakers boomed do you hear there this this is the commander speaking the voice was deep and grave and hesitant it caught and held the attention of every man in the ship i have bad news for you turner spoke slowly quietly i am sorry i he broke off then went on more slowly still captain vallery died five minutes ago for a moment the speaker was silent then crackled again he died on the bridge in his chair he knew he was dying and i dont think he suffered at all he insisted he insisted that i thank you for the way you all stood by him tell them these were his words as far as i remember tell them he said that i couldnt have carried on without them that they are the best crew that god ever gave a captain then he said it was the last thing he said give them my apologies after all theyve done for me well well tell them im terribly sorry to let them down like this that was all he said just tell them im sorry and then he died chapter sixteen saturday night richard vallery was dead he died grieving stricken at the thought that he was abandoning the crew of the ulysses leaving them behind leaderless but it was only for a short time and he did not have to wait long before the dawn hundreds more men in the cruisers the destroyers and the merchantmen had died also and they did not die as he had feared under the guns of the tirpitz another grim parallel with pq for the tirpitz had not left alta fjord they died primarily because the weather had changed richard vallery was dead and with his death a great change had come over the men of the ulysses when vallery died other things died also for he took these things with him he took with him the courage the kindliness the gentleness the unshakable faith the infinitely patient and understanding endurance all these things which had been so peculiarly his own and now these things were gone and the ulysses was left without them and it did not matter the men of the ulysses no longer needed courage and all the adjuncts of courage for they were no longer afraid vallery was dead and they did not know how much they respected and loved that gentle man until he was gone but then they knew they knew that something wonderful something that had become an enduring part of their minds and memories something infinitely fine and good was gone and they would never know it again and they were mad with grief and in war a griefstricken man is the most terrible enemy there is prudence caution fear painfor the griefstricken man these no longer exist he lives only to lash out blindly at the enemy to destroy if he can the author of his grief rightly or wrongly the ulysses never thought to blame the captains death on any but the enemy there was only for them the sorrow and the blind hate zombies nicholls had called them once and the ulysses was more than ever a ship manned by living zombies zombies who prowled restlessly incessantly across the snow and ice of the heaving decks automatons living only for revenge the weather changed just before the end of the middle watch the seas did not changefr was still butting into the heavy rolling swell from the north still piling up fresh sheets of glistening ice on their labouring focsles but the wind dropped and almost at once the snowstorm blew itself out the last banks of dark heavy cloud drifting away to the south by four oclock the sky was completely clear there was no moon that night but the stars were out keen and sharp and frosty as the icy breeze that blew steadily out of the north then gradually the sky began to change at first there was only a barely perceptible lightening on the northern rim then slowly a pulsating flickering band of light began to broaden and deepen and climb steadily above the horizon climbing higher to the south with the passing of every minute soon that pulsating ribbon of light was paralleled by others streamers in the most delicate pastel shades of blue and green and violet but always and predominantly white and always too these lanes of multicoloured light grew higher and stronger and brighter at the climax a great band of white stretched high above the convoy extending from horizon to horizon these were the northern lights at any time a spectacle of beauty and wonder and this night surpassing lovely down below in ships clearly illumined against the dark and rolling seas the men of fr looked up and hated them on the bridge of the ulysses chrysler chrysler of the uncanny eyesight and supersensitive hearing was the first to hear it soon everyone else heard it too the distant roar throbbing and intermittent of a condor approaching from the south after a time they became aware that the condor was no longer approaching but sudden hope died almost as it was born there was no mistaking it nowthe deeper heavier note of a fockewulf in maximum climb the commander turned wearily to carrington its charlie all right he said grimly the bastards spotted us hell already have radioed alta fjord and a hundred to one in anything you like that hes going to drop a marker flare at feet or so itll be seen fifty miles away your moneys sake the first lieutenant was withering i never bet against dead certs and then by and by maybe a few flares at a couple of thousand exactly turner nodded pilot how far do you reckon were from alta fjordin flying time i mean for a knot plane just over an hour the kapok kid said quietly his ebullience was gone he had been silent and dejected since vallery had died two hours previously an hour carrington exclaimed and theyll be here my god sir he went on wonderingly theyre really out to get us weve never been bombed nor torpedoed at night before weve never had the tirpitz after us before we never the tirpitz turner interrupted just where the hell is that ship shes had time to come up with us oh i know its dark and weve changed course he added as carrington made to object but a fast destroyer screen would have picked uspreston he broke off spoke sharply to the signal petty officer look alive man that ships flashing us sorry sir the signalman swaying on his feet with exhaustion raised his aldis clacked out an acknowledgment again the light on the merchantman began to wink furiously transverse fracture engine bedplate preston read out damage serious shall have to moderate speed acknowledge said turner curtly what ship is that preston the ohio freighter sir the one that stopped a tin fish a couple of days back thats her sir make a signal essential maintain speed and position turner swore what a time to choose for an engine breakdown pilot when do we rendezvous with the fleet six hours time sir exactly six hours turner compressed his lips just six hours perhaps he added bitterly perhaps carrington murmured perhaps turned affirmed depends entirely on the weather cinc wont risk capital ships so near the coast unless he can fly off fighter cover against air attack and if you ask me thats why the tirpitz hasnt turned up yet some wandering uboats tipped him off that our fleet carriers are steaming south hell be waiting on the weather whats he saying now preston the ohios signal lamp had flashed briefly then died imperative slow down preston repeated damage severe am slowing down he is too carrington said quietly he looked up at turner at the set face and dark eyes and knew the same thought was in the commanders mind as was in his own hes a goner sir a dead duck he hasnt a chance not unless unless what turner asked harshly unless we leave him an escort leave what escort number one the vikingthe only effective unit weve left he shook his head in slow decision the greatest good of the greatest number thats how it has to be theyll know that preston send regret cannot leave you standby how long to effect repairs the flare burst even before prestons hand could close on the trigger it burst directly over fr it was difficult to estimate the height probably six to eight thousand feet but at that altitude it was no more than an incandescent pinpoint against the great band of the northern lights arching majestically above but it was falling quickly glowing more brightly by the sound the parachute if any could have been only a steadying drogue the crackling of the wt speaker broke through the stuttering chatter of the aldis wtbridge wtbridge message from sirrus three survivors dead many dying or seriously wounded medical assistance urgent repeat urgent the speaker died just as the ohio started flickering her reply send for lieutenant nicholls turner ordered briefly ask him to come up to the bridge at once carrington stared down at the dark broad seas seas flecked with milky foam the bows of the ulysses were crashing down heavily continuously youre going to risk it sir i must youd do the same number one what does the ohio say preston i understand too busy to look after the royal navy anyway we will make up on you au revoir we will make up on you au revoir turner repeated softly he lies in his teeth and he knows it by god he burst out if anyone ever tells me the yankee sailors have no guts ill push his perishing face in preston send au revoir good luck number one i feel like a murderer he rubbed his hand across his forehead nodded towards the shelter where vallery lay stretched out and strapped to his settee month in month out hes been taking these decisions its no wonder he broke off as the gate creaked open is that you nicholls there is work for you my boy cant have you medical types idling around uselessly all day long he raised his hand all right all right he chuckled i know how are things on the surgical front he went on seriously weve done all we can sir there was very little left for us to do nicholls said quietly his face was deeply lined haggard to the point of emaciation but were in a bad way for supplies hardly a single dressing left and no anaesthetics at allexcept whats left in the emergency kit the surgeoncommander refuses to touch those good good turner murmured how do you feel laddie awful you look it turner said candidly nichollsim terribly sorry boyi want you to go over to the sirrus yes sir there was no surprise in the voice it hadnt been difficult to guess why the commander had sent for him now turner nodded without speaking his face the lean strong features the heavy brows and sunken eyes were quite visible hu i now in the strengthening light of the plunging flare a face to remember nicholls thought how much kit can i take with me sir just your medical gear no more youre not travelling by pullman laddie can i take my camera my films all right turner smiled briefly looking forward keenly to photographing the last seconds of the ulysses i suppose dont forget that the sirrus is leaking like a sieve pilot get through to the wt tell the sirrus to come alongside prepare to receive medical officer by breeches buoy the gate creaked again turner looked at the bulky figure stumbling wearily on to the compass platform brooks like every man in the crew was dead on his feet but the blue eyes burned as brightly as ever my spies are everywhere he announced whats this about the sirrus shanghaiing young johnny here sorry old man turner apologised it seems things are pretty bad on the sirrus i see brooks shivered it might have been the thin threnody of the wind in the shattered rigging or just the iceladen wind itself he shivered again looked upwards at the sinking flare pretty very pretty he murmured what are the illuminations in aid of we are expecting company turner smiled crookedly an old world custom o socratesthe light in the window and what have you he stiffened abruptly then relaxed his face graven in granitic immobility my mistake he murmured the company has already arrived the last words were caught up and drowned in the rumbling of a heavy explosion turner had known it was cominghed seen the thin stiletto of flame stabbing skywards just forard of the ohio freighters bridge the sound had taken five or six seconds to reach themthe ohio was already over a mile distant on the starboard quarter but clearly visible still under the luminance of the northern lightsthe northern lights that had betrayed her almost stopped in the water to a wandering uboat the ohio freighter did not remain visible for long except for the moment of impact there was neither smoke nor flame nor sound but her back must have been broken her bottom torn outand she was carrying a full cargo of nothing but tanks and ammunition there was a curious dignity about her endshe sank quickly quietly without any fuss she was gone in three minutes it was turner who finally broke the heavy silence on the bridge he turned away and in the light of the flare his face was not pleasant to see au revoir he muttered to no one in particular au revoir thats what he said the lying he shook his head angrily touched the kapok kid on the arm get through to wt he said sharply tell the viking to sit over the top of that sub till we get clear wheres it all going to end brookss face was still and heavy in the twilight god knows how i hate those murdering bastards turner ground out oh i know i know we do the same but give me something i can see something i can fight something youll be able to see the tirpitz all right carrington interrupted dryly by all accounts shes big enough turner looked at him suddenly smiled he clapped his arm then craned his head back staring up at the shimmering loveliness of the sky he wondered when the next flare would drop have you a minute to spare johnny the kapok kids voice was low id like to speak to you sure nicholls looked at him in surprise sure ive a minute ten minutesuntil the sirrus comes up whats wrong andy just a second the kapok kid crossed to the commander permission to go to the charthouse sir sure youve got your matches turner smiled ok off you go the kapok kid smiled faintly said nothing he took nicholls by the arm led him into the charthouse flicked on the lights and produced his cigarettes he looked steadily at nicholls as he dipped his cigarette into the flickering pool of flame know something johnny he said abruptly i reckon i must have scotch blood in me scots nicholls corrected and perish the very thought im feelingwhats the word fey isnt it im feeling fey tonight johnny the kapok kid hadnt even heard the interruption he shivered i dont know why ive never felt this way before ah nonsense indigestion my boy nicholls said briskly but he felt strangely uncomfortable wont wash this time carpenter shook his head halfsmiling besides i havent eaten a thing for two days im on the level johnny in spite of himself nicholls was impressed emotion gravity earnestnessthese were utterly alien to the kapok kid i wont be seeing you again the kapok kid continued softly will you do me a favour johnny dont be so bloody silly nicholls said angrily how the hell do you take this with you the kapok kid pulled out a slip of paper thrust it into nichollss hands can you read it i can read it nicholls had stilled his anger yes i can read it there was a name and address on the sheet of paper a girls name and a surrey address so thats her name he said softly juanita juanita he pronounced it carefully accurately in the spanish fashion my favourite song and my favourite name he murmured is it the kapok kid asked eagerly is it indeed and mine johnny he paused if perhapswell if i dont well youll go to see her johnny what are you talking about man nicholls felt embarrassed halfimpatiently halfplayfully he tapped him on the chest why with that suit on you could swim from here to murmansk youve said so yourself a hundred times the kapok kid grinned up at him the grin was a little crooked sure sure i know i knowwill you go johnny dammit to hell yes nicholls snapped ill goand its high time i was going somewhere else come on he snapped off the lights pulled back the door stopped with his foot halfway over the sill slowly he stepped back inside the charthouse closed the door and nicked on the light the kapok kid hadnt moved was gazing quietly at him im sorry andy nicholls said sincerely i dont know what made me bad temper said the kapok kid cheerfully you always did hate to think that i was right and you were wrong nicholls caught his breath closed his eyes for a second then he stretched out his hand all the best vasco it was an effort to smile and dont worry ill see her ifwell ill see her i promise you juanita but if i find you there he went on threateningly ill thanks johnny thanks a lot the kapok kid was almost happy good luck boy vaya con dios thats what she always said to me what she said before i came away vaya con dios thirty minutes later nicholls was operating aboard the sirrus the time was it was bitterly cold with a light wind blowing steadily from the north the seas were heavier than ever longer between the crests deeper in their gloomy troughs and the damaged sirrus labouring under a mountain of ice was making heavy weather of it the sky was still clear a sky of breathtaking purity and the stars were out again for the northern lights were fading the fifth successive flare was drifting steadily seawards it was at that they heard it the distant rumble of gunfire far to the south perhaps a minute after they had seen the incandescent brilliance of a burning flare on the run of the far horizon there could be no doubt as to what was happening the viking still in contact with the uboat although powerless to do anything about it was being heavily attacked and the attack must have been short sharp and deadly for the firing ceased soon after it had begun ominously nothing came through on the wt no one ever knew what had happened to the viking for there were no survivors the last echo of the vikings guns had barely died away before they heard the roar of the engines of the condor at maximum throttle in a shallow dive for five perhaps ten secondsit seemed longer than that but not long enough for any gun in the convoy to begin tracking him accuratelythe great fockewulf actually flew beneath his own flare and then was gone behind him the sky opened up in a blinding coruscation of flame more dazzling more hurtful than the light of the noonday sun so intense so extraordinary the power of those flares so much did pupils contract and eyelids narrow in instinctive selfprotection that the enemy bombers were through the circle of light and upon them before anyone fully realised what was happening the timing the splitsecond cooperation between marker planes and bombers were magnificent there were twelve planes in the first wave there was no concentration on one target as before not more than two attacked any ship turner watching from the bridge watching them swoop down steeply and level out before even the first gun in the ulysses had opened up caught his breath in sudden dismay there was something terribly familiar about the speed the approach the silhouette of these planes suddenly he had it heinkels by god heinkel s and the heinkel turner knew carried that weapon he dreaded above all others the glider bomb and then as if he had touched a master switch every gun on the ulysses opened up the air filled with smoke the pungent smell of burning cordite the din was indescribable and all at once turner felt fiercely strangely happy to hell with them and their glider bombs he thought this was war as he liked to fight it not the catandmouse hideandseek frustration of trying to outguess the hidden wolfpacks but war out in the open where he could see the enemy and hate him and love him for fighting as honest men should and do his damnedest to destroy him and turner knew if they could at all the crew of the ulysses would destroy him it needed no great sensitivity to direct the seachange that had overtaken his menyes his men now they no longer cared for themselves they had crossed the frontier of fear and found that nothing lay beyond it and they would keep on feeding their guns and squeezing their triggers until the enemy overwhelmed them the leading heinkel was blown out of the sky and fitting enough it was x turret that destroyed it x turret the turret of dead marines the turret that had destroyed the condor and was now manned by a scratch marine crew the heinkel behind lifted sharply to avoid the hurtling fragments of fuselage and engines dipped flashed past the cruisers bows less than a boatlength away banked steeply to port under maximum power and swung back in on the ulysses every gun on the ship was caught on the wrong foot and seconds passed before the first one was brought to beartime and to spare for the heinkel to angle in at drop his bomb and slew frantically away as the concentrated fire of the oerlikons and pompoms closed in on him miraculously he escaped the winged bomb was high but not high enough it wavered steadied dipped then glided forwards and downwards through the drifting smoke of the guns to strike home with a tremendous deafening explosion that shook the ulysses to her keel and almost shattered the eardrums of those on deck to turner looking aft from the bridge it seemed that the ulysses could never survive this last assault an extorpedo officer and explosives expert himself he was skilled in assessing the disruptive power of high explosive never before had he been so close to so powerful so devastating an explosion he had dreaded these glider bombs but even so he had underestimated their power the concussion had been double treble what he had been expecting what turner did not know was that what he had heard had been not one explosion but two but so nearly simultaneous as to be indistinguishable the glider bomb by a freakish chance had crashed directly into the port torpedo tubes there had been only one torpedo left there the other two had sent the vytura to the bottom and normally amatol the warhead explosive is extremely stable and inert even when subjected to violent shock but the bursting bomb had been too close too powerful sympathetic detonation had been inevitable damage was extensive and spectacular it was severe but not fatal the side of the ulysses had been ripped open as by a giant canopener almost to the waters edge the tubes had vanished the decks were holed and splintered the funnel casing was a shambles the funnel itself tilting over to port almost to fifteen degrees but the greatest energy of the explosion had been directed aft most of the blast expending itself over the open sea while the galley and canteen severely damaged already were no more than a devils scrapyard almost before the dust and debris of the explosion had settled the last of the heinkels was disappearing skimming the waves weaving and twisting madly in evasive action pursued and harried by a hundred glowing streams of tracer then magically they were gone and there was only the sudden deafening silence and the flares drooping slowly to extinction lighting up the pall above the ulysses the dark clouds of smoke rolling up from the shattered stirling and a tanker with its after superstructure almost gone but not one of the ships in fr had faltered or stopped and they had destroyed five heinkels a costly victory turner mused if it could be called a victory but he knew the heinkels would be back it was not difficult to imagine the fury the hurt pride of the high command in norway as far as turner knew no russian convoy had ever sailed so far south before riley eased a cramped leg stretched it gently so as to avoid the great spinning shaft carefully he poured some oil on to the bearing carefully so as not to disturb the engineer commander propped in sleep between the tunnel wall and rileys shoulder even as riley drew back dodson stirred opened heavy gummed lids good god above he said wearily you still here riley it was the first time either of them had spoken for hours its a good job i am here riley growled he nodded towards the bearing bloody difficult to get a firehose down to this place i should think that was unfair riley knew he and dodson had been taking it in halfhour turns to doze and feed the bearing but he felt he had to say something he was finding it increasingly difficult to keep on being truculent to the engineer commander dodson grinned to himself said nothing finally he cleared his throat murmured casually the tirpitz is taking its time about making its appearance dont you think yes sir riley was uncomfortable should a been here long ago damn her him dodson corrected absently admiral von tirpitz you know why dont you give up this foolishness riley riley grunted said nothing dodson sighed then brightened go and get some more coffee riley im parched no riley was blunt you get it as a favour riley dodson was very gentle im damned thirsty i oh all right the big stoker swore climbed painfully to his feet wherell i get it plenty in the engineroom if its not iced water theyre swigging its coffee but no iced water for me dodson shivered riley gathered up the thermos stumbled along the passage he had only gone a few feet when they felt the ulysses shudder under the recoil of the heavy armament although they did not know it it was the beginning of the air attack dodson braced himself against the wall saw riley do the same pause a second then hurry away in an awkward stumbling run there was something grotesquely familiar in that awkward run dodson thought the guns surged back again and the figure scuttled even faster like a giant crab in a panic panic dodson thought thats it panicstricken dont blame the poor bastardim beginning to imagine things myself down here again the whole tunnel vibrated more heavily this timethat must be x turret almost directly above no i dont blame him thank god hes gone he smiled quietly to himself i wont be seeing friend riley againhe isnt all that of a reformed character tiredly dodson settled back against the wall on my own at last he murmured to himself and waited for the feeling of relief but it never came instead there was only a vexation and loneliness a sense of desertion and a strangely empty disappointment riley was back inside a minute he came back with that same awkward crablike run carrying a threepint thermos jug and two cups cursing fluently and often as he slipped against the wall panting wordlessly he sat down beside dodson poured out a cup of steaming coffee why the hell did you have to come back dodson demanded harshly i dont want you and you wanted coffee riley interrupted rudely youve got the bloody stuff drink it at that instant the explosion and the vibration from the explosion in the port tubes echoed weirdly down the dark tunnel the shock flinging the two men heavily against each other his whole cup of coffee splashed over dodsons leg his mind was so tired his reactions so slow that his first realisation was of how damnably cold he was how chill that dripping tunnel the scalding coffee had gone right through his clothes but he could feel neither warmth nor wetness his legs were numbed dead below the knees then he shook his head looked up at riley what in gods name was that whats happening did you havent a clue didnt stop to ask riley stretched himself luxuriously blew on his steaming coffee then a happy thought struck him and a broad cheerful grin came as near to transforming that face as would ever be possible its probably the tirpitz he said hopefully three times more during that terrible night the german squadrons took off from the airfield at alta fjord throbbed their way nornorwest through the bitter arctic night over the heaving arctic sea in search of the shattered remnants of fr not that the search was difficultthe fockewulf condor stayed with them all night defied their best attempts to shake him off he seemed to have an endless supply of these deadly flares and might very well have beenin fact almost certainly wascarrying nothing else and the bombers had only to steer for the flares the first assault about was an orthodox bombing attack made from about feet the planes seemed to be dorniers but it was difficult to be sure because they flew high above a trio of flares sinking close to the water level as an attack it was almost but not quite abortive and was pressed home with no great enthusiasm this was understandable the barrage was intense but there were two direct hits one on a merchantman blowing away most of the focsle the other on the ulysses it sheered through the flag deck and the admirals day cabin and exploded in the heart of the sick bay the sick bay was crowded with the sick and dying and for many that bomb must have come as a godsent release for the ulysses had long since run out of anaesthetics there were no survivors among the dead was marshall the torpedo officer johnson the leading sba the masteratarms who had been lightly wounded an hour before by a splinter from the torpedo tubes burgess strapped helplessly in a straitjackethe had suffered concussion on the night of the great storm and gone insane brown whose hip had been smashed by the hatch cover of y magazine and brierley who was dying anyway his lungs saturated and rotted away with fuel oil brooks had not been there the same explosion had also shattered the telephone exchange barring only the bridgegun phones and the bridgeengine phones and speakingtubes all communication lines in the ulysses were gone the second attack at am was made by only six bombers heinkels again carrying gliderbombs obviously flying strictly under orders they ignored the merchantmen and concentrated their attack solely on the cruisers it was an expensive attack the enemy lost all but two of their force in exchange for a single hit aft on the stirling a hit which tragically put both after guns out of action turner redeyed and silent bareheaded in that subzero wind and pacing the shattered bridge of the ulysses marvelled that the stirling still floated still fought back with everything she had and then he looked at his own ship less a ship he thought wearily than a floating shambles of twisted a steel still scything impossibly through those heavy seas and i marvelled all the more broken burning cruisers cruisers ravaged and devastated to the point of destruction were nothing new for turner he had seen the trinidad and the edinburgh being literally battered to death on these same russian convoys but he had never seen any ship at any time take such inhuman murderous punishment as the ulysses and the obsolete stirling and still live he would not have believed it possible the third attack came just before dawn it came with the grey halflight an attack carried out with great courage and the utmost determination by fifteen heinkel gldderbombers again the cruisers were the sole targets the heavier attack by far being directed against the ulysses far from shirking the challenge and bemoaning their illluck the crew of the ulysses that strange and selfless crew of walking zombies whom nicholls had left behind welcomed the enemy gladly even joyfully for how can one kill an enemy if he does not come to you fear anxiety the nearcertainty of deaththese did not exist home and country families wives and sweethearts were names only names they touched a mans mind these thoughts touched it and lifted and were gone as if they had never been tell them vallery had said tell them they are the best crew god ever gave a captain vallery that was what mattered that and what vallery had stood for that something that had been so inseparably a part of that good and kindly man that you never saw it because it was vallery and the crew hoisted the shells slammed the breeches and squeezed their triggers men uncaring men oblivious of anything and everything except the memory of the man who had died apologising because he had let them down except the sure knowledge that they could not let vallery down zombies but inspired zombies men above themselves as men commonly are when they know the next step the inevitable step has them clear to the top of the far side of the valley the first part of the attack was launched against the stirling turner saw two heinkels roaring in in a shallow dive improbably surviving against heavy concentrated fire at pointblank range the bombs delayed action and armourpiercing struck the stirling amidships just below deck level and exploded deep inside in the boilerroom and engineroom the next three bombers were met with only pompom and lewis fire the main armament forard had fallen silent with sick apprehension turner realised what had happened the explosion had cut the power to the turrets ruthlessly contemptuously almost the bombers brushed aside the puny opposition every bomb went home the stirling turner saw was desperately wounded she was on fire again and listing heavily to starboard the suddenly lifting crescendo of aero engines spun turner round to look to his own ship there were five heinkels in the first wave at different heights and approach angles so as to break up the pattern of aa fire but all converging on the after end of the ulysses there was so much smoke and noise that turner could only gather confused broken impressions suddenly it seemed the air was filled with gliderbombs and the tearing staccato crash of the german cannon and guns one bomb exploded in midair just forard of the after funnel and feet away from it a maiming murderous storm of jagged steel scythed across the boatdeck and all oerlikons and the pompoms fell immediately silent their crews victim to shrapnel or concussion another plunged through the deck and engineers flat and turned the wt office into a charnel house the remaining two that struck were higher smashing squarely into x gundeck and x turret the turret was split open around the top and down both sides as by a giant cleaver and blasted off its mounting to lie grotesquely across the shattered poop apart from the boatdeck and turret gunners only one other man lost his life in that attack but that man was virtually irreplaceable shrapnel from the first bomb had burst a compressed air cylinder in the torpedo workshop and hartley the man who above all had become the backbone of the ulysses had taken shelter there only seconds before the ulysses was running into dense black smoke now the stirling was heavily on fire her fuel tanks gone what happened in the next ten minutes no one ever knew in the smoke and flame and agony they were moments borrowed from hell and men could only endure suddenly the ulysses was out in the clear and the heinkels all bombs gone were harrying her attacking her incessantly with cannon and machinegun ravening wolves with their victim on its knees desperate to finish it off but still here and there a gun fired on the ulysses just below the bridge for instancethere was a gun firing there turner risked a quick glance over the side saw the gunner pumping his tracers into the path of a swooping heinkel and then the heinkel opened up and turner flung himself back knocking the kapok kid to the deck then the bomber was gone and the guns were silent slowly turner hoisted himself to his feet peered over the side the gunner was dead his harness cut to ribbons he heard a scuffle behind him saw a slight figure fling off a restraining hand and climb to the edge of the bridge for an instant turner saw the pale staring face of chrysler chrysler who had neither smiled nor even spoken since they had opened up the asdic cabinet at the same time he saw three heinkels forming up to starboard for a fresh attack get down you young fool turner shouted do you want to commit suicide chrysler looked at him eyes wide and devoid of recognition looked away and dropped down to the sponson below turner lifted himself to the edge of the bridge and looked down chrysler was struggling with all his slender strength struggling in a strange and frightening silence to drag the dead man from his oerlikon cockpit somehow with a series of convulsive despairing jerks he had him over the side had laid him gently to the ground and was climbing into the cockpit his hand turner saw was bare and bleeding stripped to the raw fleshthen out of the corner of his eyes he saw the flame of the heinkeps guns and flung himself backward one second passed two three three seconds during which cannon shells and bullets smashed against the reinforced armour of the bridge then as a man in a daze he heard the twin oerlikons opening up the boy must have held his fire to the very last moment six shots the oerlikon firedonly six and a great grey shape stricken and smoking hurtled over the bridge barely at head height sheared off its port wing on the director tower and crashed into the sea on the other side chrysler was still sitting in the cockpit his right hand was clutching his left shoulder a shoulder smashed and shattered by a cannon shell trying hopelessly to stem the welling arterial blood even as the next bomber straightened out on its strafing run even as he flung himself backwards turner saw the mangled bloody hand reach out for the trigger grip again flat on the duckboards beside carrington and the kapok kid turner pounded his fist on the deck in terrible frustration of anger he thought of starr the man who had brought all this upon them and hated him as he would never have believed he could hate anybody he could have killed him then he thought of chrysler of the excruciating hell of that gunrest pounding into that shattered shoulder of brown eyes glazed and shocked with pain and grief if he himself lived turner swore he would recommend that boy for the victoria cross abruptly the firing ceased and a heinkel swung off sharply to starboard smoke pouring from both its engines quickly together with the kapok kid turner scrambled to his feet hoisted himself over the side of the bridge he did it without looking and he almost died then a burst of fire from the third and last heinkelthe bridge was always the favourite targetwhistled past his head and shoulders he felt the wind of their passing fan his cheek and hair then winded from the convulsive backthrust that had sent him there he was stretched full length on the duckboards again they were only inches from his eyes these duckboards but he could not see them all he could see was the image of chrysler a gaping wound the size of a mans hand in his back slumped forward across the oerlikons the weight of his body tilting the barrels grotesquely skywards both barrels had still been firing were still firing would keep on firing until the drums were empty for the dead boys hand was locked across the trigger gradually one by one the guns of the convoy fell silent the clamour of the aero engines began to fade in the distance the attack was over turner rose to his feet slowly and heavily this time he looked over the side of the bridge stared down into the oerlikon gunpit then looked away bis lace expressionless behind him he heard someone coughing it was a strange bubbling kind of cough turner whirled round then stood stockstill his hands clenched tightly at his sides the kapok kid with carrington kneeling helplessly at his side was sitting quietly on the boards his back propped against the legs of the admirals chair from left groin to right shoulder through the middle of the embroidered j on the chest stretched a neat straight evenlyspaced pattern of round holes stitched in by the machinegun of the heinkel the blast of the shells must have hurtled him right across the bridge turner stood absolutely still the kid he knew with sudden sick certainly had only seconds to live he felt that any sudden move on his part would snap the spunsilk thread that held him on to life gradually the kapok kid became aware of his presence of his steady gaze and looked up tiredly the vivid blue of bis eyes was dulled already the face white and drained of blood idly his hand strayed up and down the punctured kapok fingering the gashes suddenly he smiled looked down at the quilted suit ruined he whispered bloody well ruined then the wandering hand slipped down to his side palm upward and his head slumped forward on his chest the flaxen hair stirred idly in the wind chapter seventeen sunday morning the stirling died at dawn she died while still under way still plungjng through the heavy seas her mangled twisted bridge and superstructure glowing red glowing whitehot as the wind and sundered oil tanks lashed the flames into an incandescent holocaust a strange and terrible sight but not unique thus the bismarck had looked whitely incandescent just before the shropshires torpedoes had sent her to the bottom the stirling would have died anywaybut the stukas made siccar the northern lights had long since gone now too the clear skies were going and dark cloud was banking heavily to the north men hoped and prayed that the cloud would spread over fr and cover it with blanketing snow but the stukas got there first the stukas the dreaded gullwinged junkers divebombers came from the south flew high over the convoy turned flew south again level with and due west of the ulysses rear ship in the convoy they started to turn once more then abruptly in the classic stuka attack pattern they peeled off in sequence port wings dipping sharply as they halfrolled turned and fell out of the sky plummetting arrowtrue for their targets any plane that hurtles down in undeviating dive on waiting gun emplacements has never a chance thus spoke the pundits the instructors in the gunnery school of whale island and proceeded to prove to their own satisfaction the evident truth of their statement using aa guns and duplicating the situation which would arise insofar as it lay within their power unfortunately they couldnt duplicate the stuka unfortunately because in actual battle the stuka was the only factor in the situation that really mattered one had only to crouch behind a gun to listen to the earpiercing screaming whistle of the stuka in its nearvertical dive to flinch from its hail of bullets as it loomed larger and larger in the sights to know that nothing could now arrest the flight of that underslung bomb to appreciate the truth of that hundreds of men alive todaythe lucky ones who endured and survived a stuka attackwill readily confirm that the war produced nothing quite so nerverending quite so demoralising as the sight and sound of those junkers with the strange dihedral of the wings in the last seconds before they pulled out of their dive but one time in a hundred maybe one time in a thousand when the human factor of the man behind the gun ceased to operate the pundits could be right this was the thousandth time for fear was a phantom that had vanished in the night ranged against the divebombers were only one multiple pompom and half a dozen oerlikonsthe forard turrets could not be brought to bearbut these were enough and more in the hands of men inhumanly calm icecool as the polar wind itself and filled with an almost dreadful singleness of purpose three stukas in almost as many seconds were clawed out of the sky two to crash harmlessly in the sea a third to bury itself with tremendous impact in the already shattered day cabin of the admiral the chances against the petrol tanks not erupting in searing flame or of the bomb not exploding were so remote as not to exist but neither happened it hardly seemed to call for commentin extremity courage becomes routinewhen the bearded doyle abandoned his pompom scrambled up to the focsle deck and flung himself on top of the armed bomb rolling heavily in scuppers awash with per cent octane petrol one tiny spark from doyles boot or from the twisted broken steel of the stuka rubbing and grinding against the superstructure would have been trigger enough the contact fuse in the bomb was still undamaged and as it slipped and skidded over the icebound deck with doyle hanging desperately on it seemed animistically determined to smash its delicate percussion nose against a bulkhead or stanchion if doyle thought of these things he did not care coolly almost carelessly he kicked off the only retaining clip left on a broken section of the guardrail slid the bomb fins first over the edge tipped the nose sharply to clear the detonator the bomb fell harmlessly into the sea it fell into the sea just as the first bomb sliced contemptuously through the useless oneinch deck armour of the stirling and crashed into the engineroom three four five six other bombs buried themselves in the dying heart of the cruiser the lightened stukas lifting away sharply to port and starboard from the bridge of the ulysses there seemed to be a weird unearthly absence of noise as the bombs went home they just vanished into the smoke and flame engulfed by the inferno no one blow finished the stirling but a mounting accumulation of blows she had taken too much and she could take no more she was like a reeling boxer a boxer overmatched against an unskilled but murderous opponent sinking under an avalanche of blows stonyfaced bitter beyond words at his powerlessness turner watched her die funny he thought tiredly shes like all the rest cruisers he mused in a queerly detached abstraction must be the toughest ships in the world hed seen many go but none easily cleanly spectacularly no sudden knockout no coup de grace for themalways always they had to be battered to death like the stirling turners grip on the shattered windscreen tightened till his forearms ached to him to all good sailors a wellloved ship was a wellloved friend for fifteen months now the old and valiant stirling had been their faithful shadow had shared the burden of the ulysses in the worst convoys of the war she was the last of the old guard for only the ulysses had been longer on the blackout run it was not good to watch a friend die turner looked away stared down at the icecovered duckboards between his feet his head sunk between hunched shoulders he could close his eyes but he could not close his ears he winced hearing the monstrous roaring hiss of boiling water and steam as the whitehot superstructure of the stirling plunged deeply into the icechilled artie for fifteen twenty seconds that dreadful agonised sibilation continued then stopped in an dnstant the sound sheared off as by a guillotine when turner looked up slowly there was only the rolling empty sea ahead the big oilslicked bubbles rising to the top bubbles rising only to be punctured as they broke the surface by the fine rain falling back into the sea from the great clouds of steam already condensing in that bitter cold the stirling was gone and the battered remnants of fr pitched and plunged steadily onwards to the north there were seven ships left nowthe four merchantmen including the commodores ship the tanker the sirrus and the ulysses none of them was whole all were damaged heavily damaged but none so desperately hurt as the ulysses seven ships only seven thirtysix had set out for russia at turner signalled the sirrus wt gone signal cinc course speed position confirm as rendezvous code the reply came exactly an hour later delayed heavy seas rendezvous approx impossible fly off air cover keep coming cinc keep coming turner repeated savagely would you listen to him keep coming he says what the hell does he expect us to doscuttle ourselves he shook his head in angry despair i hate to repeat myself he said bitterly but i must too bloody late as usual heavy grey clouds formless and menacing blotted out the sky from horizon to horizon they were snow clouds and please god the snow would soon fall that could save them now that and that alone but the snow did not comenot then once more there came instead the stukas the roar of their engines rising and falling as they methodically quartered the empty sea in search of the convoycharlie had left at dawn but it was only a matter of time before the divebomber squadron found ffie tiny convoy ten minutes from the time of the first warning of their approach the leading junkers tipped over its wing and dropped out of the sky ten minutes but time for a council and plan of desperation when the stukas came they found the convoy stretched out in line abreast the tanker varella in the middle two merchantmen in close line ahead on either side of it the sirrus and the ulysses guarding the flanks a suicidal formation in submarine watersa torpedo from port or starboard could hardly miss them all but weather conditions were heavily against submarines and the formation offered at least a fighting chance against the stukas if they approached from asterntheir favourite attack techniquethey would run into the simultaneous massed fire of seven ships if they approached from the sides they must first attack the escorts for no stuka would present its unprotected underbelly to the guns of a warship they elected to attack from either side five from the east four from the west this time turner noted they were carrying longrange fuel tanks turner had no time to see how the sirrus was faring indeed he could hardly see how his own ship was faring for thick acrid smoke was blowing back across the bridge from the barrels of a and b turrets in the gaps of sound between the crash of the s he could hear the quickfire of doyles midship pompom the vicious thudding of the oeklikons suddenly startling in its breathtaking unexpectedness two great beams of dazzling white stabbed out through the mirk and gloom turner stared then bared his teeth in fierce delight the inch searchlights i of course the great scharnhorst and not the tirpitz it never caught the great ship she was destroyed at her anchorage in alta fjord by lancaster bombers of the royal air force searchlights still on the official secret list capable of lighting up an enemy six miles away what a fool he had been to forget them vallery had used them often in daylight and in dark against attacking aircraft no man could look into those terrible eyes those flaming arcs across the electrodes and not be blinded blinking against the eyewatering smoke turner peered aft to see who was manning the control position but he knew who it was before he saw him it could only be ralston searchlight control turner remembered was his day action station besides he could think of no one other than the big blond torpedoman with the gumption the quick intelligence to burn the lamps on his own initiative jammed in the corner of the bridge by the gate turner watched him he forgot his ship forgot even the bombers he personally could do nothing about them anyway as he stared in fascination at the man behind the controls his eyes were glued to the sights his face expressionless absolutely but for the gradual stiffening of back and neck as the sight dipped in docile response to the delicate caress of his fingers on the wheel he might have been carved from marble the immobility of the face the utter concentration was almost frightening there was not a flicker of feeling or emotion never a flicker as the first stuka weaved and twisted in maddened torment seeking to escape that eyestaring flame not even a flicker as it swerved violently in its dive pulled out too late and crashed into the sea a hundred yards short of the ulysses what was the boy thinking of turner wondered his mother his sisters entombed under the ruins of a croydon bungalow of his brother innocent victim of that mutiny how impossible that mutiny seemed nowin scapa flow of his father dead by his sons own hand turner did not know could not even begin to guess clairvoyantiy almost he knew that it was too late that no one would ever know now the face was inhumanly still there wasnt a shadow of feeling as the second stuka overshot the ulysses dropped its bomb into the open sea not a shadow as a third blew up in midair not a trace of emotion when the guns of the next stuka smashed one of the lights not even when the cannon shells of the last smashed the searchlight control tore half his chest away he died instantaneously stood there a moment as if unwilling to abandon his post then slumped back quietly on to the deck turner bent over the dead boy looked at the face the eyes upturned to the first feathery flakes of falling snow the eyes the face were still the same masklike expressionless turner shivered and looked away one bomb and one only had struck the ulysses it had struck the focsle deck just forard of a turret there had been no casualties but some freak of vibration and shock had fractured the turrets hydaulic lines temporarily at least b was the only effective remaining turret in the ship the sirrus hadnt been quite so lucky she had destroyed one stukathe merchantmen had claimed anotherand had been hit twice both bombs exploding in the after messdeck the sirrus overloaded with survivors was carrying double her normal complement of men and usually that messdeck would have been crowded during action stations it was empty not a man had lost his lifenot a man was to lose his life on the destroyer sirrus she was never damaged again on the russian convoys hope was rising rising fast less than an hour to go now and the battle squadron would be there it was dark dark with the gloom of an arctic storm and heavy snow was falling hissing gently into the dark and rolling sea no plane could find them in thisand they were almost beyond the reach of shorebased aircraft except of course for the condors and it was almost impossible weather for submarines it may be we shall touch the happy isles carrington quoted softly what turner looked up baffled what did you say number one tennyson carrington was apologetic the captain was always quoting him maybe well make it yet maybe maybe turner was noncommittal preston yes sir i see it preston was staring to the north where the signal lamp of the sirrus was flickering rapidly a ship sir he reported excitedly sirrus says naval vessel approaching from the north from the north thank god thank god turner shouted exultantly from the north it must be them theyre ahead of time i take it all back can you see anything number one not a thing sir too thickbut its clearing a bit i think theres the sirrus again what does she say preston turner asked anxiously contact sub contact green closing contact at this late hour turner groaned then smashed his fist down on the binnacle he swore fiercely by god shes not going to stop us now preston signal the sirrus to stay he broke off looked incredulously to the north up there in the snow and gloom stilettos of white flame had lanced out briefly vanished again carrington by his side now he stared unwinkingly north saw shells splashing whitely in the water under the bows of the commodores ship the cape hatteras then he saw the flashes again stronger brighter this time flashes that lit up for a fleeting second the bows and superstructure of the ship that was firing he turned slowly to find that carrington too had turned was gazing at him with set face and bitter eyes turner grey and haggard with exhaustion and the sour foretaste of ultimate defeat looked in turn at his first lieutenant in a long moment of silence the answer to many questions he said softly thats why theyve been softening up the stirling and ourselves for the past couple of days the fox is in among the chickens its our old pal the hipper cruiser come to pay us a social call it is so near and yet turner shrugged we deserved better than this he grinned crookedly how would you like to die a heros death the very idea appals me boomed a voice behind him brooks had just arrived on the bridge me too turner admitted he smiled he was almost happy again have we any option gentlemen alas no brooks said sadly full ahead both carrington called down the speakingtube it was by way of his answer no no turner chided gently full power number one tell them were in a hurry remind them of the boasts they used to make about the abdiel and the manxman preston general emergency signal scatter proceed independently to russian ports the upper deck was thick with freshly fallen snow and the snow was still falling the wind was rising again and after the warmth of the canteen where he had been operating it struck at johnny nichollss lungs with sudden searing pain the temperature he guessed must be about zero he buried his face in his duffel coat climbed laboriously haltingly up the ladders to the bridge he was tired deadly weary and he winced in agony every time his foot touched the deck his splinted left leg was shattered just above the ankleshrapnel from the bomb in the after messdeck peter orr commander of the sirrus was waiting for him at the gate of the tiny bridge i thought you might like to see this doc the voice was strangely highpitched for so big a man rather i thought you would want to see this he corrected himself look at her go he breathed just look at her go nicholls looked out over the port side half a mile away on the beam the cape hatteras was blazing furiously slowing to a stop some miles to the north through the falling snow he could barely distinguish the vague shape of the german cruiser a shape pinpointed by the flaming guns still mercilessly pumping shells into the sinking ship every shot went home the accuracy of their gunnery was fantastic half a mile astern on the port quarter the ulysses was coming up she was sheeted in foam and spray the bows leaping almost clear of the water then crashing down with a pistolshot impact easily heard even against the wind on the bridge of the sirrus as the great engines thrust her through the water faster faster with the passing of every second nicholls gazed fascinated this was the first time hed seen the ulysses since hed left her and he was appalled the entire upperworks fore and aft were a twisted unbelievable shambles of broken steel both masts were gone the smokestacks broken and bent the director tower shattered and grotesquely askew smoke was still pluming up from the great holes in focsle and poop the after turrets wrenched from their mountings pitched crazily on the deck the skeleton of the condor still lay athwart y turret a stuka was buried to the wings in the focsle deck and she was he knew split right down to the water level abreast the torpedo tubes the ulysses was something out of a nightmare steadying himself against the violent pitching of the destroyer nicholls stared and stared numbed with horror and disbelief orr looked at him looked away as a messenger came to the bridge rendezvous he read good lord minutes time do you hear that doc minutes time yes sir nicholls said absently he hadnt heard him orr looked at him touched his arm pointed to the ulysses bloody well incredible isnt it he murmured i wish to god i was aboard her nicholls muttered miserably why did they send me look whats that a huge flag a flag twenty feet in length was streaming out below the yardarm of the ulysses stretched taut in the wind of its passing nicholls had never seen anything remotely like it the flag was enormous red and blue and whiter than the driving snow the battle ensign orr murmured bill turners broken out the battle ensign he shook his head in wonder to take time off to do that nowwell doc only turner would do that you know him well nicholls nodded silently me too orr said simply we are both lucky men the sirus was still doing fifteen knots still headed for the enemy when the ulysses passed them by a cablelength away as if they were stopped in the water long afterwards nicholls could never describe it all accurately he had a hazy memory of the ulysses no longer plunging and lifting but battering through waves and troughs on a steady even keel the deck angling back sharply from a rearing forefoot to the counter buried deep in the water fifteen feet below the great boiling tortured sea of white that arched up in seething magnificence above the shattered poopdeck he could recall too that b turret was firing continuously shell after shell screaming away through the blinding snow to burst in brilliant splendour over and on the german cruiser for b turret had only starshells left he carried too a vague mental picture of turner waving ironically from the bridge of the great ensign streaming stiffly astern already torn and tattered at the edges but what he could never forget what he would hear in his heart and mind as long as he lived was the tremendous frightening roar of the great boilerroom intake fans as they sucked in mighty draughts of air for the starving engines for the ulysses was driving through the heavy seas under maximum power at a speed that should have broken her shuddering back should have burnt out the great engines there was no doubt as to turners intentions he was going to ram the enemy to destroy him and take him with him at a speed of just on or over forty incredible knots nicholls gazed and gazed and did not know what to think he felt sick at heart for that ship was part of him now his good friends especially the kapok kidfor he did not know that the kid was already deadthey too were part of him and it is always terrible to see the end of a legend to see it die to see it going into the gulfs but he felt too a strange exultation she was dying but what a way to die and if ships had hearts had souls as the old sailing men declared surely the ulysses would want it this way too she was still doing forty knots when as if by magic a great gaping hole appeared in her bows just above the waterline shellfire possibly but unlikely at that angle it must have been a torpedo from the uboat not yet located a sudden dip of the bows could have coincided with the upthrust of a heavy sea forcing a torpedo to the surface such things had happened before rarely but they happened the ulysses brushed aside the torpedo ignored the grievous wound ignored the heavy shells crashing into her and kept on going she was still doing forty knots driving in under the guns of the enemy guns at maximum depression when a magazine blew up blasted off the entire bows in one shattering detonation for a second the lightened focsle reared high into the air then it plunged down deep down into the shoulder of a rolling sea she plunged down and kept on going down driving down to the black floor of the arctic driven down by the madly spinning screws the still thundering engines her own executioner chapter eighteen epilogue the air was warm and kind and still the sky was blue a deep and wonderful blue with little puffs of cottonwool cloud drifting lazily to the far horizon the streetgardens the hanging birdcage flowerbaskets spilled over with blue and yellow and red and gold all the delicate pastel shades and tints he had almost forgotten had ever existed every now and then an old man or a hurrying housewife or a young man with a laughing girl on his arm would stop to admire them then walk on again the better for having seen them the nesting birds were singing clear and sweet above the distant roar of the traffic and big ben was booming the hour as johnny nicholls climbed awkwardly out of the taxi paid off the driver and hobbled slowly up the marble steps his face carefully expressionless the sentry saluted opened the heavy swing door nicholls passed inside looked around the huge hall saw that both sides were lined with heavy imposing doors at the far end beneath the great curve of the stairs and overhanging the widely convex counter of the type usually found in banks hung a sign typist pool inquiries the tiptap of the crutches sounded unnaturally loud on the marble floor as he limped over to the counter very touching and melodramatic nicholls he thought dispassionately trust the audience are having their moneys worth half a dozen typists had stopped work as if by command were staring at him in open curiosity hands resting limply on their machines a trim young wren redhaired an shirtsleeved came to the counter can i help you sir the quiet voice the blue eyes were soft with concern nicholls catching a glimpse of himself in a mirror behind her a glimpse of a scuffed uniform jacket over a grey fishermans jersey of blurred sunken eyes and gaunt pale cheeks admitted wryly to himself that he couldnt blame her he didnt have to be a doctor to know that he was in pretty poor shape my name is nicholls surgeonlieutenant nicholls i have an appointment lieutenant nicholls hms ulysses the girl drew in her breath sharply of course sir theyre expecting you nicholls looked at her looked at the wrens sitting motionless in their chairs caught the intense wondering expression in their eyes the awed gaze with which one would regard beings from another planet it made him feel vaguely uncomfortable upstairs i suppose he hadnt meant to sound so brusque no sir the wren came quietly round the counter theywell they heard youd been wounded sir she murmured apologetically just across the hall here please she smiled at him slowed her step to match his halting walk she knocked held open the door announced him to someone he couldnt see and closed the door softly behind him when he had passed through there were three men in the room the one man he recognised viceadmiral starr came forward to meet him he looked older far older far more tired than when nicholls had last seen himhardly a fortnight previously how are you nicholls he asked not walking so well i see under the assurance the thin joviality so flat and misplaced the harsh edge of strain burred unmistakably come and sit down he led nicholls across to the table long big and covered with leather behind the table framed against huge wallmaps sat two men starr introduced them one big beefy red of face was in full uniform the sleeves ablaze with the broad band and four stripes of an admiral of the fleet the other was a civilian a small stocky man with irongrey hair eyes still and wise and old nicholls recognised him immediately would have known anyway from the deference of both the admirals he reflected wryly that the navy was indeed doing him proud such receptions were not for all but they seemed reluctant to begin the reception nicholls thoughthe had forgotten the shock his appearance must give finally the greyhaired man cleared his throat hows the leg boy he asked looks pretty bad to me his voice was low but alive with controlled authority not too bad thank you sir nicholls answered two three weeks should see me back on the job youre taking two months laddie said the greyhaired man quietly more if you want it he smiled faintly if anyone asks just tell em i said so cigarette he flicked the big tablelighter sat back in his chair temporarily he seemed at a loss as to what to say next then he looked up abruptly had a good trip home very fair sir vip treatment all the way moscow teheran cairo gib nichollss mouth twisted much more comfortable than the trip out he paused inhaled deeply on his cigarette looked levelly across the table i would have preferred to come home in the sirrus no doubt starr broke in acidly but we cannot afford to cater for the personal prejudices of all and sundry we were anxious to have a firsthand account of frand particularly the ulyssesas soon as possible nichollss hands clenched on the edge of his chair the anger had leapt in him like a flame and he knew that the man opposite was watching closely slowly he relaxed looked at the greyhaired man interrogative eyebrows mutely asking confirmation the greyhaired man nodded just tell us all you know he said kindly everything about everything take your time from the beginning nicholls asked in a low voice from the beginning nicholls told them he would have liked to tell the story right as it fell out from the convoy before fr straight through to the end he did his best but it was a halting story strangely lacking in conviction the atmosphere the surroundings were wrong the contrast between the peaceful warmth of these rooms and the inhuman cold and cruelty of the arctic was an immense gulf that could be bridged only by experience and understanding down here in the heart of london the wild incredible tale he had to tell fell falsely incredibly even on his own ears halfway through he looked at his listeners almost gave up incredulity no it wasnt thatat least not with the greyhaired man and the admiral of the fleet just a baffled incomprehension an honest failure to understand it wasnt so bad when he stuck to the ascertainable facts the facts of carriers crippled by seas of carriers mined stranded and torpedoed the facts of the great storm of the desperate struggle to survive the facts of the gradual attrition of the convoy of the terrible dying of the two gasoline tankers of the uboats and bombers sent to the bottom of the ulysses battering through the snowstorm at knots blown up by the german cruiser of the arrival of the battle squadron of the flight of the cruiser before it could inflict further damage of the roundingup of the scattered convoy of the curtain of russian fighters in the barents sea of the ultimate arrival in the kola inlet of the battered remnants of frfive ships in all it was when he came to less readily ascertainable facts to statements that could never be verified at all that he sensed the doubt the something more than wonder he told the story as calmly as unemotionally as he could the story of ralston ralston of the fighting lights and the searchlights of his father and family of riley the ringleader of the mutiny and his refusal to leave the shaft tunnel of petersen who had killed a marine and gladly given his own life of mcquater and chrysler and doyle and a dozen others for a second his own voice broke uncertainly as he told the story of the halfdozen survivors from the ulysses picked up by the sirrus soon afterwards he told how brooks had given his lifejacket to an ordinary seaman who amazingly survived fifteen minutes in that water how turner wounded in head and arm had supported a dazed spicer till the sirrus came plunging alongside had passed a bowline round him and was gone before anything could be done how carrington that enduring man of iron a baulk of splintered timber under his arms had held two men above water till rescue came both menpreston was onehad died later carrington had climbed the rope unaided clambered over the guardrails dangling a leftleg with the foot blown off above the ankle carrington would survive carrington was indestructible finally doyle too was gone they had thrown him a rope but he had not seen it for he was blind but what the three men really wanted to know nicholls realised was how the ulysses had been how a crew of mutineers had borne themselves he had told them he knew things of wonder and of splendour and they could not reconcile these with men who would take up arms against their own ship in effect against their own king so nicholls tried to tell them then knew as he tried that he could never tell them for what was there to tell that vallery had spoken to the men over the broadcast system how he had gone among them and made them almost as himself on that grim exhausting tour of inspection how he had spoken of them as he died and how most of all his death had made them men again for that was all that there was to tell and these things were just nothing at all with sudden insight nicholls saw that the meaning of that strange transformation of the men of the ulysses a transformation of bitter broken men to men above themselves could neither be explained nor understood for all the meaning was in vallery and vallery was dead nicholls felt tired now desperately so he knew he was far from well his mind was cloudy hazy in retrospect and he was mixing things up his sense of chronological time was gone he was full of hesitations and uncertainties suddenly he was overwhelmed by the futility of it all and he broke off slowly his voice trailing into silence vaguely he heard the greyhaired man ask something in a quiet voice and he muttered aloud unthinking what was that what did you say the greyhaired man was looking at him strangely the face of the admiral behind the table was impassive starrs he saw was open in disbelief i only said they were the best crew god ever gave a captain nicholls murmured i see the old tired eyes looked at him steadily but there was no other comment fingers drumming on the table he looked slowly at the two admirals then back to nicholls again take things easy for a minute boy if youll just excuse us he rose to his feet walked slowly over to the big bay windows at the other end of the long room the others following nicholls made no move did not even look after them he sat slumped in the chair looking dejectedly unseeingly at the crutches on the floor between his feet from time to time he could hear a murmur of voices starrs highpitched voice carried most clearly mutiny ship sir never the same again better this way there was a murmured reply too low to catch then he heard starr saying finished as a fighting unit the greyhaired man said something rapidly his tone sharp with disagreement but the words were blurred then the deep heavy voice of the fleet admiral said something about expiation and the greyhaired man nodded slowly then starr looked at him over his shoulder and nicholls knew they were talking about him he thought he heard the words not well and frightful strain but perhaps he was imagining it anyway he no longer cared he was anxious for one thing only and that was to be gone he felt an alien in an alien land and whether they believed him or not no longer mattered he did not belong here where everything was so sane and commonplace and realand withal a world of shadows he wondered what the kapok kid would have said had he been here and smiled in fond reminiscence the language would have been terrible the comments rich and barbed and pungent then he wondered what vallery would have said and he smiled again at the simplicity of it all for vallery would have said do not judge them for they do not understand gradually he became aware that the murmuring had ceased that the three men were standing above him his smile faded and he looked up slowly to see them looking down strangely at him their eyes full of concern im damnably sorry boy the greyhaired man said sincerely youre a sick man and weve asked far too much of you a drink nicholls it was most remiss no thank you sir nicholls straightened himself in his chair ill be perfectly all right he hesitated is is there anything else no nothing at all the smile was genuine friendly youve been a great help to us lieutenant a great help and a fine report thank you very much indeed a liar and a gentleman nicholls thought gratefully he struggled to his feet reached out for his crutches he shook hands with starr and the admiral of the fleet and said goodbye the greyhaired man accompanied him to the door his hand beneath nichollss arm at the door nicholls paused sorry to bother you butwhen do i begin my leave sir as from now the other said emphatically and have a good time god knows youve earned it my boy where are you going henley sir henley i could have sworn you were scots i am siri have no family oh a girl lieutenant nicholls nodded silently the greyhaired man clapped him on the shoulder and smiled gently pretty ill be bound nicholls looked at him looked away to where the sentry was already holding open the street doors and gathered up his crutches i dont know sir he said quietly i dont know at all ive never seen her he tiptapped his way across the marble flags passed through the heavy doors and limped out into the sunshine the end
