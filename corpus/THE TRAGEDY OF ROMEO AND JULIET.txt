the fairies midwife and she comes in shape no bigger than an agate stone on the forefinger of an alderman drawn with a team of little atomies athwart mens noses as they lie asleep her wagon spokes made of long spinners legs the cover of the wings of grasshoppers her traces of the smallest spiders web her collars of the moonshines watry beams her whip of crickets bone the lash of film her wagoner a small greycoated gnat not half so big as a round little worm prickd from the lazy finger of a maid her chariot is an empty hazelnut made by the joiner squirrel or old grub time out o mind the fairies coachmakers and in this state she gallops night by night through lovers brains and then they dream of love oer courtiers knees that dream on cursies straight oer lawyers fingers who straight dream on fees oer ladies lips who straight on kisses dream which oft the angry mab with blisters plagues because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are sometime she gallops oer a courtiers nose and then dreams he of smelling out a suit and sometime comes she with a tithepigs tail tickling a parsons nose as a lies asleep then dreams he of another benefice sometimes she driveth oer a soldiers neck and then dreams he of cutting foreign throats of breaches ambuscadoes spanish blades of healths five fadom deep and then anon drums in his ear at which he starts and wakes and being thus frighted swears a prayer or two and sleeps again this is that very mab that plats the manes of horses in the night and bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs which once untangled much misfortune bodes this is the hag when maids lie on their backs that presses them and learns them first to bear making them women of good carriage this is she rom peace peace mercutio peace thou talkst of nothing mer true i talk of dreams which are the children of an idle brain begot of nothing but vain fantasy which is as thin of substance as the air and more inconstant than the wind who wooes even now the

do least yet most suspected as the time and place doth make against me of this direful murther and here i stand both to impeach and purge myself condemned and myself excusd prince then say it once what thou dost know in this friar i will be brief for my short date of breath is not so long as is a tedious tale romeo there dead was husband to that juliet and she there dead that romeos faithful wife i married them and their stoln marriage day was tybalts doomsday whose untimely death banishd the newmade bridegroom from this city for whom and not for tybalt juliet pind you to remove that siege of grief from her betrothd and would have married her perforce to county paris then comes she to me and with wild looks bid me devise some mean to rid her from this second marriage or in my cell there would she kill herself then gave i her so tutored by my art a sleeping potion which so took effect as i intended for it wrought on her the form of death meantime i writ to romeo that he should hither come as this dire night to help to take her from her borrowed grave being the time the potions force should cease but he which bore my letter friar john was stayd by accident and yesternight returnd my letter back then all alone at the prefixed hour of her waking came i to take her from her kindreds vault meaning to keep her closely at my cell till i conveniently could send to romeo but when i came some minute ere the time of her awaking here untimely lay the noble paris and true romeo dead she wakes and i entreated her come forth and bear this work of heaven with patience but then a noise did scare me from the tomb and she too desperate would not go with me but as it seems did violence on herself all this i know and to the marriage her nurse is privy and if aught in this miscarried by my fault let my old life be sacrificd some hour before his time unto the rigour of severest law prince we still have known thee for a holy man wheres romeos man what can he say in this

came with flowers to strew his ladys grave and bid me stand aloof and so i did anon comes one with light to ope the tomb and byandby my master drew on him and then i ran away to call the watch prince this letter doth make good the friars words their course of love the tidings of her death and here he writes that he did buy a poison of a poor pothecary and therewithal came to this vault to die and lie with juliet where be these enemies capulet montage see what a scourge is laid upon your hate that heaven finds means to kill your joys with love and i for winking at you discords too have lost a brace of kinsmen all are punishd cap o brother montague give me thy hand this is my daughters jointure for no more can i demand mon but i can give thee more for i will raise her statue in pure gold
