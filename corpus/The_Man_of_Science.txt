the man of science i met a man in the strand one day that i knew very well as i thought though i had not seen him for years we walked together to charing cross and there we shook hands and parted next morning i spoke of this meeting to a mutual friend and then i learnt for the first time that the man had died six months before the natural inference was that i had mistaken one man for another an error that not having a good memory for faces i frequently fall into what was remarkable about the matter however was that throughout our walk i had conversed with the man under the impression that he was that other dead man and whether by coincidence or not his replies had never once suggested to me my mistake as soon as i finished jephson who had been listening very thoughtfully asked me if i believed in spiritualism to its fullest extent that is rather a large question i answered what do you mean by spiritualism to its fullest extent well do you believe that the spirits of the dead have not only the power of revisiting this earth at their will but that when here they have the power of action or rather of exciting to action let me put a definite case a spiritualist friend of mine a sensible and by no means imaginative man once told me that a table through the medium of which the spirit of a friend had been in the habit of communicating with him came slowly across the room towards him of its own accord one night as he sat alone and pinioned him against the wall now can any of you believe that or cant you i could brown took it upon himself to reply but before doing so i should wish for an introduction to the friend who told you the story speaking generally he continued it seems to me that the difference between what we call the natural and the supernatural is merely the difference between frequency and rarity of occurrence having regard to the phenomena we are compelled to admit i think it illogical to disbelieve anything we are unable to disprove for my part remarked macshaughnassy i can believe in the ability of our spirit friends to give the quaint entertainments credited to them much easier than i can in their desire to do so you mean added jephson that you cannot understand why a spirit not compelled as we are by the exigencies of society should care to spend its evenings carrying on a laboured and childish conversation with a room full of abnormally uninteresting people that is precisely what i cannot understand macshaughnassy agreed nor i either said jephson but i was thinking of something very different altogether suppose a man died with the dearest wish of his heart unfulfilled do you believe that his spirit might have power to return to earth and complete the interrupted work well answered macshaughnassy if one admits the possibility of spirits retaining any interest in the affairs of this world at all it is certainly more reasonable to imagine them engaged upon a task such as you suggest than to believe that they occupy themselves with the performance of mere drawingroom tricks but what are you leading up to why to this replied jephson seating himself straddlelegged across his chair and leaning his arms upon the back i was told a story this morning at the hospital by an old french doctor the actual facts are few and simple all that is known can be read in the paris police records of sixtytwo years ago the most important part of the case however is the part that is not known and that never will be known the story begins with a great wrong done by one man unto another man what the wrong was i do not know i am inclined to think however it was connected with a woman i think that because he who had been wronged hated him who had wronged him with a hate such as does not often burn in a mans brain unless it be fanned by the memory of a womans breath still that is only conjecture and the point is immaterial the man who had done the wrong fled and the other man followed him it became a pointtopoint race the first man having the advantage of a days start the course was the whole world and the stakes were the first mans life travellers were few and far between in those days and this made the trail easy to follow the first man never knowing how far or how near the other was behind him and hoping now and again that he might have baffled him would rest for a while the second man knowing always just how far the first one was before him never paused and thus each day the man who was spurred by hate drew nearer to the man who was spurred by fear at this town the answer to the nevervaried question would be at seven oclock last evening msieur seven ah eighteen hours give me something to eat quick while the horses are being put to at the next the calculation would be sixteen hours passing a lonely chalet monsieur puts his head out of the window how long since a carriage passed this way with a tall fair man inside such a one passed early this morning msieur thanks drive on a hundred francs apiece if you are through the pass before daybreak and what for dead horses msieur twice their value when living one day the man who was ridden by fear looked up and saw before him the open door of a cathedral and passing in knelt down and prayed he prayed long and fervently for men when they are in sore straits clutch eagerly at the straws of faith he prayed that he might be forgiven his sin and more important still that he might be pardoned the consequences of his sin and be delivered from his adversary and a few chairs from him facing him knelt his enemy praying also but the second mans prayer being a thanksgiving merely was short so that when the first man raised his eyes he saw the face of his enemy gazing at him across the chairtops with a mocking smile upon it he made no attempt to rise but remained kneeling fascinated by the look of joy that shone out of the other mans eyes and the other man moved the highbacked chairs one by one and came towards him softly then just as the man who had been wronged stood beside the man who had wronged him full of gladness that his opportunity had come there burst from the cathedral tower a sudden clash of bells and the man whose opportunity had come broke his heart and fell back dead with that mocking smile still playing round his mouth and so he lay there then the man who had done the wrong rose up and passed out praising god what became of the body of the other man is not known it was the body of a stranger who had died suddenly in the cathedral there was none to identify it none to claim it years passed away and the survivor in the tragedy became a worthy and useful citizen and a noted man of science in his laboratory were many objects necessary to him in his researches and prominent among them stood in a certain corner a human skeleton it was a very old and muchmended skeleton and one day the longexpected end arrived and it tumbled to pieces thus it became necessary to purchase another the man of science visited a dealer he well knew a little parchmentfaced old man who kept a dingy shop where nothing was ever sold within the shadow of the towers of notre dame the little parchmentfaced old man had just the very thing that monsieur wanted a singularly fine and wellproportioned study it should be sent round and set up in monsieurs laboratory that very afternoon the dealer was as good as his word when monsieur entered his laboratory that evening the thing was in its place monsieur seated himself in his highbacked chair and tried to collect his thoughts but monsieurs thoughts were unruly and inclined to wander and to wander always in one direction monsieur opened a large volume and commenced to read he read of a man who had wronged another and fled from him the other man following finding himself reading this he closed the book angrily and went and stood by the window and looked out he saw before him the sunpierced nave of a great cathedral and on the stones lay a dead man with a mocking smile upon his face cursing himself for a fool he turned away with a laugh but his laugh was shortlived for it seemed to him that something else in the room was laughing also struck suddenly still with his feet glued to the ground he stood listening for a while then sought with starting eyes the corner from where the sound had seemed to come but the white thing standing there was only grinning monsieur wiped the damp sweat from his head and hands and stole out for a couple of days he did not enter the room again on the third telling himself that his fears were those of a hysterical girl he opened the door and went in to shame himself he took his lamp in his hand and crossing over to the far corner where the skeleton stood examined it a set of bones bought for three hundred francs was he a child to be scared by such a bogey he held his lamp up in front of the things grinning head the flame of the lamp flickered as though a faint breath had passed over it the man explained this to himself by saying that the walls of the house were old and cracked and that the wind might creep in anywhere he repeated this explanation to himself as he recrossed the room walking backwards with his eyes fixed on the thing when he reached his desk he sat down and gripped the arms of his chair till his fingers turned white he tried to work but the empty sockets in that grinning head seemed to be drawing him towards them he rose and battled with his inclination to fly screaming from the room glancing fearfully about him his eye fell upon a high screen standing before the door he dragged it forward and placed it between himself and the thing so that he could not see it nor it see him then he sat down again to his work for a while he forced himself to look at the book in front of him but at last unable to control himself any longer he suffered his eyes to follow their own bent it may have been an hallucination he may have accidentally placed the screen so as to favour such an illusion but what he saw was a bony hand coming round the corner of the screen and with a cry he fell to the floor in a swoon the people of the house came running in and lifting him up carried him out and laid him upon his bed as soon as he recovered his first question was where had they found the thing where was it when they entered the room and when they told him they had seen it standing where it always stood and had gone down into the room to look again because of his frenzied entreaties and returned trying to hide their smiles he listened to their talk about overwork and the necessity for change and rest and said they might do with him as they would so for many months the laboratory door remained locked then there came a chill autumn evening when the man of science opened it again and closed it behind him he lighted his lamp and gathered his instruments and books around him and sat down before them in his highbacked chair and the old terror returned to him but this time he meant to conquer himself his nerves were stronger now and his brain clearer he would fight his unreasoning fear he crossed to the door and locked himself in and flung the key to the other end of the room where it fell among jars and bottles with an echoing clatter later on his old housekeeper going her final round tapped at his door and wished him goodnight as was her custom she received no response at first and growing nervous tapped louder and called again and at length an answering goodnight came back to her she thought little about it at the time but afterwards she remembered that the voice that had replied to her had been strangely grating and mechanical trying to describe it she likened it to such a voice as she would imagine coming from a statue next morning his door remained still locked it was no unusual thing for him to work all night and far into the next day so no one thought to be surprised when however evening came and yet he did not appear his servants gathered outside the room and whispered remembering what had happened once before they listened but could hear no sound they shook the door and called to him then beat with their fists upon the wooden panels but still no sound came from the room becoming alarmed they decided to burst open the door and after many blows it gave way and they crowded in he sat bolt upright in his highbacked chair they thought at first he had died in his sleep but when they drew nearer and the light fell upon him they saw the livid marks of bony fingers round his throat and in his eyes there was a terror such as is not often seen in human eyes brown was the first to break the silence that followed he asked me if i had any brandy on board he said he felt he should like just a nip of brandy before going to bed that is one of the chief charms of jephsons stories they always make you feel you want a little brandy
