 laughing bill hyde and other stories by rex beach author of rainbows end heart of the sunset the spoilers etc illustration like me he asked ponatah turned away blindly mr william hyde was discharged from deer lodge penitentiary a changed man that was quite in line with the accepted theory of criminal jurisprudence the wardens discipline and the chaplains prayers yes mr hyde was changed and the change had bitten deep his humorous contempt for the law had turned to abiding hatred his sunburned cheeks were pallid his lungs were weak and he coughed considerably balanced against these results to be sure were the benefits accruing from three years of corrective discipline at the states expense the knack of conversing through stone walls which mr hyde had mastered and the plaiting of wonderful horsehair bridles which he had learned otherwise he was the same laughing bill his friends had known neither more nor less regenerate since the name of montana promised to associate itself with unpleasant memories mr hyde determined at once to bury his past and begin life anew in a climate more suited to weak lungs to that end he stuck up a peaceful citizen of butte who was hurrying homeward with an armful of bundles and in the warm dusk of a pleasant evening relieved him of eightythree dollars a swiss watch with an elkstooth fob a pearlhandled penknife a keyring and a bottle of digestive tablets three wasted years of industry had not robbed mr hyde of the technique of his trade hence there was nothing amateurish or uproarious about the procedure he merely backheeled the pedestrian against a billboard held him erect and speechless by placing his left hand upon his victims shoulder and pressing his left forearm firmly across the gentlemans apple the while with his own dexterous right mit he placed the eightythree dollars in circulation during the transaction he laughed constantly an hour later he was en route for the sunny south there being good and sufficient reasons why he preferred that direction to any other arizona helped mr hydes lungs for the random town which he selected was high and dry but unfortunately so was laughing bill soon after his arrival and in consequence he was forced to engage promptly in a new business enterprise this time he raised a payroll it was an easy task for the custodian of the payroll was a small man with a kindly and unsuspicious nature as a result of this operation bill was enabled to maintain himself for some six weeks in a luxury to which of late he had been unaccustomed at the end of this time the original bearer of the payroll tottered forth from the hospital and chancing to overhear mr hyde in altercation with a faro dealer he was struck by some haunting note in the formers laughter and lost no time in shuffling his painful way to the sheriffs office seeing the man go laughing bill realized that his health again demanded a change of climate and since it lacked nearly an hour of train time he was forced to leave on horseback luckily for him he found a horse convenient it was a wild horse with nothing whatever to indicate that it belonged to any one except the fact that it carried a silvermounted saddle and bridle the reins of which were fastened to a post in front of a saloon mr hyde enjoyed the ride for it kept him out in the open air it grieved him to part with the horse a few hours later but being prodigal with personal property he presented the animal to a poor mexican woman leaving her to face any resulting embarrassments ten minutes later he swung himself under a westbound freight and in due time arrived in california somewhat dirty and fatigued but in excellent humor laughing bills adventures and his aliases during his slow progress up the coast form no part of this story it might be said with a great deal of truth that he was missed if not mourned in many towns finally having found the climates of california oregon and washington uniformly unsuited to one of his habits force of circumstance in the shape of numerous handbills adorned with an unflattering halftone of himself but containing certain undeniably accurate data such as diameter of skull length of nose angle of ear and the like drove him still north and west bill was a modest man he considered these statistics purely personal in character to see them blazoned publicly on the walls of postoffices and in the corridors of county buildings outraged his finer feelings so he went away from there in haste as usual having never sailed the sea he looked forward to such an experience with lively anticipation only to be disappointed in the realization it was rough off flattery and he suffered agonies strange and terrifying in due time however he gained his sea legs and being forever curious even prying he explored the ship his explorations were interesting for they took him into strange quarters into the forecastle the steerage even into some of the firstclass staterooms the doors of which had been left on the hook while their occupants were at meals no small benefit accrued to mr hyde from these investigations one day during the dinnerhour as he was occupied in admiring the contents of a strange suitcase a voice accosted him over his shoulder and he looked up to discover a face in the cabin window bill realized that an explanation was due for it was evident that the speaker had been watching him for some little time but under the circumstances even though the face in the window was round youthful goodhumored explanations promised to be embarrassing how dy said mr hyde what luck inquired the stranger mr hyde sat back upon his heels and grinned engagingly not much he confessed cant find it nowhere this guy must be a missionary the newcomer opened the door and entered he was a mediumsized plump young man oh i say he protested is it as bad as that bill nodded vaguely meanwhile carefully measuring the physical proportions of the interloper the latter went on i saw that you knew your business and i was hoping youd manage to find something i had missed mr hyde breathed deep with relief his expression altered you been through ahead of me he inquired oh several times daily in fact the speaker tossed a bunch of keys upon the berth saying glance through the steamertrunk while youre here and declare me in on anythingyou find mr hyde rose to his feet and retreated a step his look of relief was replaced by one of dark suspicion as always in moments of extremity he began to laugh who are you he demanded i why i live here thats my baggage ive been through it as i told you but the young man frowned whimsically and lit a cigarette it doesnt diagnose i cant find a solitary symptom of anything worth while sit down wont you mr hydes manner changed for a second time he was embarrassed apologetic crestfallen your cabin why then its my mistake he declared i must a got in the wrong flat mac sent me up for a deck of cards but say thats funny aint it he began to see the joke upon himself and the youth echoed his laughter it is funny the latter agreed for heavens sake dont spoil it sit down and have a smoke im not going to eat you see here you dont mean dyou think for a minute mr hyde began with rotund dignity but the other waved his cigarette impatiently saying oh drop that stuff or ill page your friend mac and show you up in assuming his air of outraged innocence laughing bill had arched his hollow chest and inhaled deeply as a result he began to cough whereupon his new acquaintance eyed him keenly saying thats a bad bark what ails you con said laughing bill pardon me i wouldnt have smoked if id known the speaker dropped his cigarette and placed a heel upon it what are you doing here alaskas no place for weak lungs gingerly seating himself upon the narrow settee mr hyde murmured wonderingly say youre a regular guy aint you he began to laugh again but now there was less of a metallic quality to his merriment yes sir dam if you aint he withdrew from his pocket a silvermounted hairbrush and comb and placed them carefully upon the washstand i dont aim to quit winner on a sport like you thanks awfully smiled the young man id have fought you for that comb and brush girl stuff you understand thats she he pointed to a leatherframed photograph propped against the mirror laughing bill leaned forward and studied the picture approvingly some queen all right blonde i reckon sure you like blondes who me i aint strong for no kind of women you hate her dont you the young man smiled more widely his whole face lit up i hate her so much that i kissed her goodby and sailed away to make a quick fortune i hope alaskas unhealthy yeah you see im a doctor im a good doctor too but it takes a long time to prove it out in the states and i cant wait a long time mr hyde pondered briefly i dont sees you got much on me doc he said i frisk em while theyre good and healthy and you take em when theyre feeble i dont see no difference to speak of its an interesting viewpoint the physician agreed seriously enough and i respect every mans opinion tell me how did you acquire that cough livin in a groundfloor apartment whats your business harnessmaker hmm youll do well up here the doctor was highly entertained i understand theres a horse at nome a horse alaska isnt a stock country laughing bill was genuinely surprised no horses he murmured how the hell do you get away you dont you stay and face the music now what do you know about that there was a brief silence well i bet ill turn my hand to something no doubt you impress me as a man of resource the doctors eyes twinkled and bill smiled a bond of friendly understanding had already sprung up between the two men now then im interested in your case ive a notion to try to cure you nothing doin on the fees im a dead card oh i wont charge you anything im merely interested in obscure ailments and if im not mistaken you suffer from more than one well disease i think you need curing about as badly as any man i ever saw now laughing bill was not skilled in subtleties and his relief at extricating himself from a trying predicament banished any resentment he might have felt at the doctors double meaning since the latter was a goodnatured harmless individual he decided to humor him and so after they had visited for an hour or more mr hyde discreetly withdrew but oddly enough during the days immediately following laughing bill grew to like the young fellow immensely this in itself was a novel experience for the exconvict had been a loner all hislife and had never really liked any one dr evan thomas however seemed to fill some longfelt want in hydes hungry makeup he fitted in smoothly too and despite the latters lifelong habit of suspicion despite his many rough edges he could not manage to hold the young man at a distance thomas was of a type strange to the wanderer he was educated he had unfamiliar airs and accomplishments but he was human and natural withal he was totally ignorant of much that mr hyde deemed fundamental and yet he was mysteriously superior while his indifferent good nature his mild amusement at the antics of the world about him covered a sincere and earnest nature he knew his business moreover and he revolutionized bills habits of hygiene in spite of the latters protests but the disease which ravaged mr hydes constitution had its toes dug in and when the steamer touched at st michaels he suffered a severe hemorrhage for the first time in his life laughing bill stood face to face with darkness he had fevered memories of going over side on a stretcher he was dimly aware of an appalling weakness which grew hourly then an agreeable indifference enveloped him and for a long time he lived in a land of unrealities of dreams the day came when he began to wonder dully how and why he found himself in a freezing cabin with doctor thomas in fur cap and arctic overshoes tending him bill pondered the phenomenon for a week before he put his query into words ive had a hard fight for you old man the doctor explained i couldnt leave you here to die i guess i must a been pretty sick right theres no hospital here so i took this cabin borrowed it from the company we dont burn much fuel and expenses arent high you been standin off the landlord yes there was a considerable silence then bill said fervently youre a regular guy like i told you but you got your pill business to attend to im all right now so you better blow thomas smiled dubiously youre a long way from all right and theres no place to blow to the last boat sailed two weeks ago last boat for where for anywhere were here for the winter unless the mailcarrier will take us to nome or up the yukon after the trails open i bet youll do a good business right here when folks see what you done for me bill ventured just wait till you look at the town deserted warehouses some young and healthy watchmen and a siwash village youre the only possible patient in all of st michaels bill lay silent for an hour staring through the open cabin window at a gray curtain of falling snowflakes then he shook his head and muttered well i be danged anything you want thomas inquired quickly i was just thinking about that gal bill indicated the leatherframed photograph which was prominently featured above the other bunk you aint gettin ahead very fast are you this time the young medical man smiled with his lips only his eyes were grave and troubled ive written her all the circumstances and shell understand shes that sort of a girl he turned cheerfully back to his task i found that i had a few dollars left so we wont starve mr hyde felt impelled to confess that in his warbag there was a roll of some seven hundred dollars title to which had vested in him on the northward trip together with certain miscellaneous objects of virtu but he resisted the impulse fearing that an investigation by his nurse might lead the latter to believe that he bill was not a harnessmaker at all but a jewelry salesman he determined to spring that roll at a later date and to present the doctor with a very thin very choice gold watch out of stateroom bill carried out this intention when he had sufficiently recovered to get about later when his lungs had healed bill hired the mailman to take him and his nurse to nome since he was not yet altogether strong he rode the sled most of the way while the doctor walked it was a slow and tiresome trip along the dreary shores of behring sea over timberless tundras across inlets where the new ice bent beneath their weight and where the mailcarrier cautiously tested the footing with the head of his ax sometimes they slept in their tent or again in roadhouses and in indian villages every hour laughing bill grew stronger and with his strength of body grew his strength of affection for the youthful doctor bill experienced a doglike satisfaction in merely being near him he suffered pangs when thomas made new friends he monopolized him jealously the knowledge that he had a pal was new and thrilling it gave bill constant food for thought and speculation thomas was always gentle and considerate but his little services his unobtrusive sacrifices never went unnoticed and they awoke in the bandit an everincreasing wonderment also they awoke a fierce desire to square the obligation the two men laid over at one of the old russian towns and thomas as was his restless custom made investigation of the native village of course bill went with him they had learned by this time to enter indian houses without knocking so therefore when they finally came to a cabin larger and cleaner than the rest they opened the door and stepped inside quite like experienced travelers a squaw was bent over a tub of washing another stood beside the tiny frosted window staring out neither woman answered the greeting of the white men must be the chiefs house thomas observed must be i spose the old bird is out adding up his reindeer sapolio sue is probly his head wife laughing bill ran an interested eye over the orderly interior some shack but i miss the usual smell neither woman paid them the least attention so they continued to talk with each other i wonder what she is washing doctor thomas said finally the figure at the window turned exposing the face of a comely young indian girl her features were good her skin was light she eyed the intruders coolly then in a wellmodulated voice and in excellent english she said she is washing a pair of sealskin pants both men removed their caps in sudden embarrassment thomas exclaimed i beg your pardon we thought this was just an ordinary native house or we wouldnt have intruded you havent intruded this is reindeer marys house the girl had again turned her back are you reindeer mary no i am ponatah mary befriended me she lets me live with her allow me to introduce mr hyde i am doctor thomas we were very rude oh everybody comes here the men recognized instantly in the speakers face as well as in her voice that education had set its stamp will you sit down and wait for her you overwhelm us after an awkward moment the physician queried how in the world did you learn to speak such good english a missionary took an interest in me when i was a little girl he sent me to carlisle laughing bill had been an attentive listener now he ventured to say i know this carlisle hes a swell football player or something ponatah smiled showing a row of small white teeth carlisle is an indian school what made you come back thomas inquired curiously ponatah shrugged her shoulders there was an end to the money what could i do at first i thought id be able to help my people but i couldnt they will learn from the white people but not from one of their own kind your parents they died when i was a baby mary took me in the girl spoke in a flat emotionless tone it must be tough to come back to this now that you know what life really is said thomas after a time ponatahs eyes were dark with tragedy when she turned them to the speaker god she cried unexpectedly then abruptly she faced the window once more it was a moment before she went on in fierce resentment why didnt they leave me as they found me why did they teach me their ways and then send me back to this this dirt and ignorance and squalor sometimes i think i cant stand it but what can i do nobody understands mary cant see why im different from her and the others she has grown rich with her reindeer she says if this is good enough for her it should be good enough for me as for the white men who come through they cant or they wont understand theyre hateful to me petersen the mailcarrier for instance i dont know why im telling you this youre strangers youre probably just like petersen i know why youre telling us thomas said slowly its because i because were not like petersen and the others its because i we can help you help me sneered the girl how i dont know yet but youre out of place here theres a place for you somewhere ill find it ponatah shook her head wearily mary says i belong here with my people no you belong with white people people who will treat you well this time the girl smiled bitterly they have treated me worse than my own people have i know them and i hate them aint you the sorehead now laughing bill murmured you got a hundredpercent grouch but if the old medicineman says hell put you in right you bet your string of beads hell do it hes got a gift for helpin downandouters you got class kid you certainly rhinestone this whole bunch of red men why you belong in french heels and a boodwar cap thats how i dope you there must be a chance for a girl like you in nome thomas continued thoughtfully youd make a good hand with children suppose i try to find you a place as governess would you ponatahs face was suddenly eager children oh yes id work my fingers to the bone i id do anything then ill do what i can for some time longer the three of them talked and gradually into the native girls eyes there came a light for these men were not like the others she had met and she saw the world begin to unfold before her when at last they left she laid a hand upon the doctors arm and said imploringly you wont forget you promise i promise he told her he dont forget nothing bill assured her and if he does ill see that he dont after they had gone ponatah stood motionless for a long time then she whispered breathlessly children little white children ill be very good to them shes a classy quilt laughing bill said on the way back to the roadhouse shes as pretty as a picture and little more than a child the doctor admitted you made a hit shed do most anything for you the doctor muttered absentmindedly shes stood off petersen and these rednecks but shed fall for you mr hyde was insinuating thomas halted he stared at his partner curiously coldly say do you think thats why i offered to help her he inquired come clean the invalid winked meaningly youre a long ways from home and ive knew fellers to do a lot worse you can grab her easy and if you do thomas grunted angrily ive put up with a lot from you he said then he strode on and if you do the other resumed falling into step with him ill bust you right where youre thickest eh ill bust you wide open oh me n that gal in the leather frame had a long talk while i was sick in st mikes and she asked me to keep you in the middle of the trail well im the little guy that can do it bill evan thomass eyes were twinkling i believe im going to cure you after all said he late that afternoon mr hyde disappeared he did not show up until after dark i been to see lo the poor squaw he readily confessed she aint the pure domestic leaf shes a blend part rooshian or something seems there was a gang of rooshians or swedes or dagoes of some sort used to run this country she says they horned into some of the best injun families and shes one of the overs they were russians rooshians is a kind of white people aint they well thats how she come so lightcomplected you remember she said our folks had treated her bad its a fact doc she spilled the story and it made a mouthful its like this when nome was struck a swede feller she had knew staked her a claim but she couldnt hold it her bein a squab under age savvy theres something in the law that prevents injuns gettin in on anything good too i dont rightly recollect what it is but if its legal you can bet its crooked anyhow uncle sam lets up a squawk that shes only eighteen goin on nineteen and a noble redskin to boot and says his mining claims is reserved for laps and yaps and japs and wops and such other furrin slantheads of legal age as declare their intention to become american citizens if their claims turn out rich enough sos it pays em to do so well ponatahs swede friend gets himself froze somehow so she has to pass the buck naturally she turns to her pals the missionaries theres a hemissionary here head mug of the whole gang hes a godly walloper and he tears into satan barehanded every sunday he slams the devil around something shameful and ponatah thinks hes a square guy if ever they come square so she asks him to relocate her claim on shares and hold it for the joint account old doctor me church agrees to split fiftyfifty half to her and half to heaven then he vamps to nome and chalks his monaker over the kids now get me the claim turns out good and ponatahs heavenly pilot makes a mexican divvy he takes the money and gives her his best wishes he grabs everything and says he never knew nobody by the name of ponatah he gets so he cant even pronounce it he allows her face is familiar but he cant place her and the partnership idea allus was repugnant to him he never was partners with nobody understand he blows the show he bows out and leaves the kid flat he forsakes the milky way for the great white one and hes out there now smokin coronas and wearin a red vest under his black coat with a diamond horseshoe in his tie it looks to me like the james boys could a learned something from this gospel holdup do you believe her story thomas inquired she dont know enough to lie and you cant trust a guy that wears his collar backwards she should go to court mr hyde shook his head i been there often but i never picked up a bet somehow or other courts is usually right next to jails and you got to watch out you dont get in the wrong place you cant win nothing in either one i thought id tell you the story so if you ever meet up with this shavetail preacher and he wants a headache pill you can slip him some sugarcoated arsenic in the days immediately following doctor thomass arrival at nome he was a busy man but he did not forget ponatah he was allowed no opportunity of doing so for bill frequently reminded him of her and as a result it was not long before he found a place for his charge in the home of a leading merchant arrangements made bill went in search of the mailcarrier petersen was drinking with two friends at the bar of the last chance and he pressed his late passenger to join them but alcoholism was not one of mr hydes weaknesses the best of bills bad habits was much worse than drink he had learned from experience that liquor put a traitors tongue in his head and in consequence he was a teetotaler i got a job for you pete he announced i got you another sledload for your next trip you know ponatah ponatah sure aye know im petersen spoke with enthusiasm well bring her along when you come me n the little doc will settle dats good yob for me all right vot mak you tank shell come aye ask her plenty tams but she ant like me you slip her this billyducks and shell come petersen pocketed the letter which bill handed him his eyes brightened the flush in his face deepened you bet your gum boots aye bring her shes svell ant she bill shes yust some svell like white voman whos this queried one of petersens companions ponatah shes jung sqvaw aye got eyes on dat chicken long tam now the burly mailman laughed loudly and slapped his friend on the shoulder mr hyde appeared to share in the general good nature carelessly smilingly he picked up petersens dogwhip which lay coiled on the bar thoughtfully he weighed it the lash was long but the handle was short and thick and its butt was loaded with shot it had much the balance of a blackjack a weapon not unknown to mr hyde pretty soft for you mailmen the former speaker grinned ja pretty soft aye bet aye have good tam dis trip yust vait you dont know how purty is ponatah she petersens listeners waited they are waiting yet for the mailman never completed his admiring recital of the indian girls charms owing to the fact that the genial mr hyde without warning tapped his late friends round head with the leather butt of the dogwhip had it not been for the norsemans otter cap it is probable that a new mailcarrier would have taken the st michaels run petersen sat down upon his heels and rested his forehead against the cool brass footrail the subsequent proceedings interested him not at all those proceedings were varied and sudden for the nearest and dearest of petersens friends rushed upon mr hyde with a roar him too bill eliminated from consideration with the loaded whip handle but this done bill found himself hugged in the arms of the other man as in the embrace of a bereaved shegrizzly now even at his best the laughing mr hyde was no hand at roughandtumble it being his opinion that fisticuffs was a peculiarly indecisive and exhausting way of settling a dispute he possessed a vile temper moreover and once aroused half measures failed to satisfy it after mr hydes admirable beginning those neutrals who had seen the start of the affray were prepared to witness an ending equally quick and conclusive they were surprised therefore to note that bill put up a very weak struggle once he had come to close quarters he made only the feeblest resistance before permitting himself to be borne backward to the floor and then as he lay pinned beneath his opponent he did not even try to guard the blows that rained upon him as a matter of fact he continued to laugh as if the experience were highly diverting seeing that the fight was onesided the bartender hastened from his retreat dragged petersens champion to his feet and flung him back into the arms of the onlookers after which he stooped to aid the loser his hands were actually upon bill before he understood the meaning of that peculiar laughter and saw in mr hydes shaking fingers that which caused him to drop the prostrate victim as if he were a rattlesnake godlmighty exclaimed the rescuer he retreated hurriedly whence he had come bill rose and dusted himself off then he bent over petersen who was stirring just give her that billyducks and tell her its all right tell her i say you wont hurt her none then still chuckling he slipped into the crowd and out of the last chance as he went he coughed and spat a mouthful of blood once the mailcarrier had been apprised of the amazing incidents which had occurred during his temporary inattention he vowed vengeance in a mighty voice and his threats found echo in the throats of his two companions but the bartender took them aside and spoke guardedly you better lay off of that guy or hell fatten the graveyard with all three of you i didnt make him at first but i got him now all right what dyou mean who is he his names hyde laughing bill laughing bill hyde one of petersens friends he who had come last into the encounter turned yellow and leaned hard against the bar a sudden nausea assailed him and he laid tender hands upon his abdomen laughing bill hyde thats why he went down so easy why he killed a feller i knew ribboned him up from underneath just that way and the jury called it selfdefense a shudder racked the speakers frame sure hes a cutter a reglar gents cutter and fitter hed a had you all over the floor in another minute if i hadnt pried you apart theyd a sewed sawdust up inside of you like you was a doll he had the old bonehandled skinner in his mit thats why i let go of him laughing bill take it from me boys you better walk around him like he was a hole in the ice it may have been the memory of that heavy whip handle it may have been the moral effect of stray biographical bits garnered here and there around the gamblingtable or it may have been merely a high and natural chivalry totally unsuspected until now which prompted petersen to treat ponatah with a chill and formal courtesy when he returned from st michaels at any rate the girl arrived in nome with nothing but praise for the mailman pete petersen so she said might have his faults but he knew how to behave like a perfect gentleman ponatah took up her new duties with enthusiasm and before a month had passed she had endeared herself to her employers who secretly assured doctor thomas that they had discovered a treasure and would never part with her she was gentle patient sweet industrious the children idolized her the indian girl had never dreamed of a home like this she was deliriously happy she took pride in discharging her obligations she did not forget the men who had made this wonder possible they had rented a little cabin and after the fashion of men they make slipshod efforts at keeping house since it was ponatahs nature to serve she found time somehow to keep the place tidy and to see to their comfort laughing bill was a hopeless idler he had been born to leisure and was wedded to indigence therefore he saw a good deal of the girl on her visits he listened to her stories of the children he admired her new and stylish clothes he watched her develop under the influence of her surroundings inasmuch as both of them were waifs and beholden to the bounty of others thy had ties in common a certain mutuality hence they came to know each other intimately despite the great change in her environment ponatah remained in many ways quite aboriginal for instance she was embarrassingly direct and straightforward she entirely lacked hypocrisy and that which puzzled or troubled her she boldly put into words there came a time when bill discovered that ponatahs eyes when they looked at him were more than friendly that most of the services she performed were aimed at him then one day she asked him to marry her there was nothing brazen or forward about the proposal ponatah merely gave voice to her feelings in a simple honest way that robbed her of no dignity bill laughed the proposal off i wouldnt marry the queen of sheby said he why i aint that kind of a bird thats why what kind of a bird are you ponatah eyed him with grave curiosity all men marry im reading a great many books and theyre all about love and marriage i love you and im pretty is it because im an indian hell that wouldnt faze me kiddo you skin the white dames around this village but you better cut out them books id make you a good wife sure youre aces but id make a bum husband i aint got the breath to blow out a candle mr hyde chuckled the idea of marriage plainly amused him how you know i aint got a covey of wives he inquired oh i know ponatah was unsmiling im simple but i can see through people i can tell the good ones and the bad ones youre a good man billy now this praise was anything but agreeable to mr hyde for above all things he abhorred socalled good people good people were suckers and he prided himself upon being a wise guy with all that was meant thereby you lay off of me kid he warned darkly and you muffle them wedding bells you cant win nothing with that line of talk if i was fifty inches around the chest liked to work and was fond of pasmentries id probly fall for you but i aint im a good man all right to leave alone ill be a brother to you but thats my limit the subject was embarrassing so he changed it say i been thinking about that claim of yours didnt you get no paper from that missionary no then his words as good as yours thats what the lawyer told me i offered to give him half but he wouldnt touch the case it was a dirty deal but you better forget it ill try the girl promised but i dont forget easily laughing bills rejection of ponatahs offer of marriage did not in the least affect their friendly relations she continued to visit the cabin and not infrequently she reverted to the forbidden topic only to meet with discouragement doctor thomas had opened an office of course but business was light and expenses heavy supplies were low in nome and prices high coal for instance was a hundred dollars a ton and as a result most of the idle citizens spent their evenings but precious little else around the saloon stoves when april came laughing bill regretfully decided that it was necessary for him to go to work the prospect was depressing and he did not easily reconcile himself to it for he would have infinitely preferred some less degraded and humiliating way out of the difficulty he put up a desperate battle against the necessity and he did not accept the inevitable until thoroughly convinced that the practice of medicine and burglary could not be carried on from the same residence without the risk of serious embarrassment to his benefactor however to find employment in a community where there were two men to one job was not easy but happily or unhappily bill had a smattering of many trades and eventually there came an opening as handyman at a mine it was a lowly position and bill had little pride in it for he was put to helping the cook waiting on table washing dishes sweeping cabins making beds and the like he had been assured that the work was light and so it was but it was also continuous he could summon not the slightest interest in it until he discovered that this was the very claim which rightfully belonged to ponatah then indeed he pricked up his ears the aurora borealis as the mine was now called had been working all winter and gigantic dumps of red paydirt stood as monuments to the industry of its workmen rumor had it that the streak was rich and that doctor slayforth the owner would be in on the first boat to personally oversee the cleanups the exmissionary bill discovered had the reputation of being a tight man and meanly suspicious in money matters he reposed no confidence in his superintendent a surly saturnine fellow known as black jack berg nor in denny slevin his foreman so much laughing bill gathered from camp gossip it soon became evident that black jack was a hard driver for sluicing began with the first trickle of snow water even while the ditches were still icebound and it continued with double shifts thereafter a representative of doctor slayforth came out from nome to watch the first cleanup and bill in his capacity as chambermaid set up a cot for him in the cabin shared by black jack and denny while so engaged the latter discovered him and gruffly ordered him to remove the cot to the bunkhouse put him in with the men growled slevin serves the dam spy right spy is he a gumshoe mr hyde paused a pillow slip between his teeth thats what me and jack was honest enough to run things all winter but we aint honest enough to clean up thats like old slayforth always lookin to get the worst of it im square and sos jack makes me sick this spyin on honest folks everybody knows we wouldnt turn a trick now it was laughing bills experience that honesty needs no boosting and that he who most loudly vaunts his rectitude is he who is least certain of it the boss must be a good man him being a sort of psalmsinger bill ventured guilelessly denny snorted oh sure hes good all right hes most too good to be true billy my boy when youve seen as many crooks as i have youll know em no matter how they come dressed as he folded the cot mr hyde opined that worldly experience must indeed be a fine thing to possess you go gamble on it slevin agreed now then just tell that hawkshaw we dont want no dam spies in our house were square guys and we cant stomach em that evening black jack called upon the handyman to help with the cleanup and put him to tend the water while he and denny under the watchful eye of the owners representative lifted the riffles worked down the concentrates and removed them from the boxes bill was an experienced placer miner so it was not many days before he was asked to help in the actual cleaning of the sluices he was glad of the promotion for as he told himself no man can squeeze a lemon without getting juice on his fingers it will be seen alas that mr hydes moral sense remained blunted in spite of the refining influence of his association with doctor thomas but aurora dust was fine and the handymans profits were scarcely worth the risks involved in taking them one morning while bill was cleaning up the superintendents cabin he noticed a tiny yellow flake of gold upon the floor in front of slevins bed careful examination showed him several colors of the same sort so he swept the boards carefully and took up the dust in a blower he breathed upon the pile blowing the lighter particles away a considerable residue of heavy yellow grains remained with a grin bill folded them in a cigarette paper and placed them in his pocket but it puzzled him to explain how there came to be gold on the cabin floor his surprise deepened when a few days later he found another prospect in the same place his two sweepings had yielded perhaps a pennyweight of the precious metal enough to set him to thinking it seemed queer that in the neighborhood of black jacks bunk he could find no pay whatever slevin had left his hip boots in the cabin and as laughing bill turned down their tops and set them out in the wind to dry his sharp eye detected several yellow pinpoints of color which proved upon closer investigation to be specks of gold clinging to the wet lining well i be danged said mr hyde carefully thoughtfully he replaced the boots where he had found them the knowledge that he was on a hot trail electrified him at the next cleanup laughing bill took less interest in his part of the work and more in denny slevins when the riffles were washed and the loose gravel had been worked down into yellow piles of rich concentrates slevin armed with whisk broom paddle and scoop climbed into the sluices bill watched him out of a corner of his eye and it was not long before his vigilance was rewarded the holdup man turned away with a feeling of genuine admiration for he had seen slevin under the very nose of the lookout go south with a substantial amount of gold the foremans daring and dexterity amazed bill and deepened his respect slevins work was cunning and yet so simple as to be almost laughable with his hip boots pulled high he had knelt upon one knee in the sluice scooping up the wet piles of gold and black iron sand while berg held a gold pan to receive it during the process black jack had turned to address the vigilant owners representative and profiting by the brief diversion bill had seen denny dump a heaping scoopload of pay into the gaping pocketlike top of his capacious rubber boot the sonsofagun breathed laughing bill the doublecrossing sonsofagun why it begins to look like a big summer for me bill slept well that night for now that he knew the game which was going on he felt sure that sooner or later he would take a hand in it just how or when the hand would fall he could not tell but that did not worry him in the least inasmuch as he already held the trumps it seemed that a kindly fortune had guided him to the aurora that fate had decreed he should avenge the wrongs of ponatah the handyman fell asleep with a smile upon his lips the first ship arrived that very evening and the next day doctor slayforth in person appeared at the aurora he was a thin restless man with weak and shifting eyes he said grace at dinner giving thanks for the scanty rations of hash and brown beans over which his hungry workmen were poised like cormorants the aurora had won the name of a bad feeder but its owner seemed satisfied with his meal later bill overheard him talking with his superintendent im disappointed with the cleanups slayforth confessed the pay appears to be pinching out she dont wash like she sampled thats a fact said black jack im afraid we shall have to practise economies look here if you aim to cut down the grub dont try it counseled berg its rotten now indeed there appeared to be plenty and the quality was excellent i fear you encourage gluttony and nothing so interferes with work we must effect a saving somehow there is too great a variation between theoretical and actual values huh you better try feeding hay for a while sourly grumbled the superintendent if you aint getting what you aimed to get its because it aint in the cards this conversation interested bill for it proved that the robbers had helped themselves with a liberal hand but how they had managed to appropriate enough gold to noticeably affect the showing of the winters work intensely mystified him it led him to believe that black jack and denny were out for a homestake that such was indeed the case and that slevin was not the only thief bill soon discovered for after the next cleanup he slipped away through the twilight and took stand among the alders outside the rear window of the shack on the hill from his point of concealment he could observe all that went on inside it was a familiar scene by the light of an oil lamp black jack was putting the final touches to the cleanup two gold pans heaped high with the mingled black sand and gold dust as it came out of the sluices were drying on the yukon stove and the superintendent was engaged in separating the precious yellow particles from the worthless material which gravity had deposited with it this refining process was slow painstaking work and was effected with the help of a flat brass scoop a blower by shaking this blower and breathing upon its contents the lighter grains of iron sand were propelled to the edge as chaff is separated from wheat and fell into a box held between the superintendents knees the residue left in the heel of the blower after each blowing process was commercial dust ready for the bank or the assay office doctor slayforth with his glasses on the end of his nose presided at the gold scales while denny slevin looked on as the dust was weighed a few ounces at a time it was dumped into a mooseskin sack and entered upon the books black jack had the light at his back he was facing the window therefore laughing bill commanded an unobstructed view of his adept manipulations it was not long before the latter saw him surreptitiously drop a considerable quantity of gold out of the scoop and into the box between his knees then cover it up with the black sand this sleightofhand was repeated several times and when the last heap of gold had been weighed bill estimated that doctor slayforth was poorer by at least a hundred ounces sixteen hundred dollars there was no question about it now these were not common thieves this was becoming a regular mans game and the stakes were assuming a size to give laughing bill a tingling sensation along his spine having discovered the modus operandi of the pair and having read their cards so to speak he next set himself to discover where they banked their swag but this was by no means easy his utmost vigilance went unrewarded by so much as a single clue berg and slevin had a habit of riding into town on saturday nights and the next time they left the claim bill pleaded a jumping toothache and set out afoot for medical attention it was late when he arrived at nome nevertheless a diligent search of the front street saloons failed to locate either man he was still looking for them when they came riding in with their delayed arrival bills apprehensions vanished as likewise did his imaginary toothache he had feared that they were in the habit of bringing the gold to nome there perhaps to bank it with some friend but now he knew that they were too cautious for that and preferred instead to cache it somewhere in the hills this simplified matters immensely so bill looked up his little doctor for a sociable visit thomas was in his office he greeted bill warmly say pillrolling must be brisk to keep you on the job till midnight the latter began business is rotten exclaimed the physician and its a rotten business nobody sick thats tough open a can of typhoid germs and ill put em in the well anything to stir up a little trade ive just balanced my books and ive just heard from alice do the books balance oh perfectly nothing equals nothing its a perfect equilibrium alice wants me to come home and start all over and im tempted to do so aint going to throw up your tail are you i cant get along without her thomas was plainly in the depths he turned away and stared moodily out into the dimlit street it was midnight but already the days were shortening already there was an hour or two of dusk between the evening and the morning light of course you cant get along without her the exbandit agreed i seen that when i looked at her picture why dont you bring her in bring her in here thomas faced about quickly humph not much well this aint no dolls village thats a fact its full of wicked men and the women aint wuth braggin over spose we go out and marry her we thomas smiled for the first time sure ill stick to the bitter finish im broke bill pshaw now dont let that worry you i got money you the doctor was surprised where did you get it well i got it thats the main thing it was left to me honestly what dyou mean honestly how much i dunno exactly you see i aint got it actually in my mit oh but ill have it all righto its just waiting for me to close down on it i reckon there must be a thousand gold buzzards in the stack mebby more its all yours thanks said the physician unimpressed look me in the eye bill spoke earnestly twenty thousand iron men aint so bad itll buy a lot of dolls clothes we can have a big party i aint kidding then reading amused incredulity in his friends face he demanded how you know i aint got a rich uncle that raised me from a colt and that broke his heart at me runnin away and turning out wild and has had lawyers gunnin for me ever since he knew he was gettin old and going to croak how you know that eh i dont know i dont know anything about you bill thats one of the most interesting features of our friendship well pay a little attention to me now then i figger it like this i got lungs like a grasshopper and the money wont do me no good so ill stake you and miss alice to it doctor thomas eyed the speaker curiously i believe you would said he after a moment would i say you ever seen a feather bed tied up with a rope you sit tight and ill slip you a roll just that size of course you know i wouldnt take it why not its moren likely itll get me into evil company or gimme some bad habit and ill gargle off before ive had a chance to spend it i aint strong ill earn what i get billy all right if you feel like that ill bet it for you on a crap game and you can take the winnings nothing doing i want honest money money that i can look in the face mr hyde was out of patience all moneys honest after you get it he cried its gettin it that draws blood i never knew the silver bird to fly off a dollar and scratch a guy did you i want to make money thats why i came up to this godforsaken place but when your uncles draft arrives you cash it aint you the champeen bonedome muttered bill such an attitude seemed to him both senseless and quixotic for he had never attached the least sentiment to money money was an elemental necessity therefore he looked upon it with practical unromantic eyes and helped himself to it as he helped himself to such elemental necessities as air or water most of lifes necessaries had fallen into monopolistic hands and were used to wring tribute from unfortunate mortals who had arrived too late to share in the graft as witness for instance standard oil so ran bills reasoning when he took the trouble to reason at all men had established arbitrary rules to govern their forays upon one anothers property to be sure but under cover of these artificial laws they stole merrily and got away with it eagles did not scruple to steal from one another horses ate one anothers fodder why human beings should not do likewise had always puzzled mr hyde the basic principle held good in both cases it seemed to him and doctor thomass refusal to share in the coming legacy struck him as silly it was the result of a warped and unsound philosophy but argue as he would he could not shake his friends opinion of the matter one evening not long after his visit to town bills toothache returned again to plague him he raised groans and hoarse profanities and then while the crew was still at supper he abandoned his work and set out in search of relief but he did not go to nome once out of sight of the mine he doubled back and came out behind the superintendents cabin a moment later he was stretched out in the narrow dark space beneath black jacks bunk dust irritated bills lungs therefore he had carefully swept out the place that morning likewise he had thoughtfully provided himself with a cotton comforter as protection to his bones he had no intention of permitting himself to be taken at a disadvantage and knowing full well the painful consequences of discovery he opened his bonehandled pocketknife and tested its keen edge with his thumb in the interests of peace and goodfellowship however he hoped he could go through the night without coughing slevin was the first to return from supper he went directly to his bunk drew a bottle of whisky from beneath his pillow poured himself a drink and replaced the bottle when berg entered he went through a similar procedure after which a fire was built the men kicked off their boots lit their pipes and stretched out upon their beds ive been thinking it over the superintendent began and you cant do it why not queried slevin i told his nibs i was sick of the grub foremen dont quit good jobs on account of the grub youve got to stick till fall then well both go well strike the old man for a raise humph hell let us go quick enough when we do that lets strike him now im through nothing stirring berg firmly declared well play out the string im taking no chances hell aint we takin a chance every day we stay here im getting so i dont sleep i got enough to do me i aint a hog i got a bully corner all picked out jack best corner in seattle for a ginmill itll wait corners dont get up and move no i wont hold the bag for you or for anybody declared the former speaker well go through arm in arm once were away clean you can do what you like me for the argentine and ten thousand acres of longhorns you better forget that corner some night youll get stewed and spill the beans who me slevin laughed in disdain fat chance there was a long silence during which the only sound was the bubbling of a pipe i spose ill have to stick if you say so denny agreed finally but im fed up im getting jumpy i got a hunch the cache aint safe i feel like something was goin to happen mr slevins premonition under the circumstances was almost uncanny it gave startling proof of his susceptibility to outside influences you are rickety black jack told him why there aint any danger nobody goes up there laughing bill held his breath missing not a word if they did wed pick em up with the glasses its open country and wed get em before they got down i spose so but the nights are getting dark nobodys out at night either you boob i aint losing any slumber over that and i aint going to lose any about your quitting ahead of me that dont trouble me none berg yawned and changed the subject half an hour later he rose languidly undressed and rolled into his bed slevin followed suit shortly after and the rapidity with which both men fell asleep spoke volumes for the elasticity of the human conscience now laughing bill had come prepared to spend the night but his throat tickled and he had a distressing habit of snoring therefore he deemed it the part of caution to depart before he dropped off into the land of dreams he effected the manoeuver noiselessly bill lingered at the spring hole on the following morning and lost himself in an attentive study of the surrounding scenery it was fairly impressive scenery and he had a keen appreciation of natures beauty but black jacks words continued to puzzle him nobody goes up there up where the aurora lay in a valley therefore most of the country round about was up it was open too the ridges were bold and barren garbed only with shreds and patches of short grass and reindeer moss wed pick em up with the glasses wed get em before they got down manifestly the cache was in plain sight if one only knew where to look for it but mr hydes sharp eyes took in ten thousand likely hidingplaces and he reasoned that it would be worse than folly to go exploring blindly without more definite data than he possessed it was clever of the pair to hide the swag where they could oversee it every hour of the day and they had chosen a safe location too for nobody wasted the effort to explore those domes and hogbacks now that they were known to contain no quartz there was anvil mountain for instance a bold schist peak crowned with a huge rock in the likeness of a blacksmiths anvil it guarded the entrance to the valley rising from the very heart of the best mining section it was the most prominent landmark hereabouts but not a dozen men had ever climbed it and nowadays nobody did as bill pondered the enigma out from his bed in the willows came don antonio de chiquito a meek and lowly burro the only member of the auroras working force which did not outrank in social importance the manofallwork don antonio was the pet of the aurora borealis and its scavenger he ate everything from garbage to rubber boots he was even suspected of possessing a low appetite for german socks it was in fact this very democratic taste in things edible which caused him to remain the steadiest of doctor slayforths boarders wisdom patience the sagacity of solomon lurked in don antonios eyes and laughing bill consulted him as a friend and an equal tony said he youve done a heap of prospecting and you know the business theres a rich pocket on one of them hills which one is it don antonio de chiquito had ears like sunbonnets he folded them back lifted his muzzle toward anvil rock and brayed loudly mebbe youre right said the man he fitted the chinese yoke to his skinny shoulders and took up his burden the load was heavy the yoke bruised his bones therefore he was moved to complain the idea of me totin water for the very guys that stole my uncles money its awful the darned crooks it was a rainy evening when business next took black jack berg and denny slevin to town having dined amply if not well they donned slickers saddled a pair of horses and set out down the creek few people were abroad therefore they felt secure from observation when they swung off the trail where it bends around the foot of anvil mountain and bore directly up through the scattered alders the grass was wet the rain erased the marks of their horses feet almost in the passing tethering their mounts in the last clump of underbrush the riders labored on afoot up a shallow draw which scarred the steep slope the murk of twilight obscured them but even in a good light they would have run small risk of discovery for slowmoving human figures would have been lost against the dark background the climb was long and arduous both men were panting when they breasted the last rise and looked down into the valley where lay the aurora borealis this was a desolate spot great boulders fallen from the huge rock overhead lay all about the earth was weathered by winter snows and summer rains ghostly fingers of mist writhed over the peak darkness was not far distant the robbers remained on the crest perhaps twenty minutes then they came striding down they passed within a hundred yards of laughing bill hyde who lay flat in the wet grass midway of their descent he watched them mount and ride out of sight then he continued his painful progress up the hillside weak lungs are not suited to heavy grades and slippery footing bill was sobbing with agony when he conquered the last rise and collapsed upon his face he feared he was dying every cough threatened a hemorrhage but when his breath came more easily and he missed the familiar taste of blood in his mouth he rose and tottered about through the fog he could discover no tracks he began to fear the night would foil him when at last luck guided his aimless footsteps to a slide of loose rock banked against a seamy ledge the surface of the bank showed a muddy scar already half obliterated by the rain brief search among the nearby boulders uncovered the hidingplace of a pick and shovel for once in his life mr hyde looked upon these tools with favor and energetically tackled the business end of a number he considered pickandshovel work the lowest form of human endeavor nevertheless he engaged in it willingly enough and he had not dug deeply before he uncovered the side of a packingcase labeled choice california canned fruits further rapid explorations showed that the box was fitted with a loose top and that the interior was wellnigh filled with stout canvas and moose skin bags bill counted them he weighed one then he sat down weakly and his hard smokeblue eyes widened with amazement suffering cats he whispered he voiced other expletives too even more forcefully indicative of surprise he was not an imaginative man it did not occur to him to doubt his sanity or to wonder if he were awake nevertheless he opened one of the pokes and incredulously examined its contents im dam if it aint he said finally i should reckon they was ready to quit argentine why jackll bust the bottom out of a boat if he takes this with him hell drown a lot of innocent people mr hyde shook his head and smiled pityingly it aint safe to trust him with it it aint safe the thievin devil theres five hundred pounds if theres an ounce he began to figure with his finger on the muddy shovel blade a hundred thousand bucks he announced finally them boys is all right slowly reluctantly he replaced the gold sacks reburied the box and placed the tools where he had found them then he set out for home don antonio de chiquito was contentedly munching an empty oat sack doubtless impelled thereto by the lingering flavor of its former contents when on the following morning bill accosted him tony i got to hand it to you the man said admiringly youre some pocket miner and you speak up like a gent when youre spoken to i got some nice eggshells saved up for you then his voice dropped to a confidential tone were in with a passel of crooks tony evil associates i call em theyre bound to have a bad influence over us i feel it aready dont you well spose you meet me tonight at the gap in the hedge and well take a walk don antonio appeared in every way agreeable to the proposal but to make certain that he would keep his appointment bill led him down into the creek bottom and tied him securely after which he removed a packsaddle and a bundle of hay from the stable the saddle he hid in the brush the hay he spread before his accomplice with the generous invitation drink hearty its on the house in explanation he went on its this way tony they left the elevator out of that anvil skyscraper and i cant climb stairs on one lung so you got to be my sixcylinder oatmotor we got a busy night ahead of us that evening laughing bill ascended anvil mountain for a second time but the exertion did not wind him unduly for he made the ascent at the end of don antonios tail he was back in camp for breakfast and despite his lack of sleep he performed his menial duties during the day with more than his usual cheerfulness speed up cant you slevin paused midway of the steepest slope and spoke impatiently to his partner below im coming black jack panted being the heavier and clumsier of the two the climb was harder for him youre so spry spose you just pack this poke he unslung a heavy leather sack from his belt and gave it to denny wed ought to a got an early start the latter complained the days are gettin short and i had a rotten fall going down last time relieved of some fifteen pounds of dead awkward weight and nothing is more awkward to carry than a sizable gold sack berg made better speed arriving at the cache in time to see slevin spit on his hands and fall to digging every time we open her up i get a shiver denny confessed with a laugh im scared to look humph think shes going to get up and walk out on us berg seated himself lit his pipe and puffed in silence for a while we aint never been seen he declared positively shes as safe as the bank of england as long as you dont get drunk me drunk ha me and the demon rum is divorced forever slevins shovel struck wood and he swiftly uncovered the box then removed its top he stood for a full minute staring into its interior then he cried hoarsely jack berg was on his feet in an instant he strode to the excavation and bent over it after a time he straightened himself and turned blazing eyes upon his confederate denny met his gaze with the glare of a man demented whad i tell you the latter chattered i told you theyd get it by god they have he cast an apprehensive glance over his shoulder far below the lights of the valley were beginning to twinkle in the direction of nome the cross on the catholic church gleamed palely against the steelgray expanse of behring sea berg was a man of violent temper he choked and gasped his face was bloated with an apoplectic rage he began to growl curses deep in his throat who got it he demanded who dyou mean by they shh slevin was panicstricken he flung out a nervous jerky hand mebbe theyre here now look out who dyou mean by they the larger man repeated i god i dunno but there must a been moren one five hundred pounds one man couldnt pack it you said they berg persisted in an odd tone slevins madly roving gaze flew back and settled upon the discolored visage thrust toward him then his own eyes widened he recoiled crying look here you dont think i his words ended in a bark i aint said what i think but im thinkin fast nobody knew it but us how dyou know i know slowly slevin settled himself his muscles ceased jumping his bullet head drew down between his shoulders well it wasnt me so it must a been you dont stall roared the larger man it wont win you anything you cant leave here till you come through that goes double jack i got my gat too and you aint going to run out on me you wanted to quit you weakened youre a liar the men stared fixedly at each other heads forward bodies tense as they glared the fury of betrayal grew to madness whered you put it berg ground the words between his teeth im askin you that very thing the foreman answered in a thin menacing voice slowly almost imperceptibly he widened the distance between himself and his accuser it was not a retreat he merely drew himself together defensively holding himself under control with the last supreme effort of his will the tension snapped suddenly with a harsh wordless cry of fury black jack tore his sixshooter from its restingplace but slevins right hand stirred in unison and it moved like light owing to the fact that he carried his gun beneath his left armpit he was the first to fire by the fraction of a second it was impossible to miss at this distance berg went to his knees as if hit by a sledge but he fired from that position and his shot caught slevin as the latter crowhopped nimbly both men were down now slevin however seemed made of rubber he was up again almost instantly and zigzagging toward the shelter of the nearest rocks berg emptied his colt at the running target then a shout burst from his lips as he saw denny pitch forward out of sight with shaking clumsy fingers black jack reloaded his hot weapon with his left hand pressed deep into his side he rose slowly to his feet and lurched forward you rat he yelled doublecross me will yeh he heard the sound of a body moving over loose stones and halted weaving in his tracks and peering into the gloom come out he ordered come out and own up and ill let yeh off there was a silence i see yeh he took unsteady aim at a shadow and fired never mind ill get yeh after a little while he stumbled onward between the boulders shouting a challenge to his invisible opponent he had gone perhaps fifty feet when the darkness was stabbed by the blaze of slevins gun three times the weapon spoke at little more than armslength and black jack spun on his heels then rocked forward limply it was a long time before the sound of his loud slow breathing ceased not until then did denny slevin move with a rattle in his throat the foreman crept out from hiding and went down the mountainside upon his hands and knees it occasioned considerable speculation at the aurora borealis when neither the superintendent nor the foreman appeared for breakfast later a telephone message to doctor slayforth having elicited the startling intelligence that neither man had been seen in town during the night there came a flicker of excitement this excitement blazed to white heat when slayforth rode up on a muddy horse accompanied by the town marshal and the chief of police followed more telephoning and some crossexamination but the men were gone they had disappeared it was a mystery baffling any attempt at explanation for there were no ships in the roadstead and hence it was impossible for the pair to have taken french leave while a search party was being organized there came word that the missing saddlehorses had been found on the slope of anvil mountain and by the time slayforths party had reached the ground more news awaited them up near the head of the draw some one had discovered the body of denny slevin there was a rush thither and thence on up the trail slevin had left to the scene of the twilight duel to black jack berg and the cache in the slide the story told itself down to the last detail it was the story of a thieves quarrel and a double killing doctor slayforth fell upon his bag of gold as a mother falls upon her babe he voiced loud hysterical condemnation of the deed he wept tears of mingled indignation and thanksgiving he gabbled scriptural quotations about the wages of sin then remembering that the wages of his men were going on he sent them back to their work and determined to dock half their mornings pay the story of the tragedy was still the sensation of nome when a fortnight later laughing bill hyde showed up in town with the cheerful announcement that he had been fired ponatah was at the cabin when he arrived and she did not try to conceal her joy at seeing him again ive been so unhappy she told him youve never been out of my thoughts billy aint you got nothing better to think about than me he asked with a smile well the psalmshouter let me out jerked the pillerslip from under me you might say and turned me adrift hes got a highchested lowbrowed swede in my place it takes a guy with hair down to his eyebrows to be a buck chambermaid the old rascal ponatahs face darkened with anger no wonder those men robbed him i wish they had taken all his gold and escaped youre pretty sore on his heavenly nibs aint you ponatah clenched her hands and her eyes blazed well you got this consolation the aurora aint as rich as it was it would have been rich enough for us us yes youd marry me if i were rich wouldnt you no i wouldnt bill declared firmly whats the use to kid you why wouldnt you are you ashamed of me bill protested say what is this youre giving me the third degree if i were as rich as well as reindeer mary wouldnt you marry me ponatah gazed at the unworthy object of her affections with a yearning that was embarrassing and laughing bill was forced to spar for wind aint you the bold mary ann makin cracks like that he chided im ashamed of you honest ive passed up plenty of frills in my time and were all better off for it my appetite for marriage aint no keener than it used to be so you forget it little doc hes the marrying kind oh yes he tells me a great deal about his alice hes very much discouraged if if i had the aurora i wouldnt forget him id give him half would you now well hes the one stiffneck that wouldnt take it hes funny that way seems to think money ll bite him or something i dont know how these pullanthrofists get along with proud people always spurning their gifts hes got my nan you take my tip kid and cling to your coin salt it down for winter thats what im doing with mine are you ponatah was not amused she was gravely interested i thought you were broke billy whered you get that at he demanded ive always got a pinch of change i have im lucky that way now then you run along and dont never try to feint me into a clinch it dont go laughing bill enjoyed a good rest in the days that followed he rested hard for several weeks and when he rested he lifted his hand to absolutely nothing he was an expert idler and with him indolence was but a form of suspended animation in spite of himself however he was troubled by a problem he was completely baffled by it in fact until without warning and without conscious effort the solution presented itself bill startled his cabin mate one day by the announcement that he intended to go prospecting nonsense said thomas when the first shock of surprise had passed this country has been run over and every inch is staked i bet ill horn in somewhere all i want is one claim where i got room to sling myself if thats all you want ill give you a claim it has twenty acres is that room enough plenty where is it its on eclipse creek i believe a patient gave it to me for a bill he wont call for a new deal if i strike it rich no i paid his fare out of the country but why waste your valuable time your time is valuable i presume sure i aint got much left you dont believe in hunches do you well i do ive seen em come out look at denny slevin for instance i heard him say he had a hunch something unpleasant was going to happen to him and it did well go fiftyfifty on this eclipse creek the doctor shrugged his shoulders suit yourself fresh air wont hurt you the first frosts of autumn had arrived before laughing bill returned to town with the announcement that he had struck a prospect doctor thomas was at first incredulous then amazed finally when the true significance of those tiny yellow grains came home to him his enthusiasm burst all bounds he was for at once closing his office and joining actively in his partners work but bill would not hear to such a thing stick to the pills and powders doc he counseled you know that game and i know this its my strike and i dont want no amachoors butting in i got options on the whole creek shes eclipsed for fair cause i dont like neighbors you shut your trap till spring and sit tight then well roll our packs stomp on the fire and call the dog old home week for us but billy we cant work out that claim in one winter protested the physician how dyou know we cant mebbe its just a pocket well find other pockets we have the whole creek say how much dyou need to satisfy you bill inquired curiously i dont know a hundred thousand dollars perhaps a hundred thousand whew you got rich tastes this aint no bonanza but if its any good at all it will net us that much probably more bill considered briefly then he announced all right bo i got your idea when i hand you a hundred thousand iron men we quit no questions no regrets is that it but youve hiked the limit on me i dunnos ill make good by the time snow flew the tent on eclipse creek had been replaced by a couple of warm shacks provisions had been bought and a crew hired work commenced immediately and it continued throughout the winter with bill in charge the gravel was leanlooking stuff but it seemed to satisfy the manager and whenever thomas came out from town he received encouraging reports from his partner hyde ceased playing solitaire long enough to pan samples in his tub of snow water now had the younger man been an experienced placer miner he might have noted with suspicion that whenever bill panned he chewed tobacco a new habit he had acquired and not infrequently he spat into the tub of muddy water but thomas was not experienced in the wiles and artifices of minesalters and the residue of yellow particles left in the pan was proof positive that the claim was making good it did strike him as strange however that when he selected a pan of dirt and washed it unassisted he found nothing at such times bill explained glibly enough that no pay dump carried steady values and that an inexperienced sampler was apt to get skunked under the best of circumstances concentrates lay in streaks and pockets he declared then to prove his assertions bill would help his partner pan and inasmuch as he wore long fingernails underneath which colors of gold could be easily concealed it was not surprising that he succeeded in finding a prospect where the doctor had failed for fear thomas should still entertain some lingering doubts bill occasionally sent him down into the shaft alone to sample the pay streak but in each instance he took pains to go down beforehand with a shotgun and some shells of his own loading and to shoot a few rounds into the face of the thawed ground the winter passed quickly enough bills only concern arising from the fact that his strike had become common knowledge and that men were clamoring to buy or to lease a part of the creek it was a tiny creek and he had it safely tied up under his options therefore he was in a position to refuse every offer by so doing he gained the reputation of being a cautious cagey man and difficult to deal with bill paid off his crew out of the first spring cleanup from the dust he had managed to dump into the sluices at night thereafter he sent the gold to town by doctor thomas who came after it regularly when he closed down the works in june he and his partner held bank deposit slips for a trifle over one hundred thousand dollars rumor placed their profits at much more bill saw little of ponatah after his return to nome for the girl avoided him and when he did see her she assumed a peculiar reserve her year and a half of intimate association with cultured people had in reality worked an amazing improvement in her and people no longer regarded her as an indian but referred to her now as that russian governess nevertheless she could retreat behind a baffling air of stolidity almost of sullenness when she chose and that was precisely the mask she wore for bill in reality she was far from stolid and anything but sullen for his part he made no effort to break down the girls guard he continued to treat her with his customary free good nature notwithstanding the liberal margin of profit on his winters operations bill realized that he was still shy approximately half of the sum which doctor thomas had set as satisfactory and when the latter began planning to resume work on a larger scale in the fall mr hyde was stricken with panic fearing lest his own lack of enthusiasm in these plans and his indifference to all affairs even remotely concerning eclipse creek should awaken suspicion he determined to sell out his own and his partners interests in accordance with their original understanding without consulting thomas he called upon doctor slayforth the pious mineowner was glad to see him his manner was not at all what it had been when bill worked for him his words of greeting fairly trickled prune juice and honey say doc i got a load on my chest im a strayed lamb and you being a sort of shepherd i turns to you bill began i trust you have not come in vain the exmissionary beamed benignly it has been my duty and my privilege to comfort the afflicted what troubles you william theres a school of sharks in this village and i dont trust em theyre too slick for a feller like me it is an ungodly place the doctor agreed i have felt the call to work here but my duties prevent of course i labor in the lords vineyard as i pass through but i am weak me too and getting weaker daily bill summoned a hollow cough listen to that hospital bark i gotta blow this place doc or theyll button me up in a rosewood overcoat i gotta sell eclipse creek and beat it again he coughed i am

gal and i got a cough they both need attention and hes the only guy that can give it were willing to hand you eclipse creek if youll take it there was considerable conversation and a visit to eclipse creek but the doctor it proved was willing to take any good bargain and a few days later the transfer was made when the larger part of slayforths winters cleanup had changed hands the two partners adjourned to thomass little office well the physician heaved a deep sigh of relief its all over and i feel as if i were dreaming the oregon sails tomorrow its time to stomp on the fire i i wonder if

he continued briskly now call the dog im off to buy our duckets laughing bill purchased three tickets instead of two then he went in search of ponatah it so chanced that he found her alone now neither he nor any other man had ever called upon her therefore she was dumfounded at his coming well kid he announced me n the doc have sold eclipse creek and we bow out tomorrow on the big smoke ponatah opened her lips but no sound issued she possessed a strong young body but the strength the life seemed suddenly to go out of it leaving her old and spiritless got a kind word for us the man inquired

will grab your lid well join hands and be soldered up laughing bill stared after the girl as she hurried away musingly he said the little doc got in on no pair for it was all her coin of course but shed a had to split fiftyfifty with a lawyer so it aint a bad deal all around the north winds malice it had snowed during the night but toward morning it had grown cold now the sledrunners complained and the load dragged heavily folsom who had been heaving at the handlebars all the way up the dexter creek hill halted his dogs at the crest and dropped upon the sled only too glad of a breathing spell his forehead was wet with sweat when it began to freeze in his eyebrows he removed his mittens and wiped away the drops then watched them congeal upon his fingers yes it was all of thirty below and a bad morning to hit the trail but folsoms face set itself better thirty below in the open than the frigid atmosphere of an unhappy home harkness who had led the way up the hill plodded onward for a time before discovering that his companion had paused then through the ring of hoar frost around his parka hood he called back ill hike down to the roadhouse and warm up folsom made no answer he did not even turn his head taciturnity was becoming a habit with him and already he was beginning to dislike his new partner for that matter he disliked everybody this morning below him lay the level tundra merging indistinguishably with the white anchorice of behring sea beyond that a long black streak of open water underscoring the sky as if to emphasize the significance of that empty horizon a horizon which for many months would remain unsmudged by smoke to folsom it seemed that the distant stretch of dark water was like a prison wall barring the outside world from him and the other fools who had elected to stay inside fools yes they were all fools folsom was a sourdough he had seen the pranks that alaskan winters play with men and women he had watched the alteration in minds and morals made by the arctic isolation and he had considered himself proof against the malice that rides the north wind the mischief that comes with the winter nights he had dared to put faith in his perfect happiness thinking himself different from other men and lois superior to other wives wherefore he now called himself a fool sprawled beside the shore five miles away was nome its ugliness of corrugated iron rough boards and tar paper somewhat softened by the distance from the jumble of roofs he picked out one and centered his attention upon it it was his roof or had been he wondered with a sudden flare of wrathful indignation if lois would remember that fact during his absence but he banished this evil thought lois had pride there was nothing common about her he could not believe that she would affront the proprieties it was to spare that very pride of hers even more than his own that he had undertaken this adventure to the kobuk and now as he looked back upon nome he told himself that he was acting handsomely in totally eliminating himself thus allowing her time and freedom in which to learn her heart he hoped that before his return she would have chosen between him and the other man it was too cold to remain idle long folsoms damp body began to chill so he spoke to his team and once more heaved upon the handlebars leaving the crest of the ridge behind the dogs began to run they soon brought up in a tangle at the roadhouse door when harkness did not appear in answer to his name folsom entered to find his trailmate at the bar glass in hand put that down folsom ordered sharply harkness did precisely that then he turned wiping his lips with the back of his hand he was a small foxfaced man with a grin he invited the newcomer to have one dont you know better than to drink on a day like this the latter demanded dont worry about me i was raised on hootch said harkness its bad medicine bah ill travel further drunk than harkness measured his critic with an insolent eye than some folks sober he commenced to warm himself at the stove whereupon the other cried impatiently come along we cant stop at every cabin but harkness was in no hurry he consumed considerable time when he finally followed folsom out into the air the latter being in a peculiarly irritable mood warned him in a voice which shook with anger were going to start with an understanding if you take another drink during the daytime ill leave you flat rats how you aim to get to the kobuk without me asked harkness ill manage somehow the smaller man shot a startled glance at the speaker then his insolence vanished all right old top he said easily but dont cut off your nose to spite your face remember i promised if youd stick to me youd wear goldbeaded moccasins he set off at a trot with the dogs following this fellow harkness had come with the first snow into nome bearing news of a strike on the kobuk and despite his braggadocio he had made rather a good impression that luck which favors fools and fakers had guided him straight to folsom he had appeared at a psychological moment in the latters affairs two disastrous seasons having almost broken folsom and rendered him eager to grasp at anything which promised quick returns moreover the latter had just had a serious quarrel with his wife harkness had offered a half interest in his kobuk claims for a grubstake and a working partner and smarting under the unaccustomed sting of domestic infelicity the other had accepted feeling sure in his own mind that lois would not let him leave her when the time came to go but the time had come and lois had offered no objection she had acted strangely to be sure but she had made no effort to dissuade him it seemed as if the proposal to separate for the winter had offended rather than frightened her well that was the way with women there was no pleasing them when you tried to do the decent thing by them they pretended to misunderstand your motives if you paid them the compliment of utter confidence they abused it on the pretext that you didnt love them if you allowed your jealousy to show they were offended at your lack of trust so ran the husbands thoughts he hoped that six months of widowhood would teach lois her own mind but it hurt to hit the trail with nothing more stimulating than a listless kiss and a chill request to write when convenient now that he was on his way he began to think of the pranks played by malicious nature during the long dark nights and to wonder if he had acted wisely in teaming up with this footless adventurer he remembered the malice that rides the winter winds the mischief that comes to arctic widows and he grew apprehensive the travelers put up that night at the tin roadhouse a comfortless shack sheathed with flattened kerosene cans and folsoms irritation at his new partner increased for harkness was loud boastful and blatantly egotistical with the egotism that accompanies dense ignorance the weather held cold the snow remained as dry as sand so they made slow progress and the husband had ample time to meditate upon his wrongs but the more he considered them the less acutely they smarted him and the gentler became his thoughts of lois the solitudes were healing his hurt the open air was cooling his anger at kougarok city a miserable huddle of cottonwood cabins harkness escaped his partners watchful eye and got drunk folsom found the fellow clinging to the bar and entertaining a crowd of loafers with his absurd boastings in a white fury he seized the wretch dragged him from the room and flung him into his bunk then stood guard over him most of the night it was during the quieter hours when the place rumbled to snores that folsom yielded to his desire to write his wife a desire which had been growing steadily he was disgusted with harkness disappointed with the whole kobuk enterprise and in a peculiarly softened mood therefore he wrote with no attempt to conceal his yearning homesick tenderness but when he read the letter in the morning it struck him as weak and sentimental just the sort of letter he would regret having written if it should transpire that lois did not altogether share his feelings so he tore it up those were the days of faint trails and poor accommodations as yet the road to the arctic was little traveled and imperfectly known so harkness acted as guide he had bragged that he knew every inch of the country but he soon proved that his ideas of distance were vague and faulty a serious shortcoming in a land with no food no shelter and no firewood except green willows in the gulchbottoms folsom began to fear that the fellows sense of direction was equally bad and taxed him with it but harkness scoffed at the idea leaving the last roadhouse behind them they came into a hilly section of great white domes high hogbacks and ramifying creeks each one exactly like its neighbor two days travel through this according to harkness should have brought them to the imnachuck where there was food and shelter again but when they pitched camp for the second night folsom felt compelled to remind his partner that they were behind their schedule and that this was the last of their grub are you sure youre going right he inquired sure of course im sure dyou think im lost folsom fed some twisted willowtops into the sheetiron stove i wouldnt recommend you as a pathfinder said he you said wed sleep out one night this is two and tomorrow well walk hungry well dont blame me challenged the other im going slow on your account now nothing could have galled folsom more than a reflection upon his ability to travel his lips whitened he was upon the point of speaking his mind but managed to check himself in time harknesss personality rasped him to the raw and he had for days struggled against an utterly absurd but insistent desire to seize the little coxcomb by the throat and squeeze the arrogance out of him as juice is squeezed out of a lemon there is flesh for which ones fingers itch i notice youre ready to camp when i am the larger man muttered understand this is no nice place to be without grub for its liable to storm any hour and storms last at this season now dont get cold feet harkness could be maddeningly patronizing when he chose leave it to me ill take you a short cut and well eat lunch in a cabin tomorrow noon but noon of the next day found harkness still plodding up the river with the dogs close at his heels the hills to the northward were growing higher and folsoms general knowledge of direction told him that they were in danger of going too far i think the imnachuck is over there said he harkness hesitated then he nodded righto its just over that low saddle he indicated a sweeping hillside ahead and a halfmile further on he left the creek and began to climb this was heavy work for the dogs and midafternoon came before the partners had gained the summit only to discover that they were not upon a saddleback after all but upon the edge of a vast rolling tableland from which a fanlike system of creeks radiated in all directions was a desolate waste of barren peaks folsom saw that the sky ahead was thick and dark as if a storm impended and realizing only too well the results of the slightest error in judgment he called to harkness but the latter pretended not to hear and took advantage of the dogs fatigue to hurry out of earshot it was some time before the team overhauled him do you know where you are folsom inquired certainly harkness studied the panorama spread before him that blue gulch yonder is the imnachuck he pointed to a valley perhaps four miles away a fine snow began to sift downward the mountain peaks to the northward became obscured as by thin smoke the afternoon shortened with alarming swiftness night up here with a blizzard brewing was unthinkable so after a while the driver called another halt something informs me that youre completely lost he said mildly who me there she is harkness flung out a directing hand once more folsom hesitated battling with his leaping desires and upon that momentary hesitation hinged results out of all proportions to the gravity of the situation issues destined to change the deepest channels of his life folsom hesitated then he yielded to his impulse and the luxury of yielding made him drunk he walked around the sled removing his mittens with his teeth as he went without a word he seized his companion by the throat and throttled him until his eyes protruded and his face grew black and bloated he relaxed his stiff fingers finally then he shook the fellow back to consciousness just as i thought he cried harshly thats not the gulch you pointed out before youre lost and you wont admit it harkness pawed the air and fought for his breath there was abject terror in his eyes he reeled away but saw there was no safety in flight own up folsom commanded you said this was the way the pathfinder whimpered you made me turn off folsom uttered a growl and advanced a step whereupon his victim gurgled ddont touch me thats the imnachuck so help me god im im almost sure it is almost the speaker stooped for his mittens and shook the snow out of them he was still struggling to control himself look here mr knowitall ive never been here before and you have somewhere in your thick skull there must be some faint remembrance of the country you got us into this fix and im going to give you one more chance to get us out of it dont try to think with your head let your feet think for you and maybe theyll carry you to the right gulch if they dont folsom scanned the brooding heavens and his lips compressed were in for a storm and well never weather it take one look while theres light to see by then turn your feet loose and pray that they lead you right for if they dont by god ill cut you loose it soon proved that memory lay neither in harknesss head nor in his feet when he had veered aimlessly about for half an hour evidently fearing to commit himself to a definite course and when the wind came whooping down rolling a twilight smother ahead of it folsom turned his dogs into the nearest depression and urged them to a run the grade increased soon brittle willowtops brushed against the speeding sled this brush grew higher as the two men blinded now by the gale stumbled onward behind the team they emerged from the gulch into a wider valley after a while and a mile further on the dogs burst through a grove of cottonwoods and fetched up before a lighted cabin window harkness pulled back his parka hood and cried boastfully what did i tell you i knew where i was all the time then he went in leaving his partner to unhitch the team and care for it friendships ripen and enmities deepen quickly on the trail seeds of discord sprout and flourish in the cold folsoms burst of temper had served to inflame a mutual dislike and as he and harkness journeyed northward that dislike deepened into something akin to hatred for the men shared the same bed drank from the same pot endured the same exasperations nothing except their hope of mutual profit held them together in our careless search for cause and effect we are accustomed to attribute important issues to important happenings amazing consequences to amazing deeds as a matter of fact it is the trivial action the little thing the thing unnoticed and forgotten which bends our pathways and makes or breaks us harkness was a harebrained irresponsible person incapable of steadiness in thought or action too weak to cherish actual hatred too changeable to nurse a lasting grudge it is with such frail instruments that prankish fate delights to work and although he never suspected it the luxury of yielding to that sudden gust of passion cost folsom dear arrived finally at the kobuk the miner examined the properties covered by his option and impressed by the optimism of the men who had made the gold discovery he paid harkness the price agreed upon the deal completed he sent the fellow back to candle creek the nearest post for supplies folsoms mood had altogether changed by now so strangling his last doubt of lois he wrote her as he had written at kougarok city and intrusted the letter to his associate harkness promptly upon his arrival at candle got drunk he stayed drunk for three days and it was not until he was well started on his way back to the kobuk that he discovered folsoms letter still in his pocket now to repeat the man was not malicious neither was he bad but as he debated whether he should backtrack there came to him the memory of his humiliation on the imnachuck divide so his brains were in his feet eh folsom had strangled him until he kicked when all the time they had been on the right trail harkness felt a flash of rage like the flare of loose gunpowder and in the heat of it he tore the letter to atoms it was a womanish spiteful thing to do and he regretted it but later when he greeted the husband he lied circumstantially and declared he had given the missive into the hands of the mailcarrier on the very hour of his departure by this time doubtless it was nearly to nome soon thereafter harkness forgot all about the incident folsom was a fast worker he hired men and crosscut the most promising claim bedrock was shallow and he soon proved it to be barren so he went on to the next property when he had prospected this claim with no better results than before he wrote his wife confessing doubts of the district and voicing the fear that his winters work would be wasted again he let his pen run as it would the letter he gave to a neighbor who was leaving for candle creek in the morning folsoms neighbor was a famous musher a seasoned selfreliant man thoroughly accustomed to all the hazards of winter travel but ten miles from his destination he crossed an inchdeep overflow which rendered the soles of his mukluks slippery and ten yards further on where the wind had laid the glareice bare he lost his footing he fell and wrenched his ankle and came hobbling into candle half an hour after the monthly mail for nome had left three weeks later folsom wrote his wife for the third time and again a month after that all three letters joined company in candle creek for meanwhile the mailmans lead dog had been killed in a fight with a big malamute at lanes landing causing its owner to miss a trip now dogfights are common by no logic could one attribute weighty results to the loss of a sixtypound leader but in this instance it so happened that the mailcarriers schedule suffered so that his contract was canceled meanwhile a lonely woman waited anxiously in nome and as the result of a strangers spite a wet mukluk and a vicious malamute her anxiety turned to bitterness and distrust it is never difficult to forward mail in the north for every musher is a postman when news came to candle creek that the government service had been discontinued the storekeeper one end of whose bar served as postoffice sacked his accumulated letters and intrusted them to some friends who were traveling southward on the morrow the trader was a canny man but he loved to gamble so when his friends offered to bet him that they could lower the record from candle to nome he went out into the night sniffed the air and studied the stars then laid them a hundred dollars that they could not excited to recklessness by this wager the volunteer mailmen cut down their load they left their stove and tent and grubbox behind planning to make a roadhouse every night except during the long jump from the imnachuck to crooked river they argued that it was worth a hundred dollars to sleep once under the open sky the fruits of that sporting enterprise were bitter the trader won his bet but he never cashed it in somewhere out on the high barrens a storm swooped down upon the travelers to one who has never faced an arctic hurricane it seems incredible that strong men have died within call of cozy cabins or have frozen with the lashings of their sleds but half untied yet it is true the sudden awful cold the shouting wind the boiling blinding suffocating rush of snow the sweaty clothes that harden into jointless armor the stiff mittens and the clumsy hands inside these tell a tale to those who know the two mailcarriers managed to get into their sleepingbags but the gale instead of drifting them over with a protective mantle of snow scoured the mountainside bare to the brittle reindeer moss and they began to freeze where they lay some twenty hours they stood it then they rose and plunged ahead of the hurricane like bewildered cattle the strongest man gave up first and lay down babbling of things to eat his companion buried him still alive and broke down the surrounding willowtops for a landmark then he staggered on by some miracle of good luck or as a result of some unsuspected power of resistance he finally came raving into the crooked river roadhouse when the wind subsided they hurried him to nome but he was frightfully maimed and as a result of his amputations he lay gabbling until long after the spring breakup folsom did not write again in fact when no word came from lois he bitterly regretted the letters he had written he heard indirectly from her newcomers from nome told him that she was well but that was all it was enough he did not wish to learn more spring found him with barely enough money to pay his way back he was blue bitter disheartened but despite the certainty that his wife had forsaken him he still cherished a flickering hope of a reconciliation strangely enough he considered no scheme of vengeance upon the other man for he was sane and healthy and he loved lois too well to spoil her attempt at happiness it so happened that the arctic ice opened up later this spring than for many seasons therefore the short summer was well under way before the first steamschooner anchored off the kobuk folsom turned his back upon the wreck of his high hopes his mind solely engaged with the problem of how to meet lois and ascertain the truth without undue embarrassment to her and humiliation to himself the prospect of seeing her of touching her of hearing her voice affected him painfully he could neither eat nor sleep on the way to nome but paced the deck in restless indecision he had come to consider himself wholly to blame for their misunderstanding and he wished only for a chance to win back her love with no questions asked and no favors granted when there were less than fifty miles to go the steamer broke her shaft there was no particular reason why that shaft should break but break it did and for eighteen hours eighteen eternities to folsom the ship lay crippled while its engineroom crew labored manfully folsom had been so long in the solitudes that nome looked like a big city when he finally saw it there were several ships in the roadstead and one of them was just leaving as the kobuk boat came to anchor she made a splendid sight as she gathered way the returning miner went ashore in the first dory and as he stepped out upon the sand a friend greeted him hello there old settler where you been all winter ive been to the kobuk folsom told him kobuk i hear shes a bum bum is right maybe shell do to dredge some day too bad you missed the oregon there she goes now the man pointed seaward too bad sure dont you know why miz folsom went out on her folsom halted after a momentary pause he repeated vaguely went out exactly didnt you know she was going oh yes of course the oregon folsom stared at the fading plume of black smoke there was a curious brightness in his eyes his face was white beneath its tan she sailed on the oregon and i missed her by an hour that broken shaft he began to laugh and turning his back upon the sea he plodded heavily through the sand toward the main street folsom found no word from his wife his house was empty but he learned that the man had also gone to the states and he drew his own conclusions since lois had ordered her life as she saw fit there was nothing to do but wait and endure doubtless the divorce would come in time nevertheless he could not think of that broken shaft without raving being penniless he looked for work and his first job came from a small jewish merchant named guth who offered him a hundred dollars to do the assessment work on a tundra claim for twenty days folsom picked holes through frozen muck wondering why a thrifty person like guth would pay good money to hold such unpromising property as this the claim was in sight of nome and as folsom finished his last days labor he heard bells ringing and whistles blowing and discovered that the town was ablaze he hurried in to find that an entire block in the business center of the city had been destroyed and with it guths little store including all its contents he found the jew in tears what a misfortune wailed the merchant ruined absolutely and by a match it started in my store my little girl you understand and now all gone he tore his beard and the tears rolled down his cheeks the little mans grief was affecting and so folsom inquired more gently than he intended im sorry of course but how about my money for the lulu assessment money theres your money guth pointed sadly into the smoldering ruins go find it youre welcome to anything i have left gott what a country how can a man get ahead with no insurance folsom laughed mirthlessly his hard luck was becoming amusing and he wondered how long it would last he had counted on that hundred dollars to get away from nome hoping to shake misfortune from his heels but a match in the hands of a child like that broken propeller shaft had worked havoc with his plans well it was useless to cry to the despairing hebrew he said dont lose your grip old man buck up and take another start you have your wife and your little girl at least and youre the sort who makes good you think so guth looked up grateful for the first word of encouragement he had heard its a cinch only dont lose your courage i ill do whats right by you mr folsom declared the other ill deed you a half interest in the lulu but folsom shook his head i dont want it theres nothing there except moss and muck and salmon berries and its a mile to bedrock no youre welcome to my share maybe you can sell the claim for enough to make a new start or to buy grub for the wife and the kid ill look for another job for a month or more the lonesome husband stevedored wrestling freight on the lighters then he disappeared he left secretly in the night for by now he had grown fanciful and he dared to hope that he could dodge his nemesis he turned up in fairbanks a thousand miles away and straightway lost himself in the hills he had not covered his tracks however for bad luck followed him now no man starves in alaska for there is always work for the ablebodied but whatever folsom turned his hand to failed and by and by his courage went he had been a man of consequence in nome he had made money and he had handled other men therefore his sense of failure was the bitterer meanwhile somewhere in him there remained the ghost of his faith in lois the faintly flickering hope that some day they would come together again it lay dormant in him like an irreligious mans unacknowledged faith in god and a hereafter but it too vanished when he read in a seattle newspaper already three months old the announcement of his wifes divorce he flinched when he read that it had been won on the grounds of desertion and thereafter he shunned newspapers spring found him broke as usual he had become bad company and men avoided him it amused him grimly to learn that a new strike had been made in nome the biggest discovery in the camps history and to realize that he had fled just in time to miss the opportunity of profiting by it he heard talk of a prehistoric seabeach line a streak of golden sands which paralleled the shore and lay hidden below the tundra mud news came of overnight fortunes of friends grown prosperous and mighty embittered anew folsom turned again to the wilderness and he did not reappear until the summer was over he came to town resolved to stay only long enough to buy bacon and beans but he had lost his pocket calendar and arrived on a sunday when the stores were closed even so little a thing as the loss of that calendar loomed big in the light of later events for in walking the streets he encountered a friend but just arrived from the behring coast the man recognized him despite his beard and his threadbare mackinaws and they had a drink together i spose you heard about that third beach line the newcomer inquired folsom nodded well theyve opened it up for miles and its just a boulevard of solid gold cap carters into it big and so are the obrien boys and old man hendricks theyre lousy with pay i did the work on a tundra claim said folsom the lulu the lulu folsoms friend stared at him havent you heard about the lulu my god where you been anyhow why the lulus a mint guth is a millionaire and he made it all without turning a finger folsoms grip on the barrail tightened until his knuckles were white im telling you right old man hes the luckiest jew in the country he let a lay to mccarthy and olson and they took out six hundred thousand dollars after christmas guth offered me a half interest in the lulu when his store burned and i turned it down hes never paid me for that assessment work the nomeite was speechless with amazement the sonofagun he said finally well you can collect now say thats what he meant when he told me he wanted to see you guth was down to the boat when i left and he says if you see folsom up river tell him to come back i got something for him those were his very words that little jew aims to pay you a rotten hundred so you wont sue him for an interest by gorry i wouldnt take it id go back and make him do the right thing id sue him id bust him in the nose a half interest in the lulu my god the speaker gulped his drink hastily after consideration folsom said hell do the right thing guth isnt a bad sort no but hes a jew trust him to get his i wouldnt ask him to do more than pay his debt you see i refused his offer what of that id give it a try anyhow and see if he wouldnt settle theres lots of lawyers would take your case but say thats the toughest toughluck story i ever heard youve sure got a jinx on you im going back but i wont sue guth im sick of alaska it has licked me im going out to gods country folsom indeed acknowledged himself beaten the narrow margin by which he had missed reward for his work and his hardships bred in him such hatred for alaska that he abruptly changed his plans he had no heart perversity had killed his courage it exasperated him beyond all measure to recall what little things his luck had hinged upon what straws had turned his feet a moment of pique with lois a broken piece of steel a match a momentary whim when guth offered him payment it was well that he did not know what part had been played by his quarrel with harkness that wet mukluk that vicious lead dog and the storekeepers wager folsom carried cordwood to pay for a deck passage down river he discovered en route that guth had really tried to get in touch with him and in fact appeared greatly concerned over his failure to do so for at tanana he received another message and again at st michaels he was grimly amused at the little jews craftiness yet it sorely offended him to think that any one should consider him such a welcher he had no intention of causing trouble for he knew he had no legal claim against the fellow and he doubted if he possessed even a moral right to share in the lulus riches to play upon the hebrews fears therefore savored of extortion nevertheless he was in no agreeable frame of mind when he arrived at his destination and inquired for guth the newmade millionaire was in his office folsom walked in unannounced he had expected his arrival to create a scene and he was not disappointed but guths actions were strange they left the new arrival dazed for the little man fell upon him with what appeared to be exuberant manifestations of joy mr folsom he cried you have come you got my letters eh well i wrote you everywhere but i was in despair for i thought you must be dead nobody knew what had become of you i got your message in fairbanks you heard about the lulu eh gott shes a dandy yes i can hardly believe it so youre rich well i congratulate you and now i can use that hundred guth chuckled ha you will have your joke eh but the lulu is no joke come we will go to the bank i want them to tell you how much she has yielded youll blame me for leasing her but how was i to know what she was i why should i blame folsom stared at the speaker its none of my business what the lulu has yielded in fact ill sleep better if i dont know little guth paused and his mouth opened after a moment he inquired curiously dont you understand there was another pause then he said quietly im a man of my word folsom suddenly saw black the room began to spin he passed his hand across his eyes wait lets get this straight he whispered it is all very simple guth told him we are equal partners in the lulu we have been ever since the day my store burned it was a little thing you said to me then but the way you said it the fact that you didnt blame me gave me new heart did you think id renig when folsom found no answer the other nodded slowly i see you probably said that guth is a jew and hell do me up if he can well i am a jew yes and i am proud of it but i am an honest man too like you folsom turned to the wall and hid his face in the crook of his arm but with his other hand he groped for that of the hebrew the story of the lulu is history now in all the north that mine is famous for it made half a dozen fortunes in a daze half doubting the reality of things folsom watched a golden stream pour into his lap all that winter and the next summer the lulu yielded wondrously but one of the partners was not happy his thoughts being ever of the woman who had left him prosperity gave him courage however and when he discovered that lois had not remarried he determined to press his luck as a gambler should when the second seasons sluicing was over and the ground had frozen he went outside the day after he sailed lois arrived in nome on the last boat she was older graver she had heard of the lulu but it was not that which had brought her back she had returned in spite of the lulu to solve an aching mystery and to learn the why of things her husbands riches she still considered him her husband merely made the task more trying advised that folsom had passed almost within hailing distance of her she pressed her lips together and took up her problem of living the prospect of another lonely alaskan winter frightened her and yet because of the lulu she could not return by the ship she had come on now that folsom was a croesus she could not follow him too closely he might misunderstand after all she reflected it mattered little to her where she lived guth called at her cabin but she managed to avoid seeing him and somehow continued to avoid a meeting late in december some travelers from candle creek while breaking a short cut to the head of crooked river came upon an abandoned sled and its impedimenta snow and rain and summer sun had bleached its wood its runners were red streaks of rust its rawhide lashings had been eaten off but snugly rolled inside the tarpaulin was a sack of mail this mail the travelers brought in with them and the nome newspapers in commenting upon the find reprinted the story of that tragic fight for life in the arctic hurricane now almost forgotten folsoms three letters reached their destination on christmas day they were stained and yellow and blurred in places for they were three years old but the woman read them with eyes wide and wondering and with heartbeats pounding for it seemed that dead lips spoke to her ten minutes later she was standing at guths door and when he let her in she behaved like one demented she had the letters hidden in her bosom and she would not let him see them but she managed to make known the meaning of her coming you know him she cried hysterically you made him rich youve lived alongside of him tell me then has he has he changed these letters are old does he still care or does he hate me as he should guth smiled he took her shaking hands in his his voice was gentle no no he doesnt hate you he has never mentioned your name to me or to any one else so far as i know but his money hasnt satisfied him he is sad and he wants you that is what took him to the states im sure lois sank into a chair her face was white her twisting fingers strained at each other i cant understand i cant make head or tail of it she moaned it seems that i wronged him but see what ruin he has made for me why why who can understand the why of anything inquired the little hebrew ive heard him curse the perversity of little things and rave at what he called the malice of the north wind i didnt dare to ask him what he meant but i knew he was thinking of the evil which had come between you two who was to blame or what separated you he never told me well his bad luck has changed and yours too and im happy now then the wireless you can talk to him let us go an hour later a crackling message was hurled into the empty christmas sky a message that pulsed through the voids was relayed over ice and brine and drifted forests to a lonely brooding man three thousand miles away the answer came rushing back thank god am starting north tomorrow love and a million kisses wait for me folsom came neither ice nor snow neither winter seas nor trackless wastes could daunt him for youth was in his heart and fire ran through his veins north and west he came by a rimy little steamer as fast as coal could drive her then overland more than fifteen hundred miles his record stands unbroken and in villages from katmai to the kuskokwim the indians tell of the tall white man with the team of fifteen huskies who raced through as if a demon were at his heels how he bored headlong into the blizzards and braved januarys fiercest rage how his guides dropped and his dogs died in their collars that was how folsom came he was thin and brown the marks of the frost were bitten deep into his flesh when one evening in early march he drove into nome he had covered sixty miles on the last days run and his team was staggering he left the dogs in their harnesses where they fell and bounded through the highbanked streets to loiss cabin it was growing dark a light gleamed from her window folsom glimpsed her moving about inside he paused to rip the ice from his bearded lips then he knocked softly three times as he stood there a gentle north wind fanned him it was deadly cold but it was fresh and clean and vastly invigorating there was no malice in it at his familiar signal he heard the clatter of a dish dropped from nerveless fingers he heard a startled voice cry out his name then he pressed the latch and entered smiling his stock in trade the science of salesmanship is quite as exact as the science of astronomy said mr gross casting his eyes down the table to see that he had the attention of the other boarders and much more intricate the successful salesman is as much an artist in his line as the man who paints pictures or writes books oh theres nothing so artistic as writing books protested miss harris the manicurist nothing except acting perhaps actors are artistic too but salesmen i meet lots in my business and im not strong for them mr gross smiled at her indulgently it was an expression that became him well and he had rehearsed it often the power to sell goods is a talent my dear miss harris just like the power to invent machinery or to rule a city or or to keep a set of books dont you agree with me mrs green mrs green the landlady a brown gray woman in black smiled frigidly youre so original mr gross said she its a pleasure to hear you im sure gross was an impressive talker due to the fact that he plagiarized office platitudes he ran on pompously dropping trade mottoes and shopworn bits of philosophy until young mitchell unable longer to endure the light of admiration he saw in miss harriss eyes rolled up his napkin to the size of a croquette and interrupted by noisily shoving back his chair and muttering under his breath that stuff comes on printed cards they give it away mrs green called to him its bread pudding mr mitchell and very nice thanks my gout is bad again he said at which some of the more frivolousminded boarders snickered mitchell is a bright boy in many ways gross remarked a moment later but hes too fresh i dont think hell last long at the office instead of climbing to his hall kennel on the fourth floor rear louis mitchell went out upon the rusty little porch of the boardinghouse and sat down on the topmost step reflecting gloomily that a clerk has small chance against a head bookkeeper life at mrs greens pension she called it that rates six dollars up terms six dollars down had not been the same for the youthful hermit of the hall bedroom since gross had met him and miss harris in the park a few sundays before and falling under the witchery of the manicurists violet eyes had changed his residence to coincide with theirs gross now occupied one of the front rooms and a corresponding place in the esteem of those less fortunate boarders to whom the mere contemplation of ten dollars a week was an extravagance mitchell had long adored the blonde manicurist but once the same roof sheltered her and the magnificent head bookkeeper he saw his dream of love and two furnished rooms with kitchenette go glimmering time was when miss harris had been content with sundays in the park vaudeville first balcony on wednesdays and a moving picture now and then these lavish attentions coupled with an occasional assault upon some delicatessen establishment had satisfied her cravings for the higher life now that gross had appeared and sown discord with his prodigality she no longer cared for animals and band concerts she had acquired the orchestraseat habit had learned to dance and above all she now possessed a subtle refinement in regard to victuals she criticized marlowes acting and complained that cold food gave her indigestion no longer did she sit the summer evenings out with mitchell holding his hand in her lap and absentmindedly buffing his nails warning him in sweet familiarity that his cuticle was growing down in consequence of her defection fierce resentment smoldered in the young mans breast he was jealous he longed to outsquander the extravagant mr gross he lusted to spend money in unstinted quantities five dollars an evening if or when necessary but there seemed little hope of his ever attaining such a purseproud position for while he loomed fairly large in the boardinghouse atmosphere of ohio street or had so loomed until the advent of the reckless bookkeeper he was so small a part of the office force of comer mathison jobbers of railway supplies as to resemble nothing multiplied by itself he received twelve dollars a week to be sure for making telephone quotations and extending invoices between times but when as the evening shadows of payday descended and he drew his envelope the procedure reminded him vaguely of blackmail for any officeboy who did not stutter could have held his job when at seven fortyfive miss harris appeared upon the porch with her hat and gloves and twodollarticket air and tripped gaily away in company with mr gross young mitchell realized bitterly that the cost of living had increased and that it was up to him to raise his salary or lose his lady he recalled grosss words at suppertime and wondered if there really could be a science to business if there could be anything to success except hard work mr comer in his weekly talks to the office force had repeatedly said so whence the origin of the bookkeepers warmedover wisdom but mitchells duties were so simple and so constricted as to allow no opening for science or so at least it seemed to him how could he be scientific how could he find play for genius when he sat at the end of a telephone wire and answered routine questions from a card every day the general railway sales manager gave him a pricelist of the commodities which c m handled and when an inquiry came over the phone all he was required all he was permitted to do was to read the figures and to quote time of delivery if this resulted in an order the sales manager took the credit an open quotation on the other hand made mitchell the subject of brusque criticism for offering a target to competitors and when he lost an order he was the goat not the general railway sales manager no one around the office was too lowly to exact homage from the quotation clerk and no one was tonguetied in the matter of criticism hence his position was neither one of dignity nor one that afforded scope for talent in the moneymaking line and yet if salesmanship really were a science mitchell reasoned there must be some way in which even a switchboard operator could profit by acquiring it what if he were buckled to the end of a wire human nature is the same face to face or voice to voice surely then if he set his mind to the task he could make himself more than a mere string of words over a telephone heretofore he had been working wholly with his fingers his eardrums and his vocal cords he determined henceforth to exercise his intelligence if he had any it was indeed high time for miss harris was undoubtedly slipping away lured by luxuries no clerk could afford and moreover he mitchell was growing old in a scant two years he would be able to vote he began forthwith to analyze the situation there wasnt much to it his telephone calls came almost wholly from the purchasing departments of the various railroads daily requisitions were filled by the stenographers in those railway offices young ladies who through their long experience were allowed to attend to the more unimportant purchases it was in quoting prices on these pickups that mitchell helloed for eight hours a day of course no large orders ever came over his wire but this small business carried an unusual profit for supply houses like comer mathison and in consequence it was highly prized after a period of intense and painful thought the young man realized for the first time that it was not the telephone itself which asked for price and time of delivery but a weak imaginative human being like himself at the other end of the wire he reasoned further that if he could convince that person that the voice from conner mathison likewise issued from a human throat then it might be possible to get away in a measure at least from the mechanical part of the business and establish altogether new relations if there were really a science to salesmanship it would work at long distance as well as at collarandelbow holds and mitchells first task therefore should be to project his own personality into the railroad offices he went to bed still trying to figure the matter out his opportunity to test his newborn theory came on the following morning when an irritable female voice over at the santa fй asked the price on twenty kegs of rivets good morning santa female he answered cheerily there was a moment of amazed silence then the young lady snapped good morning what is this the weather bureau i want comer mathison gee cant a fellow display a little courtesy in business mitchell inquired id rather be nice to you than not all right mr comer the voice replied sarcastically make a nice price on those rivets and cut out the kidding listen my names not comer its mitchell im not kidding either i want you to ask for me whenever you call up every little bit helps you know oh i see you want the carriage man to call your number all right mitch if youre out at lunch with mr carnegie the next time i want a dozen number ten sheets ill have you paged at the union league club if the speaker liked this kind of blank verse she had called up the right supply house for mitchell came back with say if i ever get your number ill do the calling miss santa fй wwhat came the startled reply i mean what i say id love to call is that so well i do all the calling for our family and im going to call you right now whats the price of those rivets two sixtyfive too high goodby wait a minute mitchell checked the lady before she could plug out on him now that youve got those rivets out of your system may i get personal for an instant just about an instant i could listen to you all day oops horace he loves me mocked the ladys voice see here im a regular person with references ive been talking to you every day for six months so i feel that were acquainted some pleasant evening when your crew of hammock gladiators palls on you let me come around and show you the difference what difference ill show you what a real porchclimber is like indeed ill think it over ten minutes later miss santa fe called up again hello i want mitchell the junior partner this is mitchell did you say those rivets were twofifty should they be they should they are ship them to trinidad thats bully of you miss santa claus i want to but the wire was dead mitchell grinned personality did count after all and he had proved that it could be projected over a copper wire an hour later when miss northwestern called him for a price on staybolt iron she did not ring off for fifteen minutes and at the end of that time she promised to take the first opportunity of having another chat in a similar manner once the ice had been broken at the c ei mitchell learned that the purchasing agent was at west baden on his vacation that he had stomach trouble and was cranky that the speaker loved music particularly chaminade and george cohan although beethoven had written some good stuff that shed been to grand haven on sunday with her cousin who sold hats out of cleveland and was a prince with his money but drank and that the price on corrugated iron might be raised ten cents without doing any damage on the following afternoon murphy the railroad sales manager stopped on his way past mitchells desk to inquire say have you been sending orchids to miss dunlap over at the santa fe i was in there this morning and she wanted to know all about you did you boost me louis inquired it wont hurt your sales to plug my game she said you and she are buddies over the wire what did she mean oh wire pals thats all what kind of a looker is she mr murphy the sales manager shrugged his shoulders she looks as if she was good to her mother then he sauntered away mitchell in the days that followed proceeded to become acquainted with the big four and in a short time was so close to the lackawanna that he called her phoebe snow the st paul asked for him three times in one afternoon and the rock island chancing to ring up while he was busy threatened to hang crкpe on the roundhouse if he were not summoned immediately to enter an order for a manhole crab within a week he became the most thoroughly telephoned person in the office and had learned the tastes the hopes the aims and the ambitions of his respective customers miss c ei for instance whose real name was gratz was a bug on music miss northwestern was literary she had read everything marion crawford ever wrote and considered her the greatest writer indiana had produced but was sorry to learn from mitchell that her marriage to capt jack crawford had turned out so unhappily some men were brutes werent they there was a hidden romance gnawing at the big fours heart and phoebe snow had a picture of james k hackett on her desk and wanted to start a poultry farm the santa fй had been married once but had taken her maiden name it was so much pleasanter in business as mitchells telephone orders piled up day after day murphy began to treat him more like an employee than a hand and finally offered him a moderate expense account if he cared to entertain his railroad trade when the young mans amazement at this offer had abated sufficiently for him to accept he sent the officeboy around to the santa fe on the run instructing him to size up miss dunlap and report it was the first order he had ever issued in the office and the news spread quickly that he had been raised mr gross took occasion to congratulate the despised underling with pompous insincerity whereat louis admonished him scowlingly to beat it back to his trial balance or hed bounce a letterpress on his dome when the officeboy reappeared he turned in a laconic report shes a peach mitchell sweated the lad for further details then nearly strained a tendon in getting to the telephone booth hello miss dunlap he called are you tied up for tonight im knot the k is silent will you go to the theater with me nickelodeon no montgomery and stone the lady muttered something unintelligible then she tittered nervously those top balconies make me dizzy how about the orchestra sixth row could you keep your head there you must own a billboard no its a bankbook same initials you see im an heiress see here mitch miss dunlap became serious youre a good little copperwire comedian but i dont know you nor your people well i come from one of the oldest families in atwood michigan and that town was settled over thirty years ago but you dont know me the lady demurred i do too youre a tall blonde gray eyes blue dress you have a dimple well i declare all right then seventhirty tonight six hundred and twelve filbert street fourth apartment and many thanks fifteen minutes before the appointed time louis mitchell was fidgeting nervously outside the filbert street coldwater walkup known as geraldine manor wondering if miss dunlap would notice his clothes twelve dollars a week had starved his wardrobe until it resembled the backdrop for a pity the blind card but promptly on the minute he punched the button at the fourth apartment an instant later he realized that no matter how he looked he had it on miss dunlap by eighty per cent she was a blonde to be sure for the time being and by the grace of ho one glance convinced her caller of two things viz that his officeboy did not care much for peaches and that the santa fй purchasing agent had a jealous wife the most that possibly could be said in praise of miss dunlaps appearance was that she was the largest stenographer in chicago then and there however her caller qualified as a salesman he smiled and he chatted in a free and easy way that had the lady roped thrown and lashed to his chariot in three minutes by her alarmclock they went to the theater and when montgomery sprang a joke or stone did a fall miss dunlap showed her appreciation after the fashion of a laughing hyena between times she barked enthusiastically giving vent to sounds like those caused when a boy runs past a picket fence with a stick in his hand she gushed but so does old faithful anyhow the audience enjoyed her greatly at supper mitchell secured parking space for his companion at the union cafй and there he learned how a welsh rabbit may be humiliated by a woman during the dйbвcle he fingered the money in his pocket then shut his eyes and ordered a bottle of champagne just to see if it could be done contrary to his expectation the waiter did not swoon nor was he arrested rootbeer had been mitchells main intoxicant heretofore but as he and the noisy miss dunlap sipped the effervescing wine over their icecream they pledged themselves to enjoy monday evenings together and she told him frankly mitch youre the nickelplated entertainer and ill never miss another monday eve unless im in the shops or the roundhouse you certainly have got class at breakfast miss harris regarded lotus darkly for mr gross had told her just enough to excite her curiosity where were you last night she inquired i went to a show were the pictures good they dont have pictures at the grand oh h the manicurists violet eyes opened wide louis you drank something youre awful pale what was it clicquot thats my favorite brand miss harris clutched the tablecloth and pulled a dish into her lap after a moment she said maybe youll take me somewhere tonight we havent been out together for the longest time oh i see this is grosss night at the maccabbees isnt it louis gloated brutally over her confusion sorry but ill probably have to entertain some more customers the firm is keeping me busy at the office things went most pleasantly for the next few weeks sixty per cent of the citys railroad business came to comer mathison the clerks began to treat mitchell as if he were an equal even gross lost his patronizing air and became openly hateful while murphy louis no longer called him mister increased his assistants expense account and confided some of his family affairs to the latter mr comer the senior partner began to nod familiarly as he passed the quotation clerks desk nor were louiss customers all so eccentric as miss dunlap phoebe snow for instance was very easy to entertain and the northwestern took to his custody like a hungry urchin to a barbecue he gave them each one night a week and in a short time all his evenings were taken as a consequence of which he saw less and less of miss harris but although he and his manicurist were becoming strangers he soon began to call the waiters at rectors by their given names and a number of the more prominent cabdrivers waved at him one morning when for the tenth successive time he slid into his deskchair an hour late mr comer bowed to him not only familiarly but sarcastically then invited him to step into his private office and see if he could locate the center of the carpet it was a geometrical task that louis had been wishing to try for some time the senior partner began with elaborate sarcasm i notice youre not getting down until nine oclock lately mr mitchell is your automobile out of order i have no automobile mr comer the youth replied respectfully no im surprised well if eight sharp is too early you may set your time mitchell tried his best to appear disconcerted you know im busy every evening with my trade said he nonsense ive seen you out with a different dressmaker every night that ive been downtown those are not dressmakers they are stenographers from the railroad offices im sorry youre not satisfied with me but im glad you called me in for ive been meaning to speak to you about this very thing you see i have practically all the railroad business in the city and it takes too much of my time keeping it lined up i have no leisure of my own ill quit saturday night if convenient mr comer grunted like a man who has stepped off a flight of stairs one step too soon i didnt know it was really business of course if it is why you neednt quit exactly im afraid ill have to mitchell dropped his eyes demurely ive had a number of offers and in justice to myself offers you how much one hundred a month and expenses mr comer removed his glasses he polished them carefully then he readjusted them and leaned forward looking the young man over from head to foot as if he had never until this moment seen more than his vague outlines umm youre nineteen years old i believe yes sir well then an hours delay wont be serious now you go back to your desk and send mr murphy here ill let you know shortly whether saturday night or this noon will be convenient it was perhaps a halfhour before lunchtime when mr comer again called for mitchell greeting him with the gruff inquiry see here do you think im going to advance you from twelve to twentyfive a week at one clip no sir humph im not i had a talk with murphy i think hes a liar but im going to make it fifteen hundred a year and expenses now get busy and work your trade for all its worth young mitchells knees wabbled but having learned the value of a black mask and a gun he went through his victim thoroughly while he had him down id like a traveling position the first of the year sir if you dont mind all right if you hold your present gait ill give you the western roads anything else youd like well then git that day louis switched from the narrowcountered bakerylunch route to regular standardgauge restaurants he ordered clothes like a bookmakers bride and he sent a cubic foot of violets to miss harris at dinnertime he patronized mr gross so tantalizingly that the latter threatened to pull his nose out until it resembled a yard of garden hose the whole boardinghouse was agog at mitchells good fortune and miss harris smiled on him in a manner reminiscent of the good old antebookkeeper one might say antevellum days she hinted that mr grosss company did not wholly satisfy her soulhunger and even confessed that she was lonely but this was mitchells rock island evening and although the frank surrender in miss harriss eyes caused him to gasp as if he were slowly settling into a barrel of icewater he tore himself from her side louiss batting average would have reached one thousand had it not been for the monon miss day the young lady there had a vocabulary limited to hello too high and goodby and it became particularly galling to learn that the fellow at james naughtens was pulling down the business so mitchell went to murphy with a proposition which showed that his mental growth had kept pace with his financial advancement you need a new stenographer he declared oh do i why do i need a new stenographer mr bones well it would be a good investment and i know a corker who is she miss day of the monon i didnt know you cared for miss day i dont thats the reason i want her to work for you murphy coughed slightly then he agreed youre learning the game well give her a threedollar raise and take her on shortly thereafter mitchell began to get acquainted with the new miss monon along the right lines and gave her thursday nights she was a great improvement over miss day she was in fact quite different from any of the others she was small and winsome and she didnt care to run around she liked her home and so did mitchell after he had called a few times before long he began to look forward eagerly to thursday nights and miss monons cozy corner with its redplush cushions reminiscent of chaircars to be sure and its darkness illumined dimly by red and green signal lamps many a pleasant evening the two spent there talking of locomotive planished iron wire nails and turnbuckles and the late lunch miss monon served beat the systems regular buffet service a city block of course they lit the red fire in front of james naughtens and turned the green light mitchells way he had the right of way on the monon after that and other salesmen were sidetracked but this was too easy to last human affairs never run smoothly it is a mans ability to surmount the hummocks and the pressure ridges that enables him to penetrate to the polar regions of success the first inkling of disaster came to mitchell when miss dunlap began to tire of the gay life and chose to spend her monday evenings at home where they might be alone together she spoke of the domestic habits she had acquired during her brief matrimonial experience she boldly declared that marriage was the ideal state for any man and that two could live as cheaply as one although personally she saw no reason why a girl should quit work the instant she became a wife did he she confessed that monday evenings had become so pleasant that if louis could arrange to drop in on fridays also the week would be considerably brightened thereby and her whole disposition improved now fridays were cinched tightly to the big four but the young man dared not acknowledge it so he confessed that all his evenings except monday were taken up with night school whereupon miss dunlap in order to keep abreast of his mental development decided to take a correspondence course in esperanto it transpired also that his attentions toward the lackawanna had been misconstrued for one night when phoebe bade him adieu in the vestibule she broke down and wept upon his shoulder saying that his coldness hurt her she confessed that a rate clerk in the freight department wanted to marry her and she supposed shed have to accept his dastardly proposal because a girl couldnt go on working all her life could she then miss gratz of the c ei following a redletter night at grand opera succeeded by a german pancake and a stein at the edelweiss and a cabride home took louis gravely to task for his extravagance and hinted that he ought to have a permanent manager who took an interest in him one who loved music as he did and whose tastes were simple and teutonic when the literary lady of the northwestern declined a trip to the white city and began to read marion crawford aloud to him louis awoke to the gravity of the situation but before he had worked the matter out in his own mind that rate clerk of whom miss lackawanna had spoken dropped in at comer mathisons introduced himself to mitchell and told him with a degree of firmness which could not be ignored that his attentions to miss phoebe snow were distasteful he did not state to whom louiss caller had the physical proportions of a white hope and he wasted few words he had come to nail up a vacate notice and he announced simply but firmly that miss snows wednesday evenings were to be considered open time thereafter and if mitchell elected to horn his way in it was a hundredtoone shot that hed have to give up solid foods for a month or more and take his nourishment through a glass tube nor were the young mans troubles confined to the office miss harris it seemed had seen him with a different lady each night she and mr gross had been out and had drawn her own conclusions so therefore when he tried to talk to her she flared up and called him a dissipated rouй and threatened to have the head bookkeeper give him a thrashing if he dared to accost her again now the various apartments where mitchell had been calling these past months were opulently furnished with gifts from the representatives of the various railway supply houses of the city each article being cunningly designed to cement in the mind of the owner a source of supply which coupled with price and delivery would make for good sales service he was greatly surprised one day to receive a brass library lamp from the santa fй the initial destination of which had evidently been changed then came a mission hallclock in the original package redirected in the hand of miss gratz of the c ei and one day the officeboy from the lackawanna brought him a smokingset for which miss phoebe snow had no use gifts like these piled up rapidly many of them bearing witness to the fact that their consignment originated from mitchells very rivals in the railroad trade judging from the quantity of stuff that ricocheted from the santa fй it was miss dunlaps evident desire to present him with a whole housekeeping equipment as quickly as possible louiss desk became loaded with ornaments his room at mrs greens became filled with nearly wedgwood vases candlesticks and other bricаbrac he acquired six mission hallclocks a row of taborets stood outside of his door like turkish sentinels and his collection of ashreceivers was the best in chicago miss harris continued to ignore him however and he learned with a jealous pang that she was giving mr gross a gratuitous course of facial massage and scalp treatments no longer did mitchell entertain his trade they entertained him they tried to help him save his money and every evening he was forced to battle for his freedom in desperation he finally went to murphy begging quick promotion to a traveling position but the sales manager told him there was no chance before the first of the year then asked him why he had lost his grip on the lackawanna business as a matter of fact since miss phoebes rate clerk had declared himself mitchell had slipped a few wednesday nights trusting to hold the lackawanna trade by virtue of his past performances but he realized in the light of murphys catechism that eternal visiting is the price of safety he sighed therefore and called up the lady then apprehensively made a date that visit issued in disaster as he had feared the rate clerk gifted with some subtle second sight had divined his treachery and was waiting he came to meet the caller gladly like a paladin louis strove to disarm the big brute by the power of the human eye then when that did not work he explained politely earnestly that his weekly calls were but part and parcel of his business and that there was nothing in his mind so remote as thoughts of matrimony but the rate clerk was a stolid a suspicious person and he was gnawed by a low and common jealousy reason failing they came together amalgamating like two drops of quicksilver on the following morning mitchell explained to mr comer that in stepping out of the bathtub he had slipped and wrenched both shoulders then while passing through the dark hall had put his face into mourning by colliding with an open door his ankles he had sprained on the way downtown about ninethirty miss dunlap called up but not to leave an order when she had finally rung off louis looked dazedly at the wire to see if the insulation had melted it seemed impossible that rubber and guttapercha could withstand such heat as had come sizzling from the santa fй from what the lady had said it required no great inductive powers to reason that the rate clerk had told all coming victorious to miss lackawannas door to have his knuckles collodionized he had made known in coarse triumphant language the base commercialism of his rival the result had been that phoebe arose in her wrath just to verify the story she had called up the other railroad offices this morning and the hideous truth had come out it had come out like a herd of jackrabbits ahead of a hound miss dunlap was shouting mad but phoebe herself when she called up was indignant in a mean sarcastic manner that hurt the northwestern rang mitchell to say goodby forever and to hope his nose was broken the big four promised that her brother who was a puddler in the south chicago steel mills would run in and finish the rate clerks job miss gratz of the cei was tearfully plaintive and being german spoke of suicide of course all business relations with these offices were at an end during that whole day but one phone order came and that was from miss monon mitchell had been steeling himself to hear from her but it seemed that she took the whole thing as rather a good joke she told him she had known all the time why he came to see her and when he reminded her that it was thursday she invited him to call if he thought it worth while when he saw miss harris at suppertime and undertook to explain his black eyes she assured him coldly that he and his ebony giglamps mattered nothing in her young life as evidence of which she flashed a magnificent threequarter carat diamond solitaire on her third finger she and mr gross expected to be married inside of two or three years if all went well she told him at eight oclock disguised behind a pair of blue goggles louis headed for miss monons door glad that the cozy corner was so dimly lighted when he arrived she bathed his battlescarred features with hamamelis which is just the same as ponds extract but doesnt cost so much and told him the other girls had acted foolishly she was very sweet and gentle with him and young mitchell imperfect as was his vision saw something in her he had never seen before a week went by during which it seemed that all the railroads except the monon had suddenly gone out of business it was as if a strike had been declared another week passed and mitchells sales were scarcely noticeable so mr comer called him in to ask is your phone disconnected no sir do you know the price of our goods yes sir dont you sleep well at home yes sir then what has become of those pickups i seem to have lost my trade your trade bah young man youve been dissipating that expense account turned your head youve been blowing in our money on your friends and youve let your customers go if you cant hold the railroad business well get some fellow who can cut out your sewingcircle wine suppers and your box parties to the north shore dйbutantes and get busy youve got a week to make good one week there wasnt the slightest chance and mitchell told miss monon so when thursday came around he told her all about that promised position on the road and what it meant to him and then he told her that beginning monday hed have to hunt a new berth at twelve dollars per she was very quiet very sympathetic so sympathetic in fact that he told her some other things which no young man on a diminishing salary should tell she said little at the moment but she did considerable thinking and she got busy on her phone early the next morning the first number she called was the santa fйs when she had finished talking with miss dunlap that hempenhaired sentimentalist was dabbing her eyes with her handkerchief and blowing her nose assuring miss monon at the same time that she was a dear and that it was all right now that she knew the truth miss monon blushed prettily thanked her and confessed that she had felt it coming on for some time thereupon they took turns calling the others from the big four to the cei with the result that mitchells wire began to heat up phoebe snow called him to say that she hadnt meant what she said that he was a good old scout and that the rate clerk was sorry also and wanted to stand treat for a dutch lunch then she left an order for a ton and a half of engine bolts miss gratz cried a little when she heard mitchells voice and told him to make his own price on forty kegs of washers and suit himself about delivery miss dunlap confessed that it was her pride which had spoken and anyhow she knew altogether too much about marriage to take another chance shed rather have one man friend than three husbands one by one the flock returned and saturday night mitchell sent five pounds of chocolates and a sheaf of red roses to the one who had made it all come out right he got his share of business after that and when the holidays came they brought him his promotion murphy who knew most of the facts was the first to congratulate him jove he said that little monon lady saved your bacon didnt she by the way you never told me what her name was young mitchells cheeks assumed a shellpink shade as he replied it doesnt matter what her name was its mitchell now we were married yesterday and all the roads were represented at the wedding with bridges burned louis mitchell knew what the telegram meant even though it was brief and cryptic he had been expecting something of the sort ever since the bottom dropped out of the steel business and prices tobogganed forty dollars a ton nevertheless it came as an undeniable shock for he had hoped the firm would keep him on in spite of hard times he wondered as he sadly pocketed the yellow sheet whether he had in him the makings of a good lifeinsurance agent or if he had not better join out with a medicine show this message led him to think his talents must lie along the latter line certainly they did not lie in the direction of metal supplies he had plenty of time to think the situation over however for it is a long jump from butte to chicago when he arrived at the latter place he was certain of only one thing he would not stand a cut in salary either comer mathison would have to fire him outright or keep him on at his present wage he would not compromise as the other salesmen had done and were doing twentyfive hundred a year is a liberal piece of money where people raise their own vegetables but to a man traveling in the west it is about equal to no pair given two hundred dollars a month and a fair expense account a salesman can plow quite a respectable furrow around plymouth rock but out where they roll their rs and monogram their live stock he cant make a track besides the loss of prestige and all that went with it there was another reason why young mitchell could not face a cut he had a wife and she was too new too wonderful she admired him too greatly to permit of such a thing she might she doubtless would lose confidence in him if he took a step backward and that confidence of hers was the most splendid thing in mitchells life no if comer mathison wanted to make any change they would have to promote him ten minutes with the old man however served to jar this satisfactory determination to its foundation mr comer put the situation clearly concisely business is rotten weve got to lay all the younger men off or well go broke he announced but im married protested the young salesman so am i so is mathison so are the rest of the fellows but my boy this is a panic we wouldnt let you go if we could keep you i can sell goods thats just it we dont want you to conditions are such that we cant afford to sell anything the less business we do the fewer losses we stand to make good lord louis this is the worst year the trade has ever known bbut im married blankly repeated mitchell comer shook his head wed keep you in a minute if there was any way to do it you go home and see the wife of course if you can show us where youre worth it well let you stay but well you cant theres no chance ill see you tomorrow ordinarily mitchell would not have allowed himself the extravagance of a cab but today the cars were too slow he wondered how the girl would take this calamity their very first as a matter of fact she divined the news even before he had voiced his exuberant greetings and leading him into the neat little front room she curled up at his side demanding all the reasons for his unexpected recall he saw that she was wideeyed and rather white when he had broken the bad news she inquired bravely what is your plan boy i havent any nonsense i mean it what can i do i dont know anything except the steel business i can lick my weight in wildcats on my own ground but the wife nodded her blonde head in complete agreement but that lets me out he concluded despondently i can sell steel because i know it from the ground up its my specialty oh we mustnt think about making a change ive handled more big jobs than any man of my age and experience on the road and yet im fired the husband sighed wearily i built that big pipe line in portland i sold those smelters in anaconda and the cyanide tanks for the highland girl yes and a lot of other jobs too i know all about the smelter business but thats no sign i can sell electric belts or corn salve were up against it girlie have people quit building smelters they sure have during this panic theres nothing doing anywhere the wife thought for a moment before saying the last time you were home you told me about some western mining men who had gone to south africa sure to the rand theyve made good too theyre whopping big operators now you said there was a large contract of some sort coming up in london large well rather the robinsonray job its the biggest ever in my line theyre going to rebuild those plants the boers destroyed i heard all about it in montana well mrs mitchell spoke with finality thats the place for you get the firm to send you over there umm i thought about that but it scared me out its too big why its a threemilliondollar job you see weve never landed a large foreign contract in this country as yet mitchell sat up suddenly but say this panic might then he relaxed oh whats the use if there were a chance the firm wouldnt send me comer would go himself hed take the whole outfit over for a job like that besides its too big a thing for our people they couldnt handle it mrs mitchells eyes were as round as buttons three million dollars worth of steel in one contract do you think you could land it if you went its my line of work the young man replied doubtfully ill bet i know more about cyanide tanks than any salesman in europe and if i had a decent price to work on then its the chance weve been waiting for the girl scrambled to her feet and fetching a chair began to talk earnestly rapidly she talked for a long time until gradually the mans gray despondency gave way to her own bright optimism nor was it idle theory alone that she advanced mitchell found that she knew almost as much about the steel business as he did and when she had finished he arose and kissed her youve put new heart into me anyhow if youre game to do your share why ill try it out but remember it may mean all weve got in the bank and he looked at her darkly its the biggest chance well ever have she insisted its worth trying dont lets wait to get rich until we are old when mr comer returned from lunch he found his youngest salesman waiting for him and inside of ten minutes he had learned what mitchell had on his mind with two words comer blew out the gas youre crazy said he am i its worth going after in the first place no big foreign job ever came to america i know all that its time we got one in the second place comer mathison are jobbers ill get a special price from carnegie in the third place it would cost a barrel of money to send a man to england mitchell swallowed hard ill pay my own way mr comer regarded the speaker with genuine astonishment youll pay your way why you havent got any money ive got a thousand dollars or the wife has its our nestegg it would take five thousand to make the trip ill make it on one yes and ill come back with that job dont you see this panic makes the thing possible yes and im the one man to turn the trick for its right in my line ill see the carnegie people at pittsburgh if they quote the right price ill ask you for a letter and thats all youll have to do will you let me go what sort of a letter a letter stating that i am your general sales manager the steel merchants mouth fell open oh i only want it for this london trip mitchell explained i wont use it except as a credential but ive got to go armed you understand mr comer if i dont land that robinsonray contract i wont come back i i couldnt after this maybe ill drive a bus i hear they have a lot of them in london suppose for instance you should get the job on a profitable basis the biggest job this concern ever had and one of the biggest ever let anywhere mr comers brow was wrinkled humorously what would you expect out of it mitchell grinned well if i signed all those contracts as your general sales manager id probably form the habit theres nothing modest about you is there queried the elder man not a thing my theory of business is that a man should either be fired or promoted if i get that job ill leave it to you to do whats right i wont ask any questions the whole thing is utterly absurd mitchells employer protested you havent a chance but wait he pressed a button on his desk well talk with mathison louis mitchell took the night train for pittsburgh he was back in three days and that afternoon mr comer in the privacy of his own office dictated a letter of which no carbon copy was preserved he gave it to the young man with his own hand and with these words youd better think it over carefully my boy its the most idiotic thing i ever heard of and there isnt one chance in a million it wont do you any good to fail even on a forlorn hope like this but mitchell smiled i cant fail im married then when the other seemed unimpressed by this method of reasoning he explained i guess you never saw my wife she says i can do it it was only to this lady herself that mitchell recited the details of his reception at pittsburgh and of the battle he had fought in the carnegie office the carnegie men had refused to take him seriously had laughed at him as at a mildmannered lunatic but i got my price he concluded triumphantly and it sure looks good to me now for the painful details and the sad goodbys how long will you be gone his wife inquired i cant stay more than a month the bankroll is too small ooooh a month london is a long way off mrs mitchells voice broke plaintively and her husbands misgivings at once took fire if i fail as they all feel sure i will what then he inquired ill be out of a job ill be a joke in the steel business ill be broke what will you do she gave him a ravishing dimpled smile and her eyes were brave once more why i havent forgotten my shorthand and there are always the department stores in a high querulous tone she cried ca a sh then laughed aloud at his expression oh it wouldnt hurt me any but you wont fail you cant were going to be rich now well divide our grand fortune she produced a roll of currency from her purse and took four twentydollar bills from it only eighty dollars he queried its more than enough for me youll be back in a month she thrust the remaining notes into his hand its our one great glorious chance dear dont you understand faith hope and enthusiasm the three graces of salesmanship thrive best in bright places had it not been for his wifes cheer during those final hours young mitchell surely would have weakened before it came time to leave on the following day it was a far cry to london and he realized way back in his head that there wasnt one chance in a million of success he began to doubt to waver but the girl seemed to feel that her lord was bound upon some flaring triumph and even at the station her face was wreathed in smiles her blue eyes were brimming with excitement she bubbled with hopeful helpful advice she patted her husbands arm and hugged it to her youre going to win boy youre going to win she kept repeating for one moment only at the actual parting she clung to him wildly with all her womans strength then as the warning cry sounded she kissed him long and hungrily and fairly thrust him aboard the pullman he did not dream how she wilted and drooped the instant he had gone as the train pulled out he ran back to the observation car to wave a last farewell and saw her clinging to the iron fence sobbing wretchedly a desolate weak little girlwife mastered by a thousand fears she was too blind with tears to see him the sight raised a lump in the young husbands throat which lasted to fort wayne poor little thoroughbred he mused i just cant lose thats all the lump was not entirely gone when the luncheon call came so mitchell dined upon it reasoning that this kind of a beginning augured well for an economical trip now that he was away from the warmth of his wifes enthusiasm contemplation of his undertaking made the salesman rather sick if only he were traveling at the firms expense if only he had something to fall back upon in case of failure if only comer mathison were behind him in any way the complexion of things would have been altogether different but to set out for a foreign land with no backing whatever in the hope of accomplishing that which no american salesman had ever been able to accomplish and to finance the undertaking out of his own pocket on a sum less than he would have expected for cigarette money well it was an enterprise to test a fellows courage and to dampen the most youthful optimism his proposal to the firm to win all or lose all he realized now had been in the nature of a bluff and the firm had called it there was nothing to do therefore but go through and win there could be no turning back for he had burned his bridges when one enters a racehorse in a contest he puts the animal in good condition he grooms it he feeds it the best the stable affords he trains and exercises it carefully mitchell had never owned a racehorse but he reasoned that similar principles should apply to a human being under similar conditions he had entered a competition therefore he decided to condition himself physically and mentally for the race a doped pony cannot run neither can a worried salesman sell goods in line with this decision he took one of the best staterooms on the lucania and denied himself nothing that the ship afforded every morning he took his exercise every evening a rubdown he trained like a fighter and when he landed he was fit his muscles were hard his stomach strong his brain clear he went firstclass from liverpool to london he put up at the metropole in luxurious quarters when he stopped to think about that nine hundred and twenty already amazingly shrunken he argued bravely that what he had spent had gone to buy condition powders on the way across he had posted himself so far as possible about the proposed robinsonray plant he learned that there were to be fifteen batteries of cyanide tanks two high eightyfour in all supported by steel suband superstructures the work to be completed at krugersdorpf twenty miles out of johannesburg south africa the address of the company was no threadneedle street threadneedle street was somewhere in london and london was the capital of a place called england he knew other african contracts were under consideration but he dismissed them from his thoughts and centered his forces upon this particular job once he had taken a definite scent his early trepidations vanished he became obsessed by a joyous purposeful unceasing energy that would not let him rest the first evening in london he fattened himself for the fray with a hearty dinner then he strove to get acquainted with his neighbors and his environment the nervous force within him needed outlet but he was frowned upon at every quarter even the waiter at his table made it patent that his social standing would not permit him to indulge in the slightest intimacy with chance guests of the hotel while the young earl who had permitted mitchell to register at the desk declined utterly to go further with their acquaintance louis spent the evening at the empire and the next morning which was sunday he put in on the top of a bus laying himself open to the advances of anybody who cared to pay him the slightest attention but he was ignored even the driver who spoke a foreign language evidently considered him a suspicious character like a wise general louis reconnoitered no threadneedle street during the afternoon noting the lay of the land and deciding upon modes of transportation to and from under the pressure of circumstance he chose a cannon street bus fare tuppence now garrulity is a disease that must either break out or strike inward with fatal results when sunday night came mitchell was about ready to fare forth with gun and mask and take conversation away from anybody who had it to spare he had begun to fear that his vocal cords would atrophy he was up early had breakfasted and was at threadneedle street promptly at nine beating the janitor by some twenty minutes during the next hour and a half he gleaned considerable information regarding british business methods the while he monotonously pounded the sidewalk at ninethirty a scouting party of dignified officeboys made a cautious approach at ninethirtyfive there came the main army of clerks only they were not clerks but clarks very impressive gentlemen with gloves spats sticks silk hats and sack coats at this same time evidently by appointment came the charwomen char being spelled scrub and affording an example of how pure english has been corrupted out in the americas after the arrival of the head clarks and stenographers at ninefortyfive there ensued fifteen minutes of guarded conversation in front of the offices during this time the public issues of the day were settled and the nations policies outlined at ten oclock the offices were formally opened and at tenthirty a reception was tendered to the managers who arrived dressed as for any wellconducted afternoon function to mitchell who was accustomed to the feverish football methods of american business life all this was vastly edifying and instructive it was even soothing although he was vaguely offended to note that passersby avoided him as if fearful of contamination upon entering threadneedle street he was halted by an imperious officeboy to him louis gave his card with a request that it be handed to mr peebleby then he seated himself and for an hour witnessed a parade of unsmiling silkhatted gentlemen pass in and out of mr peeblebys office growing impatient at length he inquired of the boy is somebody dead around here or is this where the city council meets i beg pardon the lad was polite in a cool superior way i say whats the idea of the pallbearers the youths expression froze to one of disapproval and suspicion i mean the parade are these fellows congressor minstrelmen his hearer shrugged and smiled vacuously then turned away whereupon mitchell took him firmly by the arm look here my boy he began there seems to be a lot of information coming to both of us who are these overdressed gentlemen i see promenading back and forth why theyre callers customers representatives of the firms we do business with sir is this guy fawkes day no sir are these men here on business are any of them salesmen for instance yes sir some of them certainly sir to see mr peebleby about the new construction work no doubt so youre letting them get the edge on me i beg pardon never mind i merely wanted to assure you that i have some olive spats a high hat and a walkingstick but i left them at my hotel im a salesman too now then lets get down to business ive come all the way from america to hire an officeboy ive heard so much about english officeboys that i thought id run over and get one would you entertain a proposition to go back to america and become my partner the boy rolled his eyes it was plain that he was seriously alarmed you are ragging me sir he stammered uncertainly perish the thought i i really sir i pay twentyfive dollars a week to officeboys thats five pun in your money i believe but meanwhile now that im in london i have some business with mr peebleby mitchell produced an american silver dollar and forced it into the boys hand whereupon the latter blinked in a dazed manner then hazarded the opinion that mr peebleby might be at leisure if mr mitchell had another card never mind the card i cant trust you with another one just show me the trail and ill take it myself thats a way we have in america a moment later he was knocking at a door emblazoned director general without awaiting an invitation he turned the knob and walked in before the astonished mr peebleby could expostulate he had introduced himself and was making known his mission fortunately for mitchell englishmen are not without a sense of humor the announcement that this young man had come all the way from chicago illinois usa to bid on the krugersdorpf work struck mr peebleby as amusing not only was the idea in itself laughable but also the fact that a mere beardless youth should venture to figure on a contract of such gigantic proportions quite convulsed the director general and in consequence he smiled then fearing that his dignity had been jeopardized he announced politely but firmly that the proposition was absurd and that he had no time to discuss it ive come for that job and im going to take it back with me mitchell averred with equal firmness i know more about this class of work than any salesman you have over here and im going to build you the finest cluster of cyanide tanks you ever saw may i ask where you obtained this comprehensive knowledge of tank construction mr peebleby inquired with some curiosity sure mitchell ran through a list of jobs with which the director general could not have been unfamiliar he mentioned work that caused that gentleman to regard him more respectfully for a time questions and answers shot back and forth between them i tell you that is my line mitchell declared at length ill read any blueprints you can offer ill answer any queries you can formulate im the accredited representative of a big concern and im entitled to a chance to figure at least that courtesy is due me i dare say it is the other reluctantly agreed im very busy but if that is the quickest way to end the discussion ill give you the prints i assure you nevertheless it is an utter waste of your time and mine he pushed a button and five minutes later a clerk staggered back into the room with an armful of blueprints that caused mitchell to gasp the bid must be in thursday at tenthirty peebleby announced thursday why good lord thats only three days and theres a drayload of drawings i told you it was a waste of time you should have come sooner mitchell ran through the pile and his heart grew sick with dismay there were drawings of tanks drawings of substructures and superstructures in every phase of construction enough of them to daunt a skilled engineer he realized that he had by no means appreciated the full magnitude of this work in fact had never figured on a job anything like this one he could see at least a weeks hard constant labor ahead of him a weeks work to be done in three days there was no use trying the time was too short it was a physical impossibility to formulate an intelligent proposition in such a short length of time then to mitchells mind came the picture of a wretched goldenhaired girl clinging to the iron fence of the pennsylvania depot he gathered the rolls into his arms at tenthirty thursday said he tenthirty sharp thank you ill have my bid in his muscles ached and his knees were trembling even before he had reached the street when he tried to board a bus he was waved away so he called a cab piled his blueprints inside of it and then clambered in on top of them he realized that he was badly frightened to this day the sight of a blueprint gives louis mitchell a peculiar nausea and a fluttering sensation about the heart at three oclock the next morning he felt his way blindly to his bed and toppled upon it falling straightway into a slumber during which he passed through monotonous maddening wastes of blue and white over which ran serpentine rows of figures he was up with the dawn and at his desk again but by four that afternoon he was too dazed too exhausted to continue his eyes were playing him tricks the room was whirling his hand was shaking until his fingers staggered drunkenly across the sheets of paper ground plans substructures superstructures were jumbled into a frightful tangle he wanted to yell instead he flung the drawings about the room stamped savagely upon them then rushed downstairs and devoured a table dhфte dinner he washed the meal down with a bottle of red wine smoked a long cigar then undressed and went to bed amid the scattered blueprints he slept like a dead man he arose at sunup clearheaded calm all day he worked like a machine increasing his speed as the hours flew he took good care to eat and drink and above all to smoke at regular intervals but he did not leave his room by dark he had much of the task behind him by midnight he began to have hope toward dawn he saw the end and when daylight came he collapsed he had deciphered the tank and superstructure plans on fortyfive sets of blueprints had formulated a proposition exclusive of substructure work basing a price per pound on the american market then ruling fob tidewater new york he had the proposition in his pocket when he tapped on the groundglass door of mr peeblebys office at tentwentynine thursday morning the director general of the great robinsonray syndicate was genuinely surprised to learn that the young american had completed a bid in so short a time then requested him somewhat absentmindedly to leave it on his desk where he could look it over at his leisure just a moment said his caller im going to sit down and talk to you again how long have you been using cyanide tanks mr peebleby ever since they were adopted mr peebleby was visibly annoyed at this interruption to his mornings work well i can give you a lot of information about them the director general raised his brows haughtily ah suggestions amendments improvements no doubt exactly in all my experience i never sent out a blueprint which some youthful salesman could not improve upon generally the younger the salesman the greater the improvement in mitchells own parlance he beat mr peebleby to the punch if thats the case youve got a rotten line of engineers he frankly announced indeed i went over those drawings myself i flattered myself that they were comprehensive and uptodate mr peebleby was annoyed nevertheless he was visibly interested and curious well theyre not the younger man declared eying him boldly for instance you call for castiron columns in your suband superstructures whereas theyre obsolete weve discarded them what you save in first cost you eat up twice over in freight not only that but their strength is a matter of theory not of fact then too in your structuralsteel sections your factor of safety is wrongly figured to get the best results your lower tanks are twenty inches too short and your upper ones nine inches too short for another thing youre using a section of beam which is five per cent heavier than your other dimensions call for the director general sat back in his chair a look of extreme alertness replacing his former expression my word is there anything else he undertook to speak mockingly but without complete success there is the layout of your platework is all wrong out of line with modern practice you should have interchangeable parts in every tank the floor of your lower section should be convex instead of flat to get the runoff you see sir this is my line of business who is your engineer inquired the elder man i should like to talk to him youre talking to him now im him it them im the party i told you i knew the game there was a brief silence then mr peebleby inquired by the way who helped you figure those prints nobody you did that alone since monday morning the speaker was incredulous i did i havent slept much im pretty tired there was a new note in mr peeblebys voice when he said jove ive treated you badly mr mitchell but i wonder if youre too tired to tell my engineers what you told me just now i should like them to hear you trot them in for the first time since leaving this office three days before mitchell smiled he was getting into his stride at last after all there seemed to be a chance there followed a convention of the draftsmen and engineers of the robinsonray syndicate before which an unknown american youth delivered an address on cyanide tanks how to build them where to buy them it was the old story of a man who had learned his work thoroughly and who loved it mitchell typified the theory of specialization what he knew he knew completely and before he had more than begun his talk these men recognized that fact when he had finished mr peebleby announced that the bids would not be opened that day the american had made his first point he had gained time in which to handle himself and the robinsonray people had recognized a new factor in the field when he was again in the director generals room the latter said i think i will have you formulate a new bid along the lines you have laid down very well you understand our time is up can you have it ready by saturday three days from now mitchell laughed its a ten days job for two men i know but we cant wait then give me until tuesday im used to a twentyfourhour shift now meanwhile id like to leave these figures here for your chief draftsman to examine of course they are not to be considered binding isnt that a bit er foolish inquired peebleby arent you leaving a weapon behind you yes but not the sort of a weapon you suspect thought mitchell this is a boomerang aloud he answered lightly oh thats all right i know im among friends when his request was granted he made a mental note step number two again he filled a cab with drawings again he went back to the metropole and to maddening columns of new figures back to the monotony of tasteless meals served at his elbow but there were other things besides his own bid to think of now mitchell knew he must find what other firms were bidding on the job and what prices they had bid the first promised to require some ingenuity the second was a titans task salesmanship in its highest development is an exact science given the data he desired louis mitchell felt sure he could read the figures sealed up in those other bids to a nicety but to get that data required much concentrated effort and much time time was what he needed above all things time to refigure these myriad drawings time to determine when the other bids had gone in time to learn trade conditions at the competitive plants time to sleep there were not sufficient hours in the day for all these things so he rigidly economized on the least important sleep he laid out a program for himself by night he worked in his room by day he cruised for information at odd moments around the dawn he slept he began to feel the strain before long never physically robust he began to grow blue and drawn about the nostrils frequently his food would not stay down he was forced to drive his lagging spirits with a lash to accomplish this he had to think often of his girlwife her letters written daily were a great help they were like some godgiven cordial that infused fresh blood into his brain new strength into his flagging limbs without them he could not have held up with certain definite objects in view he made daily trips to threadneedle street invariably he walked into the general offices unannounced invariably he made a new friend before he came out peebleby seemed to like him in fact asked his opinion on certain forms of structure and voluntarily granted the young man two days of grace two days they were like oxygen to a dying man mitchell asked permission to talk to the head draftsman and received it and following their interview he requested the privilege of dictating some notes regarding the interview in this way he met the stenographer when he had finished with her he flipped the girl a gold sovereign stolen from the sadly melted nine hundred and twenty as mitchell was leaving the office the director general yielded to a kindly impulse and advised his new acquaintance to run over to paris and view the exposition you can do your figuring there just as well as here said he i dont want your trip from chicago to be altogether wasted mr mitchell louis smiled and shook his head i cant take that exposition back with me and i can take this contract i think ill camp with my bid in the small hours of that night he made a discovery that electrified him he found that the most commonly used section in his specifications a twelveinch ibeam was listed under the english custom as weighing fiftyfour pounds per foot whereas the standardized american section which possessed the same carrying strength weighed four pounds less here was an advantage of eight per cent in cost and freight this put another round of the ladder beneath him he was progressing well but as yet he had learned nothing about his competitors the next morning he had some more dictation for peeblebys stenographer and niched another sovereign from his sad little bankroll when the girl gave him his copy he fell into conversation with her and painted a picture of yankeeland well calculated to keep her awake nights they gossiped idly she of her social obligations he of the cyanidetank business he could think of nothing else to talk about adroitly he led her out they grew confidential she admitted her admiration for mr jenkins from edinburgh yes mr jenkinss company was bidding on the krugersdorpf job he was much nicer than mr kruse from the brussels concern and anyhow those belgian firms had no chance at this contract for belgium was proboer and well she had heard a few things around the office mitchell was getting feedbox information when he left he knew the names of his dangerous competitors as well as those whom in all likelihood he had no cause to fear another step he was gaining ground in order to make himself absolutely certain that his figures would be low there still remained three things to learn and they were matters upon which he could afford to take no slightest chance of mistake he must know first the dates of those other bids second the marketprice of english steel at such times and third the cost of fabrication at the various mills the first two he believed could be easily learned but the third promised to afford appalling difficulties to a man unfamiliar with foreign methods and utterly lacking in trade acquaintances he went at them systematically however only to run against a snag within the hour not only did he fail to find the answer to question number one but he could find no market quotations whatever on structural steel shapes such as entered into the krugersdorpf job he searched through every possible trade journal through reading rooms and libraries for the price of ibeams channels zbars and the like but nowhere could he even find mention of them his failure left him puzzled and panicstricken he could not understand it if only he had more time he reflected time in which to learn the usages and the customs of this country but time was what he had not he was tired very tired from his sleepless nights and hours of daylight strain and meanwhile the days were rushing past while engaged in these side labors he had of course been working on his draftsmen friends and more assiduously even than upon his blueprints on tuesday night with but one more day of grace ahead of him he gave a dinner to all of them disregarding the fact that his bankroll had become frightfully emaciated for several days after that little party blueprinting in the robinsonray office was a lost art when his guests had dined and had settled back into their chairs mitchell decided to risk all upon one throw he rose at the head of the table and told them who he was he utterly destroyed their illusions regarding him and his position with comer mathison he bared his heart to those stoopshouldered shabby young men from threadneedle street and came right down to the nine hundred and twenty dollars and the girl he told them what this krugersdorpf job meant to him and to her and to the four twentydollar bills in chicago illinois usa those englishmen listened silently nobody laughed perhaps it was the sort of thing they had dreamed of doing some day perhaps there were other girls in other tiny furnished flats other hearts wrapped up in similar struggles for advancement they were good mathematicians it seemed for they did not have to ask mitchell how the nine hundred and twenty was doing or to inquire regarding the health of the other eighty one of them a nearsighted fellow with thick lenses arose with the grave assertion that he had taken the floor for the purpose of correcting a popular fallacy englishmen and yankees he declared were not cousins they were brothers and their interests ever had been and ever would be identical he said too that england wanted to do business with america and as for this particular contract not only did the british nation as a whole desire america to secure it but the chaps who bent over the boards at no threadneedle street were plugging for her tooth and nail his hollowchested companions yelled their approval of this statement whereupon mitchell again arose alternately flushing and paling and apologized for what had happened in he acknowledged himself ashamed of the affair moreover and sympathized with his guests over their present trouble with the boers when he had finished they voted him the best host and the best little cyanide tankbuilder known to them and then everybody tried to tell him something at once they told him among other things that every bid except his had been in for two weeks and that they were in the vault under the care of mr pitts the head draftsman they promised to advise him if any new bids came in or if any changes occurred and most important of all they told him that in england all structural steel shapes instead of being classified as in america are known as angles and they told him just how and where to find the official reports giving the price of the same for every day in the year the word angles was the missing key and those official market reports formed the lock in which to fit it mitchell had taken several mighty strides and there remained but one more step to take when his guests had finally gone home swearing fealty and declaring this to be the best dinner they had ever drunk he hastened back to his room back to the desert of blueprints and to the interminable columns of figures and over them he worked like a madman he slept two hours before daylight then he was up and toiling again for this was his last day using the data he had gathered the night before he soon had the price of english and scottish steel at the time the last bids were closed given one thing more namely the cost of fabrication in these foreign shops and he would have reduced this hazard to a certainty he would be able to read the prices contained in those sealed bids as plainly as if they lay open before him but his time had narrowed now to hours he lunched with john pitts the head draughtsman going back to pick up the boomerang he had left the week before have you gone over my first bid he asked carelessly i have lucky for you said pitts you made a mistake indeed how so why its thirty per cent too low it would be a crime to give you the business at those figures but you see i didnt include the substructure i didnt have time to figure that mitchell prayed that his face might not show his eagerness evidently it did not for pitts walked into the trap even so said he its thirty per cent out of the way i made allowance for that the boomerang had finished its flight once they had separated mitchell broke for his hotel like a hunted man he had made no mistake in his first figures the great krugersdorpf job was his but nevertheless he wished to make himself absolutely sure and to secure as much profit as possible for comer mathison without a handsome profit this threemilliondollar job might ruin a firm of their standing in order to verify pittss statement in order to swell his proposed profits to the utmost mitchell knew he ought to learn the overhead in english mills that is the fixed charges which added to shop costs and prices of material are set aside to cover office expenses cost of operation and contingencies without this information he would have to go it blind after a fashion and thereby risk penalizing himself with it he could estimate very closely the amounts of the other bids and insure a safe margin for comer mathison in addition to this precaution he wished to have his own figures checked up for even under normal conditions if one makes a numerical error in work of this sort he is more than apt to repeat it time and again and mitchell knew himself to be deadly tired almost on the verge of collapse he was inclined to doze off whenever he sat down the raucous noises of the city no longer jarred or startled him and his surroundings were becoming unreal grotesque as if seen through the spell of absinthe yes it was necessary to check off his figures but who could he get to do the work he could not go to threadneedle street he thought of the carnegie representative and telephoned him explaining the situation and his crying need only to be told that no one in that office was capable of assisting him he was referred however to an english engineer who it was barely possible could handle the job in closing the carnegie man voiced a vague warning his name is dell and he used to be with one of the edinburgh concerns so dont let him know your inside figures he might spring a leak a halfhour later mitchell his arms full of blueprints was in mr dells office but the english engineer hesitated he was very busy he had numerous obligations mitchell gazed over the threadbare rooms and hastily estimated how much of the nine hundred and twenty dollars would be left after he had paid his hotel bill what there was to do must be done before the next mornings sun arose this job is worth ten sovereigns to me if it is finished tonight he declared briskly mr dell hesitated stumbled and fell very well well begin at once said he he unrolled the blueprints from a drawer he produced a slidingrule he slid this rule up he slid it down he gazed through his glasses at space he made microscopic spencerian figures in neat rows and columns he seemed to pluck his results from the air with necromantic cunning and what had taken the young man at his elbow days and nights of cruel effort to accomplish what had put haggard lines about his mouth and eyes the engineer accomplished in a few hours by means of that slidingrule meanwhile with one weary effort of will his visitor summoned his powers and crossexamined him adroitly here was the very man to supply the one missing link in the perfect chain but mr dell would not talk he did not like americans nor american methods and he made his dislike apparent by sealing his lips mitchell played upon his vanity at first only to find the man wholly lacking in conceit changing his method of attack mitchell built a fire under mr dell he grilled everything british the people their social customs their business methods even english engineers and he did it in a most annoying manner mr dell began to perspire he worked doggedly on for a while then he arose in defense of his country whereupon mitchell artfully shifted his attack to english steelmills the other refuted his statements flatly at length the engineer was goaded to anger he became disputative indignant loquacious when louis mitchell flung himself into the dark body of his cab late that evening and sank his legs kneedeep into those hateful blueprints he blessed that engineer for dell had told him all he wished to know all he had tried so vainly to discover through other sources the average overhead in british mills was one hundred and thirty per cent and dell knew the young man laughed hysterically triumphantly but the sound was more like a tearful hiccough tomorrow at tenthirty it was nearly over he would be ready as he lolled back inertly upon the cushions he mused dreamily that he had done well in less than two weeks in a foreign country and under strange conditions without acquaintance or pull or help of any sort he had learned the names of his competitive firms the dates of their bids and the market prices ruling on every piece of steel in the krugersdorpf job when those bids were figured he had learned the rules governing english labor unions he knew all about piecework and timework fixed charges and shop costs together with the ability of every plant figuring on the robinsonray contract to turn out the work in the necessary time all this and more he had learned legitimately and without cost to his commercial honor henceforth that southafrican contract depended merely upon his own ability to add subtract and multiply correctly it was his just as surely as two and two make four for salesmanship is an exact science the girl would be very happy he told himself he was glad that she could never know the strain it had been again through the slow silent hours of that wednesday night mitchell fought the fatigue of death going over his figures carefully there were no errors in them dawn was creeping in on him when he added a clean thirtypercent profit for his firm signed his bid and prepared for bed but he found that he could not leave the thing after he had turned in he became assailed by sudden doubts and fears what if he had made a mistake after all what if some link in his chain were faulty what if some other bidder had made a mistake and underfigured such thoughts made him tremble now that it was all done he feared that he had been overconfident for could it really be possible that the greatest steel contract in years would come to him he grew dizzy at the picture of what it meant to him and to the girl he calmed himself finally and looked straight at the matter sitting up in bed his knees drawn up under his chin while so engaged he caught sight of his drawn face in the mirror opposite and started when he realized how old and heavy with fatigue it was he determined suddenly to shave that profit to twentynine per cent and make assurance doubly sure but managed to conquer his momentary panic cold reasoning told him that his figures were safe louis mitchell was the only salesman in mr peeblebys office that morning who did not wear a silk hat pearl gloves and spats in consequence the others ignored him for a time but only for a time once the proposals had been read an air of impenetrable gloom spread over the room the seven scotch english and belgian mourners stared cheerlessly at one another and then with growing curiosity at the young man from overseas who had underbid the lowest of them by six thousand pounds sterling less than one per cent after a while they bowed among themselves mumbled something to mr peebleby and went softly out in their high hats their pearl gloves and their spats more like pallbearers now than ever six hundred and thirtyseven thousand five hundred pounds sterling said the director general by jove mitchell im glad they shook hands im really glad thats over three million dollars in real money said the youth its quite a tidy little job peebleby laughed youve been very decent about it too i hope to see something of you in the future what youll see my smoke thats all youre not going back right away tomorrow ive booked my passage and cabled the girl to meet me in new york my word a girl shell be glad to hear of your success oh ive told her already you see i knew id won the director general of the robinsonray syndicate stared in open amazement but mitchell hitched his chair closer saying now lets get at those signatures ive got to pack that night louis mitchell slept with fifteen separate contracts under his pillow he doublelocked the door pulled the dresser in front of it and left the light burning at times he awoke with a start and felt for the documents toward morning he was seized with a sudden fright so he got up and read them all over for fear somebody had tampered with them they were correct however whereupon he read them a second time just for pleasure they were strangely interesting on the deutschland he slept much of the way across and by the time liberty statue loomed up he could dream of other things than blueprints of the girl for instance she had enough left from the eighty dollars to bring her to new york and to pay for a weeks lodging in west thirtyfourth street though how she managed it mitchell never knew she was at the dock of course he knew she would be he expected to see her with her arms outstretched and with the old joyous smile upon her dimpled face and therefore he was sorely disappointed when he came down the gangplank and she did not appear he searched high and low until finally he discovered her seated over by the letter m where his trunk was waiting inspection there she was huddled up on a coil of rope crying as if her heart would break her nerve was gone along with the four twentydollar bills she was afraid to face him afraid there had been an error in his cablegram not until she lay in his arms at last sobbing and laughing her slender body all aquiver did she believe then he allowed her to feel the fifteen contracts inside his coat later when they were in a cab bound for her smelly little boardinghouse he showed them to her in return she gave him a telegram from his firm a telegram addressed as follows mr louis mitchell general sales manager comer mathison new york city the message read that goes comer mitchell opened the trap above his head and called up to the driver hey cabbie weve changed our minds drive us to the waldorf at a gallop with interest to date this is the tale of a wrong that rankled and a great revenge it is not a moral story nor yet measured by the modern money code is it what could be called immoral it is merely a tale of sharp wits which clashed in pursuit of business therefore let it be considered unmoral a word with a wholly different commercial significance time was when wrongs were righted by mace and battleax amid fanfares and shoutings but we live in a quieter age an age of repression wherein the keenest thrust is not delivered with a yell of triumph nor the oldest score settled to the blare of trumpets no longer do the men of great muscle lord it over the weak and the puny as a rule they toil and they lift doing unpleasant menial duties for hollowchested bigdomed men with eyeglasses but among those very spindleshanked terracotta dwellers who cower at draughts and eat soda mints the ancient struggle for supremacy wages fiercer than ever single combats are fought now as then and the flavor of victory is quite as sweet to the pallid man back of a rolltop desk as to the swart bristling baron behind his vizored helmet the beginning of this story runs back to the time henry hanford went with the general equipment company as a young salesman full of hope and enthusiasm and a somewhat exaggerated idea of his own importance he was selling shears punches and other machinery used in the fabrication of structural steel in the territory assigned to him the works of the atlantic bridge company stuck up like a sore thumb for although it employed many men although its contracts were large and its requirements numerous the general equipment company had never sold it a dollars worth of anything in the course of time hanford convinced himself that the atlantic bridge company needed more modern machinery so he laid siege to jackson wylie sr its president and practical owner he spent all of six months in gaining the old mans ear but when he succeeded he laid himself out to sell his goods he analyzed the atlantic bridge companys needs in the light of modern milling practice and demonstrated the saving his equipment would effect a big order and much prestige were at stake both of which young hanford needed badly at the time he was vastly encouraged therefore when the bridgebuilder listened attentively to him i dare say we shall have to make a change mr wylie reluctantly agreed ive been bothered to death by machinery salesmen but youre the first one to really interest me hanford acknowledged the compliment and proceeded further to elaborate upon the superiority of the general equipment companys goods over those sold by rival concerns when he left he felt that he had mr wylie sr going at the office they warned him that he had a hard nut to crack that wylie was given to stringing salesmen and was a hard man to close with but hanford smiled confidently granting those facts they rendered him all the more eager to make this sale and the bridge company really did need uptodate machinery he instituted an even more vigorous selling campaign he sent much printed matter to mr wylie sr he wrote him many letters being a thoroughgoing young saleman he studied the plant from the ground up learning the bridge business in such detail as enabled him to talk with authority on efficiency methods in the course of his studies he discovered many things that were wrong with the atlantic and spent days in outlining improvements on paper he made the acquaintance of the foremen he cultivated the general superintendent he even met mr jackson wylie jr the sales manager a very polished metallic young man who seemed quite as deeply impressed with hanfords statements as did his father under our highly developed competitive system modern business is done very largely upon personality from the attitude of both father and son hanford began to count his chickens instead of letting up however he redoubled his efforts which was his way he spent so much time on the matter that his other work suffered and in consequence his firm called him down he outlined his progress with the atlantic bridge company declared he was going to succeed and continued to camp with the job notwithstanding the firms open doubts sixty days after his first interview he had another visit with wylie senior during which the latter drained him of information and made an appointment for a month later said mr wylie you impress me strongly hanford and i want my associates to hear you get your proposition into shape and make the same talk to them that you have made to me hanford went away elated he even bragged a bit at the office and the report got around among the other salesmen that he really had done the impossible and had pulled off something big with the atlantic it was a busy month for that young gentleman and when the redletter day at last arrived he went on to newark to find both wylies awaiting him well sir are you prepared to make a good argument the father inquired i am hanford decided that three months was not too long a time to devote to work of this magnitude after all i want you to do your best the bridgebuilder continued encouragingly then he led hanford into the directors room where to his visitors astonishment some fifty men were seated these are our salesmen announced mr wylie he introduced hanford to them with the request that they listen attentively to what the young man had to say it was rather nervous work for hanford but he soon warmed up and forgot his embarrassment he stood on his feet for two long hours pleading as if for his life he went over the atlantic plant from end to end he showed the economic necessity for new machinery then he explained the efficiency of his own appliances he took rival types and picked them to pieces pointing out their inferiority he showed his familiarity with bridge work by going into figures which bore out his contention that the atlantics output could be increased and at an actual monthly saving he wound up by proving that the general equipment company was the one concern best fitted to effect the improvement it had taken months of unremitting toil to prepare himself for this exposition but the young fellow felt he had made his case when he took up the cost of the proposed instalment however mr jackson wylie sr interrupted him that is all i care to have you cover the latter explained thank you very kindly mr hanford hanford sat down and wiped his forehead whereupon the other stepped forward and addressed his employees gentlemen said he you have just listened to the best argument i ever heard i purposely called you in from the road so that you might have a practical lesson in salesmanship and learn something from an outsider about your own business i want you to profit by this talk take it to heart and apply it to your own customers our selling efficiency has deteriorated lately you are getting lazy i want you to wake up and show better results that is all you might thank this young gentleman for his kindness when the audience had dispersed hanford inquired blankly dont you intend to act on my suggestions oh no said mr wylie in apparent surprise we are doing nicely as it is i merely wanted you to address the boys but ive spent three months of hard labor on this you led me to believe that you would put in new equipment the younger wylie laughed languidly exhaling a lungful of cigarette smoke when dad gets ready to purchase hell let you know said he six months later the atlantic bridge company placed a mammoth order with hanfords rival concern and he was not even asked to figure on it that is how the seeds of this story were sown of course the facts got out for those atlantic salesmen were not wanting in a sense of humor and hanford was joshed in every quarter to make matters worse his firm called him to account for his wasted time implying that something was evidently wrong with his selling methods thus began a lack of confidence which quickly developed into strained relations the result was inevitable hanford saw what was coming and was wise enough to resign his position but it was the ridicule that hurt him most he was unable to get away from that had he been at all emotional he would have sworn a vendetta so deep and lasting was the hurt but he did not he merely failed to forget which after all is not so different it seemed queer that henry hanford should wind up in the bridge business himself after attempting to fill several unsatisfactory positions and yet there was nothing remarkable about it for that three months of intense application at the atlantic plant had given him a groundwork which came in handy when the patterson bridge company offered him a desk he was a good salesman he worked hard and in time he was promoted by and by the story was forgotten by every one except henry hanford but he had lost a considerable number of precious years when it became known that the english and continental structural shops were so full of work that they could not figure on the mammoth fivemilliondollar steel structure designed to span the barrata river in africa and when the royal commission in london finally advertised broadcast that time was the essence of this contract mr jackson wylie sr realized that his plant was equipped to handle the job in magnificent shape with large profit to himself and with great renown to the wylie name he therefore sent his son jackson wylie the second now a fullfledged partner to london armed with letters to almost everybody in england from almost everybody in america two weeks later the patterson bridge company was not so aggressive as its more pretentious rival henry hanford went abroad on the same mission but he carried no letters of introduction for the very good reason that he possessed neither commercial influence nor social prestige bradstreets had never rated him and whos who contained no names with which he was familiar jackson wylie the second had been to london frequently and he was accustomed to english life he had friends with headquarters at princes and at romanos friends who were delighted to entertain so prominent an american his letters gave him the entree to many of the best clubs and paved his way socially wherever he chose to go it was hanfords first trip across and he arrived on british soil without so much as a knowledge of english coins with nothing in the way of baggage except a grip full of blueprints and with no destination except the parliament buildings where he had been led to believe the royal barrata bridge commission was eagerly and impatiently awaiting his coming but when he called at the parliament buildings he failed not only to find the commission but even to encounter anybody who knew anything about it he did manage to locate the office after some patient effort but learned that it was nothing more than a forwarding address and that no member of the commission had been there for several weeks he was informed that the commission had convened once and therefore was not entirely an imaginary body beyond that he could discover nothing on his second visit to the office he was told that sir thomas drummond the chairman was inside having run down from his shootinglodge in scotland for the day but sir thomass clerk with whom hanford had become acquainted at the time of his first call informed him that mr jackson wylie the second from america was closeted with his lordship and in consequence his lordship could not be disturbed later when hanford got more thoroughly in touch with the general situation he began to realize that introductions influence social prestige would in all probability go farther toward landing the barrata bridge than mere engineering ability or close figuring facts with which the younger wylie was already familiar and against which he had provided it also became plain to hanford as time went on that the contract would of necessity go to america for none of the european shops were in position to complete it on time owing to government needs this huge elevenspan structure had to be on the ground within ninety days from the date of the signing of the contract and erected within eight months thereafter the commissions clerk a big redfaced jovial fellow informed hanford that price was not nearly so essential as time of delivery that although the contract glittered with alluring bonuses and was heavily weighted with forfeits neither bonuses nor forfeitures could in the slightest manner compensate for a delay in time it was due to this very fact to the peculiar urgency of the occasion that the commissioners were inclined to look askance at prospective bidders who might in any way fail to complete the task as specified if all that is true tell me why wylie gets the call hanford inquired i understand he has the very highest references said the englishman no doubt but you cant build bridges with letters of introduction even in africa probably not but sir thomas is a big man mr wylie is one of his sort they meet on common ground dont you see well if i cant arrange an interview with any member of the commission i can at least take you to lunch will you go the clerk declared that he would indeed and in the days that followed the two saw much of each other this fellow lowe by name interested hanford he was a cosmopolite he was polished to the hardness of agate by a life spent in many lands he possessed a cold eye and a firm chin he was a complex mixture of daredeviltry and meekness he had fought in a war or two and he had led hopes quite as forlorn as the one hanford was now engaged upon it was this bond perhaps which drew the two together in spite of lowes assistance hanford found it extremely difficult nay almost impossible to obtain any real inside information concerning the barrata bridge wherever he turned he brought up against a blank wall of english impassiveness he even experienced difficulty in securing the blueprints he wanted it looks pretty tough for you lowe told him one day im afraid youre going to come a cropper old man this chap wylie has the rail and hes running well he has opened an office i believe so i understand well the race isnt over yet and im a good stayer this is the biggest thing i ever tackled and it means a lot to me more than you imagine how so hanford recited the story of his old wrong to lowes frank amazement what a rotten trick the latter remarked yes and i dont forget youd better forget this job it takes pull to get consideration from people like sir thomas and wylie has more than he needs a fellow without it hasnt a chance look at me for instance working at a desk bah want to try something else i do and youd better follow suit hanford shook his head i never quit i cant when my chance at this bridge comes along lowe laughed oh the chance will come chances always come sometimes we dont see them thats all when this one comes i want to be ready meanwhile i think ill reconnoiter wylies new office and find out whats doing day after day henry hanford pursued his work doggedly seeing much of lowe something of wylies clerk and nothing whatever of sir thomas drummond or the other members of the royal barrata bridge commission he heard occasional rumors of the social triumphs of his rival and met him once to be treated with halfveiled amusement by that patronizing young man meanwhile the time was growing short and hanfords firm was not well pleased with his progress then the chance came unexpectedly as hanford had declared chances always come the remarkable thing in this instance was not that the veiled goddess showed her face but that hanford was quick enough to recognize her and bold enough to act he had taken lowe to the trocadero for dinner and finding no seats where they could watch the crowd he had selected a stall in a quiet corner they had been there but a short time when hanford recognized a voice from the stall adjacent as belonging to the representative of the atlantic bridge company from the sounds he could tell that wylie was giving a dinnerparty and with lowes aid he soon identified the guests as members of the royal barrata bridge commission hanford began to strain his ears as the meal progressed this became less of an effort for young wylies voice was strident the wylie conversation had ever been limited largely to the wylies their accomplishments their purposes and their prospects and now having the floor as host he talked mainly about himself his father and their forthcoming barrata bridge contract it was his evident endeavor this evening to impress his distinguished guests with the tremendous importance of the atlantic bridge company and its unsurpassed facilities for handling big jobs a large part of young wylies experience had been acquired by manipulating municipal contracts and the aldermen connected therewith he now worked along similar lines hanford soon learned that he was trying in every way possible to induce drummond and his associates to accompany him back to america for the purpose of proving beyond peradventure that the atlantic could take care of a fivemilliondollar contract with ease as if theyd go lowe said softly and yet by jove he talks as if he had the job buttoned up the englishman was alert his dramatic instinct was at play recognizing the significance of wylies offer and its possible bearing upon hanfords fortunes he waved the waiter away knowing better than to permit the rattle of dishes to distract his hosts attention meanwhile with clenched teeth and smoldering eyes henry hanford heard his rival in the next compartment identify the state of new jersey by the fact that the works of the atlantic bridge company were located therein and dignify it by the fact that the jackson wylies lived there you know gentlemen wylie was saying i can arrange the trip without the least difficulty and i assure you there will be no discomfort i am in constant cipher communication with my father and he will be delighted to afford you every courtesy i can fix it up by cable in a day hanford arose with a silent gesture to his guest then although the meal was but half over he paid the bill he had closed his campaign right then and there he landed the great barrata bridge contract lowe mystified beyond measure by his friends action made no comment until they were outside then he exclaimed i say old top what blew off hanford smiled at him queerly the whole top of young wylies head blew off if he only knew it its my day to settle that score and the interest will be compounded i must be extremely stupid not at all youre damned intelligent and thats why im going to need your help hanford turned upon the adventurer suddenly have you ever been an actor lowe made a comical grimace i say old man thats pretty rough my people raised me for a gentleman exactly come with me to my hotel were going to do each other a great favor with your help and the help of mr jackson wylie the seconds london clerk im going to land the barrata bridge hanford had not read his friend lowe awrong and when behind locked doors he outlined his plan the big fellow gazed at him with amazement his blue eyes sparkling with admiration gad that appeals to me i think i can do it there was no timidity in lowes words merely a careful consideration of the risks involved hanford gripped his hand ill attend to wylies clerk he declared now wed better begin to rehearse but what makes you so positive you can handle his clerk queried lowe oh ive studied him the same way ive studied you ive been doing nothing else for the last month bli me youre a corker said mr lowe back in newark new jersey jackson wylie sr was growing impatient in spite of his sons weekly reports he had begun to fret at the indefinite nature of results up to date this dissatisfaction it was that had induced him to cable his invitation to the royal commission to visit the atlantic plant mr jackson wylie sr had a mysterious way of closing contracts once he came in personal contact with the proper people in the words of his envious competitors he had good terminal facilities and he felt sure in his own mind that he could get this job if only he could meet some member of that commission who possessed the power to act business was bad and in view of his sons preliminary reports he had relied upon the certainty of securing this tremendous contract he had even turned work away so that his plant might be ready for the rush with the result that many of his men now were idle and that he was running far below capacity but he likewise had his eye upon those english bonuses and when his associates rather timidly called his attention to the present state of affairs he assured them bitingly that he knew his business nevertheless he could not help chafing at delay nor longing for the time to come to submit the bid that had lain for a month upon his desk the magnitude of the figures contained therein was getting on mr wylies nerves on the tenth of may he received a cablegram in his own official cipher which translated read meet sir thomas drummond chairman royal barrata bridge commission arriving cunard liner campania thirteenth stopping waldorf arrange personally barrata contract caution the cablegram was unsigned but its address atwylie betrayed not only its destination but also the identity of its sender mr jackson wylie sr became tremendously excited the last word conjured up bewildering possibilities he was about to consult his associates when it struck him that the greatest caution he could possibly observe would consist of holding his own tongue now and henceforth they had seen fit to criticize his handling of the matter thus far he decided he would play safe and say nothing until he had first seen sir thomas drummond and learned the lay of the land he imagined he might then have something electrifying to tell them he had dealt from the bottom too often he had closed too many bridge contracts in his time to mistake the meaning of this visit or of that last word caution during the next few days mr jackson wylie sr had hard work to hold himself in and he was at a high state of nervous tension when on the morning of the fourteenth day of may he strolled into the waldorfastoria and inquired at the desk for sir thomas drummond there was no sir thomas stopping at the hotel although a mr t drummond from london had arrived on the campania the day before mr jackson wylie placed the heel of his right shoe upon the favorite corn of his left foot and bore down upon it heavily he must be getting into his dotage he reflected or else the idea of a fivemilliondollar job had him rattled of course sir thomas would not use his title at the rear desk he had his card blown up through the tube to mr t drummond and a few moments later was invited to take the elevator arriving at the sixth floor he needed no page to guide him boots pointed his way to the apartment of the distinguished visitor as plainly as a lettered signboard boots of all descriptions huntingboots ridingboots street shoes lowshoes pumps sandals black ones and tan ones all in a row outside the door it was a typically english display evidently sir thomas drummond was a personage of the most extreme importance and traveled in befitting style mr wylie told himself nothing was missing from the collection unless perhaps a pair of rubber hipboots a stoopshouldered old man with a marked accent and a portwine nose showed mr wylie into a parlor where the first object upon which his active eyes alighted was a mass of blueprints he knew these drawings he had figured on them himself he likewise noted a hatbox and a great shapeless english bag both plastered crazily with hotel and steamship labels hailing from every quarter of the world it was plain to be seen that sir thomas was a globetrotter mr drummond begs you to be seated the valet announced with what seemed an unnecessary accent on the mister then moved silently out mr wylie remarked to himself upon the value of discreet servants they were very valuable very hard to get in america this must be some lifelong servitor in his lordships family there was no occasion to inquire the identity of the tall florid englishman in tweeds who entered a moment later a bundle of estimates in his hand sir thomas drummond chairman of the royal barrata bridge commission was written all over him in large type his lordship did not go to the trouble of welcoming his visitor but scanned him frigidly through his glasses you are mr jackson wylie senior he demanded abruptly that is my name president of the atlantic bridge company of newark new jersey the same you received a cablegram from your son in london yes your lordship sir thomas made a gesture as if to forego the title let me see it please mr wylie produced the cablegram and drummond scanned it sharply evidently the identification was complete does any one besides your son and yourself know the contents of this message not a soul you have not told any one of my coming no sir very well sir thomas appeared to breathe easier he deliberately tore the cablegram into small bits then tossed the fragments into a wastepaper basket before waving his caller to a chair he still remained very cold very forceful although his stiff formality had vanished do you understand all about this bridge he inquired wylie senior took the cue of brusqueness and nodded shortly can you build it in the time specified with ease have you submitted your bid not yet i what is the amount of your proposal the president of the atlantic bridge company gasped this was the boldest the coldest work he had ever experienced many times he had witnessed public officials like sir thomas drummond approach this delicate point but never with such composure such matteroffact certainty and lack of moral scruple evidently however this englishman had come to trade and wanted a direct answer there was no false pose no romance here but jackson wylie sr was too shrewd a business man to name a rockbottom price to begin with the training of a lifetime would not permit him to deny himself a liberal leeway for hedging therefore he replied cautiously my figures will be approximately ј sterling it was his longest speech thus far for what seemed an hour to the bridgebuilder sir thomas drummond gazed at him with a cold hard eye then he folded his papers rolled up his blueprints placed them in the big travelingbag and carefully locked it when he had finished he flung out this question suddenly does that include the commissioners up to this point mr jackson wylie had spoken mainly in monosyllables now he quit talking altogether it was no longer necessary he merely shook his head in negation he was smiling slightly then i shall ask you to add ј sterling to your price his lordship calmly announced make your bid ј sterling and mail it in time for wednesdays boat i sail on the same ship proposals will be opened on the twentyfifth arrange for an english indemnity bond for ten per cent of your proposition do not communicate in any manner whatsoever with your son except to forward the sealed bid to him he is not to know of our arrangement you will meet me in london later we will take care of that ј out of the last forty per cent of the contract price which is payable thirty days after completion inspection and acceptance of the bridge you will not consult your associates upon leaving here do i make myself clear very well sir the figures are easy to remember ј ј to you i am pleased with the facilities your plant offers for doing the work i am confident you can complete the bridge on time and i beg leave to wish you a very pleasant good day jackson wylie sr did not really come to until he had reached the street even then he did not know whether he had come down the elevator or through the mailchute of one thing only was he certain he was due to retire in favor of his son he told himself that he needed a trip through the holy land with a guardian and a nursingbottle then he paused on the curb and stamped on his corn for a second time oh what an idiot i am he cried savagely i could have gotten ј to start with but by gad sir thomas is the coldestblooded thing i ever went against i i cant help but admire him having shown a deplorable lack of foresight mr wylie determined to make up for it by an ample display of hindsight if the profits on the job were not to be so large as they might have been he would at least make certain of them by obeying instructions to the letter in accordance with this determination he made out the bid himself and he mailed it with his own hand that very afternoon he put three blue stamps on the envelope although it required but two then he called up an automobile agency and ordered a foreign towncar his wife had admired he decided that she and the girls might go to paris for the fall shopping he might even go with them in view of that mornings episode for ten days he stood the pressure then on the morning of the twentyfourth he called his confrиres into the directors room that same room in which young hanford had made his talk a number of years before inasmuch as it was too late now for a disclosure to affect the opening of the bids in london he felt absolved from his promise to sir thomas gentlemen i have the honor to inform you he began pompously that the barrata bridge is ours we have the greatest structural steel job of the decade his chest swelled with justifiable pride how when what do you mean they cried he told them of his mysterious but fruitful interview at the waldorf ten days previously enjoying their expressions of amazement to the full then he explained in considerable detail the difficulties he had surmounted in securing such liberal figures from sir thomas we were ready to take the contract for ј as you will remember but by the exercise of some diplomacy he coughed modestly i may say by the display of some firmness and independence i succeeded in securing a clean profit of over what we had expected he accepted with becoming diffidence the congratulations which were showered upon him of course the news created a sensation but it was as nothing to the sensation that followed upon the receipt of a cablegram the next day which read atwylie newark new jersey terrible mistake somewhere we lost am coming home today mr jackson wylie sr also went home that day by carriage for after raving wildly of treachery after cursing the name of some english nobleman unknown to most of the office force he collapsed throwing his employees into much confusion there were rumors of an apoplectic stroke some one telephoned for a physician but the president of the atlantic bridge company only howled at the latter when he arrived what hit the old man hardest was the fact that he could not explain to his associates that he could not even explain to himself for that matter he could make neither head nor tail of the affair his son was on the high seas and could not be reached the mystery of the whole transaction threatened to unseat his reason even when his sorrowing heir arrived a week after the shock the father could gather nothing at first except the bare details all he could learn was that the royal barrata bridge commission had met on the twentyfifth day of may for the second time in its history with sir thomas drummond in the chair in the midst of an ultrabritish solemnity the bids had been opened and read nine of them two belgian one german two french one english one scottish and two american the only proposals that conformed to the specifications in every respect were the last named they were perfect the atlantic bridge company of newark new jersey offered to do the work as specified for ј sterling the patterson bridge company through its authorized agent mr henry hanford named a price of ј the rest was but a matter of detail having concluded this bald recital jackson wylie the second spread his hands in a gesture of despair i cant understand it he said dolefully i thought i had it cinched all the time you had it cinched bellowed his father you why you ruined it all why in hell did you send him over here i send who what are you talking about that man with the boots that lying thieving scoundrel sir thomas drummond of course the younger wylies face showed blank uncomprehending amazement sir thomas drummond was in london all the time i was there i saw him daily said he not until this very moment did the president of the atlantic bridge company comprehend the trap he had walked into but now the whole hideous business became apparent he had been fooled swindled and in a way to render recourse impossible nay in a manner to blacken his reputation if the story became public he fell actually ill from the passion of his rage and not even a long rest from the worries of business completely cured him the bitter taste of defeat would not down he might never have understood the matter thoroughly had it not been for a missive he received one day through the mail it was a bill from a london shoestore for twelve pairs of boots of varying styles made out to henry hanford and marked paid mr jackson wylie sr noted with unspeakable chagrin that the last word was heavily underscored in ink as if by another hand hanfords bill was indeed paid and with interest to date the cub reporter why he chose buffalo paul anderson never knew unless perhaps it had more newspapers than bay city michigan and because his ticket expired in the vicinity of buffalo for that matter why he should have given up an easy job as the mate of a tugboat to enter the tortuous paths of journalism the young man did not know and lacking the introspective faculty he did not stop to analyze his motives so far as he could discover he had felt the call to higher endeavor and just naturally had heeded it such things as practical experience and educational equipment were but empty words to him for he was young and hopeful and the world is kind at twentyone he had hoped to enter his chosen field with some financial backing and to that end when the desire to try his hand at literature had struck him he had bought an interest in a smokeconsumer which a fireman on another tugboat had patented in partnership with the inventor he had installed one of the devices beneath a sawmill boiler as an experiment although the thing consumed smoke surprisingly well it likewise unharnessed such an amazing army of heatunits that it melted the crownsheet of the boiler whereupon the sawmill men being singularly coarse and unimaginative fellows set upon the patentee and his partner with ashrakes drawbars and other ordinary unpatented implements a lumberjack beat hollowly upon their ribs with a peavy and that night young anderson sickened of smokeconsumers harked anew to the call of journalism and hiked arriving in buffalo with seven dollars and fifty cents to the good for seven dollars counted out in advance he chartered a furnished room for a week the same carrying with it a meal at each end of the day which left in andersons possession a superfluity of fifty cents to be spent in any extravagance he might choose next day he bought a copy of each newspaper and carefully scanning them selected the one upon which to bestow his reportorial gifts this done he weighed anchor and steamed through the town in search of the office walking in upon the city editor of the intelligencer he gazed with benevolent approval upon that busy gentlemans broad back he liked the place the office suited him and he decided to have his desk placed over by the window after a time the editor wheeled displaying a young smooth fat face out of which peered grayblue eyes with pinpoint pupils well he queried here i am said anderson so it appears what do you want work what kind newspapering what can you do anything well well cried the editor you dont look much like a newspaper man im not one yet but im going to be where have you worked nowhere you see im really a playwright the editors face showed a bit of interest playwright eh anderson anderson he mused dont recall the name no said paul ive never written any plays yet but im going to thats why i want to sort of begin here and get the hang of this writing game a boy entered with some proofs at that moment and tossed them upon the table distracting the attention of the newspaper man the latter wheeled back to his work and spoke curtly over his shoulder im not running a school of journalism goodby maybe youd like me to do a little space work id never like you get out im busy anderson retired gracefully jingling his scanty handful of nickels and dimes and a halfhour later thrust himself boldly in upon another editor but with no better result he made the rounds of all the offices although invariably rebuffed he became more firmly convinced than ever that journalism was his designated sphere that night after dinner he retired to his room with the evening papers wedged a chair against his bed and hoisting his feet upon the washstand absorbed the news of the day it was ineffably sweet and satisfying to be thus identified with the profession of letters and it was immeasurably more dignified than tugging on the saginaw river once he had schooled himself in the tricks of writing he decided he would step to higher things than newspaper work but for the present it was well to ground himself firmly in the rudiments of the craft in going through the papers he noted one topic which interested him a similar mystery story on the second page from what he could gather he judged that much space had already been given to it for now inasmuch as no solution offered the item was dying slowly the major portion of each article being devoted to a rehash of similar unsolved mysteries anderson read that the body of the goldenhaired girl still lay at the morgue unidentified bit by bit he pieced together the lean story that she was a suicide and that both the police and the press had failed in their efforts to unearth the least particle of information regarding her in spite of her remarkable beauty and certain unusual circumstances connected with her death investigation had led nowhere on the following day anderson again walked into the editorialrooms of the intelligencer and greeted the smooth fatfaced occupant thereof anything doing yet he inquired not yet said the newspaper man with a trace of annoyance in his voice as the applicant moved out he halted him at the door with the words oh wait andersons heart leaped after all he thought perseverance would not yet nor soon the editor smiled broadly and paul realized that the humor in those pinpoint eyes was rather cruel five other calls he made that day to be greeted gruffly in every instance except one one man encouraged him slightly by saying come back next week i may have an opening then in view of the payasyouenter policy in vogue at andersons boardinghouse he knew there could be no next week for him therefore he inquired how about a little space work in the meantime im pretty good at that stuff you are surest thing you know did you ever do any no but im good just the same huh the editor grunted theres no room now and come to think of it you neednt bother to get around next week i cant break in new men that evening young anderson again repaired to his room with his harvest of daily papers and again he read them thoroughly he was by no means discouraged as yet for his week had just begun there were still five days of grace and prime ministers have been made overnight nations have fallen in five days six calls a day for five days that meant thirty chances for a job it was a cinch hidden away among the back pages once more he encountered the goldenhairedgirl story and although one paper featured it a bit because of some imaginary clue the others treated it casually making public the information that the body still lay at the morgue a silent irritating thing of mystery on the third day paul made his usual round of calls he made them more quickly now because he was recognized and was practically thrown out of each editorial sanctum his serenity remained unruffled and his confidence undisturbed of all the six editors burns of the intelligencer treated him worst adding ridicule to his gruffness a refinement of cruelty which annoyed the young steamboat man anderson clenched his hardknuckled hand and estimated the distance from editorial ear to point of literary chin but realized in time that steamboat methods were out of place here in the politer realms of journalism four times more he followed his daily routine and on monday morning arose early to avoid his landlady his week was up his nickels and dimes were gone nevertheless he spent the day on his customary rounds he crept in late at night blue with the cold and rather dazed at his bad luck he had eaten nothing since the morning before and he knew that he dared not show up at the breakfasttable the next morning for the time being discouragement settled upon him it settled suddenly like some heavy smothering thing it robbed him of hope and redoubled his hunger he awoke at daylight roused by the sense of his defeat then tiptoed out while yet the landlady was abed and spent the day looking for work along the waterfront but winter had tied up the shipping and he failed as he likewise failed at sundry employment agencies where he offered himself in any capacity at noon he wandered into the park and finding a sheltered spot sunned himself as best he could he picked up the sheets of a windscattered paper and read until the chill december afternoon got into his bones and forced him to his feet the tale of the unidentified girl at the morgue recurred to him when he read the announcement that she would be buried two days later in the potters field perhaps the girl had starved for lack of work he reflected perhaps hunger and cold had driven her to her death certainly those two were to blame for many a tragedy calculated to mystify warmly clad policemen and wellfed reporters when he stole shivering into his bleak bedroom late that night he found a note pinned upon his pillow of course the landlady needed her rent all landladies were in need of money and of course he would get out in the morning he was glad she had not turned him out during the day for this afforded him sanctuary for another night at least after tomorrow it would be a park bench for his he left his valise behind in the morning rather lamenting the fact that the old lady could not wear the shirts it contained and hoping that she would realize a sufficient sum from their sale to pay his bill it was late afternoon when he commenced his listless tramp toward the newspaper offices since burns had become his pet aversion he saved him for the last framing a few farewell remarks befitting the death of hopes like his and rehearsing an exit speech suitable to mark his departure from the field of letters when he finally reached the intelligencer editorialrooms burns rounded on him angrily for the love of mike are you here again he demanded i thought you might like to have some space work by heavens youre persistent yes we editors are an unfeeling lot arent we the fat young man inquired no temperament no appreciation he laughed noiselessly give me a job anderson cried his voice breaking huskily ill make good ill do anything how long do you intend to keep bothering me questioned burns andersons cheeks were blue and the backs of his legs were trembling from weakness but he repeated stolidly give me a job i i wont bother you after that ill make good see if i dont you think well of yourself dont you if you thought half as well of me as i do paul assured him id be your star reporter star hell testily cried the editor we havent got such a thing they dont know theyre alive except on payday look at this blond girl at the morgue theyve wasted two weeks on that case he paused suddenly then his soft lips spread showing his sharp white teeth modifying his tone he continued say i rather like you anderson youre such a blamed nuisance youve half convinced me that youre a genius the younger mans hunger which had given up in despair raised its head and bit into his vitals sharply maybe i ive a notion to give you a chance thats all i want the caller quavered in a panic just give me a toehold thats all his voice broke in spite of his effort to hold it steady burns wasnt a bad sort after all just grouchy and irritable perhaps this was merely his way burns continued well i will give you an assignment a good assignment too and if you cover it ill put you on permanently ill do more than that ill pay you what we pay our best man if you make good thats fair isnt it he smiled benignly and the soontobe reporters wits went capering off in a hysterical stampede anderson felt the desire to wring the fellows hand all that counts in this office is efficiency the latter went on we play no favorites when a man delivers the goods we boost him when he fails we fire him theres no sentiment here and i hold my job merely because im the best man in the shop can you go to work tonight why why yes sir very well thats the spirit i like you can take your time on the story and you neednt come back till you bring it yes sir now pay attention here it is about two weeks ago a blond girl committed suicide in a main street boardinghouse the bodys down at the morgue now find out who she is he turned back to his desk and began to work the hungry youth behind him experienced a sudden sinking at the stomach all at once he became hopelessly empty and friendless and he felt his knees urging him to sit down he next became conscious that the shoulders of mr burns were shaking a bit as if he had encountered a piece of rare humor after an instant when anderson made no move to go the man at the desk wheeled about exposing a bloated countenance purple with suppressed enjoyment whats the matter he giggled dont you want the job i cant tell you any more about the girl thats all we know the rest is up to you youll find out everything wont you please do for your own sake and the sake of the intelligencer yes yes im sure you will because youre a good newspaper man you told me so yourself his appreciation of the jest threatened to strangle him mr burns began the other i im up against it i guess you dont know it but im hungry i havent eaten for three days at this the editor became positively apoplectic oh yes yes i do he nodded vigorously you show it in your face thats why i went out of my way to help you he he he now you run along and get me the girls name and address while i finish this proof then come back and have supper with me at the press club again he chortled and snickered whereupon something sullen and fierce awoke in young anderson he knew of a way to get food and a bed and a place to work even if it would only last thirty days for he judged burns was the kind of man who would yell for the police in case of an assault paul would have welcomed the prospect of prison fare but he reasoned that it would be an incomplete satisfaction merely to mash the pudgy face of mr burns and hear him clamor what he wanted at this moment was a job burnss beating could hold over this suicide case had baffled the pick of buffalos trained reporters it had foiled the best efforts of her police nevertheless this fatpaunched fellow had baited a starving man by offering him the assignment it was impossible it was a cruel joke and yet there might be a chance of success even while he was debating the point he heard himself say very well mr burns if you want her name ill get it for you he crammed his hat down over his ears and walked out leaving the astonished editor gazing after him with open mouth andersons first impulse had been merely to get out of burnss office out of sight of that grinning satyr and never to come back but before he had reached the street he had decided that it was as well to starve striving as with folded hands after all the dead girl had a name instead of leaving the building he went to the files of the paper and turning back uncovered the original story which he cut out with his penknife folded up and placed in his pocket this done he sought the lobby of a nearby hotel found a seat near a radiator and proceeded to read the clipping carefully it was a meager story but it contained facts and was free from the confusion and distortions of the later accounts which was precisely what he wished to guard against late one afternoon so the story went the girl had rented a room in a main street boardinghouse had eaten supper and retired at eleven oclock the next day when she did not respond to a knock on her door the room had been broken into and she had been found dead with an empty morphinebottle on the bureau that was all there were absolutely no clues to the girls identity for the closest scrutiny failed to discover a mark on her clothing or any personal articles which could be traced she had possessed no luggage save a little handsatchel or shoppingbag containing a few coins one fact alone stood out in the whole affair she had paid for her room with a twodollar canadian bill but this faint clue had been followed with no result no one knew the girl she had walked out of nowhere and had disappeared into impenetrable mystery those were the facts in the case and they were sufficiently limited to baffle the best efforts of buffalos trained detective force it would seem that there can be no human creature so obscure as to have neither relatives friends nor acquaintances and yet this appeared to be the case for a full description of this girl had been blazoned in the papers of every large city had been exposed in countless country postoffices and conveyed to the police of every city of the states and canada it was as if the mysterious occupant of the morgue had been born of the winter wind on that fateful evening two weeks before the country had been dragged by a net of publicity that marvelous finemeshed fabric from which no living man is small or shrewd enough to escape and still the sad white face at the morgue continued to smile out from its halo of gold as if in gentle mockery for a long time paul anderson sat staring into the realms of speculation his lips white with hunger his cheeks hollow and feverish from the battle he had waged his power of exclusion was strong therefore he lost himself to his surroundings finally however he roused himself from his abstraction and realized the irony of this situation he the weakest the most inexperienced of all the men who had tried had been set to solve this mystery and starvation was to be the fruit of his failure he saw that it had begun to snow outside in the lobby it was warm and bright and vivid with jostling life the music of a stringed orchestra somewhere back of him was calling welldressed men and women in to dinner all of them seemed happy hopeful purposeful he noted furthermore that three days without food makes a man cold even in a warm place and lightheaded too the north wind had bitten him cruelly as he crossed the street and now as he peered out of the plateglass windows the night seemed to hold other lurking horrors besides his want was like a burden and he shuddered weakly hesitating to venture out where the wind could harry him it was a great temptation to remain here where there was warmth and laughter and life nevertheless he rose and slunk shivering out into the darkness then laid a course toward the morgue while anderson trod the snowy streets a slackjowled editor sat at supper with some friends at the press club eating and drinking heartily as is the custom of newspaper men let down for a moment from the strain of their work he had told a story and his caustic way of telling it had amused his hearers for each and every one of them remembered the shabby applicant for work and all of them had wasted baffling hours on the mystery of this girl with the golden hair i guess i put a crimp in him giggled mr burns i gave him a chance to show those talents he recommends so highly the morgue on a night like this is a pretty dismal place for a hungry man said one of the others its none too cheerful in the daytime the others agreed and burns wabbled anew in his chair in appreciation of his humor young anderson had never seen a morgue and tonight owing to his condition his dread of it was childlike it seemed as if this particular charnelhouse harbored some grisly thing which stood between him and food and warmth and hope the nearer he drew to it the greater grew his dread a discourteous man shrunken as if from the chill of the place was hunched up in front of a glowing stove he greeted anderson sourly out into that courtyard turn to the left second door he directed shes in the third compartment anderson lacked courage to ask the fellow to come along but stumbled out into a snowfilled areaway lighted by a swinging incandescent which danced to the swirling eddies compartment he supposed bodies were kept upon slabs or tables or something like that he had steeled himself to see rows of unspeakable sights played upon by dripping water but he found nothing of the sort the second door opened into a room which he discovered was colder than the night outside evidently the result of artificial refrigeration he was relieved to find the place utterly bare except for a sort of car or truck which ran around the room on a track beneath a row of square doors these doors evidently opened into the compartments alluded to by the keeper which compartment had the fellow said paul abruptly discovered that he was rattled terribly rattled and he turned back out of the place he paused shortly however and took hold of himself now now he said aloud youre a bum reporter my boy an instant later he forced himself to jerk open the first door at his hand for what seemed a full minute he stared into the cavern as if petrified then he closed the door softly sweat had started from his every pore alone once more in the great room he stood shivering god he muttered this was newspaper training indeed he remembered now having read several days before about an italian laborer who had been crushed by a falling column to one unaccustomed to death in any form that object headon in the obscurity of the compartment had been a trying sight he began to wonder if it were really cold or stiflingly hot the boy ground his teeth and flung open the next door slamming it hurriedly again to blot out what it exposed why didnt they keep them covered why didnt they show a card outside must he examine every grisly corpse upon the premises he stepped to the third door and wrenched it open he knew the girl at once by her wealth of yellow hair and the beauty of her still white face there was no horror here no ghastly sight to weaken a mans muscles and sicken his stomach only a tired girl asleep anderson felt a great pity as he wheeled the truck opposite the door and reverently drew out the slab on which the body lay he gazed upon her intently for some time she was not at all as he had pictured her and yet there could be no mistake he took the printed description from his pocket and reread it carefully comparing it point by point when he had finished he found that it was a composite word photograph vaguely like and yet totally unlike the person it was intended to portray and so lacking in character that no one knowing the original intimately would have been likely to recognize her from it so that was why no word had come in answer to all this newspaper publicity after all this case might not be so difficult as it had seemed for the first time the dispirited youth felt a faint glow of encouragement he began to formulate a plan hurriedly he fumbled for his notebook and there in that house of death with his paper propped against the wall he wrote a twohundredword description a description so photographically exact that to this day it is preserved in the buffalo police archives as a perfect model he replaced the body in its restingplace and went out there was no chill in him now no stumbling nor weakness of any sort he had found a startingpoint had uncovered what all those trained newspaper men had missed and he felt that he had a chance to win twenty minutes later burns who had just come in from supper turned back from his desk with annoyance and challenge in his little narrow eyes well i think ive got her mr burns nonsense anyhow ive got a description that her father or her mother or her friends can recognize the one you and the other papers printed disguised her so that nobody could tell who she was it might have covered a hundred girls rapidly and without noting the editors growing impatience paul read the two descriptions then ran on breathlessly all we have to do is print ten or twenty thousand of these and mail them out with the morning edition separate sheets posters you understand so they can be nailed up in every postoffice within two hundred miles send some to the police of all the cities and well have a flash in twentyfour hours burns made no comment for a moment instead he looked the young man over angrily from his eager face to his unblacked shoes his silence his stare were eloquent why why not anderson demanded querulously i tell you this description isnt right it its nothing like her nothing at all say i thought id seen the last of you growled the corpulent man arent you on to yourself yet do you mean that your talk this evening dont go paul demanded quietly do you mean to say you wont even give me the chance you promised no i dont mean that what i said goes all right but i told you to identify this girl i didnt agree to do it what dyou think this paper is anyhow we want stories in this office we dont care who or what this girl is unless theres a story in her were not running a jobprint shop nor a mailorder business to identify strayed females twenty thousand posters bah and say dont you know that no two men can write similar descriptions of anybody or anything whats the difference whether her hair is burnished gold or raw gold or her eyes bluish gray instead of grayish blue rats beat it but i tell you whats her name where does she live what killed her thats what i want to know id look fine wouldnt i circularizing a dead story wouldnt that be a laugh on me no mr anderson author artist and playwright im getting damned tired of being pestered by you and you neednt come back here until you bring the goods do i make myself plain it was anger which cut short the younger mans reply on account of petty economy for fear of ridicule this editor refused to relieve some withered old woman some bent and worried old man who might be who probably were waiting waiting waiting in some outoftheway village so anderson reflected because there might not be a story in it this girl would go to the potters field and her people would never know and yet by heaven they would know something told him there was a story back of this girls death and he swore to get it with a mighty effort he swallowed his chagrin and disregarding the insult to himself replied very well ive got you this time humph burns grunted viciously i dont know how ill turn the trick but ill turn it for the second time that evening he left the office with his jaws set stubbornly paul anderson walked straight to his boardinghouse and bearded his landlady ive got a job said he im very glad the lady told him honestly enough i feared you were going to move out yes he repeated ive got a job that carries the highest salary on the paper you remember the yellowhaired girl who killed herself awhile ago he asked indeed i do everybody knows about that case well it got too tough for the police and the other reporters so they turned it over to me its a bully assignment and my pay starts when i solve the mystery now im starved i wish youd rustle me some grub but mr anderson youre bill for this week you know i get paid in tut tut you know how newspapers are they dont pay in advance and i cant pay you until they pay me youll probably have to wait until saturday for im a little out of practice on detective stuff but ill have this thing cleared up by then you dont appreciate you cant appreciate what a corking assignment it is anderson had a peculiarly engaging smile and five minutes later he was wrecking the pantry of all the edibles his fellowboarders had overlooked the while his landlady told him her lifes history wept over the memory of her departed husband and confessed that she hoped to get out of the boardinghouse business some time a good nights sleep and a hearty breakfast put the young man in fine fettle and about ten oclock he repaired to a certain roominghouse on main street the number of which he obtained from the clipping in his pocket a girl answered his ring but at sight of him she shut the door hurriedly explaining through the crack mrs macdougal is out and you cant come in but i want to talk to you im not allowed to talk to reporters she declared mrs macdougal wont let me a slight scotch accent gave anderson his cue macdougal is a good scotch name im scotch myself and so are you he smiled his boardinghouse smile and the girls eyes twinkled back at him didnt she tell you i was coming why no sir arent you a reporter ive been told that im not i came to look at a room what room the girl asked quickly we havent any vacant rooms thats queer anderson frowned i cant be mistaken im sure mrs macdougal said there was one the door opened slowly maybe she meant the one on the second floor precisely an instant later he was following his guide upstairs anderson recognized the room at a glance from its description but the girl did not mention the tragedy which had occurred therein so he proceeded to talk terms with her prolonging his stay as long as possible meanwhile using his eyes to the best advantage he invented an elaborate ancestry which he traced backward through the pages of scottish chiefs the only book of the sort he had ever read and by the time he was ready to leave the girl had thawed out considerably ill take the room he told her and im well pleased to get it i dont see how such a good one stands vacant in this location there was an instants pause then his companion confessed theres a reason youll find it out sooner or later so i may as well tell you thats where the yellowhaired girl you hear so much about killed herself i hope it wont make any difference to you mr gregor certainly not i read about the case canadian wasnt she oh yes theres no doubt of it she paid her rent with a canadian bill and besides i noticed her accent i didnt tell the reporters however theyre such a fresh lot pauls visit it appeared had served to establish one thing at least a thing which the trained investigators had not discovered canadian money in buffalo was too common to excite comment therefore none of them had seen fit to follow out that clue of the twodollar bill the papers had it that she was some wealthy girl the former speaker ran on but i know better indeed how do you know her hands they were good hands and she used them as if she knew what they were made for anything else no she seemed very sad and didnt say much of course i only saw her once anderson questioned the girl at some further length but discovered nothing of moment so he left declaring that he would probably move into the room on the following day prom the roominghouse he went directly to the morgue and for a second time examined the body confining his attention particularly to the hands the right one showed nothing upon which to found a theory save that it was indeed a capable hand with smooth skin and welltended nails but on examining the left paul noted a marked peculiarity near the ends of the thumb and the first finger the skin was roughened abrased there were numerous tiny black spots beneath the skin which upon careful scrutiny he discovered to be microscopic bloodblisters for a long time he puzzled over this phenomenon which had escaped all previous observers but to save him he could invent no explanation for it he repaired finally to the office of the attendant and asked for the girls clothes receiving permission to examine a small bundle wheres the rest he demanded thats all she had said the man no baggage at all not a thing but what she stood up in the coroner has her jewelry and things of that sort anderson searched the contents of the bundle with the utmost care but found no mark of any sort the garments although inexpensive were beautifully neat and clean and they displayed the most marvelous examples of needlework he had ever seen among the effects was a plush muff out of which as he picked it up fell a pair of little knitted mittens or was there a pair finding but the one he shook the muff again then looked through the other things wheres the other mitten he inquired there aint been but the one the attendant told him are you sure see here do you think im trying to hold out a yarn mitten on you i say there aint been but the one i was here when she came and i know discouraged by the paucity of clues which this place offered anderson went next to the coroners office the city hall newspaper squad had desks in this place but paul paid no attention to them or to their occupants he went straight to the wicket and asked for the effects of the dead girl it appeared that burns had told his practical joke broadcast for the young man heard his name mentioned and then some one behind him snickered he paid no attention however for the clerk had handed him a small leather bag or purse together with a morphinebottle about the size and shape of an ordinary vaselinebottle the bag was cheap and bore no makers name or mark inside of it was a brooch a ring a silver chain and a slip of paper stuck to the bottom of the reticule was a small key paul came near overlooking the lastnamed article for it was well hidden in a fold near the corner now a key to an unknown lock is not much to go on at best therefore he gave his attention to the paper it was evidently a scrap torn from a sheet of wrappingpaper and bore these figures in pencil while he was reading these figures paul heard a reporter say loudly now that i have written the paper who will take it another answered i will who are you inquired the first voice hawkshaw the detective andersons cheeks flushed but he returned the bag and its contents without comment and walked out heedless of the laughter of the six reporters the injustice of their ridicule burnt him like a brandingiron for his only offense lay in trying the impossible these fellows had done their best and had failed yet they jeered at him because he had tackled a forlorn hope they had taken the trail when it was hot and had lost it now they railed at him when he took it cold all that afternoon he tramped the streets thinking thinking until his brain went stale the only fresh clues he had discovered thus far were the marks on finger and thumb the fact that the girl was a canadian and that she had possessed but one mitten instead of two this last for obvious reasons was too trivial to mean anything and yet in so obscure a case it could not be ignored the fact that she was a canadian helped but little therefore the best point upon which to hang a line of reasoning seemed to be those black spots on the left hand but they stumped anderson absolutely he altered his mental approach to the subject and reflected upon the girls belongings taken in their entirety they showed nothing save that the girl was poor therefore he began mentally to assort them one by one first clothes they were ordinary clothes they betrayed nothing second the purse it was like a million other purses and showed no distinguishing mark no peculiarity third the jewelry it was cheap and common of a sort to be found in any store fourth the morphinebottle paul was forced likewise to dismiss consideration of that there remained nothing but the scrap of paper torn from the corner of a large sheet and containing these penciled figures it was a simple sum in subtraction a very simple sum indeed too simple anderson reflected for any one to reduce to figures unless those figures had been intended for a purpose he recalled the face at the morgue and vowed that such a girl could have done the sum mentally then why the paper why had she taken pains to tear off a piece of wrappingpaper jot down figures so easy to remember and preserve them in her purse why she did so because she was methodical something answered but his alter ego reasoned if she had been sufficiently methodical to note a trivial transaction so carefully she would have been sufficiently methodical to use some better some more methodical method she would not have torn off a corner of thick wrappingpaper upon which to keep her books there was but one answer memorandum all right memorandum it was for the time being now then in what business could she have been engaged where she found it necessary to keep memoranda of such inconsiderable sums oh lord there were a million paul had been walking on thin ice from the start now it gave way beneath him so he abandoned this train of thought and went back once more to the bundle of clothes surely there was a clue concealed somewhere among them if only he could find it they were poor clothes and yet judging by their cut he fancied the girl had looked exceedingly well in them nay even modish she had evidently spent much time on them as the beautiful needlework attested at this point andersons mind ran out on to thin ice again so he reverted to the girl herself for the nth time she was canadian her hands were useful there were tiny bloodblisters on the left thumb and index finger and the skin was roughened and torn minutely evidently by some sharp instrument what instrument he answered the question almost before he had voiced it a needle of course paul stopped in his walk so abruptly that a man poked him in the back with a ladder but he paid no heed for his mind was leaping that thickening of the skin those tiny scratches those bloodblisters those garments without mark of maker yet so stylish in cut and so carefully made and furthermore that memorandum why she was a dressmaker said anderson out loud he went back over his reasoning but it held good so good that he would have wagered his own clothes that he was right yes and those figures represented some trifling purchases or commission for a customer no doubt it followed naturally that she was not a buffalo dressmaker else she would have been identified long since nor was it likely that she came from any city for her clothes had not given him the impression of being citymade and moreover the publicity given to the case through the press even allowing for the fact that the printed description had been vague would have been sure to uncover her identity no she was a canadian country seamstress the young mans mind went back a few years to his boyhood on a michigan farm where visiting dressmakers used to come and stay by the week to make his mothers clothes they usually carried a little flat trunk filled with patterns yard sticks forms and other paraphernalia of the trade paul remembered that the owners used to buy the cloths and materials at the country stores and render a strict accounting thereof to his mother well where was the trunk that went with this country dressmaker the question of baggage had puzzled him from the start had the girl been possessed of a grip or bundle of any kind at the time of her death that question would have been answered but there was absolutely nothing of the sort in her room her complete lack of luggage had made him doubt at first that she was an outoftown visitor but following his recent conclusions he decided now that directly the opposite was true she had come to buffalo with nothing but a trunk otherwise she would have taken her handluggage with her to the main street roominghouse it remained to find that trunk this problem threatened even greater difficulties than any hitherto and paul shivered as the raw lake wind searched through his clothes he wondered if it had been as cold as this when the girl arrived in buffalo yes assuredly then why did she go out with only one mitten his reason told him that the other one had been lost by the police but the police are careful as a rule they had saved every other article found in the girls possession even to a brooch and pin and scrap of paper probably the girl herself had lost it but country dressmakers are careful too they are not given to losing mittens especially in cold weather it was more reasonable to believe that she had mislaid it among her belongings inasmuch as those belongings according to pauls logic were doubtless contained in her trunk that was probably where the missing mitten would be found but after all had she really brought a trunk with her like a flash came the recollection of that key stuck to the bottom of the girls leather purse at the coroners office ten minutes later paul was back at the city hall for a second time he was greeted with laughter by the reportorial squad again he paid no heed why you saw those things not two hours ago protested the coroners clerk in answer to his inquiry i want to see them again well im busy youve had them once thats enough friend said anderson quietly i want those things and i want them quick you give them to me or ill go to the man higher up and get them and your job along with them the fellow obeyed reluctantly paul picked the key loose and examined it closely while he was thus engaged one of the reporters behind him said aha at last he has the key to the mystery the general laughter ceased abruptly when the object of this banter thrust the key into his pocket and advanced threateningly toward the speaker his face white with rage the latter rose to his feet he undertook to execute a dignified retreat but anderson seized him viciously flung him back and pinned him against the wall crying furiously you dirty rat if you open your face to me again ill brain you and that goes for all of this deathwatch he took in the other five men with his reddened eyes when you fellows see me coming hole up understand his grip was so fierce his mouth had such a wicked twist to it that his victim understood him perfectly and began to grin in a sickly apologetic fashion paul reseated the reporter at his desk with such violence that a chair leg gave way then he strode out of the building for the next few hours anderson tramped the streets in impotent anger striving to master himself for that trifling episode had so upset him that he could not concentrate his mind upon the subject in hand when he tried to do so his conclusions seemed grotesquely fanciful and farfetched this delay was all the more annoying because on the morrow the girl was to be buried and therefore the precious hours were slipping away he tried repeatedly to attain that abstract subconscious mood in which alone shines the pure light of inductive reasoning where is that trunk where is that trunk where is that trunk he repeated tirelessly could it be in some other roominghouse no if the girl had disappeared from such a place leaving her trunk behind the publicity would have uncovered the fact it might be lying in the baggageroom of some hotel to be sure but paul doubted that for the same reason the girl had been poor too it was unlikely that she would have gone to a highpriced hotel well he couldnt examine all the baggage in all the cheap hotels of the city that was evident somehow he could not picture that girl in a cheap hotel she was too fine too patrician no it was more likely that she had left her trunk in some railroad station this was a long chance but paul took it the girl had come from canada therefore anderson went to the grand trunk railway depot and asked for the baggagemaster there were other roads but this seemed the most likely a rawboned irish baggageman emerged from the confusion and of a sudden paul realized the necessity of even greater tact here than he had used with the scotch girl for he had no authority of any sort behind him by virtue of which he could demand so much as a favor are you a married man he inquired abruptly gwan i thought ye wanted a baggageman the big fellow replied dont kid me this is important shure i am but i dont want any accident insurance i took a chance and im game have you any daughters two of them but whats it to ye suppose one of them disappeared the baggageman seized anderson by the shoulder his eyes dilated with a catch in his voice he cried love o god speak out what are ye drivin at nothing has happened to your girls but then what in hell wait i had to throw a little scare into you so youd understand what im getting at suppose one of your girls lay dead and unidentified in the morgue of a strange city and was about to be buried in the potters field youd want to know about it wouldnt you are ye daft or has something really happened if not its a damn fool question what dye want listen youd want her to have a decent burial and youd want her mother to know how she came to such a pass wouldnt you the irishman mopped his brow uncertainly i would that then listen some more paul told the man his story freely earnestly but rapidly he painted the picture of a shy lonely girl homeless hopeless and despondent in a great city then the picture of two old people waiting in some distant farmhouse sick at heart and uncertain seeing their daughters face in the firelight hearing her sigh in the night wind he talked in homely words that left the baggagemans face grave then he told how burns in a cruel jest had sent a starving boy out to solve the mystery that had baffled the best detectives when he had finished his listener cried shure it was a rotten trick but why dye come here i want you to go through your baggageroom with me till we find a trunk which this key will fit come on with ye im blamed if i dont admire yer nerve of course ye understand ive no right to let ye in thats up to the stationmaster but hes a grouchy divil the speaker led paul into a room piled high with trunks then summoned two helpers well move every dam wan of them till we fit your little key he declared then the four men fell to a blind search promised to be a job of hours so paul walked down the runway between the piles of trunks using his eyes as he went at least he could eliminate certain classes of baggage and thus he might shorten the search but halfway down the row he called sharply to the smashers come here quick at his tone they came running look that one in the bottom row he cried thats it something tells me it is on the floor underneath the pile was a little flat battered tin trunk pathetically oldfashioned and out of place among its more stylish neighbors it was the kind of trunk paul had seen in his mothers front room on the farm it was bound about with a bit of rope his excitement infected the others and the three smashers went at the pile regardless of damage andersons suspense bid fair to choke him what if this were not the one he asked himself but what if it were the right one what if this key he clutched in his cold palm should fit the lock paul pictured what he would see when he lifted the lid a collection of forms hangers patterns yardsticks a tape measure and somewhere in it a little black yarn mitten he prayed blindly for courage to withstand disappointment there she is panted his irish friend dragging the object out into the clear the other men crowded closer come on lad what are ye waitin for anderson knelt before the little battered trunk and inserted the key it was the keenest moment he had ever lived he turned the key then he was on his feet cold calm his blue eyes glittering cut those ropes quick he ordered were right the man at his side whipped out a knife and slashed twice come close all of you paul directed and remember everything we find you may have to testify he lifted the lid on the top of the shallow tray lay a little black yarn mitten the mate to that one in the city morgue anderson smiled into the faces of the men at his side thats it he said simply the tall irishman laid a hand on his shoulder saying yer all right boy dont get rattled paul opened the till and found precisely the paraphernalia he had expected there were forms hangers patterns yardsticks and a tape measure in the compartment beneath were some neatly folded clothes the needlework of which was fine and in one corner a bundle of letters which anderson examined with trembling fingers they were addressed to miss mabel wilkes highland ontario canada care of captain wilkes the amateur detective replaced the letters carefully he closed and locked the trunk then he thanked his companions if i had a dollar in the world said he id ask you boys to have a drink but im broke then he began to laugh foolishly hysterically until the rawboned man clapped him on the back again straighten up lad yeve been strained a bit too hard ill telephone for the cops in an instant paul was himself youll do nothing of the sort he cried why man youll spoil the whole thing ive worked this out alone and if the police hear of it theyll notify all the papers and ill have no story burns wont give me that job and ill be hungry again true i forgot that fatheaded divil of an editor well you say the word and nobody wont know nothin from us hey boys sure not the other men agreed this lad was one of their kind he was up against it and fighting for his own therefore they knew how to sympathize but paul had been seized with terror lest his story might get away from him therefore he bade them a hasty goodby and sped uptown his feet could not carry him swiftly enough burns greeted him sourly when he burst into the editorial sanctum it was not yet twentyfour hours since he had sent this fellow away with instructions not to return are you back again he snarled i heard about your assaulting wells down at the city hall dont try it on me or ill have you pinched paul laughed lightly i dont have to fight for my rights any more indeed what are you grinning about have you found who that girl is i have what burnss jaw dropped limply he leaned forward in his chair yes sir ive identified her the fat man was at first incredulous then suspicious dont try any tricks on me he cried warningly dont try to put anything over her name is mabel wilkes she is the daughter of captain wilkes of highland ontario she was a country dressmaker and lived with her people at that place her trunk is down at the grand trunk depot with the rest of her clothes in it together with the mate to the mitten she had when she killed herself i went through the trunk with the baggagemaster name corrigan heres the key which i got from her purse at the coroners office burns fixed his round eyes upon the key then he shifted them slowly to andersons face why why this is amazing i i he cleared his throat nervously how did you discover all this who told you nobody told me i reasoned it out but how good lord am i dreaming im a good newspaper man ive been telling you that every day maybe youll believe me now burns made no reply instead he pushed a button and wells of the city hall squad entered pausing abruptly at sight of anderson giving the latter no time for words mr burns issued his instructions on the instant he was the trained newspaper man again cheating the clock dial and trimming minutes his words were sharp and decisive that suicide story has broken big and weve got a scoop anderson has identified her take the first gt train for highland ontario and find her father captain wilkes wire me a full story about the girl mabel private life history everything take plenty of space have it in by midnight wellss eyes were round too they were glued upon paul with a hypnotic stare but he managed to answer yes sir he was no longer grinning now anderson the editor snapped get downstairs and see if you can write the story pile it on thick its a corker very good sir but id like a little money that elated youth demanded boldly just advance me fifty will you remember im on top salary burns made a wry face ill send a check down to you he promised but get at that story and make it a good one or ill fire you tonight anderson got he found a desk and began to write feverishly a halfhour later he read what he had written and tore it up another halfhour and he repeated the performance three times he wrote the tale and destroyed it then paused realizing blankly that as a newspaper story it was impossible every atom of interest surrounding the suicide of the girl grew out of his own efforts to solve the mystery nothing had happened no new clues had been uncovered no one had been implicated in the girls death there was no crime it was a tale of paul andersons deductions nothing more and it had no newspaper value he found he had written about himself instead of about the girl he began again this time laboriously eliminating himself and when he had finished his story it was perhaps the poorest journalistic effort ever written upon lagging feet he bore the copy to burnss office but the editor gave him no time for explanation demanding fiercely wheres that check i sent you here it is the youth handed it to him make a mistake i certainly did burns tore up the check before saying now you get out you bum and stay out or take the consequences get out what for you know what for burns was quivering with rage you ran a good bluff and you nearly put it over but i dont want to advertise myself as a jackass so i shant have you pinched unless you come back come back i intend to stay whats the matter i had an idea you were fourflushing stormed the editor so i went down to the gt depot myself theres no trunk of the sort there corrigan never saw you or anybody like you say why didnt you walk out when you got that check what made you come back anderson began to laugh softly good old corrigan hes all right isnt he well he gets half of that check when you rewrite it if i dont laugh myself to death before i get to the bank what dyou mean burns was impressed by the others confidence nothing except that ive found one square man in this village one square guy is a pretty big percentage in a town the size of buffalo corrigan wouldnt let you see the depot if i wasnt along put on your coat and come with me yes and bring a couple of hired men if it will make you feel any better at the depot he called the baggagemaster to him and said mr corrigan this is mr burns the city editor of the intelligencer thats what he told me grinned the irishman utterly ignoring the young editor but you didnt give him no references and i wouldnt take a chance burns maintained a dignified silence he said little even when the contents of the trunk were displayed to him nor did he open his mouth on the way back to the office but when he was seated at his desk and had read andersons copy he spoke this is the rottenest story ever turned in at this office said he i know it is paul agreed frankly then explained his difficulty in writing it ill do it myself burns told him now you go home and report tomorrow a very tired but a very happy young man routed out the landlady of a cheap boardinghouse that night and hugged her like a bear explaining joyously that he had done a great big thing he waltzed her down the hall and back while she clutched wildly at her flapping flannel wrapper and besought him to think of her other boarders he waltzed her out of her bedroom slippers gave her a smacking big kiss on her wrinkled cheek then left her breathless and scandalized but all aflutter the city had read the story when anderson awoke the next morning for the intelligencer had made a clean beat and burns had played up the story tremendously hence it was with jumping pulses that paul scanned the front page of that journal the further he read however the greater grew his indignation the history of mabel wilkes under the magic touch of burns had to be sure become a wonderful tragic story but nowhere in it was mention made of paul anderson in the patient and ingenious solution of the mystery of the girls identity no credit was given to him the cleverness and the perseverance of the buffalo intelligencer was exploited its able reportorial staff was praised its editorial shrewdness extolled but that was all when he had concluded reading the article anderson realized that it was no more than a boost for the city editor who it was plain to be seen had uncovered the story bit by bit greatly to the confusion of the police and the detective bureau it astounded as well as angered paul to realize how cleverly burns had covered him up therefore the sense of injustice was strong in him when he entered the office his enemy recognized his mood and seemed to gloat over it that was good work you did he purred and ill keep you on as long as you show ability of course you cant write yet so ill let you cover realestate transactions and the market ill send for you when youre needed anderson went back to his desk in silent rage real estate burns evidently intended to hold him down his gloomy meditations were somewhat lightened by the congratulations of his fellowreporters who rather timidly ventured to introduce themselves they understood the facts and they voiced a similar indignation to his burns had played him a rotten trick they agreed not content with robbing his new reporter of the recognition which was justly his the fellow was evidently determined to vent his spite in other ways well that was like burns they voiced the opinion that anderson would have a tough job getting through interference of the kind that their editor would throw in his way hour after hour paul sat around the office nursing his disappointment waiting for burns to send him out about two oclock wells hurried into the office bringing with him the afternoon papers still wet from the press in his eyes was an unwonted sparkle he crossed directly to anderson and thrust out his palm old man i want to shake with you said he and i want to apologize for being a rotter paul met him halfway and the fellow went on burns gave us the wrong tip on you said you were a joke thats why we joshed you but you showed us up and im glad you did why thank you stammered the new reporter upon whom this manly apology had a strong effect it it was more luck than anything luck nothing youre a genius and its a dirty shame the way the boss tried to steal your credit however it seems he overreached himself wells began to laugh tried to steal it good lord he did steal it how do you mean he overreached himself havent you seen the afternoon papers no well read em mr wells spread his papers out before paul whose astonished eyes took in for a second time the story of the wilkes suicide but what a story he read his own name in big black type he read headlines that told of a starving boy sent out on a hopeless assignment as a cruel joke he read the story as it had really occurred only told in the third person by an author who was neither ashamed nor afraid to give credit where it was due the egotistical pretense of the buffalo intelligencer was torn to shreds and ridicule was heaped upon its editor paul read nervously breathlessly until wells interrupted him im to blame for this said he i couldnt stand for such a crooked deal when i got in this morning and saw what that fat imbecile had done to you i tipped the true facts off to the others all of the facts i knew they got the rest from corrigan down at the grand trunk depot of course this means my job if the old man finds it out but i dont give a damn as yet anderson was too dazed to grasp what had happened to him but the other continued the boys have had it in for burns on the quiet for months and now i guess theyre even i i dont know how to thank you stammered anderson dont try youre a born reporter and the other papers will give you a job even if the baby hippo in yonder fires you a boy touched paul on the arm with the announcement mr burns wants to see you oho cried wells hes got the bad news gee id like to hear what he says ill bet hes biting splinters out of his desk let me know what comes off will you when anderson entered the office of his editor he was met by a whitefaced man whose rage had him so by the throat that speech for a moment was impossible beneath mr burnss feet and strewn broadcast about the room were the crumpled sheets of the afternoon papers burns glared at the newcomer for a moment then he extended a shaking finger crying furiously you did this did what you put up this job you made a fool of me no sir i did not your parents saw to that dont tell me you didnt you you damned ungrateful burns seemed about to assault his reporter but restrained himself youre fired do you understand fired discharged say burns not a word im done with you i just a minute young anderson cried in a tone that stilled the other im fired am i for something i didnt do very well im glad of it for now you cant stand in my way you tried to doublecross me and failed you robbed me of what was mine and got caught at it youre a big man in your way burns but some day people will tell you that the biggest thing you ever did was to fire paul anderson thats how small youll be and thats how big im going to grow youve welched on your own word but theres one thing you gave me that you cant take away and thats the knowledge that im a newspaper man and a good one now just one thing more im broke today but im going to lick you as soon as i save up enough for the fine with studied insolence the speaker put on his hat slammed the door behind him and walked out of the intelligencer office leaving the apoplectic editor thereof secure in the breathless knowledge that for once in his life he had heard the truth spoken mr burns wondered how long it would take that young bully to save up ten dollars and costs out of the night there is but one remedy for your complaint doctor suydam settled deeper into his chair marry the girl that is the only piece of your professional advice i ever cared to follow but how any way you can use force if necessary only marry her otherwise i predict all sorts of complications for you melancholia brainfag bankruptcy austin laughed could you write me a prescription oh shell have you bob you dont seem to realize that you are a good catch austin finished buckling his puttee before rising to his full height that doesnt mean anything to her she doesnt need to make a catch nonsense shes just like all the others only richer and nicer go at her as if she were the cornmarket she wont be half so hard to corner you have made a name for yourself and a blamed sight more money than you deserve you are young comparatively i mean the elder man stroked his shock of irongray hair for answer well at any rate you are a picturesque personage even if you cant wear ridingclothes doesnt a man look like the devil in these togs austin posed awkwardly in front of a mirror theres only one person who can look worse in ridingclothes than a man thats a woman what heresy particularly in a society doctor but i agree with you i learned to ride on her account you know as a matter of fact i hate it the sight of a horse fills me with terror doctor suydam laughed outright at this she tells me that you have a very good seat really austins eyes gleamed suddenly you know i never had a chance to ride when i was a youngster in fact i never had an opportunity to do anything except work thats what makes me so crude and awkward what i know i have picked up during the last few years you make me tired declared the former you arent oh i dont skate on waxed floors nor spill tea nor clutch at my chauffeur in a tight place but you know what i mean i feel lonesome in a dresssuit a butler fills me with gloom and well im not one of you thats all perhaps thats what makes a hit with marmion shes used to the other kind it seems to me that i have always worked ruminated the former speaker i dont remember that i ever had time to play even after i came to the city its a mighty sad thing to rob a boy of his childhood it makes him a dull unattractive sort when he grows up i used to read about people like miss moore but i never expected to know them until i met you of course that corn deal rather changed things well i should rather say it did suydam agreed with emphasis the result is that when i am with her i forget the few things i have done that are worth while and i become the farmhand again im naturally rough and angular and she sees it oh youre too sensitive you have a heart like a girl underneath that saturnine front of yours and while you look like the sphinx you are really as much of a kid at heart as i am where do you ride today riverside drive what horse is she riding pointer the doctor shook his head too many automobiles on the drive hes a rotten nag for a woman anyhow his mouth is as tough as a stirrup and he has the disposition of a tarantula why doesnt she stick to the park you know marmion say wouldnt it be great if pointer bolted and you saved her life she couldnt refuse you then austin laughed thats not exactly the way id care to win her however if pointer bolted id probably get rattled and fall off my own horse i dont like the brutes come on im late thats right grumbled the other leave me here while you make love to the nicest girl in new york im going down to the office and amputate somebody they descended the single flight to the street where austins groom was struggling with a huge black its coming pretty soft for you brokers the doctor growled as his companion swung himself into the saddle the next time i get a friend ill keep him to myself austin leaned forward with a look of grave anxiety upon his rugged features and said wish me luck doc im going to ask her today good for you old fellow there was great fondness in the younger mans eyes as he wrung the riders hand and waved him adieu then watched him disappear around the corner shell take him he mused half aloud shes a sensible girl even if all new york has done its best to spoil her he hailed a taxicab and was hurried to his office it was perhaps two hours later that he was called on the telephone hello yes yes what is it he cried irritably mercy hospital what the young physician started hurt you say runaway go on quick he listened with whitening face then broke in abruptly of course he sent for me ill be right up he slammed the receiver upon its hook and seizing his hat bolted out through a waitingroom full of patients his car was in readiness and he called to his chauffeur in such tones that the fellow vaulted to his seat go up madison avenue theres less traffic there and for gods sake hurry during two years service with new yorks most fashionable physician the driver had never received a command like this and he opened up his machine a policeman warned him at thirtythird street and the car slowed down at which suydam leaned forward crying roughly to hell with regulations theres a man dying the last word was jerked from him as he was snapped back into his seat regardless of admonitory shouts from patrolmen the french car sang its growing song while truckdrivers bellowed curses and pedestrians fled from crossings at the scream of its siren a crosstown car blocked them and the brakes screeched in agony while doctor suydam was wellnigh catapulted into the street then they were under way again with the car leaping from speed to speed it was the first time the driver had ever dared to disregard those upraised whitegloved hands and it filled his joyriding soul with exultation a street repair loomed ahead whereupon with a sickening skid they swung into a side street the gears clashed again and an instant later they shot out upon fifth avenue at the next corner they lay motionless in a blockade while the motor shuddered then they dodged through an opening where the mudguards missed by an inch and were whirling west toward broadway at th street a bicycle officer stared in amazement at the dwindling number beneath the rear axle then ducked his head and began to pedal he overhauled the speeding machine as it throbbed before the doors of mercy hospital to be greeted by a grinning chauffeur who waved him toward the building and told of a doctors urgency inside doctor suydam pallid of face and shaking in a most unprofessional manner was bending over a figure in ridingclothes the figure of a tall muscular man who lay silent deaf to his words of greeting they told him all there was to tell in the deadly impersonal way of hospitals while he nodded swift comprehension there had been a runaway a woman on a big whiteeyed bay that had taken fright at an automobile a swift rush up the driveway a lunge over the neck of the pursuing horse then a man wrenched from his saddle and dragged beneath cruel murderous hoofs the bay had gone down and the woman was senseless when the ambulance arrived but she had revived and had been hurried to her home in the mans hand they had found the fragment of a bridle rein gripped with such desperation that they could not remove it until he regained consciousness he had asked regarding the girls safety then sighed himself into oblivion again they told suydam that he would die with sick heart the listener cursed all highspirited women and highstrung horses declaring them to be works of the devil like automobiles then he went back to the side of his friend where other hands less unsteady were at work poor lonely old bob he murmured not a soul to care except marmion and me and god knows whether she cares or not but robert austin did not die although the attending surgeons said he would said he should in fact unless all the teachings of their science were at fault he even offended the traditions of the hospital by being removed to his own apartments in a week there suydam who had watched him night and day told him that miss moore had a broken shoulder and hence could not come to see him poor girl said austin faintly if id known more about horses i might have saved her if youd known more about horses youd have let pointer run declared his friend nobody but an idiot or a bob austin would have taken the chance you did how is your head the sick man closed his eyes wearily it hurts all the time whats the matter with it weve none of us been able to discover what isnt the matter with it why in thunder did you hold on so long because i i love her i suppose did you ask her to marry you suydam had been itching to ask the question for days no i was just getting to it when pointer bolted i im slow at such things there was a moments pause doc whats the matter with my eyes i cant see very well dont talk so much ordered the physician youre lucky to be here at all thanks to that copperriveted constitution of yours youll get well but it seemed that the patient was fated to disappoint the predictions of his friend as well as those of the surgeons at mercy hospital he did not recover in a manner satisfactory to his medical adviser and although he regained the most of his bodily vigor the injury to his eyes baffled even the most skilled specialists he was very brave about it however and wrung the heart of doctor suydam by the uncomplaining fortitude with which he bore examination after examination learned oculists theorized vaporously about optic atrophies fractures and brain pressures of one sort and another and meanwhile robert austin in the highest perfection of bodily vigor in the fullest possession of those faculties that had raised him from an unschooled farmboy to a position of eminence in the business world went slowly blind the shadows crept in upon him with a deadly merciless certainty that would have filled the stoutest heart with gloom and yet he maintained a smiling stoicism that deceived all but his closest associates to doctor suydam however the incontestable progress of the malady was frightfully tragic he alone knew the mans abundant spirits his lofty ambitions and his active habits he alone knew of the overmastering love that had come so late and was destined to go unvoiced and he raved at the maddening limits of his profession in austins presence he strove to be cheerful and to lighten the burden he knew was crushing the sick man but at other times he bent every energy toward a discovery of some means to check the affliction some hand more skilled than those he knew of in time however he recognized the futility of his efforts and resigned himself to the worst he had a furious desire to acquaint marmion moore with the truth and to tell her with all the brutal frankness he could muster of her part in this calamity but austin would not hear of it she doesnt dream of the truth the invalid told him and i dont want her to learn she thinks im merely weak and it grieves her terribly to know that i havent recovered if she really knew it might ruin her life for she is a girl who feels deeply i want to spare her that its the least i can do but shell find it out some time i think not she comes to see me every day every day yes im expecting her soon and she doesnt know austin shook his head i never let her see theres anything the matter with my sight she drives up with her mother and i wait for her there in the baywindow its getting hard for me to distinguish her now but i recognize the hoofbeats i can tell them every time but i dont understand i pretend to be very weak explained the elder man with a guilty flush i sit in the big chair yonder and my jap boy waits on her she is very kind austins voice grew husky im sorry to lose sight of the park out yonder and the trees and the children theyre growing indistinct i i like children ive always wanted some for myself ive dreamed about that his thin haggard face broke into a wistful smile i guess that is all over with now why questioned suydam savagely why dont you ask her to marry you bob she couldnt refuse and god knows you need her thats just it she couldnt refuse this is the sort of thing a fellow must bear alone shes too young and beautiful and fine to be harnessed up to a wornout old cripple cripple the other choked dont talk like that dont be so blamed resigned it tears my heart out i i why i believe i feel this more than you do austin turned his face to the speaker with a look of such tragic suffering that the younger man fell silent im glad i can hide my feelings austin told him slowly for that is what i have to do every instant she is with me i dont wish to inflict unnecessary pain upon my friends but dont you suppose i know what this means it means the destruction of all my fine hopes the death of all i hold dear in the world i love my work for i am or i was a success this means i must give it up im strong in body and brain this robs me of my usefulness all my life i have prayed that i might some time love a woman that time has come but this means i must give her up and be lonely all my days i must grope my way through the dark with never a ray of light to guide me do you know how awful the darkness is he clasped his hands tightly i must go hungering through the night with a voiceless love to torture me just at the crowning point of my life ive been snuffed out i must fall behind and see my friends desert me bob cried the other in shocked denial oh you know it will come to that people dont like to feel pity forever tugging at them ive been a lonely fellow and my friends are numbered for a time they will come to see me and try to cheer me up they will even try to include me in their pleasures then when it is no longer a new story and their commiseration has worn itself out they will gradually fall away it always happens so ill be poor bob austin and ill go feeling my way through life an object of pity a stumbling incomplete thing that has no place to fill no object to work for no one to care god im not the sort to go blind wheres the justice of it ive lived clean why did this happen to me why why i know what the world is ive been a part of it ive seen the spring and the autumn colors and ive watched the sunsets ive looked into mens faces and read their souls and when youve done that you cant live in darkness i cant and i wont what do you mean im going away when where when i can no longer see marmion moore and before my affliction becomes known to her where you can guess oh thats cowardly bob youre not that sort you mustnt its unbelievable his friend cried in a panic austin smiled bitterly we have discussed that too often and im not sure that what i intend doing is cowardly i cant go now for the thing is too fresh in her memory she might learn the truth and hold herself to blame but when she has lost the first shock of it i shall walk out quietly and she wont even suspect other interests will come into her life ill be only a memory then after a pause he went on i couldnt bear to see her drop away with the rest dont give up yet urged the physician she is leaving for the summer and while she is gone well try that berlin chap hell be here in august and he will fail as the others did he will lecture some clinic about me thats all marmion will hear that my eyes have given out from overwork or something like that then ill go abroad and i wont come back austin divining the rebellion in his friends heart said quickly youre the only one who could enlighten her doc but you wont do it you owe me too much i i suppose i do acknowledged suydam slowly i owe you more than i can ever repay wait the sick man raised his hand while a sudden light blazed up in his face shes coming to the doctors trained ear the noises of the street rose in a confused murmur but austin spoke in an awed breathless tone almost as if he were clairvoyant i can hear the horses shes coming to see me ill go exclaimed the visitor quickly but the other shook his head id rather have you stay austin was poised in an attitude of the intensest alertness his angular awkward body was drawn to its full height his lean face was lighted by some hidden fire that lent it almost beauty shes getting out of the carriage he cried in a nervous voice then he felt his way to his accustomed armchair suydam was about to go to the baywindow when he paused regarding his friend curiously what are you doing the blind man had begun to beat time with his hand counting under his breath one two three shell knock when i reach twentyfive sh sh he continued his pantomime and suydam realized that from repeated practice austin had gauged to a nicety the seconds marmion moore required to mount the stairs this was his means of holding himself in check true to prediction at twentyfive a gentle knock sounded and suydam opened the door come in marmion the girl paused for the briefest instant on the threshold and the doctor noted her fleeting disappointment at seeing him then she took his hand this is a surprise she exclaimed i havent seen you for ever so long her anxious glance swept past him to the big awkward figure against the windows light austin was rising with apparent difficulty and she glided to him please dont rise how many times have i told you not to exert yourself suydam noted the gentle proprietary tone of her voice and it amazed him i am very glad that you came to see me the afflicted mans voice was jerky and unmusical how are you today miss he shouldnt rise should he miss moore appealed to the physician he is very weak and shouldnt exert himself the doctor wished that his friend might see the girls face as he saw it he suddenly began to doubt his own judgment of women oh im doing finely austin announced wont you be seated he waved a comprehensive gesture and suydam marveling at the manner in which the fellow concealed his infirmity brought a chair for the caller i came alone today mother is shopping miss moore was saying see i brought these flowers to cheer up your room she held up a great bunch of sweet peas i love the pink ones dont you austin addressed the doctor miss moore has been very kind to me im afraid she feels it her duty no no cried the girl she rarely misses a day and she always brings flowers im very fond of bright colors suydam cursed at the stiff formality in the mans tone how could any woman see past that glacial front and glimpse the big aching heart beyond austin was harsh and repellent when the least bit selfconscious and now he was striving deliberately to heighten the effect the physician wondered why marmion moore had gone even thus far in showing her gratitude for she was not the selfsacrificing kind as for a love match between two such opposite types suydam could not conceive of it even if the girl understood the sweet simple nature of this man even if she felt her own affections answer to his suydam believed he knew the women of her set too well to imagine that she could bring herself to marry a blind man particularly one of no address we leave for the mountains tomorrow marmion said so i came to say goodby for a time i shall miss your visits austin could not disguise his genuine regret but when you return i shall be thoroughly recovered perhaps we can ride again never declared miss moore i shall never ride again think of the suffering ive caused you i i am dreadfully sorry to suydams amazement he saw the speakers eyes fill with tears a doubt concerning the correctness of his surmises came over him and he rose quickly after all he reflected she might see and love the real bob as he did and if so she might wish to be alone with him in this last hour but austin laughed at his friends muttered excuse you know theres nobody waiting for you thats only a pretense to find livelier company you promised to dine with me to miss moore he explained he isnt really busy why he has been complaining for an hour that the heat has driven all his patients to the country and that he is dying of idleness the girls expression altered curiously she shrank as if wounded she scanned the speakers face with startled eyes before turning with a strained smile to say so doctor we caught you that time that comes from being a highpriced society physician why dont you practise among the masses i believe the poor are always in need of help i really have an engagement suydam muttered then break it for mr austins sake he is lonely and i must be going in a moment the three talked for a time in the manner all people adopt for a sickroom then the girl rose and said with her palm in austins hand i owe you so much that i can never hope to repay you but you you will come to see me frequently this season promise you wont hide yourself will you the blind man smiled his thanks and spoke his farewell with meaningless politeness then as the physician prepared to see her to her carriage miss moore said no please stay and gossip with our invalid its only a step she walked quickly to the door flashed them a smile and was gone suydam heard his patient counting as before one two three at twentyfive the elder man groped his way to the open baywindow and bowed at the carriage below there came the sound of hoofs and rolling wheels and the doctor who had taken stand beside his friend saw marmion moore turn in her seat and wave a last adieu austin continued to nod and smile in her direction even after the carriage was lost to view then he felt his way back to the armchair and sank limply into it gone i ill never be able to see her again suydams throat tightened miserably could you see her at all only her outlines but when she comes back in the fall ill be as blind as a bat he raised an unsteady hand to his head and closed his eyes i can stand anything except that to lose sight of her dear face the force of his emotion wrenched a groan from him i dont know what to make of her said the other why didnt you let me go bob it was her last goodby she wanted to be alone with you she might have thats it exclaimed austin i was afraid of myself afraid id speak if i had the chance his voice was husky as he went on its hard hard for sometimes i think she loves me shes so sweet and so tender at such times im a god but i know it cant be that it is only pity and gratitude that prompts her heaven knows im uncouth enough at best but now i have to exaggerate my rudeness i play a part the part of a lumbering stupid lout while my heart is breaking he bowed his head in his hands closing his dry feverish eyes once more its cruelly hard i cant keep it up the other man laid a hand on his shoulder saying i dont know whether youre doing right or not i half suspect you are doing marmion a bitter wrong oh but she cant she cant love me austin rose as if frightened she might yield to her impulse and well marry me for she has a heart of gold but it wouldnt last she would learn some time that it wasnt real love that prompted the sacrifice then i should die the specialist from berlin came but he refused to operate declaring bluntly that there was no use and all during the long hot summer days robert austin sat beside his open window watching the light die out of the world waiting waiting for the time to make his sacrifice suydam read marmions cheery letters aloud wondering the while at the wistful note they sounded now and then he answered them in his own handwriting which she had never seen one day came the announcement that she was returning the first week in october already september was partly gone so austin decided to sail in a week at his dictation suydam wrote to her saying that the strain of overwork had rendered a long vacation necessary the doctor writhed internally as he penned the careful sentences wondering if the hurt of the deliberately chosen words would prevent her sensing the truth back of them as days passed and no answer came he judged it had the apartment was stripped and bare the trunks were packed on the afternoon before austins departure all through the dreary mockery of the process the blind man had withstood his friends appeal his stern face set his heavy heart full of a despairing stubbornness now being alone at last he groped his way about the premises to fix them in his memory then he sank into his chair beside the window he heard a knock at the door and summoned the stranger to enter then he rose with a gasp of dismay marmion moore was greeting him with sweet yet hesitating effusiveness i i thought you were not coming back until next week he stammered we changed our plans she searched his face as best she could in the shaded light a strange anxious expression upon her own your letter surprised me the doctors orders he said carelessly they say i have broken down i know i know what caused it she panted you never recovered from that accident you did not tell me the truth ive always felt that you were hiding something from me why oh why nonsense he undertook to laugh but failed in a ghastly manner ive been working too hard now im paying the penalty how long will you be gone she queried oh i havent decided a long time however his tone bewildered her it is the first vacation i ever had i want to make the most of it you you were going away without saying goodby to your old friends her lips were white and her brave attempt to smile would have told him the truth had he seen it but he only had her tone to go by so he answered indifferently all my arrangements were made i couldnt wait you are offended with me miss moore said after a pause how have i hurt you what is it please i i have been too forward perhaps austin dared not trust himself to answer and when he made no sign the girl went on painfully im sorry i didnt want to seem bold i owe you so much we were such good friends in spite of her efforts her voice showed her suffering the man felt his lonely heart swell with the wild impulse to tell her all to voice his love in one breathless torrent of words that would undeceive her the strain of repression lent him added brusqueness when he strove to explain and his coldness left her sorely hurt his indifference filled her with a sense of betrayal it chilled the impulsive yearning in her breast she had battled long with herself before coming and now she repented of her rashness for it was plain he did not need her this certainty left her sick and listless therefore she bade him adieu a few moments later and with aching throat went blindly out and down the stairs the instant she was gone austin leaped to his feet the agony of death was upon his features breathlessly he began to count one two three he felt himself smothering and with one sweep of his hand ripped the collar from his throat five six seven he was battling like a drowning man for in truth the very breath of his life was leaving him a drumming came into his ears he felt that he must call out to her before it was too late he was counting aloud now his voice like the moan of a man on the rack nine ten a frenzy to voice his sufferings swept over him but he held himself only a moment more and she would be gone her life would be spared this dark shadow and she would never know but he he would indeed be face to face with darkness toward the last he was reeling but he continued to tell off the seconds with the monotonous regularity of a timepiece his every power centered on that process the idea came to him that he was counting his own flickering pulsethrobs for the last time with a tremendous effort of will he smoothed his face and felt his way to the open window for by now she must be entering the landau a moment later and she would turn to waft him her last adieu her last god how the seconds lagged that infernal thumping in his ears had drowned the noises from the street below he felt that for all time the torture of this moment would live with him then he smiled he smiled blindly out into the glaring sunlight and bowed and bowed and smiled again clinging to the windowcasing to support himself by now she must have reached the corner he freed one hand and waved it gaily then with outflung arms he stumbled back into the room the hot tears coursing down his cheeks marmion moore halted upon the stairs and felt mechanically for her gold chatelaine she recalled dropping it upon the centertable as she went forward with hands outstretched to austin so she turned back then hesitated but he was leaving tomorrow surely he would not misinterpret the meaning of her reappearance summoning her selfcontrol she remounted the stairs quickly the door was half ajar as she had left it in her confusion mustering a careless smile she was about to knock then paused austin was facing her in the middle of the room beating time he was counting aloud but was that his voice in the brief instant she had been gone he had changed astoundingly moreover notwithstanding the fact that she stood plainly revealed he made no sign of recognition but merely counted on and on with the voice of a dying man she divined that something was sadly amiss she wondered for an instant if the man had lost his senses she stood transfixed halfminded to flee yet held by some pitying desire to help then she saw him reach forward and grope his way uncertainly to the window in his progress he stumbled against a chair he had to feel for the casing then she knew marmion moore found herself inside the room staring with wide affrighted eyes at the man whose life she had spoiled she pressed her hands to her bosom to still its heavings she saw austin nodding down at the street below she saw his ghastly attempt to smile she heard the breath sighing from his lungs and heard him muttering her name then he turned and lurched past her groping groping for his chair she cried out sharply in a stricken voice mr austin the man froze in his tracks he swung his head slowly from side to side as if listening what the word came like the crack of a gun then after a moment marmion he spoke her name as if to test his own hearing it was the first time she had ever heard him use it she slipped forward until within an armslength of him then stretched forth a wildly shaking hand and passed it before his unwinking eyes as if she still disbelieved then he heard her moan marmion he cried again my god little girl i thought i heard you go then this this is the reason she said ohhh what are you doing here why did you come back he demanded brutally i forgot my no god sent me back there was a pause during which the man strove to master himself then he asked in the same harsh accents how long have you been here long enough to see and to understand well you know the truth at last i have gone blind the last word caused his lips to twitch he knew from the sound that she was weeping bitterly please dont ive used my eyes too much that is all it is nothing no no no she said brokenly dont you think i understand dont you think i see it all now but why why didnt you tell me why when he did not answer she repeated god sent me back i i was not meant to be so unhappy austin felt himself shaken as if by a panic he cried hurriedly you see weve been such good friends i knew it would distress you i wanted to spare you that you were a good comrade to me we were like chums yes we were chums no friend could have been dearer to me than you miss moore i never had a sister you know i i thought of you that way and i he was struggling desperately to save the girl but his incoherent words died on his lips when he felt her come close and lay her cheek against his arm you mustnt try to deceive me any more she said gently i was here i know the truth and i want to be happy even then he stood dazed and disbelieving until she continued i know that you love me and that i love you it is pity he exclaimed hoarsely you dont mean it but she drew herself closer to him and turned her tearstained face up to his saying wistfully if your dear eyes could have seen they would have told you long ago oh my love he was too weak to resist longer his arms were trembling as they enfolded her but in his heart was a gladness that comes to but few men and you wont go away without me will you she questioned fearfully no no he breathed oh marmion i have lost a little but i have gained much god has been good to me the real and the makebelieve on his way downtown phillips stopped at a subway newsstand and bought all the morning papers he acknowledged that he was vastly excited as he turned in at the stage door he thrilled at sight of the big electric sign over the theater pallid now in the morning sunshine but symbolizing in frosted letters the thing for which he had toiled and fought had hoped and despaired these many years there it hung a dream come true and it read a womans thrall by henry phillips the stagedoor man greeted him with a toothless smile and handed him a bundle of telegrams mumbling i knew it would go over mr phillips the notices are swell aint they they seem to be i aint seen their equal since the music master opened well run a year this differed from the feverish halfhysterical praise of the evening before phillips had made allowances then for the spell of a firstnight enthusiasm and had prepared himself for a rude awakening this morning he had seen too many plays fail to put much faith in the fulsomeness of firstnighters but the words of the doorman carried conviction he had felt confident up to the last moment to be sure for he knew he had put his lifes best work into this drama and he believed he had written with a masters cunning nevertheless when his message had gone forth a sudden panic had seized him he had begun to fear that his judgment was distorted by his nearness to the play or that his absorption in it had blinded him to its defects it was evident now however that these fears had been illfounded for no play could receive such laudatory reviews as these and fail to set newyorkers aflame certain printed sentences kept dancing through his memory unknown dramatist of tremendous power a love story so pitiless so true that it electrifies the deep cry of a suffering heart norma berwynd enters the galaxy of stars that last sentence was the most significant the most wonderful of all norma berwynd a star phillips could scarcely credit it he wondered if she had the faintest notion of how or why her triumph had been effected the property man met him and he too was smiling i just came from the office he began say theyre raving its the biggest hit in ten years oh come now its too early for the afternoon papers the papers be blowed its the public that makes a play the whole town knows about this one already its in and over i tell you well sell out tonight believe me this is a knockout a regular bullseye it wont take no government bonds to bridge us over the next two weeks did you get the new props sure the electrician is working on the drop light for the first act well have a better glass crash tonight and ive got a brandnew dagger that other knife was all right but mr francis forgot how to handle it nevertheless its dangerous we came near having a real tragedy last evening dont lets take any more chances it wasnt my fault on the level the property man insisted francis always goes up at an opening thank heaven the papers didnt notice it huh we could afford to kill an actor for notices like them it would make great advertising and please the critics say i knew this show was a hit under the dimlit vault of the stage phillips found the thirdact scenery set for the rehearsal he had called then having given his instructions to the wardrobe woman he drew a chair up before a bunch light and prepared to read for a second time the morning reviews he had attempted to read them at breakfast but his wife the playwright sighed heavily at the memory of that scene lйontine had been very unjust as usual her temper had run away with her again and had forced him to leave the house with his splendid triumph spoiled his first taste of victory like ashes in his mouth he was in a way accustomed to these endless senseless rows but their increasing frequency was becoming more and more trying and he was beginning to doubt his ability to stand them much longer it seemed particularly nasty of lйontine to seize upon this occasion to vent her open dislike of him their relations were already sufficiently strained marriage all at once assumed a very lopsided aspect to the playwright he had given so much and received so little with an effort he dismissed the subject from his mind and set himself to the more pleasant task of looking at his play through the eyes of the reviewers they had been very fair he decided at last their only criticism was one which he had known to be inevitable therefore he felt no resentment norma berwynd was superb he read she combined with rare beauty a personality at once bewitching and natural she gave life to her lines she was deep intense true she rose to her emotional heights in a burst of power which electrified the audience we cannot but wonder why such an artist has remained so long undiscovered the dramatist smiled surely that was sufficient praise to compensate him for the miserable experience he had just undergone he read further alas that the same kind things cannot be said of irving francis whose name is blazoned forth in letters of fire above the theater he has established himself as one of americas brightest stars but the rфle of john danton does not enhance his reputation in his lighter scenes he was delightful but his emotional moments did not ring true in the whitehot climax of the third act for instance which is the big scene of the play he was stiff unnatural unconvincing either he saw miss berwynd taking the honors of stardom away from him and generously submerged his own talent in order to enhance her triumph or it is but another proof of the statement that husband and wife do not make convincing lovers in the realm of the makebelieve it was surely due to no lack of opportunity on his part so the writer thought irving francis had voluntarily allowed his wife to rival him phillips smiled at this some actors might be capable of such generosity but hardly irving francis he recalled the mans insistent demands during rehearsals that the script be changed to build up his own part and undermine that of his wife the many heated arguments which had even threatened to prevent the final performance of the piece irvings egotism had blinded him to the true result of these quarrels for although he had been given more lines more scenes phillips had seen to it that norma was the one to really profit by the changes author and star had been upon the verge of rupture more than once during that heartbreaking period of preparation but phillips was supremely glad now that he had held himself in control lйontines constant nagging had borne fruit after all in that it had at least taught him to bite down on his words and to smile at provocation yes norma berwynd was a star in spite of herself in spite of her husband she was no longer merely the wife of irving francis the popular idol phillips was glad that she did not know how long it had taken him to effect her independence nor the price he had paid for it since under the circumstances the truth could help neither of them he was aroused from his abstraction by the rustle of a womans garments and leaped to his feet with a glad light in his eyes only to find lйontine his wife confronting him oh he said then with an effort what is the matter nothing i didnt know you were coming downtown whom were you expecting lйontine mocked with that slight accent which betrayed her gallic origin no one she regarded him with fixed hostility i came down to see your rehearsal you dont object i hope why should i object phillips turned away with a shrug im surprised thats all after what you said this morning isnt your interest in the play a trifle tardy no ive been greatly interested in it all the time i read it several times in manuscript indeed i didnt know that it wont be much of a rehearsal this morning im merely going to run over the third act with mr and mrs francis you can rehearse her forty years and shell never play the part the critics dont agree with you they rave over her if francis himself mrs phillips uttered an exclamation of anger oh of course she is perfect you wouldnt give me the part would you no you gave it to her but its mine by rights i have the personality i wrote it for her said the husband after a pause i cant see you in it naturally she sneered well i can and its not too late to make the change ill replace her my name will help the piece lйontine he exclaimed in amazement what are you talking about the play is a tremendous success as it is and miss berwynd is a big hit id be crazy to make a change you wont give me the part certainly not you shouldnt ask it doesnt lйontine murat mean more to the public than norma berwynd she demanded until last night yes today well no she has created this rфle besides you couldnt play the part and why not if you please i dont want to hurt your feelings lйontine go on she commanded in a voice roughened by passion in the first place youre not young enough the woman quivered in the second place youve grown heavy then too your accent she broke out at him furiously so im old and fat and foreign ive lost my beauty you think so eh well other men dont ill show you what men think of me this is no time for threats he interrupted coldly bah i dont threaten seizing him by the arm she swung him about for she was a large woman and still in the fullest vigor of her womanhood listen you cant fool me i know why you wrote this play i know why you took that girl and made a star of her ive known the truth all along you have no cause to dont lie she stormed at him i can read you like a book but i wont stand for it she flung his arm violently from her and turned away i think youd better go home he told her youll have the stage hands talking in a minute she laughed disagreeably ignoring his words i watched you write this play i have eyes even if irving francis is blind its time he knew what is going on there is nothing going on phillips cried heatedly but his wife merely shrugged her splendid shoulders and opening her gold vanity case gave her face a deft going over with a tiny powder puff after a time the man continued i could understand your attitude if you cared for me but some years ago you took pains to undeceive me on that point lйontines lip curled and she made no answer this play is a fine piece of property it will bring us a great deal of money it is the thing for which i have worked years i am going to tell francis the truth about you and his wife she said but theres nothing to tell the man insisted with an effort to restrain himself besides you must know the result if you start a thing like that hell walk out and take his wife with him that would ruin give me her part i wont be coerced he flared up angrily you are willing to ruin me out of pique i suppose but i wont permit it this is the biggest thing i ever did or ever will do perhaps it means honor and recognition and youre selfish enough to spoil it all ive never spoken to norma berwynd in any way to which her husband or you could object therefore i resent your attitude my attitude im your wife he took a turn across the stage followed by her eyes pausing before her at length he said quietly ive asked you to go home and now i insist upon it if you are here when i return i shall dismiss the rehearsal i refuse to allow our domestic relations to interfere with my business he strode out to the front of the house and then paced the dark foyer striving to master his emotions a moment later he saw his wife leave the stage and assumed that she had obeyed his admonitions and gone home the propertyman appeared with an armful of draperies and mechanical appliances interrupting his whistling long enough to call out heres the new hangings mr phillips and the oriental rugs ive got the dagger too he held a gleaming object on high believe me its some davy crockett theres a newspaper guy out back and he wants your ideas on the american drama i told him they were great will you see him not now tell him to come back later say that john danton is some character why dont you let him have the gal because well because it doesnt happen in real life and ive tried to make this play real more than anything else when norma berwynd and her husband arrived phillips had completely regained his composure and he greeted them cordially the woman seemed awed halffrightened by her sudden rise to fame she seemed to be walking in a dream and a great wonder dwelt in her eyes as for francis he returned the authors greeting curtly making it plain that he was in no agreeable temper i congratulate you phillips he said you and norma have become famous overnight the open resentment in his tone angered the playwright and caused him to wonder if their longdeferred clash was destined to occur this morning he knew himself to be overwrought and he imagined francis to be in no better frame of mind nevertheless he answered pacifically if that is so we owe it to your art not at all i see now what i failed to detect in reading and rehearsing the piece and what you neglected to tell me namely that this is a womans play theres nothing in it for me theres nothing in my part oh come now the part is tremendous you merely havent got the most out of it as yet francis drew himself up and eyed the speaker coldly youre quoting the newspapers pray be more original you know of course how i stand with these pennyaliners they never have liked me but as for the part he shrugged i cant get any more out of it than there is in it doubtless that was my fault at rehearsals ive called this one so we can fix up the weak spot in the third act well were on time where are the others francis cast an inquiring glance about ill only rehearse you and mrs francis indeed the former speaker opened his mouth for a cutting rejoinder but changed his mind and stalked away into the shadowy depths of the wings please make allowances for him norma begged approaching phillips in order that her words might not be overheard ive never seen him so broken up over anything he is always unstrung after an opening but he is terrible this morning there was trouble timidity and another indefinable expression in the womans eyes as they followed the vanishing figure of her husband faint lines appeared at the corners of her mouth lines which had no place in the face of a happily married woman she was trembling moreover as if she had but recently played some big emotional rфle and phillips felt the old aching pity for her tugging at his heart he wondered if those stories about francis could be true it has been a great strain on all of us he told her but you how do you feel after all this he indicated the pile of morning papers and at sight of them her eyes suddenly filled with that same wonder and gladness he had noticed when she first arrived ohh i im breathless something clutches me here she laid her hand upon her bosom its so new i cant express it yet except well all of my dreams came true in a night some fairy waved her wand and lo poor ugly little me she laughed although it was more like a sob i had no idea my part was so immense had you i had i wrote it that way my dreams also came true but why a faint flush stole into her cheeks there are so many women who could have played the part better than i you had courage to risk your piece in my hands mr phillips perhaps i knew you better than you knew yourself she searched his face with startled curiosity or better at least than the world knew you tell me there is something wrong im afraid he resents your oh no no she denied hastily letting her eyes fall but not before he had seen them fill again with that same expression of pain and bewilderment hes not himself thats all i you wont irritate him please he has such a temper francis came out of the shadows scowling well lets get at it said he phillips agreed if you dont mind well start with your entrance i wish you would try to express more depth of feeling more tenderness if you please mr francis remember john danton has fought this love of his for many years undertaking to remain loyal to his wife he doesnt dream that diane returns his love for he has never spoken never even hinted of his feelings until this instant now however they are forced into expression he begins reluctantly frightened at the thing which makes him speak then when she responds the dam breaks and his love overrides his will power his loyalty his lifelong principles it sweeps him onward and it takes her with him the truth appals them both they recognize its certain consequences and yet they respond freely fiercely you cant overplay the scene mr francis certainly i can overplay it the star declared thats the danger my effects should come from repression i must differ with you repressive methods are out of place here you see john danton loses control of himself nonsense francis declared angrily the effectiveness of the scene depends altogether upon its well its savagery it must sweep the audience off its feet in order that the climax shall appear logical nonsense again im not an oldschool actor and i cant chew scenery ive gained my reputation by repressive acting by intensity this is not acting this is real life franciss voice rose a tone in pitch and his eyes flashed at this stubborn resistance to his own set ideas great heavens phillips dont try to tell me my own business people dont behave that way in real life they dont explode under passion not even jealousy or revenge they are reserved reserve thats the real thing the other is all makebelieve seeing that it was useless to argue with the man phillips said nothing more so francis and his wife assumed their positions and began their lines it was a long scene and one demanding great force to sustain it was this in fact which had led to the choice of irving francis for the principal rфle for he was a man of tremendous physical power he had great ability moreover and yet never even at rehearsals had he been able to invest this particular scene with conviction phillips had rehearsed him in it time and again but he seemed strangely incapable of rising to the necessary heights he was hollow artificial his tricks and mannerisms showed through like familiar trade marks strangely enough the girl also had failed to get the most out of the scene and this morning both star and leading woman seemed particularly cold and unresponsive they lacked the spark the uplifting intensity which was essential therefore in desperation phillips finally tried the expedient of altering their business of changing positions postures and crosses but they went through the scene for a second time as mechanically as before knowing every line as he did feeling every heart throb living and suffering as john danton was supposed to be living and suffering phillips was nearly distracted to him this was a wanton butchery of his finest work he interrupted at last in a heartsick hopeless tone which sorely offended the already irritated francis im afraid its no use you dont seem to get it what is it i dont get roughly demanded the actor youre not genuine either of you you dont seem to feel it humph were married said the star so brutally that his wife flushed painfully i tell you i get all its possible to get out of the scene you wrote it and you see a lot of imaginary values but theyre not there im no superman no god i cant give you more than the part contains look at it in this light phillips argued after a pause diane is a married woman she too is fighting a battle she is restrained by every convention every sense of right every instinct of wifehood and womanhood now then you must sweep all that aside your own fire must set her ablaze despite i i must do all this mocked the other furiously why must i do it all make norma play up to me she underplays me all the time shes not in my key thats whats the matter and im damned tired of this everlasting criticism there was a strained silence during which the two men faced each other threateningly and a panic seized the woman she managed to say uncertainly perhaps i should play up to you irving on the contrary i dont think the fault is yours phillips said stiffly again there was a dramatic silence in which there was no element of the makebelieve it was the clash of two strong men who disliked each other intensely and whose masks were slipping neither they nor the leading woman detected a figure stealing out from the gloom as if drawn by the magnetism of their anger my fault as usual francis sneered understand this phillips my reputation means something to me and i wont be forced out of a good engagement by a well by you or by any other stage manager phillips saw that same fearful look leap into the womans eyes and it checked his heated retort i dont mean to find fault with you he declared evenly i have the greatest respect for your ability as an actor but the star tossed his massive head in a peculiarly aggravating manner perhaps you think you can play the part better than i irving please breathed his wife show me how it should be done if you feel it so strongly thank you i will phillips answered impulsively im not an actor but i wrote this piece whats more i lived it before i wrote it its my own story and i think i know how it should be played francis smiled mockingly good said he i shall learn something do you mind the author turned to the real diane and she shook her head saying uncertainly its very good of you very well if you will hold the manuscript mr francis ill try to show what i feel the scene lacks however i dont think ill need any prompting now then well begin at john dantons entrance with the mocking smile still upon his lips francis took the manuscript and seated himself upon the prompters table it was by no means remarkable that henry phillips should know something about acting for he had long been a stage manager and in emergencies he has assumed a good many divergent rфles he felt no selfconsciousness therefore as he exchanged places with francis only an intense desire to prove his contentions he nerved himself to an unusual effort but before he had played more than a few moments he forgot the hostile husband and began to live the part of john danton as he had lived it in the writing as he invariably lived it every time he read the play or saw it acted nor as he had said did he need prompting for the lines were not the written speeches of another which had been impressed upon his brain by the mechanical process of repetition they were his own thoughts expressed in the simplest terms he knew and they came forth unbidden hot eager once he began to voice them he was seized by that same mighty current which had drawn them from him in the first place and left them strewn upon paper like driftwood after a flood he had acted every part of his play he had spoken every line many times in solitude but this was the first time he had faced the real diane he found himself mastered by a fierce exultation he forgot that he was acting or that the woman opposite him was playing a rфle of his creation he began to live his true life for the first time since he had met the wife of irving francis clothed in the makebelieve the real henry phillips spoke freely feelingly his very voice changed in timbre in quality it became rich alive his eyes caressed the woman and stirred her to a new response as for irving francis he watched the transformation with astonishment grudgingly resentfully he acknowledged that this was indeed fine acting he realized too that his blind egotism had served merely to prove the truth of the authors criticism and to emphasize his own shortcomings the idea enraged him but the spectacle held him enthralled norma berwynd was not slow to appreciate the truth accustomed thoroughly to every phase of the makebelieve world in which she dwelt she recognized unerringly in the new john dantons words and actions something entirely unreal and apart from the theatrical the conviction that henry phillips was not acting came to her with a blinding suddenness and it threw her into momentary confusion hence her responses were mechanical but soon without effort on her part this embarrassment fell away and she in turn began to blaze the flame grew as phillips breathed upon it she realized wildly that her heart had always hungered for words like these and that coming from his lips they carried an altogether new and wondrous meaning that they filled some longfelt aching want of which she had been ignorant until this moment the certainty that it was phillips himself who spoke and not a mere character of his creation filled her with an exultant recklessness she forgot her surroundings her husbands presence even the fact that the lines she spoke were not of her own making never had the scene been played like this it grew vital it took on a tremendous significance no one could have observed it and remained unresponsive francis let fall the manuscript and stared at the actors wonderingly since he was an actor nothing was so real to him nothing so thrilling as the makebelieve he realized that this was indeed a magnificent exhibition of the artificial with parted lips and pulse athrob he followed the wooing of that imaginary john danton in whom he could see no one but himself after a time he became conscious of a presence at his side and heard some one breathing heavily turning with a start he found lйontine phillips at his shoulder she too was aroused but in her sneering visage was that which brought the actor abruptly out of his spell she had emerged from the shadows noiselessly and was leaning forward her strong hands gripping the edge of the table littered with its many properties mrs phillips had played emotional scenes herself but never with such melodramatic intensity as she now unconsciously displayed her whole body shook as with an ague her dark face was alive with a jealous fury which told irving francis the story he had been too dull to suspect the truth when it came home smote him like a blow his hatred for the author which had been momentarily forgotten momentarily lost in his admiration of the artist rose up anew and he recognized this occult spell which had held him breathless as the thrall of a vital reality not after all the result of inspired acting instantly he saw past the makebelieve into the real and what he saw caused him to utter a smothered cry lйontine turned her face to him you fool she whispered through livid lips francis was a huge leonine man he rose now to his full height as a cat rises but the drama drew his gaze in spite of himself he could not keep his eyes from his wifes face lйontine plucked at his sleeve and whispered again you fool something contorted the actors frame bitterly and he gasped like a man throttled lйontine could feel his muscles stiffen but the two players were in elysium they had reached the climax of the scene danton had told his love as only a great starved love can tell itself and with swimming eyes and fluttering lids with heart pounding beneath her folded hands diane swayed toward him and his arms enfolded her her body met his yielded her face was upturned her fragrant halfopened lips were crushed to his in a fierce impassioned kiss of genuine ecstasy up to this moment the intensity of franciss rage had held him paralyzed despite the voice which was whispering so constantly at his ear but now when he saw his wife swooning upon the breast of the man who had played his part he awoke she knows he loves her lйontine was saying you let him tell her in front of your face he has taken her away from you mrs phillipss eyes fell upon the working fingers of the man as they rested beside her own they were opening and closing hungrily she also saw the naked knife which lay upon the table and she moved it forward cautiously until the eager fingers twined about it then she breathed go and shoved him forward fiercely it was irving franciss cry of rage as he rushed upon them which aroused norma berwynd from her dream from her intoxication she saw him towering at phillipss back and with a scream she tried to save the latter the husbands blow fell however it was delivered with all the savage fury that lay in irving franciss body and his victim was fairly driven to his knees beneath it the latter rose then staggered and half sliding through the womans sheltering embrace crumpled limply into a massive upholstered chair he too was dazed by the sudden transition from his real world to his makebelieve when his eyes cleared he saw norma berwynd struggling with her husband interposing her own slender body in his path francis was cursing her foully for her unfaithfulness his voice was thick and brutal yes its true she cried with hysterical defiance i never knew till now but its true its true youve killed him lйontine chattered shrilly and emerged from the shadows her dark features ashen her eyes ringed with white mrs francis turned from her husband and flung her arms about the recumbent man calling wildly to him the dйnouement had come with such swiftness that it left all four of them appalled at their actions seeing what his brief insanity had led him into francis felt his strength evaporate his face went white his legs buckled beneath him he scanned the place wildly in search of means of escape my god my god lйontine was repeating why doesnt somebody come now that his brain had cleared and he knew what hand had smitten him and why phillips was by far the calmest of the four he saw the knife at his feet and smiled for no steel could rob him of that gladness which was pulsing through his veins he was still smiling when he stooped and picked up the weapon he arose lifting norma to her feet then his hand slid down and sought hers you neednt worry he said to francis you see this is the new dagger i got for the end of the act he held it out in his open palm for all of them to see and they noted that it was strangely shortened that the point of the sliding blade was barely exposed beneath the hilt francis wiped his wet face then shuddered and cursed weakly with relief meanwhile groping at the prompters table for support sold a prop knife he cried you youre not really norma swayed forward with eyes closed lйontine laughed by god i meant it the star exclaimed uncertainly you cant deny he gasped and tugged at his collar i believe there is nothing to deny the author said quietly he looked first at his wife then at his enemy and then down at the quivering white face upturned to his there is nothing to deny is there he inquired of norma nothing she said i im glad to know the truth thats all francis glared first at one then at the other and as he did so he began to realize the full cost of his action when it came home to him in terms of dollars and cents he showed his true character by stammering i i made a frightful mistake im not myself really im not it was your wifes fault in a panic he ran on unmindful of lйontines scorn she did it mr phillips she gave me the knife she whispered things she made me i im very sorry mr phillips and ill play the part the way you want it i will indeed lйontine met her husbands look defiantly hence it was as much to her as to the cringing actor that the playwright said your salary will go on as usual under your contract mr francis that is until the management supplies you with a new play but im the real john danton and i shall play him tonight and henceforth then im discharged norma dyou hear that were canceled fired no miss berwynds name will go up in lights as the star if she cares to stay said phillips do you wish to remain he looked down at the woman and she nodded yes oh yes she said i must stay i darent go back that hunted look leaped into her eyes again and phillips recognized it now as fear the abject physical terror of the weaker animal i want to go forward not backward if there is any way ill show you the way he told her gently well find it together he smiled reassuringly and with a little gasping sigh she placed her hand in his running elk up from the valley below came the throb of war drums the faint rattle of shots and the distant cries of painted horsemen charging from my vantagepoint on the ridge i had an unobstructed view of the encampment a great circle of tepees and tents three miles in circumference cradled in a sag of the timberless hills the sounds came softly through the still dakota air and my eye took in every sharpdrawn detail of the scene ponies grazing along the creek bottom children playing beneath the blue smoke of campfires the dense crowd ringed about a medicine pole in their center intent on a wardance five thousand sioux were here in all their martial splendor they were painted and decked and trapped for war living again their days of plenty telling anew their tales of might and repeating on a mimic scale their greatest battles five days the feasting had continued five mornings had i been awakened at dawn to see a thousand ochered feathered horsemen come thundering down upon the camp their horses running flat their rifles popping while the valley rocked to their battlecries and to the answering clamor of the army which rode forth to meet them five sultry days had i spent wandering unnoticed ungreeted and disdained an alien in a hostile land tolerated but unwelcome five evenings had i witnessed the tents begin to glow and the campfires kindle until the valley became hooped about as if by a million giant fireflies five nights had i strayed like a lost soul through an unreal wilderness harkening to the drone of stories told in an unfamiliar tongue to the minorkeyed dirges of an unknown race to the thumping of countless moccasined feet in the measures of queer dances the odors of a savage people had begun to pall on me and the sound of a strange language to annoy i longed for another white man for a word in my own tongue it was the annual giveaway celebration when all the tribe assembles to make presents to race to tell stories and to recount the legends of their prowess they had come from all quarters of the reservation bringing their trunks their children and their dogs of the last named more had come by far than would go back for this was a week of feasting and every day the air was heavy with the smell of singeing hair and the curs that had been spared gnawed at an everincreasing pile of bones i had seen old hags strangle dogs by pulling on opposite ends of a slipnoose or choke them by laying a tentpole on their throats and standing on the ends i had seen others knock them down with billets of wood drag them kicking to the fires and then knock them down again when they crawled out of the flames all in all i had acquired much information regarding the carnival appetites of the noble red man learning that he is poetic only in the abstract it was drawing on toward sunset so i slipped into my camera strap and descended the slope i paused however while still some distance away from my tent for next to it another had been erected during my absence it was a tiny affair with a rug in front of it and upon the rug stood a steamerchair hello inside i shouted then ran forward straddling papooses and shouldering squaws out of my way hello came an answer and out through the flap was thrust the head of my friend the government doctor gee im glad to see you i said as i shook his hand im as lonesome as a deaf mute at a song recital i figured you would be said the doctor so i came out to see the finish of the feast and to visit with you i brought some bread from the agency hoorah white bread and white conversation im hungry for both whats the matter wont the indians talk to you i guess they would if they could but they cant i havent found one among the whole five thousand who can understand a word i say your government schools have gone back in the betting with me doc you must keep your graduates under lock and key they can all speak english if they want to that is the younger ones some few of the old people are too proud to try but the others can talk as well as we can until they forget do you mean to say these people have been fooling me i dont believe it said i theres one that cant talk english and ill make a bet on it i indicated a passing brave with an eaglefeather headdress which reached far down his naked legs he was a magnificent animal he was young and lithe and as tall and straight as a sapling ive tried him twice and he simply doesnt understand my friend called to the warrior hey tom come here a minute the indian came and the doctor continued when do you hold the horseraces thomas tomorrow at four oclock unless it rains said the fellow he spoke in an odd halting dialect but his words were perfectly understandable are you going to ride no my racehorse is sick as the ocherdaubed figure vanished into the dusk the old man turned to me saying college man what yes ba hes a graduate impossible i declared why he talks like a foreigner or as if he were just learning our language exactly in another three years hell be an indian again through and through oh the reservation is full of fellows like tom the doctor heaved a sigh of genuine discouragement its a melancholy acknowledgment to make but our work seems to count for almost nothing its their blood perhaps they forget the higher education said i but how about the agency school where you teach them to farm and to sew and to cook as well as to read and to write surely they dont forget that ive heard a graduating class read theses sing cantatas and deliver sounding orations then ive seen those same young fellows three months later squatting in tepees and eating with their fingers its a common thing for our sweet girl graduates to lay off their white commencementday dress their highheeled shoes and their pretty hats for the shawl and the moccasin we teach them to make spongecake and to eat with a fork but they prefer dogsoup and a horn spoon of course there are exceptions but most of them forget much faster than they learn our eastern ideas of mr lo are somewhat out of line with the facts i acknowledged hes sort of a hero with us i remember several successful plays with romantic indians in the lead i know my friend laughed shortly i saw some of them if you like however ill tell you how it really happens i know a story when we had finished supper the doctor told me the story of running elk the night was heavy with unusual odors and burdened by weird music the whisper of a lively multitude came to us punctuated at intervals by distant shouts or shots or laughter on either hand the campfires stretched away like twinkling stars converging steadily until the horns joined each other away out yonder in the darkness it was a suitable setting for an epic tale of the sioux ive grown gray in this service the old man began and the longer i live the less time i waste in trying to understand the difference between the indian race and ours ive about reached the conclusion that its due to some subtle chemical ingredient in the blood one race is lively and progressive the other is sluggish and atavistic the white man is ever developing hes always advancing always expanding the red man is marking time or walking backward it is only a matter of time until he will vanish utterly hes different from the negro the negro enlarges up to a certain limit then he stops some people claim i believe that his skull is sutured in such a manner as to check his brain development when his bones finally harden and set the idea sounds reasonable if true there will never be a serious conflict between the blacks and the whites but the red man differs from both to begin with his is not a subject race by birth physically he is as perfect as either nature has endowed him with an intellect quite as keen as the white mans and with an open articulation of the skull which permits the growth of his brain somewhere nevertheless she has cunningly concealed a flaw a flaw which i have labored thirty years to find i have a theory you know all old men have theories that it is a physical thing as tangible as that osseous constriction of the cranium which holds the negro in subjection and that if i could lay my finger on it i could raise the indian to his ancient mastery and to a dignified place among the nations i could change them from a vanishing people into a race of rulers of lawgivers of creators at least that used to be my dream some years ago i felt that i was well on my way to success for i found a youth who offered every promise of great manhood i studied him until i knew his every trait and his every strength he didnt seem to have any weaknesses i raised him according to my own ideas he became a tall straight fellow handsome as a bronze statue of a god physically he was perfect and he had a mind as fine as his body he had the best blood of his nation in him being the son of a war chief and he was called thomas running elk i educated him at the agency school under my own personal supervision and on every occasion i studied him i spent hours in shaping his mind and in bending him away from the manners and the habits of his tribe i taught him to think like a white man he responded like a growing vine he became the pride of the reservation a reserved but an eager youth with an understanding and a wit beyond that of most white boys of his age search him as rigorously as i might i couldnt find a single flaw i believed i was about to prove my theory running elk romped through our school and he couldnt learn fast enough when he had finished i sent him east to college and in order to wean him utterly away from the past instead of sending him to an indian school i arranged for him to enter one of the big eastern universities where no indian had ever been where constant association with the flower of our race would by its own force raise him to a higher level well it worked he led his classes as a stag leads a herd he was a silent dignified shadowy figure his fellowstudents considered him unapproachable nevertheless they admired and they liked him in all things he excelled but he was best perhaps in athletics and for this i took the credit a jovian satisfaction in my work news of his victories on track and field and gridiron came to me regularly for his professors were interested in my experiment as for the boy himself he never wrote it was not his nature nor did he communicate with his people he had cut himself off from them and i think he looked down upon them at intervals his father came to the agency to inquire about running elk for i did not allow my protйgй to return even during vacations that was a part of my plan at my stories of his sons victories the father made no comment he merely listened quietly then folded his blanket about him and slipped away the old fellow was a good deal of a philosopher he showed neither resentment nor pleasure but once or twice i caught him smiling oddly at my enthusiasm i know now what was in his mind it was in running elks senior year that a great thing came to him a thing i had counted upon from the start he fell in love a girl entered his life but this girl didnt enter as i had expected and when the news reached me i was completely taken aback she was a girl i had dandled on my knees as a child the only daughter of an old friend moreover instead of running elk being drawn to her as i had planned she fell desperately in love with him i guess the gods were offended at my presumption and determined by one hairsbreadth shift to destroy the balance of my whole structure theyre a jealous lot the gods i didnt understand at that time how great must have been the amusement which i offered them youve heard of old henry harman yes the railroad king it was his daughter alicia no wonder you look incredulous in order to understand the story youll have to know something about old henry youll have to believe in heredity henry is a selfmade man he came into the middle west as a poor boy and by force of indomitable pluck ability and doggedness he became a captain of industry we were born on neighboring farms and while i after a lifetime of work have won nothing except an underpaid government job henry has become rich and mighty he had that indefinable unacquirable faculty for making money and he became a commanding figure in the financial world hes dominant hes selfcentered hes onepurposed hes a roughhewn block of a man and his unbounded wealth his power and his contact with the world have never smoothed nor rounded him hes just about the same now as when he was a section boss on his own railroad his daughter alicia is another henry harman feminized her mother was a pampered child born to ease and enslaved to her own whims no desire of hers however extravagant ever went ungratified and right up to the hour of her death old henry never said no to her partly out of a spirit of amusement i dare say and partly because she was the only unbridled extravagance he had ever yielded to in all his life well having sowed the wind he reaped the whirlwind in alicia she combined the distinguishing traits of both parents and she grew up more effectively spoiled than her mother when i got a panicky letter from one of running elks professors coupling her name vaguely with that of my indian i wavered in my determination to see this experiment out but the analyst is unsentimental and a fellow who sets out to untangle the skein of nature must pay the price so i waited that fall i was called to washington on department business we were fighting for a new appropriation and while there i went to the theater one night i was extremely harassed and my mind was filled with indian matters so i went out alone to seek an evenings relief not caring whither my feet took me the play was one of those you spoke of it told the story of a young indian college man in love with a white girl whether or not it was well written i dont know but it seemed as if the hand of destiny had led me to it for the heros plight was so similar to the situation of running elk that it seemed almost uncanny and i wondered if this play might afford me some solution of his difficulty you will remember that the indian in the play is a great football hero and a sort of demigod to his fellows he begins to consider himself one of them their equal and he falls in love with the sister of his chum but when this fact is made known his friends turn against him and try to show him the barrier of blood at the finish a messenger comes bearing word that his father is dead and that he has been made chief in the old mans place he is told that his people need him and although the girl offers to go with him and make her life his he renounces her for his duty to the tribe well it was all right up to that point but the end didnt help me in shaping the future of running elk for his father was hale hearty and contented and promised to hang on in that condition as long as we gave him his allowance of beef on issue day that night when i got back to the hotel i found a longdistance call from old henry harman he had wired me here at the agency and finding i was in washington he had called me from new york he didnt tell me much over the phone except that he wanted to see me at once on a matter of importance my work was about finished so i took the train in the morning and went straight to his office when i arrived i found the old fellow badly rattled there is a certain kind of worry which comes from handling affairs of importance men like henry harman thrive upon it but theres another kind which searches out the joints in their coats of mail and makes women of them thats what henry was suffering from oh doc im in an awful hole he exclaimed youre the only man who can pull me out its about alicia and that damned savage of yours i knew that was it said i if youve heard about it clear out there harman declared with a catch in his voice its even worse than i thought he strode up and down his office for a few moments then he sank heavily into his chair and commenced to pound his mahogany desk declaring angrily i wont be defied by my own flesh and blood i wont thats all there is to it im master of my own family why the things fantastic absurd and yet its terrible heavens i cant believe it have you talked with alicia not with her to her shes like a mule i never saw such a will in a woman i ive fought her until im weak where she got her temper i dont know he collapsed feebly and i was forced to smile for theres only one thing stubborn enough to overcome a harmans resistance and that is a harmans desire then it isnt a girlish whim i ventured whim look at me he held out his trembling hands shes licked me doc shes going to marry that that he choked and muttered unintelligibly ive reasoned ive pleaded ive commanded she merely smiles and shrugs and says im probably right in the abstract then she informs me that abstract problems go to pieces once in a while she says this this galloping moose this yelping ghostdancer of yours is the only real man she ever met what does he have to say humph grunted harman i offered to buy him off but he threatened to serve me up with dumplings and wear my scalp in his belt such insolence alicia wouldnt speak to me for a week you made a mistake there said i running elk is a sioux as for alicia shes thoroughly spoiled shes never been denied any single thing in all her life and she has your disposition its a difficult situation difficult its scandalous hideous how old is alicia nineteen oh ive worn out that argument she says shell wait you know she has her own money from her mother does running elk come to your house at this my old friend roared so fiercely that i hastened to say ill see the boy at once i have more influence with him than anybody else i hope you can show him how impossible how criminal it is to ruin my girls life harman said this seriously yes and mine too for that matter suppose the yellow newspapers got hold of this he shuddered doc i love that girl so well that id kill her with my own hands rather than see her disgraced ridiculed tut tut said i thats pride just plain selfish pride i dont care a damn what it is id do it i earned my way in the world but shes got blue blood in her and she was born to a position she goes everywhere when she comes out shell be able to marry into the best circles in america she could marry a duke if she wanted to id buy her one if she said the word naturally i cant stand for this dirty lowbrowed injun hes not dirty i declared and hes not as lowbrowed as some foreigner youd be glad to pick out for her well hes an injun retorted harman and thats enough weve both seen em tried they all drop back where they started from you know that as well as i do i dont know it said i thinking of my theories ive been using him to make an experiment but the experiment has gotten away from me i dare say youre right i wanted him to meet and to know white girls but i didnt want him to marry one certainly not a girl like alicia no we must put a stop to this affair ill see him right away tomorrow is thanksgiving said henry wait over and go up with us and see the football game are you going harman grimaced alicia made me promise id rather take her than let her go with friends theres no telling what she might do why let her go at all i objected the old fellow laughed mirthlessly why let her running elk plays fullback how stop her well pick you up at your hotel in the morning and drive you up in the car its the big game of the year youll probably enjoy it i wont miss harman seemed glad to see me on the following day she must have known that i was in her fathers confidence but she was too well schooled to show it as we rode out in the big limousine i undertook to study her but the reading of women isnt my game all i could see was a beautiful spirited imperious girl with the harman eyes and chin she surprised me by mentioning running elk of her own free will she wasnt the least bit embarrassed and although her fathers face whitened she preserved her quiet dignity and i realized that she was in no wise ashamed of her infatuation i didnt wonder that the old gentleman chose to accompany her to this game although he must have known that the sight of running elk would pain him like a brandingiron it was the first great gridiron battle i had ever seen and so i was unprepared for the spectacle the enthusiasm of that immense crowd astonished me and in spite of the fact that i had come as a tired old man it got into my veins until my heart pounded and my pulses leaped the songs the shouts the bellows of that multitude were intensely thrilling for youth was in them i grew young again and i was half ashamed of myself until i saw other people of my own age who had also become boys and girls for the day and the seriousness of it why it was painful not one of those countless thousands was a disinterested spectator they were all intensely partisan and youd have thought life or death hung on the victory not one did i say there was one who held himself aloof from all the enthusiasm old henry sat like a lump of granite and out of regard for him i tried to restrain myself we had a box close to the side lines with the йlite of the east on either hand people whose names i had read they bowed and smiled and waved to our little party and i felt quite important youve probably seen similar games so theres no need of my describing this one even if i could it was my first experience however and it impressed me greatly when the teams appeared i recognized running elk at a distance so did the hordes of madmen behind us and i began to understand for the first time what it was that the old man in the seat next to mine was combating a dancing dervish in front of the grandstand said something through a megaphone then he waved a cane whereupon a tremendous barking rah rah rah broke out it ended with my sioux boys name and i wished the old chief back in dakota were there to see his son and to witness the honor done him by the whites quite as impressive to me as this demonstration was the deathlike silence which settled over that tremendous throng when the teams scattered out in readiness the other side kicked off and the ball sailed high and far as it settled in its downward flight i saw a lithe tall shadow of a man racing toward it and i recognized my boy id lost his position for the moment but i knew that hungry predatory stride which devoured the yards as if he were a thing of the wind he was off with the ball in the hollow of his arm right back into the heart of his enemies dodging darting leaping twisting always advancing they tore his interference away from him but nevertheless he penetrated their ranks and none of them could lay hands upon him he was running free when tackled his assailant launched himself with such savage violence that the sound of their impact came to us distinctly as he fell i heard alicia harman gasp then the crowd gave tongue from that time on to the finish of the game my eyes seldom left running elk and then only long enough to shoot covert glances at my companions although the skill of my young sioux overtopped that of all the other contestants the opposing team played as one man they were like a wonderful welloiled piece of machinery and they scored all through the first half our side struggled to retaliate but at the intermission they had not succeeded so far running elk hadnt noticed our presence but when the teams returned for the second half he saw us he didnt even know that i was in the east in fact he hadnt laid eyes on me for more than three years the sight of me there in the box with alicia and her father must have been an unpleasant shock to him my face must have seemed an evil omen nevertheless he waved his hand at me and smiled one of his rare reserved smiles i couldnt help marveling at the fellows physical beauty i had been secretly hoping that his side would be defeated so that miss harman might see him for once as a loser but the knowledge of our presence seemed to electrify him and by the spark of his own magnetism he fired his fellows until they commenced to play like madmen i have no doubt they were precisely that his spirit was like some galvanic current and he directed them with a master mind he was a naturalborn strategist of course for through him ran the blood of the craftiest race of all the earth the blood of a people who have always fought against odds to whom a forlorn hope is an assurance of victory on this day the son of a sioux chief led the men of that great university with the same skill that hannibal led his carthaginian cohorts up to the gates of rome he led them with the cunning of chief joseph the greatest warrior of his people he was indefatigable irresistible magnificent and he himself tied the score in spite of myself i joined madly in the cheering but the boy didnt let down now that his enemies recognized the source of their peril they focused upon him all their fury they tried to destroy him they fell upon him like animals they worried and they harried and they battered him until i felt sick for him and for the girl beside me who had grown so faint and pale but his body was of my making i had spent careful years on it and although they wore themselves out they could not break running elk he remained a fleeting an elusive thing with the vigor of a wild horse he tackled their runners with the ferocity of a wolf it was a grand exhibition of coolness and courage for he was everywhere always alert and always ready and it was he who won the game there came some sort of a fumble too fast for the eye to follow and then the ball rolled out of the scrimmage before we knew what had happened running elk was away with it a scattered field ahead of him i dare say you have heard about that run for it occurred in the last three minutes of play and is famous in football annals to this day so im told it was a spectacular performance apparently devised by fate to make more difficult the labors of old henry and me every living soul on those highbanked bleachers was on his feet at the finish a senseless screaming demon i saw alicia straining forward her face like chalk her very lips blanched her whole highstrung body aquiver her eyes were distended and in them i saw a look which told me that this was no mere girlish whim that this was more than the animal call of youth and sex running elk had become a fetish to her the father must likewise have recognized this for as we passed out he stammered into my ear you see doc the girls mad its awful awful i dont know what to do we had become momentarily separated from her and therefore i urged him get her away quick no matter how or where use force if you have to but get her out of this crowd this atmosphere and keep her away ill see him tonight the old fellow nodded i ill kidnap her and take her to europe he mumbled god its awful i didnt go back to the city with the harmans but i told alicia goodby at the runningboard of the machine i dont think she heard me running elk was glad to see me and i spent that evening with him he asked all about his people he told me of his progress and he spoke lightly of his victory that day but sound him as i would i could elicit no mention of alicia harmans name he wasnt much of a talker anyhow so at last i was forced to bring up the subject myself at my first word the silence of his forefathers fell upon him and all he did was listen i told him forcibly that any thoughts of her were ridiculous and impossible why said he after i had finished i told him a thousand reasons why i recounted them cruelly unfeelingly but he made no sign as a matter of fact i dont think he understood them any more than he understood the affair itself he appeared to be blinded confused by the splendor of what had come to him alicia was so glorious so different so mysterious to him that he had lost all sense of perspective and of proportion recognizing this i descended to material things which i knew he could grasp i paid for your education said i and it is almost over with in a few months youll be turned out to make your own living and then youll encounter this race prejudice i speak of in a way to effect your stomach and your body youre a poor man running elk and youve got to earn your way your blood will bar you from a good many means of doing it and when your color begins to affect your earning capacity youll have all you can do to take care of yourself life isnt played on a gridiron and the first thing youve got to do is to make a man of yourself youve got no right to fill your head with dreams with insane fancies of this sort yes sir said he and that was about all i could get out of him his reticence was very annoying i didnt see him again for i came west the next day and the weeks stretched into months without word of him or of the others shortly before he was due to return i was taken sick the one big illness of my life which came near ending me which made me into the creaking old ruin that i am they sent me away to another climate where i got worse then they shifted me about like a bale of goods airing me here and there for a year and a half i hung over the edge one ailment running into another but finally i straightened out a bit and tottered back into washington to resume operations for six months i hung around headquarters busied on department matters i had lost all track of things out here meanwhile for the agent had been changed shortly after i left and no one had taken the trouble to keep me posted but eventually i showed up on the reservation again reaching here on the first of july three days before the annual celebration of the people many changes had occurred in my two years absence and there was no one to bring me gossip hence i heard little during the first day or two while i was picking up the loose ends of my work one thing i did find out however namely that running elk had come straight home from college and was still on the reserve i determined to look him up during the festival but on the morning of the fourth i got the surprise of my life the stage from the railroad brought two women two strange women who came straight to my office alicia harman and her french maid well i was fairly knocked endwise but alicia was as wellpoised and as selfcontained as on that thanksgiving morning in new york when she and old henry had picked me up in their automobile a trifle more stunning and a bit more determined perhaps oh she was a splendid creature in the first glory of her womanhood a perfectly groomed and an utterly spoiled young goddess she greeted me graciously with that queenly air of all great ladies where is your father i asked as she laid off her dustcoat hes in new york said she im traveling alone and where have you been all this time in europe mainly rome naples cairo india st petersburg london all about in fact father took me abroad the day after thanksgiving you remember and he has kept me there but i came of age two weeks ago two weeks i ejaculated yes i took the first ship after my birthday ive been traveling pretty constantly ever since this is a long way from the world out here isnt it she looked around curiously from your world yes said i and when she offered nothing further i grew embarrassed i started to speak then noting the maid i hesitated but alicia shook her head faintly lisette doesnt understand a word of english said she why have you come out here alicia i inquired i was far more ill at ease than she do you need to ask she eyed me defiantly i respected fathers wishes when i was in my minority i traveled and studied and did all the tiresome things he commanded me to do as long as he had the right to command but when i became my own mistress i took my full freedom he made his life to suit himself i intend to make mine to suit myself im sorry i cant please him but we dont seem to see things the same way and i dare say he has accepted the inevitable then you consider this this move you evidently contemplate as inevitable she lifted her dainty brows inevitable isnt a good word i wish a certain thing i have wished it from the first i have never ceased for an instant to wish it i feel that i must have it therefore to all intents and purposes it is inevtable anyhow im going to have it you have er been in communication with never father forbade it then how did you know he is here he wrote me when he left college he said he was coming home ive heard nothing since he is here isnt he so i believe i havent seen him yet you know ive been away myself will you take me to him have you really weighed this thing i remonstrated do you realize what it means please dont she smiled wearily so many people have tried to argue me out of my desires i shall not spoil my life believe me it is too good a thing to ruin that is precisely why im here if you insist i gave in reluctantly of course ill put myself at your service well look for him tomorrow all sorts of wild expedients to thwart a meeting were scurrying through my mind well go today said she but at once if youre too busy ill ask somebody else very well said i well drive out to the encampment and i sent for my buckboard i was delayed in spite of myself until nearly sundown and meanwhile alicia harman waited in my office pacing the floor with illconcealed impatience before starting i ventured one more remonstrance for i was filled with misgivings and the more i saw of this girl the more fantastic and unnatural this affair seemed but the unbridled impulses of her parents were bearing fruit and no one could say her nay she afforded the most illuminating study in heredity that i have ever witnessed we didnt say much during our fifteenmile drive for i was worried and alicia was oddly torn between apprehension and exultation we had left the french maid behind i dont know that any woman ever went to her lover under stranger circumstances or in greater perturbation of spirit than did this girl behind whom lay a generation of selfishness and unrestraint it was well along in the evening when we came over the ridge and saw the encampment below us you can imagine the fairy picture it made with its myriad of winking fires with the soft effulgence of a thousand glowing tents and with the wonderful magic of the night over it all as we drew nearer the unusual sounds of a strange merrymaking came to us the soft thudding of drums the weird melody of the dances the stir and the confusion of crowded animal life in the daylight it would have been sufficiently picturesque but under the wizard hand of the darkness it became ten times more so when i finally tied my horses and led the girl into the heart of it i think she became a bit frightened for these indians were the sioux of a bygone day they were barbaric in dress and in demeanor i guided her through the tangle of tepees through glaring firelit circles and through black voids where we stumbled and had to feel our way we were jostled and elbowed by fierce warriors and by sullen squaws at every group i asked for running elk but he was merely one of five thousand and nobody knew his whereabouts the people have ever been jealous of their customs and as a result we were frequently greeted by cold looks and sudden silences recognizing this open resentment my companion let down a thick automobile veil which effectually hid her face her dustcoat was long and loose and served further to conceal her identity at one time we came upon a sight i would gladly have spared her the spectacle of some wrinkled hags strangling a dog by the light of a fire the girl at my side stifled a cry at the apparition what are they doing she gasped preparing the feast i told her do they really they do said i come i tried to force her onward but she would not stir until the sacrifice had been dragged to the flames where other carcasses were singeing among the pots and kettles from every side came the smell of cooking meat mingled with the odor of burning hair and flesh i could hear miss harman panting as we went on we circled half the great hoop before we came upon the trail of our man and were directed to a nearby tepee upon the glowing walls of which many heads were outlined in silhouette and from which came the monotonous voice of a storyteller i dont know what hopes the girl had been nursing she must have looked upon these people not as kindred of running elk but rather as his servants his slaves realizing that her quest was nearly ended her strength forsook her and she dropped behind me the entrance to the tepee was congested by those who could not find space inside but they rose silently upon recognizing me and made room i lifted the flap and peered within clearing a view for miss harman we beheld a circle of halfnaked braves in full war regalia squatting haunch to haunch listening to a storyteller in front of them was a confusion of blackened pails and steaming vessels into which they dipped with their naked fingers their faces were streaked with paint their lips were greasy with traces of the dish the air of the place was reeking from their breaths my eyes were slower than alicias and so i did not distinguish our quarry at first although a slow sigh at my ear and a convulsive clutch at my arm told me that he was there and then i too saw running elk it was he who was talking to whom the others listened what a change two years had wrought his voice was harsh and guttural his face through the painted daubs and streaks was coarser and duller than when i had seen him his very body was more thin and shrunken he finished his tale while we stared at him the circle broke into commendatory grunts and he smiled in childlike satisfaction at the impression he had made he leaned forward and scrutinizing the litter of sooty pots plunged his hand into the nearest one miss harman stumbled back into the crowd and her place was taken by a squaw running elk i called over the heads of those next the entrance and seeing my face against the night he arose and came out stepping over the others how do you do i said you havent forgotten me have you he towered head and shoulders above me his feather headdress adding to his stature the beaded patterns of his warharness stood out dimly in the halflight no no i will never forget you doctor you you have been sick the change in his speech was even more noticeable when he turned his tongue to english he halted over his words and he mouthed them hesitatingly yes pretty sick and you what are you doing i do what the rest do said he nothing i have some horses and a few head of cattle that is all are you satisfied i demanded sharply he eyed me darkly for an instant then he answered slowly i am an indian i am satisfied then education didnt do you any good after all i was offended disappointed i must have spoken gruffly this time he paused a long while before he replied i had dreams said he many dreams and they were splendid but you told me that dreams were out of place in a sioux so i forgot them along with all the things i had learned it is better so alicia harman called me in a voice which i did not recognize so i shook hands with running elk and turned away he bowed his head and slunk back through the tepee door back into the heart of his people back into the past and with him went my experiment since then i have never meddled with the gods nor given them cause to laugh at me the doctor arose and stretched himself then he entered his tent for a match the melancholy pulse of the drums and the minorkeyed chant which issued out of the night sounded like a dirge sung by a dying people what became of running elk i inquired the old man answered from within that was he i asked about the horseraces hes the man you couldnt understand who wouldnt talk to you hes nearly an indian again alicia harman married a duke the moon the maid and the winged shoes the last place i locked wheels with mike butters was in idaho id just sold a silverlead prospect and was proclaimin my prosperity with soundin brass and ticklin symbols i was tuned up to g and singin quartettes with the bartender opery buffet so to speak when in mike walked it was a bright morning outside and i didnt reconize him at first against the sunlight wheres that choleramorbus case said he stranger them aint sounds of cramps i told him its me singin hell amongst the yearlins then i seen who he was and i fell among him when wed abated ourselves i looked him over what you doin in all them good clothes i inquired im a dds do tell all i ever took was the first three degrees gimme the grip and the password and ill believe you that aint a masonic symbol said he im a dentist a bony fido dentist with forceps and a little furnace and a gasbag and a waitinrooms he swelled up and bit a hangnail off of his cigar yep a regular toothwright naturally i was surprised not to say awed have you got much of a practice i made bold to ask umm it aint what it ought to be still i cant complain it takes time to work into a fashionable clienteel all i get a whack at now is injuns but im gradually beginnin to close in on the white teeth now this was certainly news to me for mike was a footracer and a good one too and the last time id seen him he didnt know nothing about teeth except that if you aint careful theyll bite your tongue i figured he was lyin so i said where did you get your degree off of a thermometer nothing of the tall i run it down i did for a gods fact its like this three months ago i crep into this burg lookin for a match but the professions was overcrowded there bein fourteen lawyers a halfdozen doctors a chiropodist and fortythree bartenders here ahead of me not to speak of a toothtinker that there dentist thought he could sprint he come from some eastern college and his pa had grubstaked him to a kit of tools and sent him out here to work his way into the confidences and cavities of the idahobos well sir the minute i seen him i realized he was my custard he wore sofy cushions on his shoulders and his coat was cut in at the back he rolled up his pants too and sometimes he sweetened the view in a vilent striped sweater i watered at the mouth and picked my teeth over him he was that succlent hed been lookin down on these natives and kiddin em ever since he arrived and once a week reglar he tried to frame a race sos he could wear his runninpants and be a hero i had no trouble fixin things he was a good little runner and he done his best but when i breasted the tape i won a quickclaim deed to his loose change to a brandnew office over a drugstore and to enough nickelplated pliers for a wiretapper i staked him to a sleeper ticket then i moved into his quarters the tools didnt have no directions on em but ive figgered out how to use most of em i gather that this here practice that youre buildin up aint exactly remunerative i said to mike not yet it aint but im widenin out there aint a day passes that i dont learn something i was out drummin up a little trade when your groans convinced me that somebody in here had a jumpin toothache if you aint busy mebbe you can help me get a patient this particular saloon had about wore out its welcome with me so i was game for any enterprise and i allowed a little patienthuntin would probly do me good i drawed my six gun and looked her over its a new sport but i bet ill take to it said i what dyou do crease em or cripple em pshaw put up that hearse ticket mike told me us doctors dont take human life we save it i thought you said you was practisin on injuns injuns is human for a fact ive learned a heap in this business not that i wouldnt bust one if i needed him but it aint necessary come ill show you this here town had more heathens than whites in it and before wed gone a block i seen a buck injun and his squaw idlin along lookin into the store winders the buck was a hungry longlegged feller and when we neared him mike said to me hist theres one ill slip up and get him from behind you grab him if he runs this method of buildin up a dental practice struck me as some strange but butters was a queer guy and this was sort of a rough town when he got abreast of mr lo mike reached out and garnered him by the neck the injun pitched some but mike eared him down finally and when i come up i seen that one side of the lads face was swelled up something fearful well well said i youve sure got the dentists eye you must have spied that swellin a block away mike nodded then he said poor feller ill bet it aches horrible my office is right handy lets get him in before the marshal sees us we drug the savage upstairs and into mikes dental stable then we bedded him down in a chair he protested considerable but we got him there in a tollable state of preservation barring the fact that he was skinned up on the corners and we had pulled a hinge off from the office door its a shame for a person to suffer thataway mike told me but these ignorant aborigines aint educated up to the mercies of science just put your knee in his stummick will you what could be finer than to alleviate pain the very thought in itself is elevatin im in this humanity business for life grab his feet quick or hell kick out the winder whoa i told the injun plenty fixum i poked the swellin on his face and he let out a yelp its lucky we got him before multiplication set in mike assured me i lay for em thataway at the foot of the stairs every day but this is the best patient ive had ive a notion to charge this one dont you charge all of em i wanted to know nope i got a tin watch off of one patient when he was under gas but the most of em aint worth goin through you got to do a certain amount of charity work dont look like much of a business to me i said theres something about it i like mike told me it sort of grows on a feller now that youre here to help catch em i calclate to acquire a lot of skill with these instruments ive been playin a lone hand and ive had to take little ones that i could handle when mike produced a pair of nickelplated nailpullers mr injun snorted like a sealion and it took both of us to hold him down but finally i tied his hair around the headrest and we had him his mane was long and i put a hard knot in it then i set on his moccasins while doctor butters pried into his innermost secrets there she is that big one mike pointed out a tooth that looked like the corner monument to a quartz claim youre on the wrong side i told him mebbe i am heres one that looks like it would come loose easier mike got a halfnelson over in the easthalfeast quartersection of the bucks mouth and throwed his weight on the pliers the injun had pretty well wore himself out by this time and when he felt those icetongs he just stiffened out an injuns dead game thataway he wont make a holler when you hurt him his squaw was hangin around with her eyes poppin out but we didnt pay no attention to her somehow mikes pinchers kept jumpin the track and at every slip a new wrinkle showed in the patients face patient is the right word all right and we didnt make no more show at loosenin that tusk than as if wed tried to pull up mount bill williams with a silk thread at last two big tears come into the bucks eyes and rolled down his cheeks first time i ever seen one cry now that weakness was plumb fatal to him for right there and then he cracked his plate with his missus yes sir he tore his shirtwaist proper the squaw straightened up and give him a look oh what a look waugh she sniffed injun heap big squaw and with that she swished out of the office and left him flat yes sir she just blew him on the spot i spose mike would have got that tooth somehow hes a perseverin party only that i happened to notice something queer and called him off here wait a minute said i and i loosened him from the mans chest mike was so engorsed in the pursuit of his profession that he was astraddle of his patients wishbone gougin away like a quartz miner take your elbow out of his mouth and lemme talk to him a minute when the savage had got his features together i said to him how you catch um bump hey and i pointed to his jaw bzzzzzz said he i turned to doctor butters hornet i declared when mike had sized up the beesting he admitted that my diagnosis was probly correct thats the trouble with these patients he complained they dont take you into their confidence just the same im goin to attend to his teeth for theres no tellin when ill catch another one whats wrong with his teeth i questioned they look good to me except theyre wore down from eatin camus if he was a horse id judge him to be about a tenyearold you never can tell by lookin at teeth whats inside of em anyhow a nice fillin would set em off i aint tried no fillins yet gimme that burley drill i wheeled out a kind of sewingmachine then i pedaled it while mike dug into that injuns hangin wall like he had a round of holes to shoot before quittintime this here was more in my line bein a hardrock miner myself and we certainly loaded a fine prospect of gold into that natives bicuspidor we took his front teeth because they was the easiest to get at it was just like i said this injuns white keys was wore off short and looked like they needed something so we laid ourselves out to supply the want we didnt exactly fill them teeth we merely riveted on a sort of a plowshare a gold sodcutter about the size of your fingernail how mike got it to stick i dont know but he must have picked up quite a number of dentists tricks before i came anyhow there she hung like a brass nameplate and she didnt wabble hardly at all youd of been surprised to see what a difference it made in that redskins looks we let our patient up finally and put a lookinglass in his hand at first he didnt know just what to make of that fillin but when he seen it was real gold a grin broke over his face his chest swelled up and he walked out of the office and across the street to a novelty store in a minute out he came with a little round lookinglass and a piece of buckskin and the last we seen of him he was hikin down the street grinnin into that mirror as happy as a child and polishin that tusk like it had started to rust which i sure entitle a gratifyin operation said mike im in no ways proud of the job i told him i feel like id salted a mine well me and mike lived in them dental parlors for a couple of weeks decoyin occasional natives into it pullin spilin fillin and filin more teeth than a few but bimeby the sport got tame one day mike was fakin variations on his guitar and i was washin dishes when i said this line is about as excitin as a game of jackstraws dyou know its footracin time with the injuns what sure theyre gettin together at old port lewis to run races this week one tribe or the other goes broke and walks home every year if we could meet up with the winnin crowd down on the la plata i didnt have to say no more for i had a hackamore on mikes attention right there and he quit climbin the g string and put up his box the next day we traded out of the tooth business and rode south down the old navajo trail we picked a good campin spot a little flat in a bend of the river where the grazin was good and we turned the ponies out we didnt have to wait long a few evenings later as we et supper we heard a big noise around the bend and knew our visitors was comin they must of had three hundred head of horses besides a big outfit of blankets buckskin baskets and all the plunder that an injun outfit travels with at sight of us in their campinplace they halted and the squaws and the children rode up to get a look at us i stepped out in front of our tent and throwed my hand to my forehead shading my eyes thats the injun sign of friendship an old chief and a couple of warriors rode forrad winchester to pommel but seein we was alone they sheathed their guns and we invited em to eat it didnt take much urgin while we fed hot biscuits to the head men the squaws pitched camp they was plumb elated at their winnin up at fort lewis and the gamblin fever was on em strong so right after supper they invited us to join em in a game of mexican monte i let mike do the cardplayin for our side because hes got a pass which is the despair of many a tinhorn he can take a clean methodistepiscopal deck deal three hands and have every face card so itll answer to its christian name no he didnt need no lookout so i got myself into a game of bounce the stick which same as you probly know is purely a redskin recreation you take a handful of twigs in your hand then throw em on to a flat rock endways bettin whether an odd or an even number will fall outside of a ring drawed in the dirt after a couple of hours mike strolled up and tipped me the wink that hed dusted his victims say he began theres the niftiest chicken down here that i ever see dont start any didos with the domestic relations of this tribe i told him or theyll spread us out and spread us thin remember youre here on business bent and if you bend back and forrads from business to pleasure and versy visa youll bust these people has scrooplous ideas regardin their wives and i respect em she aint married mike told me shes the chiefs daughter and she looks better to me than a silver mine durin that evening we give the impression that we was well heeled so the tribe wasnt in no hurry to break camp on the following morning along about noon i missed mike and i took a stroll to look for him i found him and the chiefs daughter alongside of a shady trout pool she was weavin a horsehair bracelet onto his wrist and i seen the flash of his ring on her finger mike could travel some he was a bit flustered it seemed to me and he tried to laugh the matter off but the girl didnt there was something about the look of her that i didnt like ive seen a whole lot of trouble come from less than a horsehair bracelet this here quail was mebbe seventeen she was slim and shy and she had big black eyes and a skin like velvet i spoke to mike in words of one syllable and i drug him away with me to our tent that afternoon some halfgrown boys got to runnin footraces and mike entered he let em beat him then he offered to bet a pony that they couldnt do it again the kids was game and they took him quick mike faked the race of course and lost his horse that bein part of our progam when it was all over i seen the chiefs daughter had been watchin us but she didnt say nuthin the next mornin however when we got up we found a bully pinto pony tied to one of our tent stakes look whos here said i young minnie haha has made good your losins that pony is worth forty dollars said mike sure and youre as good as a squawman this minute youre betrothed am i the idy didnt seem to faze mike if thats the case said he i reckon ill play the string out i sort of like it as far as ive gone i wish shed gave us that creamcolored mare or hers i said its worth two of this one ill get it today mike declared and sure enough he lost another footrace and the next morning the creamcolored mare was picketed in front of our tent well this didnt look good to me and i told mike so i never was much of a hand to take money from women so i served a warnin on him that if we didnt get down to business pretty quick and make our cleanup i proposed to leave him flat on his back that day the young men of the tribe did a little footrunnin and mike begged em to let him in it was comical to see how pleased they was they felt so sure of him that they began proratin our belongins among one another they laid out a halfmile course and everybody in camp went out to the finishline to see the contest and to bet on it the old chief acted as judge bookmaker clerk of the course referee and stakeholder i spose by the time the race was ready to start there must of been fifty ponies up besides a lot of money but the old bird kept every wager in his head he rolled up a couple of blankets and placed em on opposite sides of the track and showed us by motions that the first man between em would be declared the winner all the money that had been bet he put in little piles on a blanket then he give the word to get ready i had no trouble layin our money at one to five and our ponies at the same odds then when everything was geared up i called mike from his tent say when he opened the fly and stepped out there was a commotion for all he had on was his runnintrunks and his spiked shoes the injuns was in breechcloths and moccasins and of course they created no comment but the sight of a halfnekked white man was something new to these people and the first flash they got at mikes fancy togs told em theyd once more fell a victim to the white mans wiles they was wise in a minute and some of the young hotbloods was for smokin us up but the chief was a sport i got to give the old bird credit he rared back on his hind legs and made a stormy palaver as near as i could judge he told his ghostdancers theyd been colddecked but he expected em to take their medicine and grin and anyhow it was a lesson to em next time theyd know bettern to monkey with strangers whatever it was he said he made his point and after a right smart lot of powwowin the entertainment proceeded but mike and me was as popular with them people as a couple of polecats at a picnic mike certainly made a picture when he lined up at the start he stood out like a marble statue in a slate quarry i caught a glimpse of the chiefs daughter and her eyes was bigger than ever and she had her hands clinched at her side he must have looked like a god to her but for that matter he was a sight to turn any untamed female heart whether the owner et belgian hare off of silver service or boiled jackrabbit out of a coaloil can women are funny thataway its a pothunters maxim never to win by a big margin but to nose out his man at the finish this mike did winnin by a yard then he acted as if he was all in faked a faint and i doused him with a sombrero of water from the creek it was a spectacular race at that for at the finish the runners was bunched till a blanket would of covered em when they tore into the finish i seen the chiefs girl do a trick mike was runnin on the outside and when nobody was watchin her the little squaw kicked one of them blanket bundles about two feet down the course givin mike that much the edge she done it clever and it would have throwed a close race them savages swallered their physic and grinned like the chief had told em and they took it standin up they turned over the flower of their pony herd to us not to mention about six quarts of silver money and enough blankets to fill our tent the old chief patted mike on the back then put both hands to his temples with his fingers spread out as much as to say he runs like a deer bimeby a buck stepped up and begun makin signs he pointed to the sun four times and we gathered that he wanted us to wait four days until he could go and get another man mike tipped me the wink sayin theyre goin after the champeen of the tribe that phony faint of mine done it will we wait why say wed wait four years wouldnt we sweet pickins i call it champeen huh for me id wait here till i was old folks i said i dont aim to leave these simple savages nothin nothin at all but a lot of idle regrets well sir there was a heap of excitement in that camp for the next three days all them injuns done was to come and look at mike and feel of his legs and argue with one another the first night after the race mike tuned up his guitar and later on i heard snatches of the spanish fandango stealin up from the river bank i knew what was on i knew without lookin that the old chiefs girl was right there beside him huggin her knees and listenin with both ears i didnt like to think about it for she was a nice little yearlin and it looked to me like mike was up to his usual devilment seemed like a lowdown trick to play on an injunoo like her and the more i studied it the warmer i got it was a wonderful night the moonlight drenched the valley and there was the smell of campfires and horses over everything just the sort of a night for a guitar just the sort of a night to make your blood run hot and to draw you out into the glitter and make you race with your shadow when mike moseyed in along about ten oclock he was plumb loco the moonmadness was on him strong his eyes was as bright as silver coins and his voice had a queer ring to it what a night said he and what a life this is lord im tired of pothuntin ive trimmed suckers till im weary ive toted a gold brick in my pocket till my clothes bag im sick of it im goin to beat this injun champeen take my half of our winnins sell off the runty ones and settle down where do you aim to settle i inquired oh anywhere hereabouts these are good people and i like em you mean youre goin to turn out with the injuns i inquired with my mouth open mike had led so sudden that he had me over the ropes im goin to do that very little thing he declared i dunno how to talk much navajo but im learnin fast and she got my meanin we understand each other and well do better as time goes on she calls me emmike sweet aint it he heaved a sigh then he gargled a laugh that sounded like boilin mush it aint often a feller like me gets a swell little dame that worships him horses guns campfires can you beat it if that squaw had a soft palate or a nose like a eeclair you wouldnt be so keen for this simple life i told him she has stirred up your wickedness mike and youve gone nutty youre mooncrazy thats all you cut it out i argued half the night but the more i talked the more i seen that mike was stuck to be a renegade its a fact if he hadnt of been a nice kid id of cut his hobbles and let him go but pshaw mike butters could run too fast to be wasted among savages and besides its a terrible thing for a white man to marry an injun the red never dies out in the woman but the white in the man always changes into a dirty muddy red i laid awake a long while tryin to figger out a way to block his game but the only thing i could think of was to tie him up and wear out a cinch on him just as i was dozin off i had an idy i didnt like it much at first i had to swaller hard to down it but the more i studied it the better it looked so for fear id weaken i rolled over and went to sleep mike was in earnest and so was the girl that much i found out the next day and she must of learned him enough navajo to propose marriage with and he must of learned her enough english to say yes for she took possession of our camp and begun to order me around first thing she lugged our navajo blankets to the creek washed em then spread em over some bushes and beat em with a stick until they were as clean and soft as thistledown ill admit she made a pleasant picture against the bright colors of them blankets and i couldnt altogether blame mike for losin his head hed lost it all right every time she looked at him out of them big black eyes he got as wabbly as clabber it was plumb disgustin that evenin he give her a guitar lesson now mike himself was a sad musician and the sound of him fandangoin uncertainly up and down the fretful spine of that instrument was a tribulation id put up with on account of friendship pure and simple but when that discordlovin lady cliffdweller set all evenin in our tent and scraped snakedances out of them catguts with a fishbone i pulled my freight and laid out in the moonlight with the dogs mikes infatuation served one purpose though he spent so much time with the squab that it give me an opportunity to work out my scheme that guitar lesson showed me that vigrous measures was necessary so i dug up a file a shoemakers needle and some waxed thread all of which we had in our kit on the fourth morning there was a stir in the camp and we knew that the courier had got back with his runner pretty soon the whole village stormed up to our tent in a body lets go out and look him over i said whats the use of lookin at him mike inquired all injuns look alike except one i pulled back the tent fly and stepped out then i called to mike for the first thing i seen was that gold fillin of ours yes sir right there starin me in the eye was the sole and shinin monument to me and mikes brief whirl at the science of dentistry the face surroundin it was stretched wide and welcome and the minute this here newcomer reconized me he drawed back his upper lip and pointed proudly to his ornament then he dug up his lookinglass and his polishinrag and begun to dust it off it was plain to be seen that he thought more of it than his right eye and it impressed the other injuns too they crowded up and studied it they took turns feelin of it especially the squaws and i bet if wed had our dentist outfit with us we could of got rich right there the chiefs daughter in particular was took with the beauties of that gewgaw and she made signs to us that she wanted one just like it i never noticed he was so rangy mike told me when hed sized up the new arrival say this guy looks good hes split plumb to the larynx and i bet he can run for all of that windshield i noticed that mike was pretty grave when he come back in the tent and more than once that day i caught him lookin at the champeen sort of studyin him out but for that matter this new party was gettin his full share of attention everywhere he went there was a trail of kids at his heels and every time he opened his mouth he made a hit with the grown folks the women just couldnt keep their eyes offen him and i seen that mike was gettin pretty sore in the evenin he made a confession that tipped off the way his mind was workin this is the first time i ever felt nervous before a race said he mebbe its because its goin to be my last race mebbe its because that injun knows me and aint

to need em and need em bad if my scheme worked out the course it was a quartermile straightaway was laid out along the bottomland where the grass was thick and short me and the chief and his girl set on a blanket among the little piles of silver and the rest of the merry villagers lined up close to the finishline we white men had been the prime attraction up till now but it didnt take me long to see that we wasnt any more them people was all wrapped up in the lad with the gold nameplate and they was rootin for him frantic last thing he done was to give his eighteencarat squawcatcher the onceover with his buckskin buffer then he shined it at the chiefs girl and trotted down to the startinline i noticed that she glued her bigandliquids on him and kept em there it was beautiful to watch those two men jockey for a start the injun was lean and hungry and mighty smart but mike was smarter still of course he got the jump it was a pretty start and mike held his lead for fifty yards or more ill admit i was worked up ive had my heart in my mouth so often over his races that its wore smooth from swallerin but this time it just wouldnt go down our dental patient was runnin an awful race but it looked like mike had him then just as the boy settled down and reached out into that long strong stride of hisn something happened he slipped he would have fell except that he caught himself the next second he slipped again and mr man in love with a gold fillin passed him with that them injuns begun to speak some of their yells brought hunks of throat with em and that whole region begun to echo as far south as the rio bravo my scheme had worked all right you see when mike was doin his heavy courtin id planted my ace in the hole id took off the outer soles of his runninshoes and filed the spikes almost in two close up to the plate when i sewed the leather back on it never showed but the minute he struck his gait they broke with him and he begin to miss his pull he might have won at that for hes got the heart of a lion but i spose the surprise did as much as anything else to beat him it made my heart bleed to see the fight he put up but he finished six feet to the bad and fell across the mark on his face sobbin like a child its the game ones that cry when theyre licked analyze a smilin loser and youll find the yellow streak i lifted him to his feet but he was shakin like a bush in the wind them shoes he wailed them damned shoes then he busted out again and blubbered like a kid right then i done some actin but pshaw anybody can act when he has to if id of overplayed my hand a nickels worth hed of clumb up me like a rat up a rafter and there would of been human reminders all over that neighborhood not but what i would have got him eventually bein as i had my sidearms but i liked mike and i wouldnt kill nobody if i was sober it happened that he fell right at the feet of the chiefs girl and when i lifted him up he seen her but say it must have been a shock to him her eyes was half shut her head was throwed back and she was hissin like a rattlesnake mike stiffened and sort of pawed at her but she drawed away just like that other squaw in our dentist office had drawed away from her liege lord and master waugh white man heap squaw said she and with that she flirted her braids and turned to the winner of the race she went up to him and lifted his lip with her thumb like she just had to have another look at his gold tooth then she smiled up into his face and they walked away together without a glance in our direction mike follered a step or two then he stopped and stared around at the crowd it was a big minute for him and for me too and ill probly never forget the picture of that pantin boy at bay among them grinnin barbarians the curs was yappin at his heels the squaws was gigglin and makin faces the bucks was showin their teeth and pointin at his tears mike never said a word he just stooped down and peeled off his runninshoes then he throwed em as far as he could right out into the river who the hell would marry a dame like that he sobbed shes stuck on his jewelry come on lad said i and i led him to our tent then while he put on his clothes i saddled the pinto pony and the creamcolored mare for it was six days to the railroad flesh i should you chance in crossing a certain mountain pass in southern catalonia to find yourself poised above a little valley against the opposite side of which lies a monastery look to the heights above it should you piece out from among the rocks the jagged ruins of a castle ask its name your guide will perhaps inform you that those blackened stones are called the teeth of the moor and if he knows the story he will doubtless tell it to you crossing himself many times during the recital in all probability however he will merely shrug his shoulders and say it is a place of bad repute nothing more even the monks of the monastery who are considered well versed in local history have forgotten the reason for the name although they recall the legend that once upon a time the castle harbored a haughty moslem lord few of them ever heard the story of joseph the anchorite and how he sought flesh within its portals those who have will not repeat it time was however when the tale was fresh and it runs this wise away back in the reign of abderamus the just first caliph of the west hafiz a certain warlike moor amazed at the fertility of this region established on the edge of the plateau a stronghold of surprising security his house he perched upon the crest of the cliff overlooking the valley below it was backed by verdant sunkissed slopes which quickly yielded tribute in such quantity as to render him rich and powerful hafiz lived and fought and died beneath the crescent banner leaving in his place a son who likewise waged war to the northward on behalf of the prophet and all true believers at the same time farming his rich catalonian acres generations came and went and although the descendants of hafiz waxed strong so also did the power of the hated christians living as they did upon the very fringe of the mussulman empire the moors beheld with consternation the slow encroachment of the unbelievers more noticeable here than farther to the southward at intervals these enemies were driven back but invariably they reappeared until at length upon the plain beneath the castle monks came and built a monastery which they called san sebastian beneath the very eyes of abul malek fourth descendant of hafiz they raised their impious walls although he chafed to wreak a bloody vengeance for this outrage his hands were tied by force of circumstance wearied with interminable wars the moorish nation had sought respite peace dozed upon the land men rested and took from the earth new strength with which to resume the neverending struggle between the crescent and the cross wherefore abul maleks rage availed him nothing from his embrasured windows he beheld the cassocked enemies of his creed passing to and fro about their business he heard his sacred hour of prayer desecrated by their christian bells and could do no more than revile them for dogs the while he awaited the will of allah it was scant comfort for a man of his violent temper but the truce threatened never to be broken years passed and still peace continued to reign meanwhile the moor fed upon his wrongs and from incessant brooding over them became possessed of a fury more fanatical more poisonous even than had been engendered by his many battles finally when the wrong had bit too deep for him to endure he summoned all his followers and selecting from their number one hundred of the finest horsemen he bade them make ready for a journey to cordova then in their presence he kissed the blue blade of his scimitar and vowed that the shackles which had hampered him and them would be struck off for many days there ensued the bustle and the confusion of a great preparation in the house of the moor men came and went women sewed and cleaned and burnished horses were groomed their manes were combed and their hoofs were polished and then one morning ere the golden sun was an hour high down the winding trail past the monastery of san sebastian came a brilliant cavalcade abul malek led seated upon an arabian steed whiter than the clouds which lay piled above the westward mountains his two sons hassam and elzemah followed astride horses as black as night horses the distinguished pedigrees of which were cited in the books of ibn zaid back of them came one hundred swarthy warriors on other coalblack mounts whose flashing sides flung back the morning rays their flowing linen robes were like the snow and from their turbans gleamed gems of value each horseman bore at his girdle a purse a kerchief and a poinard and in their purses lay two thousand dinars of gold slaves brought up the rear of the procession riding asses laden with bales and they led fifty bloodred bays caparisoned as for a tournament with scowling glances at the monastery the band rode on across the valley climbed to the pass and disappeared after many days they arrived at cordova then when they had rested and cleansed themselves abul malek craved audience of the caliph aboulabbas el hakkam being of distinguished reputation his wish was quickly granted and on the following day in the presence of the hadjeb the viziers the white and black eunuchs the archers and the cuirassiers of the guard he made a gift to his sovereign of those hundred northern horsemen and their mounts those fifty blooded bays and their housings those bales of aloewood and camphor those silken pieces and those two thousand dinars of yellow catalonian gold this done he humbly craved a favor in return and when bade to speak he began by telling of the indignities rendered him by the monks of san sebastian five generations my people have dwelt upon our lands serving the true god and his prophet he declared with quivering indignation but now those idolaters have come they gibe and they mock at me beneath my very window my prayers are broken by their yammerings they defile my casement and the stench of their presence assails my nostrils what do you ask of me inquired the caliph i ask for leave to cleanse my doorstep the illustrious moslem shook his head whereat abul malek cried does not the koran direct us to destroy the unbelieving and the impious must i then suffer these infidels to befoul my garden god is merciful it is his will that for a time the unbelievers shall appear to flourish said the caliph we are bound by solemn compact with the kings of leon and castile to observe an armistice that armistice we shall observe for our land is weary of wars our men are tired and their scars must heal it is not for you or for me to say this is good or this is evil allahs will be done abul malek and his sons returned alone to their mountains but when they reined in at the door of their castle the father spat venomously at the belfried roof of the monastery beneath and vowed that he would yet work his will upon it now that the law forbade him to make way with his enemies by force he canvassed his brain for other means of effecting their downfall but every day the monks went on with their peaceful tasks unmindful of his hatred and their impious religion spread about the countryside abul maleks venom passed them by they gazed upon him with gentle eyes in which there was no spleen although in him they recognized a bitter foe as time wore on his hatred of their religion became centered upon the monks themselves and he undertook by crafty means to annoy them men said these christian priests were good that their lives were spent in prayer in meditation and in works of charity among the poor tales came to the moor of their spiritual existence of their fleshly renunciation but at these he scoffed he refused to credit them pah he would cry tugging at his midnight beard how can these men be aught but liars when they live and preach a falsehood their creed is impious and they are hypocrites they are not superior beings they are flesh like you or me they have our passions and our faults but a thousand times multiplied for they walk in darkness and dwell in hypocrisy beneath their cassocks is black infamy their hearts are full of evil aye of lust and of every unclean thing being false to the true god they are false to themselves and to the religion they profess and i will prove it thus ran his reasoning in order to make good his boast abul malek began to study the monks carefully one after another he tried temptation a certain grossbellied fellow he plied with wine he flattered and fawned upon the simple friar he led him into his cellars striving to poison the good mans body as well as his mind but the visitor partook in moderation and preached the gospel of christ so earnestly that the saracen fled from his presence bathing himself in clean water to be rid of the pollution next he laid a trap for the abbot himself he selected the fairest of his slaves a wellrounded woman of great physical charm and bribed her with a girdle of sequins she sought out the abbot and professed a hunger for his creed bound thus by secrecy to the pious man she lured him by every means at her command but the abbot had room for no passion save the love of christ and her wiles were powerless against this armor abul malek was patient he renewed his vow to hold the false religion up to ridicule and laughter thinking by encompassing the downfall of a single advocate thus to prove his contention and checkmate its everwidening influence he became obsessed by this idea he schemed and he contrived he used to the utmost the powers of his oriental mind from his vantagepoint above the cloister he heard the monks droning at their latin his somber glances followed them at their daily tasks like a spider he spun his web and when one victim broke through it he craftily repaired its fabric luring another into its meshes at times he shared his vigil with his daughter zahra a girl of twelve fast growing into womanhood and since she had inherited his wit and temperament he taught her to share his hatred of the blackrobed men this moorish maiden possessed the beauty of her mother who had died in childbirth and in honor of that celebrated favorite of abderamus iii she had been christened flower of the world nor was the title too immoderate as all men who saw her vowed already the hot sun of catalonia had ripened her charms and neighboring lords were beginning to make extravagant overtures of marriage but seeing in her a possible weapon more powerful than any he had yet launched against the monks of san sebastian the father refused to consider even the best of them he continued to keep her at his side pouring his hatred into her ears until she too was ablaze with it zahra was in her fourteenth year when abul malek beheld one day a new figure among those in the courtyard of the monastery below even from his eminence the saracen could see that this latecomer was a giant man for the fellow towered head and shoulders above his brethren inquiry taught him that the monks name was joseph nor was their meeting long delayed for a sickness fell among the people of the valley and abul malek being skilled in medicine went out to minister among the poor according to his religion at the sickbed of a shepherd the two men came face to face joseph was not young nor was he old but rather he had arrived at the perfect flower of his manhood and his placid soul shone out through features of unusual strength and sweetness in him the crafty moor beheld a difference which for a time was puzzling but eventually he analyzed it the other monks had once been worldly men they showed it in their faces the countenance of fray joseph on the contrary was that of a boy and it was without track of temptation or trace of evil he had lived a sheltered life from his earliest youth so it transpired and abul malek rejoiced in the discovery it being his belief that all men are flesh and that within them smolder flames which some day must have mastery if this monk had never let his youth run free if he had never met temptation and conquered it those pentup forces which inhabit all of us must be gathering power year by year and once the joint of this armor had been found once it could be pierced he would become earthly like other men and his false religion would drop away leaving him naked under the irksome garb of priesthood accordingly the moor tested fray joseph as he had tested the abbot and the others but to no avail and he was in despair until one day the secret of his failure was unexpectedly revealed being busied with his accounts he had repaired to the shade of a pomegranate grove near the cliff the better to escape the heat while so engaged up the path from the monastery came the good brother just abreast of abul maleks point of vantage joseph paused to listen a songbird was trilling wondrously and the monks face raised toward the pomegranate trees became transfigured he changed as if by magic his lips parted in a tender smile his figure grew tense with listening not until the last note had died away did he move then a great breath stirred his lungs and with shining eyes and rapt countenance he went on into the fields abul malek rose his white teeth gleaming through his beard allah be praised he exclaimed it is music and rolling up his papers he went into the house early on the following morning another cavalcade filed down past the monastery of san sebastian but this procession was in great contrast to the one that had gone by five years before instead of gaily caparisoned warriors it was composed mainly of women and slaves with a mere handful of guards to lead the way there were bondmaidens and seamstresses an ancient nurse and a tutor of languages while astride of a palfrey at her fathers side rode the youthful lady of the castle her veil was wet upon her cheeks her eyes were filled with shadows yet she rode proudly like a princess once more the train moved past the sunbaked walls of the monastery across the plain to the mountain road that led to the land of bounty and of culture late that afternoon brother joseph learned from the lips of a herdsman that the beauteous zahra flower of all the moorish race had gone to cordova to study music ii abul malek once more rode home alone to his castle but this time as he dismounted at his door he smiled at the monastery below four years crept by during which the saracen lord brooded over the valley and the monk joseph went his simple way rendering service where he could preaching by the example of his daily life and his unselfish devotion a sermon more powerful than his lips could utter through it all the moor watched him carefully safeguarding him as a provident farmer fattens a sheep for the slaughter once a year the father rode southward to cordova bringing news with his return that delighted the countryside news that penetrated even the walls of san sebastian and filled the good men therein with gladness it seemed that the maiden zahra was becoming a great musician she pursued her studies in the famous school of alizeriab and not even moussali himself that most gifted of arabian singers could bring more tender notes from the lute than could this fair daughter of catalonia her skill transcended that of al farabi for the harp the tabor and the mandolin were wedded to her dancing fingers and most marvelous of all her soul was so filled with poetry that her verses were sung from valencia to cadiz it was said that she could move men to laughter to tears to deeds of heroism that she could even lull them to sleep by the potency of her magic she had once played before the caliph under amazing circumstances the prince of true believers so ran the story had quarreled with his favorite wife and in consequence had fallen into a state of melancholy so deep as to threaten his health and to alarm his ministers do what they would he still declined until in despair the hadjeb sent for zahra daughter of abul malek she came surrounded by her servants and sang before el hakkam so cunningly did she contrive her verses so tender were her airs so potent were her fluttering fingers that those within hearing were moved to tears and the unhappy lover himself became so softened that he sped to the arms of his offended beauty and a reconciliation occurred in token of his gratitude he had despatched a present of forty thousand drachmas of gold to the singer and her renown went broadcast like a flame when abul malek heard of this he praised his god and gathering his horsemen he set out to bring his daughter home for the time was ripe one evening in early spring that magic season when nature is most charming fray joseph returning to his cell heard from behind a screen of verdure alongside his path a woman singing but was this singing he asked himself could mortal lips give birth to melody like this it was the sighing of summer winds through rustling leaves the music of crystal brooks on stony courses the fullthroated worship of birds joseph listened enthralled like a famished pilgrim in the desert his simple soul attuned to harmonies of the woodland leaped in answer his fancy starved by years of churchly rigor quickened like a prisoner at the light of day not until the singer had ceased did he resume his way and through his dreams that night ran the song of birds the play of zephyrs the laughter of bubbling springs a few evenings later he heard the voice again and paused with lips apart with heart consumed by eagerness it was some slave girl busied among the vines of abul malek he decided for she translated all the fragmentary airs that float through summer evenings the songs of sweethearts the tender airs of motherhood the croon of distant waterfalls the voice of sleepy locusts and yet she wove them into an air that carried words it was most wonderful joseph felt a strong desire to mingle his voice with the singers but he knew his throat to be harsh and stiff from chanting latin phrases he knew not whither the tune would lead and yet when she sang he followed realizing gladly that she voiced the familiar music of his soul he was moved to seek her out and to talk with her until he remembered with a start that she was a woman and he a priest each night he shaped his course so as to bring him past the spot where the mysterious singer labored and in time he began to feel the stirring of a very earthly curiosity the which he manfully fought down through the long heated hours of the day he hummed her airs and repeated her verses longing for the twilight hour which would bring the angel voice from out the vineyard eventually the girl began to sing of love and joseph echoed the songs in solitude his voice as rasping and untrue as that of a frog then one evening he heard that which froze him in his tracks the singer accompanied herself upon some instrument the like of which he had never imagined the music filled the air with heavenly harmony and it set him to vibrating like a tautened string it rippled forth softer than the breeze more haunting than the perfume of the frangipani joseph stood like a man in a trance forgetful of all things save these honeyed sounds half minded to believe himself favored by the music of the seraphim never had he dreamed of such an intoxication and then as if to intensify his wild exultation the maiden sang a yearning strain of passion and desire the priest began to tremble his heartbeats quickened his senses became unbridled something new and mighty awoke within him and he was filled with fever his huge thews tightened his muscles swelled as if for battle yet miracle of miracles he was melting like a child in tears with his breath tugging at his throat he turned off the path and parted the verdure going as soundlessly as an animal and all the while his head was whirling his eyes took note of nothing he was drawn as by a thousand invisible strings which wound him toward the hidden singer but suddenly the music ended in a peal of rippling laughter and there came the rustle of silken garments fray joseph found himself in a little open glade so recently vacated that a faint perfume still lingered to aggravate his nostrils beyond stretched the vineyard of the moor a tangle of purpling vines into the baffling mazes of which the singer had evidently fled so she had known of his presence all along the monk reflected dizzily it followed therefore that she must have waited every evening for his coming and that her songs had been sung for him an ecstasy swept over him regaining the path he went downward to the monastery his brain afire his body tingling joseph was far too simple for selfanalysis and he was too enchanted by those liquid strains to know what all this soul confusion foretold he merely realized that he had made the most amazing of discoveries that the music of the spheres had been translated for his privileged ears that a door had opened allowing him to glimpse a glory hidden from other mortals it was not the existence of the singer but of the music that excited him to adoration he longed to possess it to take it with him and to cherish it like a thing of substance to worship it in his solitude the song had been of love but after all love was the burden of his religion love filled the universe it kept the worlds aswinging it was the thing that dominated all nature and made sweet even the rigid life of an anchorite it was doubtless love which awoke this fierce yet tender yearning in him now this ecstasy that threatened to smother him love was a holy and an impersonal thing nevertheless it blazed and melted in his every vein and it made him very human through all that night fray joseph lay upon his couch rapt thankful wondering but in the morning he had changed his thoughts became unruly and he recalled again that tantalizing perfume the shy tones of that mischief laughter he began to long intensely to behold the author of this musicmagic to behold her just once for imagination graced her with a thousand witching forms he wished ardently also to speak with her about this miracle this hidden thing called melody for the which he had starved his life unknowingly as the afternoon aged he began to fear that he had frightened her and therefore when he came to tread his homeward path it was with a strange commingling of eagerness and of dread but while still at a distance he heard her singing as usual and nearing the spot he stopped to drink in her message again the maiden sang of love again the monk felt his spirit leaping as she fed his starving soul even more adroitly than she fingered the vibrant strings at last her wild romantic verses became more unrestrained the music quickened until regardless of all things fray joseph burst the thicket asunder and stood before her huge exalted palpitant i too have sung those songs he panted hoarsely that melody has lived in me since time began but i am mute and you who are you what miracle bestowed this gift he paused for with the ending of the song his frenzy was dying and his eyes were clearing there casting back his curious gaze was a bewitching moorish maid whose physical perfection seemed to cause the very place to glow the slanting sunbeams shimmered upon her silken garments from her careless hand drooped an instrument of gold and of tortoiseshell an instrument strange to the eyes of the monk her feet were cased in tiny slippers of soft moroccan leather her limbs rounded and supple and smooth as ivory were outlined beneath wide flowing trousers which were gathered at the ankles a tunic of finest fabric was flung back displaying a figure of delicate proportions half recumbent now upon the sward the loveliness of moorish women has been heralded to the world it is not strange that this maid renowned even among her own people should have struck the rustic priest to dumbness he stood transfixed and yet he wondered not for it was seemly that such heavenly music should have sprung from the rarest of mortals he saw that her hair blacker than the night rippled in a glorious cascade below her waist and that her teeth embellished with the whiteness of alabaster the vermilion lips which smiled at him that same intoxicating scent sweeter than the musk of hadramaut enveloped her her fingers were jeweled with nails which flashed in rivalry with their burden of precious stones as she toyed with the whispering strings for a time she regarded the monk silently i am zahra she said at length and joseph thrilled at the tones of her voice to me all things are music zahra flower of the world he repeated wonderingly after an instant he continued harshly then you are the daughter of the moor yes abul malek you have heard of me who has not aye you were rightly called flower of the world but this music it brought me here against my will it pulls at me like straining horses why is that what wizardry do you possess what strange chemistry she laughed lightly i possess no magic art we are akin you and i that is all you of all men are attuned to me no he said heavily you are an infidel i am a christian there is no bond between us so she mocked and yet when i sing you can hear the nightingales of aden i can take you with me to the fields of battle or to the innermost halls of the alhambra i have watched you many times brother joseph and i have never failed to play upon your soul as i play upon my own are we not then attuned your veil he cried accusingly i have never beheld a moorish womans face until now her lids drooped as if to hide the fire behind them and she replied without heeding his words sit here beside me i will play for you yes yes he cried eagerly play play on for me but i will stand accordingly she resumed her instrument and oer its strings her rosy fingers twinkled while with witchery of voice and beauty she enthralled him again she sang of love reclinging there like an houri fit to grace the paradise of her prophet and the giant monk became a puppet in her hands now although she sang of love it was a different love from that which joseph knew and worshiped and as she toyed with him his hot blood warred with his priestly devotion until he was racked with the tortures of the pit but she would not let him go she lured him with her eyes her lips her luscious beauty until he heard no song whatever until he no longer saw visions of spiritual beatitude but flesh ripe flesh aquiver and awake to him a cry burst from him turning he tore himself away and went crashing blindly through the thicket like a bull pursued on on he fled down to the monastery and into the coolness of his cell where upon the smooth worn flags he knelt and struggled with this evil thing which accursed his soul for many days joseph avoided the spot which had witnessed his temptation but of nights when he lay spent and weary with his battle through the grating of his window came the song of the saracen maid and the whisper of her golden lute he knew she was calling to him therefore he beat his breast and scourged himself to cure his longing but night after night she sang from the heights above and the burden of her song was ever the same of one who waited and of one who came bit by bit she wore down the mans resistance then drew him up through the groves of citron and pomegrante into the grape fields time and again he fled closer and closer she lured him until one day he touched her flesh womans flesh and forgot all else but now it was her turn to flee she poised like a sunbeam just beyond his reach her bosom heaving her lips as ripe and full as the grapes above her eyes afire with invitation in answer to his cry she made a glowing promise subtle yet warm and soft as of the flesh tonight when the moon hangs over yonder pass i shall play on the balcony outside my window beneath is a door unbarred come for i shall be alone in all the castle and there you will find music made flesh and flesh made music then she was gone the soul of the priest had been in torment heretofore but chaos engulfed it during the hours that followed he was like a man bereft of reason he burned with fever yet his whole frame shook as from a wintry wind he prayed or tried to but his eyes beheld no vision save a waiting moorish maid with hair like night his stammering tongue gave forth no latin but repeated oer and oer her parting promise there you will find music made flesh and flesh made music he realized that the foul fiend had him by the throat and undertook to cast him off but all the time he knew that when the moon came bringing with it the cadence of a song he would go even though his going led to perdition and go he did groveling in his misery his sandals spurned the rocky path when he heard the voice of zahra sighing through the branches then when he had reached the castle wall he saw her bending toward him from the balcony above i come to you she whispered and an instant later her form showed white against the blackness of the low stone door in front of him there in the gloom for one brief instant her yielding body met his her hands reached upward and drew his face down to her own then out from his hungry arms she glided and with rippling laughter fled into the blackness zahra he cried come she whispered and when he hesitated do you fear to follow zahra he repeated but his voice was strange and he tore at the cloth that bound his throat stumbling after her guided only by her voice always she was just beyond his reach always she eluded him yet never did he lose the perfume of her presence nor the rustle of her silken garments over and over he cried her name until at last he realized from the echo of his calling that he had come into a room of great dimensions and that the girl was gone for an instant he was in despair until her voice reached him from above i do but test you christian priest i am waiting flower of the world he stammered hoarsely whence lead the stairs and do you love me then she queried in a tone that set him all ablaze zahra he repeated i shall perish for want of you how do you measure this devotion she insisted softly will it cool with the dawn or are you mine in truth forever and all time i have no thought save that of you come light of my soul or i shall die do you then adore me above all things earthly and heavenly that you forsake your vows answer that my arms may enfold you he groaned like a man upon a rack and the agony of that cry was proof conclusive of his abject surrender then through the dead black silence of the place there came a startling sound it was a peal of laughter loud evil triumphant and as if it had been a signal other mocking voices took it up until the great vault rang to a fiendish din ho hassam elzemah close the doors cried the voice of abul malek bring the lights there followed a ponderous clanging and the rattle of chains the while fray joseph stood reeling in his tracks then suddenly from every side burst forth the radiance of many lamps torches sprang into flame braziers of resin wood began to smoke flambeaux were lit and half blinded by the glare the christian monk stood revealed in the hall of abul malek he cast his eyes about but on every side he beheld grinning men of swarthy countenance and at sight of his terror the hellish merriment broke forth anew until the whole place thundered with it facing him upon an ornamental balcony stood the moor and beside him with elbows on the balustrade and face alight with sinister enjoyment stood his daughter stunned by his betrayal joseph imploringly pronounced her name at which a fresh guffaw resounded then above the clamor she inquired with biting malice dost thou any longer doubt oh christian that i adore thee at this her father and her brothers rocked back and forth as if suffocated by the humor of this jest the lone man turned in mind to flee but every entrance to the hall was closed and at each portal stood a grinning saracen he bowed his shaven head and his shame fell slowly upon him you have me trapped he said what shall my punishment be this answered the moorish lord to acknowledge once again before us all the falseness of your faith that i have never done that i can never do said joseph nay but a moment ago you confessed that you adored my daughter above all things earthly or heavenly you forswore your vows for her repeat it then i have sinned before god but i still acknowledge him and crave his mercy said the wretched priest hark you joseph you are the best of monks have you ever done evil before this night my life has been clean but the flesh is weak it was the witchcraft of satan in that womans music i prayed for strength but i was powerless my soul shall pay the penalty what sort of god is this who snares his holiest disciple with the lusts of the flesh mocked abul malek did not your prayers mount up so high or is his power insufficient to forestall the devil bah there is but one true god and mohammed is his prophet these many years have i labored to rend your veil of holiness asunder and to expose your faith to ridicule and laughter this have i done tonight stop cried the tortured monk bring forth a lance nay nay you shall hear me through gloated abul malek and again joseph bowed his tonsured head murmuring it is my punishment ringed about thus by his enemies the priest stood meekly while the sweat came out upon his face as the saracen mocked and jeered at him he made no answer except to move his lips in whispered grayer had it not been for this sign they might have thought him changed to stone so motionless and so patient did he stand how long the baiting lasted no one knew it may have been an hour then josephs passive silence roused the anger of the overlord who became demoniac in his rage his followers joined in harrying the victim until the place became a babel finally elzemah stepped forward torch in hand and spat upon the giant blackrobed figure the monks face whitened it grew ghastly but he made no movement then in a body the infidels rushed forth to follow the example of abul maleks son they swarmed about the christian jeering cursing spitting snatching at his garments until their master cried enough the knave has water in his veins his blood has soured deserted by his god his frame has withered and his vigor fled yes echoed his daughter he is great only in bulk had he been a man i might have loved him but the evil has fled out of him leaving nothing but his cassock off with his robe elzemah let us see if aught remains with swift movement her brother tore at the monks habit baring his great bosom at this insult to his cloth a frightful change swept over the victim he upheaved his massive shoulders his gleaming head rose high and in the glaring light they saw that his face had lost all sweetness and humility it was now the visage of a madman all fleshly passion stored through thirty years of cloister life blazed forth consuming reason and intelligence with a sweep of his mighty arms he cleared a space about him hurling his enemies aside as if they were made of straw he raised his voice above the din cursing god and men and moors as they closed in upon him he snatched from the hands of a lusty slave a massive wroughtiron brazier and whirling it high above his head he sent its glowing coals flying into the farthest corners of the room then with this weapon he laid about him right and left while men fell like grain before the reaper at him shouted abul malek from his balcony pull down the weapons from the walls the fool is mad zahra clutched at her fathers sleeve and pointed to a distant corner where a tongue of flame was licking the dry woodwork and hangings her eyes were flashing and her lips were parted she bent forward following the priest with eagerness allah be praised she breathed he is a man elzemah strove to sheathe his poinard in the monks bare breast but the brazier crushed him down across the wide floor raged the contest but the mighty priest was irresistible hassam seeing that the priest was fighting toward the balcony flung himself upon the stairs crying to his father and his sister to be gone by now the castle echoed with a frightful din through which arose a sinister crackling the light increased moment by moment and there came the acrid smell of smoke men left the maniac to give battle to the other fury some fled to the doors and fought with their clumsy fastenings but as they flung them back a draught sucked through changing the place into a raging furnace with his back against the stairs hassam hewed at the monk with his scimitar he had done as well had he essayed to fell an oak with a single blow up over him rushed the giant to the balcony above where abul malek and his daughter stood at bay in the trap of their own manufacture there in the glare of the mounting flames fray joseph sank his mighty fingers through the moors black beard the place by now was suffocating and the roar of the conflagration had drowned all other sounds men wrapped their robes about their heads and hurled themselves blindly at the doors fighting with one another with the licking flames with the dead that clogged the slippery flags but the maid remained she tore at the tattered cassock of the priest crying into his ear come joseph we may yet escape he let the writhing abul malek slip from out his grasp and peered at her through the smother thou knowest me not she queried i am zahra her arms entwined his neck for a second time that night but with a furious cry he raised his hands and smote her down at his feet then he fled back to the stairs and plunged down into the billows that raged ahead of the fresh night wind the bells of san sebastian were clanging the alarm the good monks were toiling up the path toward the inferno which lit the heavens when black against the glare they saw a giant figure approaching it came reeling toward them vast mighty misshapen not until it was in their very midst did they recognize their brother joseph he was bent and broken he was singed of body and of raiment he gibbered foolishly he passed them by and went staggering to his cell long ere they reached the castle it was but a seething mountain of flame and in the morning naught remained of abul maleks house but heated ruins strange tales were rife concerning the end of the moor and of his immediate kin but the monks could make little out of them for they were garbled and too ridiculous for belief no mussulman who survived the fire could speak coherently of what had happened in the great hall nor could fray joseph tell his story for he lay stricken with a malady which did not leave him for many weeks even when he recovered he did not talk for although his mind was clear on most matters nay although he was as simple and as devout as ever a kind providence had blotted out all memory of zahra of his sin and of the temptation that had beset his flesh so it is that even to this day the teeth of the moor remains a term of mystery to most of the monks of san sebastian
