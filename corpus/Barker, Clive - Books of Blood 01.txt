introduction by ramsey campbell the creature had taken hold of his lip and pulled his muscle off his bone as though removing a balaclava still with me heres another taste of what you can expect from clive barker each man woman and child in that seething tower was sightless they saw only through the eyes of the city they were thoughtless but to think the citys thoughts and they believed themselves deathless in their lumbering relentless strength vast and mad and deathless you see that barker is as powerfully visionary as he is gruesome one more quote from yet another story what would a resurrection be without a few laughs i quote that deliberately as a warning to the fainthearted if you like your horror fiction reassuring both unreal enough not to be taken too seriously and familiar enough not to risk spraining your imagination or waking up your nightmares when you thought they were safely put to sleep these books are not for you if on the other hand youre tired of tales that tuck you up and make sure the night light is on before leaving you not to mention the parade of good stories well told which have nothing more to offer than borrowings from better horror writers whom the bestseller audience have never heard of you may rejoice as i did to discover that clive barker is the most original writer of horror fiction to have appeared for years and in the best sense the most deeply shocking writer now working in the field the horror story is often assumed to be reactionary certainly some of its finest practitioners have been but the tendency has also produced a good deal of irresponsible nonsense and there is no reason why the whole field should look backward when it comes to the imagination the only rules should be ones own instincts and clive barkers never falter to say that horror fiction is fundamentally concerned with reminding us what is normal if only by showing the supernatural and alien to be abnormal is not too far from saying that horror fiction must be about ordinary everyday people confronted by the alien thank heaven nobody convinced poe of that and thank heaven for writers as radical as clive barker not that hes necessarily averse to traditional themes but they come out transformed when hes finished with them sex death and starshine is the ultimate haunted theatre story human remains is a brilliantly original variation on the doppelganger theme but both these take familiar themes further than ever before to conclusions that are both blackly comic and weirdly optimistic the same might be said of new murders in the rue morgue a dauntingly optimistic comedy of the macabre but now were in the more challenging territory of barkers radical sexual openness what precisely this and others of his tales are saying about possibilities i leave for you to judge i did warn you that these books are not for the faint of heart and imagination and its as well to keep that in mind while braving such tales as midnight meattrain a technicolor horror story rooted in the graphic horror movie but wittier and more vivid than any of those scapegoats his island tale of terror actually uses that staple of the dubbed horror film and videocassette the underwater zombie and son of celluloid goes straight for a biological taboo with a directness worthy of the films of david cronenberg but its worth pointing out that the real strength of that story is its flow of invention so it is with tales such as in the hills the cities and the skins of the fathers their fertility of invention recalls the great fantastic painters and indeed i cant think of a contemporary writer in the field whose work demands more loudly to be illustrated and theres more the terrifying pigblood blues dread which walks the shaky tightrope between clarity and voyeurism that any treatment of sadism risks more but i think its almost time i got out of your way here you have nearly a quarter of a million words of him his choice of the best of eighteen months worth of short stories written in the evenings while during the days he wrote plays it seems to me to be an astonishing performance and the most exciting debut in horror fiction for many years merseyside may the book of blood the dead have highways they run unerring lines of ghosttrains of dreamcarriages across the wasteland behind our lives bearing an endless traffic of departed souls their thrum and throb can be heard in the broken places of the world through cracks made by acts of cruelty violence and depravity their freight the wandering dead can be glimpsed when the heart is close to bursting and sights that should be hidden come plainly into view they have signposts these highways and bridges and laybys they have turnpikes and intersections it is at these intersections where the crowds of dead mingle and cross that this forbidden highway is most likely to spill through into our world the traffic is heavy at the crossroads and the voices of the dead are at their most shrill here the barriers that separate one reality from the next are worn thin with the passage of innumerable feet such an intersection on the highway of the dead was located at number tollington place just a brickfronted mockgeorgian detached house number was unremarkable in every other way an old forgettable house stripped of the cheap grandeur it had once laid claim to it had stood empty for a decade or more it was not rising damp that drove tenants from number it was not the rot in the cellars or the subsidence that had opened a crack in the front of the house that ran from doorstep to eaves it was the noise of passage in the upper storey the din of that traffic never ceased it cracked the plaster on the walls and it warped the beams it rattled the windows it rattled the mind too number tollington place was a haunted house and noone could possess it for long without insanity setting in at some time in its history a horror had been committed in that house noone knew when or what but even to the untrained observer the oppressive atmosphere of the house particularly the top storey was unmistakable there was a memory and a promise of blood in the air of number a scent that lingered in the sinuses and turned the strongest stomach the building and its environs were shunned by vermin by birds even by flies no woodlice crawled in its kitchen no starling had nested in its attic whatever violence had been done there it had opened the house up as surely as a knife slits a fishs belly and through that cut that wound in the world the dead peered out and had their say that was the rumour anyway it was the third week of the investigation at tollington place three weeks of unprecedented success in the realm of the paranormal using a newcomer to the business a twentyyearold called simon mcneal as a medium the essex university parapsychology unit had recorded all but incontrovertible evidence of life after death in the top room of the house a claustrophobic corridor of a room the mcneal boy had apparently summoned the dead and at his request they had left copious evidence of their visits writing in a hundred different hands on the pale ochre walls they wrote it seemed whatever came into their heads their names of course and their birth and death dates fragments of memories and wellwishes to their living descendants strange elliptical phrases that hinted at their present torments and mourned their lost joys some of the hands were square and ugly some delicate and feminine there were obscene drawings and halffinished jokes alongside lines of romantic poetry a badly drawn rose a game of noughts and crosses a shopping list the famous had come to this wailing wall mussolini was there lennon and janis joplin and nobodies too forgotten people had signed themselves beside the greats it was a rollcall of the dead and it was growing day by day as though word of mouth was spreading amongst the lost tribes and seducing them out of silence to sign this barren room with their sacred presence after a lifetimes work in the field of psychic research doctor florescu was well accustomed to the hard facts of failure it had been almost comfortable settling back into a certainty that the evidence would never manifest itself now faced with a sudden and spectacular success she felt both elated and confused she sat as she had sat for three incredible weeks in the main room on the middle floor one flight of stairs down from the writing room and listened to the clamour of noises from upstairs with a sort of awe scarcely daring to believe that she was allowed to be present at this miracle there had been nibbles before tantalizing hints of voices from another world but this was the first time that province had insisted on being heard upstairs the noises stopped mary looked at her watch it was sixseventeen pm for some reason best known to the visitors the contact never lasted much after six shed wait til halfpast then go up what would it have been today who would have come to that sordid little room and left their mark shall i set up the cameras reg fuller her assistant asked please she murmured distracted by expectation wonder what well get today well leave him ten minutes sure upstairs mcneal slumped in the corner of the room and watched the october sun through the tiny window he felt a little shut in all alone in that damn place but he still smiled to himself that warm beatific smile that melted even the most academic heart especially doctor florescus oh yes the woman was infatuated with his smile his eyes the lost look he put on for her it was a fine game indeed at first that was all it had been a game now simon knew they were playing for bigger stakes what had begun as a sort of liedetection test had turned into a very serious contest mcneal versus the truth the truth was simple he was a cheat he penned all his ghostwritings on the wall with tiny shards of lead he secreted under his tongue he banged and thrashed and shouted without any provocation other than the sheer mischief of it and the unknown names he wrote ha he laughed to think of it the names he found in telephone directories yes it was indeed a fine game she promised him so much she tempted him with fame encouraging every lie that he invented promises of wealth of applauded appearances on the television of an adulation hed never known before as long as he produced the ghosts he smiled the smile again she called him her gobetween an innocent carrier of messages shed be up the stairs soon her eyes on his body his voice close to tears with her pathetic excitement at another series of scrawled names and nonsense he liked it when she looked at his nakedness or all but nakedness all his sessions were carried out with him only dressed in a pair of briefs to preclude any hidden aids a ridiculous precaution all he needed were the leads under his tongue and enough energy to fling himself around for half an hour bellowing his head off he was sweating the groove of his breastbone was slick with it his hair plastered to his pale forehead today had been hard work he was looking forward to getting out of the room sluicing himself down and basking in admiration awhile the gobetween put his hand down his briefs and played with himself idly somewhere in the room a fly or flies maybe were trapped it was late in the season for flies but he could hear them somewhere close they buzzed and fretted against the window or around the light bulb he heard their tiny fly voices but didnt question them too engrossed in his thoughts of the game and in the simple delight of stroking himself how they buzzed these harmless insect voices buzzed and sang and complained how they complained mary florescu drummed the table with her fingers her wedding ring was loose today she felt it moving with the rhythm of her tapping sometimes it was tight and sometimes loose one of those small mysteries that shed never analysed properly but simply accepted in fact today it was very loose almost ready to fall off she thought of alans face alans dear face she thought of it through a hole made of her wedding ring as if down a tunnel was that what his death had been like being carried away and yet further away down a tunnel to the dark she thrust the ring deeper on to her hand through the tips of her indexfinger and thumb she seemed almost to taste the sour metal as she touched it it was a curious sensation an illusion of some kind to wash the bitterness away she thought of the boy his face came easily so very easily splashing into her consciousness with his smile and his unremarkable physique still unmanly like a girl really the roundness of him the sweet clarity of his skin the innocence her fingers were still on the ring and the sourness she had tasted grew she looked up fuller was organizing the equipment around his balding head a nimbus of pale green light shimmered and wove she suddenly felt giddy fuller saw nothing and heard nothing his head was bowed to his business engrossed mary stared at him still seeing the halo on him feeling new sensations waking in her coursing through her the air seemed suddenly alive the very molecules of oxygen hydrogen nitrogen jostled against her in an intimate embrace the nimbus around fullers head was spreading finding fellow radiance in every object in the room the unnatural sense in her fingertips was spreading too she could see the colour of her breath as she exhaled it a pinky orange glamour in the bubbling air she could hear quite clearly the voice of the desk she sat at the low whine of its solid presence the world was opening up throwing her senses into an ecstasy coaxing them into a wild confusion of functions she was capable suddenly of knowing the world as a system not of politics or religions but as a system of senses a system that spread out from the living flesh to the inert wood of her desk to the stale gold of her wedding ring and further beyond wood beyond gold the crack opened that led to the highway in her head she heard voices that came from no living mouth she looked up or rather some force thrust her head back violently and she found herself staring up at the ceiling it was covered with worms no that was absurd it seemed to be alive though maggoty with life pulsing dancing she could see the boy through the ceiling he was sitting on the floor with his jutting member in his hand his head was thrown back like hers he was as lost in his ecstasy as she was her new sight saw the throbbing light in and around his body traced the passion that was seated in his gut and his head molten with pleasure it saw another sight the lie in him the absence of power where shed thought there had been something wonderful he had no talent to commune with ghosts nor had ever had she saw this plainly he was a little liar a boyliar a sweet white boyliar without the compassion or the wisdom to understand what he had dared to do now it was done the lies were told the tricks were played and the people on the highway sick beyond death of being misrepresented and mocked were buzzing at the crack in the wall and demanding satisfaction that crack she had opened she had unknowingly fingered and fumbled at unlocking it by slow degrees her desire for the boy had done that her endless thoughts of him her frustration her heat and her disgust at her heat had pulled the crack wider of all the powers that made the system manifest love and its companion passion and their companion loss were the most potent here she was an embodiment of all three loving and wanting and sensing acutely the impossibility of the former two wrapped up in an agony of feeling which she had denied herself believing she loved the boy simply as her gobetween it wasnt true it wasnt true she wanted him wanted him now deep inside her except that now it was too late the traffic could be denied no longer it demanded yes it demanded access to the little trickster she was helpless to prevent it all she could do was utter a tiny gasp of horror as she saw the highway open out before her and understood that this was no common intersection they stood at fuller heard the sound doctor he looked up from his tinkering and his face washed with a blue light she could see from the corner of her eye bore an expression of enquiry did you say something he asked she thought with a fillip of her stomach of how this was bound to end the etherfaces of the dead were quite clear in front of her she could see the profundity of their suffering and she could sympathize with their ache to be heard she saw plainly that the highways that crossed at tollington place were not common thoroughfares she was not staring at the happy idling traffic of the ordinary dead no that house opened onto a route walked only by the victims and the perpetrators of violence the men the women the children who had died enduring all the pains nerves had wit to muster with their minds branded by the circumstances of their deaths eloquent beyond words their eyes spoke their agonies their ghost bodies still bearing the wounds that had killed them she could also see mingling freely with the innocents their slaughterers and tormentors these monsters frenzied mushminded bloodletters peeked through into the world nonesuch creatures unspoken forbidden miracles of our species chattering and howling their jabberwocky now the boy above her sensed them she saw him turn a little in the silent room knowing that the voices he heard were not flyvoices the complaints were not insectcomplaints he was aware suddenly that he had lived in a tiny corner of the world and that the rest of it the third fourth and fifth worlds were pressing at his lying back hungry and irrevocable the sight of his panic was also a smell and a taste to her yes she tasted him as she had always longed to but it was not a kiss that married their senses it was his growing panic it filled her up her empathy was total the fearful glance was hers as much as his their dry throats rasped the same small word please that the child learns please that wins care and gifts please that even the dead surely even the dead must know and obey please today there would be no such mercy given she knew for certain these ghosts had despaired on the highway a grieving age bearing the wounds they had died with and the insanities they had slaughtered with they had endured his levity and insolence his idiocies the fabrications that had made a game of their ordeals they wanted to speak the truth fuller was peering at her more closely his face now swimming in a sea of pulsing orange light she felt his hands on her skin they tasted of vinegar are you all right he said his breath like iron she shook her head no she was not all right nothing was right the crack was gaping wider every second through it she could see another sky the slate heavens that loured over the highway it overwhelmed the mere reality of the house please she said her eyes rolling up to the fading substance of the ceiling wider wider the brittle world she inhabited was stretched to breaking point suddenly it broke like a dam and the black waters poured through inundating the room fuller knew something was amiss but he didnt understand what was happening she felt his spine ripple she could see his brain whirl whats going on he said the pathos of the enquiry made her want to laugh upstairs the waterjug in the writing room shattered fuller let her go and ran towards the door it began to rattle and shake even as he approached it as though all the inhabitants of hell were beating on the other side the handle turned and turned and turned the paint blistered the key glowed redhot fuller looked back at the doctor who was still fixed in that grotesque position head back eyes wide he reached for the handle but the door opened before he could touch it the hallway beyond had disappeared altogether where the familiar interior had stood the vista of the highway stretched to the horizon the sight killed fuller in a moment his mind had no strength to take the panorama in it could not control the overload that ran through his every nerve his heart stopped a revolution overturned the order of his system his bladder failed his bowels failed his limbs shook and collapsed as he sank to the floor his face began to blister like the door and his corpse rattle like the handle he was inert stuff already as fit for this indignity as wood or steel somewhere to the east his soul joined the wounded highway on its route to the intersection where a moment previously he had died mary florescu knew she was alone above her the marvellous boy her beautiful cheating child was writhing and screeching as the dead set their vengeful hands on his fresh skin she knew their intention she could see it in their eyes there was nothing new about it every history had this particular torment in its tradition he was to be used to record their testaments he was to be their page their book the vessel for their autobiographies a book of blood a book made of blood a book written in blood she thought of the grimoires that had been made of dead human skin shed seen them touched them she thought of the tattooes shed seen freak show exhibits some of them others just shirtless labourers in the street with a message to their mothers pricked across their backs it was not unknown to write a book of blood but on such skin on such gleaming skin oh god that was the crime he screamed as the torturing needles of broken jugglass skipped against his flesh ploughing it up she felt his agonies as if they had been hers and they were not so terrible yet he screamed and fought and poured obscenities out at his attackers they took no notice they swarmed around him deaf to any plea or prayer and worked on him with all the enthusiasm of creatures forced into silence for too long mary listened as his voice wearied with its complaints and she fought against the weight of fear in her limbs somehow she felt she must get up to the room it didnt matter what was beyond the door or on the stairs he needed her and that was enough she stood up and felt her hair swirl up from her head flailing like the snake hair of the gorgon medusa reality swam there was scarcely a floor to be seen beneath her the boards of the house were ghostwood and beyond them a seething dark raged and yawned at her she looked to the door feeling all the time a lethargy that was so hard to fight off clearly they didnt want her up there maybe she thought they even fear me a little the idea gave her resolution why else were they bothering to intimidate her unless her very presence having once opened this hole in the world was now a threat to them the blistered door was open beyond it the reality of the house had succumbed completely to the howling chaos of the highway she stepped through concentrating on the way her feet still touched solid floor even though her eyes could no longer see it the sky above her was prussianblue the highway was wide and windy the dead pressed on every side she fought through them as through a crowd of living people while their gawping idiot faces looked at her and hated her invasion the please was gone now she said nothing just gritted her teeth and narrowed her eyes against the highway kicking her feet forward to find the reality of the stairs that she knew were there she tripped as she touched them and a howl went up from the crowd she couldnt tell if they were laughing at her clumsiness or sounding a warning at how far she had got first step second step third step though she was torn at from every side she was winning against the crowd ahead she could see through the door of the room to where her little liar was sprawled surrounded by his attackers his briefs were around his ankles the scene looked like a kind of rape he screamed no longer but his eyes were wild with terror and pain at least he was still alive the natural resilience of his young mind had half accepted the spectacle that had opened in front of him suddenly his head jerked around and he looked straight through the door at her in this extremity he had dredged up a true talent a skill that was a fraction of marys but enough to make contact with her their eyes met in a sea of blue darkness surrounded on every side with a civilization they neither knew nor understood their living hearts met and married im sorry he said silently it was infinitely pitiful im sorry im sorry he looked away his gaze wrenched from hers she was certain she must be almost at the top of the stairs her feet still treading air as far as her eyes could tell the faces of the travellers above below and on every side of her but she could see very faintly the outline of the door and the boards and beams of the room where simon lay he was one mass of blood now from head to foot she could see the marks the hieroglyphics of agony on every inch of his torso his face his limbs one moment he seemed to flash into a kind of focus and she could see him in the empty room with the sun through the window and the shattered jug at his side then her concentration would falter and instead shed see the invisible world made visible and hed be hanging in the air while they wrote on him from every side plucking out the hair on his head and body to clear the page writing in his armpits writing on his eyelids writing on his genitals in the crease of his buttocks on the soles of his feet only the wounds were in common between the two sights whether she saw him beset with authors or alone in the room he was bleeding and bleeding she had reached the door now her trembling hand stretched to touch the solid reality of the handle but even with all the concentration she could muster it would not come clear there was barely a ghostimage for her to focus on though it was sufficient she grasped the handle turned it and flung the door of the writing room open he was there in front of her no more than two or three yards of possessed air separated them their eyes met again and an eloquent look common to the living and the dead worlds passed between them there was compassion in that look and love the fictions fell away the lies were dust in place of the boys manipulative smiles was a true sweetness answered in her face and the dead fearful of this look turned their heads away their faces tightened as though the skin was being stretched over the bone their flesh darkening to a bruise their voices becoming wistful with the anticipation of defeat she reached to touch him no longer having to fight against the hordes of the dead they were falling away from their quarry on every side like dying flies dropping from a window she touched him lightly on the face the touch was a benediction tears filled his eyes and ran down his scarified cheek mingling with the blood the dead had no voices now nor even mouths they were lost along the highway their malice dammed plane by plane the room began to reestablish itself the floorboards became visible under his sobbing body every nail every stained plank the windows came clearly into view and outside the twilight street was echoing with the clamour of children the highway had disappeared from living human sight entirely its travellers had turned their faces to the dark and gone away into oblivion leaving only their signs and their talismans in the concrete world on the middle landing of number the smoking blistered body of reg fuller was casually trodden by the travellers feet as they passed over the intersection at length fullers own soul came by in the throng and glanced down at the flesh he had once occupied before the crowd pressed him on towards his judgement upstairs in the darkening room mary florescu knelt beside the mcneal boy and stroked his bloodplastered head she didnt want to leave the house for assistance until she was certain his tormentors would not come back there was no sound now but the whine of a jet finding its way through the stratosphere to morning even the boys breathing was hushed and regular no nimbus of light surrounded him every sense was in place sight sound touch touch she touched him now as she had never previously dared brushing her fingertips oh so lightly over his body running her fingers across the raised skin like a blind woman reading braille there were minute words on every millimetre of his body written in a multitude of hands even through the blood she could discern the meticulous way that the words had harrowed into him she could even read by the dimming light an occasional phrase it was proof beyond any doubt and she wished oh god how she wished that she had not come by it and yet after a lifetime of waiting here it was the revelation of life beyond flesh written in flesh itself the boy would survive that was clear already the blood was drying and the myriad wounds healing he was healthy and strong after all there would be no fundamental physical damage his beauty was gone forever of course from now on he would be an object of curiosity at best and at worst of repugnance and horror but she would protect him and he would learn in time how to know and trust her their hearts were inextricably tied together and after a time when the words on his body were scabs and scars she would read him she would trace with infinite love and patience the stories the dead had told on him the tale on his abdomen written in a fine cursive style the testimony in exquisite elegant print that covered his face and scalp the story on his back and on his shin on his hands she would read them all report them all every last syllable that glistened and seeped beneath her adoring fingers so that the world would know the stories that the dead tell he was a book of blood and she his sole translator as darkness fell she left off her vigil and led him naked into the balmy night here then are the stories written on the book of blood read if it pleases you and learn they are a map of that dark highway that leads out of life towards unknown destinations few will have to take it most will go peacefully along lamplit streets ushered out of living with prayers and caresses but for a few a chosen few the horrors will come skipping to fetch them off to the highway of the damned so read read and learn its best to be prepared for the worst after all and wise to learn to walk before breath runs out the midnight meat train leon kaufman was no longer new to the city the palace of delights hed always called it in the days of his innocence but that was when hed lived in atlanta and new york was still a kind of promised land where anything and everything was possible now kaufman had lived three and a half months in his dreamcity and the palace of delights seemed less than delightful was it really only a season since he stepped out of port authority bus station and looked up nd street towards the broadway intersection so short a time to lose so many treasured illusions he was embarrassed now even to think of his naivety it made him wince to remember how he had stood and announced aloud new york i love you love never it had been at best an infatuation and now after only three months living with his object of adoration spending his days and nights in her presence she had lost her aura of perfection new york was just a city he had seen her wake in the morning like a slut and pick murdered men from between her teeth and suicides from the tangles of her hair he had seen her late at night her dirty back streets shamelessly courting depravity he had watched her in the hot afternoon sluggish and ugly indifferent to the atrocities that were being committed every hour in her throttled passages it was no palace of delights it bred death not pleasure everyone he met had brushed with violence it was a fact of life it was almost chic to have known someone who had died a violent death it was proof of living in that city but kaufman had loved new york from afar for almost twenty years hed planned his love affair for most of his adult life it was not easy therefore to shake the passion off as though he had never felt it there were still times very early before the copsirens began or at twilight when manhattan was still a miracle for those moments and for the sake of his dreams he still gave her the benefit of the doubt even when her behaviour was less than ladylike she didnt make such forgiveness easy in the few months that kaufman had lived in new york her streets had been awash with spilt blood in fact it was not so much the streets themselves but the tunnels beneath those streets subway slaughter was the catchphrase of the month only the previous week another three killings had been reported the bodies had been discovered in one of the subway cars on the avenue of the americas hacked open and partially disembowelled as though an efficient abattoir operative had been interrupted in his work the killings were so thoroughly professional that the police were interviewing every man on their records who had some past connection with the butchery trade the meatpackaging plants on the waterfront were being watched the slaughterhouses scoured for clues a swift arrest was promised though none was made this recent trio of corpses was not the first to be discovered in such a state the very day that kaufman had arrived a story had broken in the times that was still the talk of every morbid secretary in the office the story went that a german visitor lost in the subway system late at night had come across a body in a train the victim was a wellbuilt attractive thirtyyearold woman from brooklyn she had been completely stripped every shred of clothing every article of jewellery even the studs in her ears more bizarre than the stripping was the neat and systematic way in which the clothes had been folded and placed in individual plastic bags on the seat beside the corpse this was no irrational slasher at work this was a highlyorganized mind a lunatic with a strong sense of tidiness further and yet more bizarre than the careful stripping of the corpse was the outrage that had then been perpetrated upon it the reports claimed though the police department failed to confirm this that the body had been meticulously shaved every hair had been removed from the head from the groin from beneath the arms all cut and scorched back to the flesh even the eyebrows and eyelashes had been plucked out finally this all too naked slab had been hung by the feet from one of the holding handles set in the roof of the car and a black plastic bucket lined with a black plastic bag had been placed beneath the corpse to catch the steady fall of blood from its wounds in that state stripped shaved suspended and practically bled white the body of loretta dyer had been found it was disgusting it was meticulous and it was deeply confusing there had been no rape nor any sign of torture the woman had been swiftly and efficiently dispatched as though she was a piece of meat and the butcher was still loose the city fathers in their wisdom declared a complete closedown on press reports of the slaughter it was said that the man who had found the body was in protective custody in new jersey out of sight of enquiring journalists but the coverup had failed some greedy cop had leaked the salient details to a reporter from the times everyone in new york now knew the horrible story of the slaughters it was a topic of conversation in every deli and bar and of course on the subway but loretta dyer was only the first now three more bodies had been found in identical circumstances though the work had clearly been interrupted on this occasion not all the bodies had been shaved and the jugulars had not been severed to bleed them there was another more significant difference in the discovery it was not a tourist who had stumbled on the sight it was a reporter from the new york times kaufman surveyed the report that sprawled across the front page of the newspaper he had no prurient interest in the story unlike his elbow mate along the counter of the deli all he felt was a mild disgust that made him push his plate of overcooked eggs aside it was simply further proof of his citys decadence he could take no pleasure in her sickness nevertheless being human he could not entirely ignore the gory details on the page in front of him the article was unsensationally written but the simple clarity of the style made the subject seem more appalling he couldnt help wondering too about the man behind the atrocities was there one psychotic loose or several each inspired to copy the original murder perhaps this was only the beginning of the horror maybe more murders would follow until at last the murderer in his exhilaration or exhaustion would step beyond caution and be taken until then the city kaufmans adored city would live in a state somewhere between hysteria and ecstasy at his elbow a bearded man knocked over kaufmans coffee shit he said kaufman shifted on his stool to avoid the dribble of coffee running off the counter shit the man said again no harm done said kaufman he looked at the man with a slightly disdainful expression on his face the clumsy bastard was attempting to soak up the coffee with a napkin which was turning to mush as he did so kaufman found himself wondering if this oaf with his florid cheeks and his uncultivated beard was capable of murder was there any sign on that overfed face any clue in the shape of his head or the turn of his small eyes that gave his true nature away the man spoke wannanother kaufman shook his head coffee regular dark the oaf said to the girl behind the counter she looked up from cleaning the grill of cold fat huh coffee you deaf the man grinned at kaufman deaf he said kaufman noticed he had three teeth missing from his lower jaw looks bad huh he said what did he mean the coffee the absence of his teeth three people like that carved up kaufman nodded makes you think he said sure i mean its a coverup isnt it they know who did it this conversations ridiculous thought kaufman he took off his spectacles and pocketed them the bearded face was no longer in focus that was some improvement at least bastards he said fucking bastards all of them ill lay you anything its a coverup of what they got the evidence theyre just keeping us in the fucking dark theres something out there thats not human kaufman understood it was a conspiracy theory the oaf was trotting out hed heard them so often a panacea see they do all this cloning stuff and it gets out of hand they could be growing fucking monsters for all we know theres something down there they wont tell us about coverup like i say lay you anything kaufman found the mans certainty attractive monsters on the prowl six heads a dozen eyes why not he knew why not because that excused his city that let her off the hook and kaufman believed in his heart that the monsters to be found in the tunnels were perfectly human the bearded man threw his money on the counter and got up sliding his fat bottom off the stained plastic stool probably a fucking cop he said as his parting shot tried to make a fucking hero made a fucking monster instead he grinned grotesquely lay you anything he continued and lumbered out without another word kaufman slowly exhaled through his nose feeling the tension in his body abate he hated that sort of confrontation it made him feel tonguetied and ineffectual come to think of it he hated that kind of man the opinionated brute that new york bred so well it was coming up to six when mahogany woke the morning rain had turned into a light drizzle by twilight the air was about as clearsmelling as it ever got in manhattan he stretched on his bed threw off the dirty blanket and got up for work in the bathroom the rain was dripping on the box of the airconditioner filling the apartment with a rhythmical slapping sound mahogany turned on the television to cover the noise uninterested in anything it had to offer he went to the window the street six floors below was thick with traffic and people after a hard days work new york was on its way home to play to make love people were streaming out of their offices and into their automobiles some would be testy after a days sweaty labour in a badlyaired office others benign as sheep would be wandering home down the avenues ushered along by a ceaseless current of bodies still others would even now be cramming on to the subway blind to the graffiti on every wall deaf to the babble of their own voices and to the cold thunder of the tunnels it pleased mahogany to think of that he was after all not one of the common herd he could stand at his window and look down on a thousand heads below him and know he was a chosen man he had deadlines to meet of course like the people in the street but his work was not their senseless labour it was more like a sacred duty he needed to live and sleep and shit like them too but it was not financial necessity that drove him but the demands of history he was in a great tradition that stretched further back than america he was a nightstalker like jack the ripper like gilles de rais a living embodiment of death a wraith with a human face he was a haunter of sleep and an awakener of terrors the people below him could not know his face nor would care to look twice at him but his stare caught them and weighed them up selecting only the ripest from the passing parade choosing only the healthy and the young to fall under his sanctified knife sometimes mahogany longed to announce his identity to the world but he had responsibilities and they bore on him heavily he couldnt expect fame his was a secret life and it was merely pride that longed for recognition after all he thought does the beef salute the butcher as it throbs to its knees all in all he was content to be part of that great tradition was enough would always have to remain enough recently however there had been discoveries they werent his fault of course nobody could possibly blame him but it was a bad time life was not as easy as it had been ten years ago he was that much older of course and that made the job more exhausting and more and more the obligations weighed on his shoulders he was a chosen man and that was a difficult privilege to live with he wondered now and then if it wasnt time to think about training a younger man for his duties there would need to be consultations with the fathers but sooner or later a replacement would have to be found and it would be he felt a criminal waste of his experience not to take on an apprentice there were so many felicities he could pass on the tricks of his extraordinary trade the best way to stalk to cut to strip to bleed the best meat for the purpose the simplest way to dispose of the remains so much detail so much accumulated expertise mahogany wandered into the bathroom and turned on the shower as he stepped in he looked down at his body the small paunch the greying hairs on his sagging chest the scars and pimples that littered his pale skin he was getting old still tonight like every other night he had a job to do kaufman hurried back into the lobby with his sandwich turning down his collar and brushing rain off his hair the clock above the elevator read sevensixteen he would work through until ten no later the elevator took him up to the twelfth floor and to the pappas offices he traipsed unhappily through the maze of empty desks and hooded machines to his little territory which was still illuminated the women who cleaned the offices were chatting down the corridor otherwise the place was lifeless he took off his coat shook the rain off it as best he could and hung it up then he sat down in front of the piles of orders he had been tussling with for the best part of three days and began work it would only take one more nights labour he felt sure to break the back of the job and he found it easier to concentrate without the incessant clatter of typists and typewriters on every side he unwrapped his ham on wholewheat with extra mayonnaise and settled in for the evening it was nine now mahogany was dressed for the nightshift he had his usual sober suit on with his brown tie neatly knotted his silver cufflinks placed in the sleeves of his immaculately pressed shirt his thinning hair gleaming with oil his nails snipped and polished his face flushed with cologne his bag was packed the towels the instruments his chainmail apron he checked his appearance in the mirror he could he thought still be taken for a man of fortyfive fifty at the outside as he surveyed his face he reminded himself of his duty above all he must be careful there would be eyes on him every step of the way watching his performance tonight and judging it he must walk out like an innocent arousing no suspicion if they only knew he thought the people who walked ran and skipped past him on the streets who collided with him without apology who met his gaze with contempt who smiled at his bulk looking uneasy in his illfitting suit if only they knew what he did what he was and what he carried caution he said to himself and turned off the light the apartment was dark he went to the door and opened it used to walking in blackness happy in it the rain clouds had cleared entirely mahogany made his way down amsterdam towards the subway at th street tonight hed take the avenue of the americas again his favourite line and often the most productive down the subway steps token in hand through the automatic gates the smell of the tunnels was in his nostrils now not the smell of the deep tunnels of course they had a scent all of their own but there was reassurance even in the stale electric air of this shallow line the regurgitated breath of a million travellers circulated in this warren mingling with the breath of creatures far older things with voices soft like clay whose appetites were abominable how he loved it the scent the dark the thunder he stood on the platform and scanned his fellowtravellers critically there were one or two bodies he contemplated following but there was so much dross amongst them so few worth the chase the physically wasted the obese the ill the weary bodies destroyed by excess and by indifference as a professional it sickened him though he understood the weakness that spoiled the best of men he lingered in the station for over an hour wandering between platforms while the trains came and went came and went and the people with them there was so little of quality around it was dispiriting it seemed he had to wait longer and longer every day to find flesh worthy of use it was now almost half past ten and he had not seen a single creature who was really ideal for slaughter no matter he told himself there was time yet very soon the theatre crowd would be emerging they were always good for a sturdy body or two the wellfed intelligentsia clutching their ticketstubs and opining on the diversions of art oh yes thered be something there if not and there were nights when it seemed he would never find something suitable hed have to ride downtown and corner a couple of lovers out late or find an athlete or two fresh from one of the gyms they were always sure to offer good material except that with such healthy specimens there was always the risk of resistance he remembered catching two black bucks a year ago or more with maybe forty years between them father and son perhaps theyd resisted with knives and hed been hospitalised for six weeks it had been a close fought encounter and one that had set him doubting his skills worse it had made him wonder what his masters would have done with him had he suffered a fatal injury would he have been delivered to his family in new jersey and given a decent christian burial or would his carcass have been thrown into the dark for their own use the headline of the new york post discarded on the seat across from him caught mahoganys eye police allout to catch killer he couldnt resist a smile thoughts of failure weakness and death evaporated after all he was that man that killer and tonight the thought of capture was laughable after all wasnt his career sanctioned by the highest possible authorities no policeman could hold him no court pass judgement on him the very forces of law and order that made such a show of his pursuit served his masters no less than he he almost wished some twobit cop would catch him take him in triumph before the judge just to see the looks on their faces when the word came up from the dark that mahogany was a protected man above every law on the statute books it was now well after tenthirty the trickle of theatregoers had begun but there was nothing likely so far hed want to let the rush pass anyway just follow one or two choice pieces to the end of the line he bided his time like any wise hunter kaufman was not finished by eleven an hour after hed promised himself release but exasperation and ennui were making the job more difficult and the sheets of figures were beginning to blur in front of him at ten past eleven he threw down his pen and admitted defeat he rubbed his hot eyes with the cushions of his palms till his head filled with colours fuck it he said he never swore in company but once in a while to say fuck it to himself was a great consolation he made his way out of the office damp coat over his arm and headed for the elevator his limbs felt drugged and his eyes would scarcely stay open it was colder outside than he had anticipated and the air brought him out of his lethargy a little he walked towards the subway at th street catch an express to far rockaway home in an hour neither kaufman nor mahogany knew it but at th and broadway the police had arrested what they took to be the subway killer having trapped him in one of the uptown trains a small man of european extraction wielding a hammer and a saw had cornered a young woman in the second car and threatened to cut her in half in the name of jehovah whether he was capable of fulfilling his threat was doubtful as it was he didnt get the chance while the rest of the passengers looked on the intended victim landed a kick to the mans testicles he dropped the hammer she picked it up and broke his lower jaw and right cheekbone with it before the marines stepped in when the train halted at th the police were waiting to arrest the subway butcher they rushed the car in a horde yelling like banshees and scared as shit the butcher was lying in one corner of the car with his face in pieces they carted him away triumphant the woman after questioning went home with the marines it was to be a useful diversion though mahogany couldnt know it at the time it took the police the best part of the night to determine the identity of their prisoner chiefly because he couldnt do more than drool through his shattered jaw it wasnt until threethirty in the morning that one captain davis coming on duty recognized the man as a retired flower salesman from the bronx called hank vasarely hank it seemed was regularly arrested for threatening behaviour and indecent exposure all in the name of jehovah appearances deceived he was about as dangerous as the easter bunny this was not the subway slaughterer but by the time the cops had worked that out mahogany had been about his business a long while it was elevenfifteen when kaufman got on the express through to mott avenue he shared the car with two other travellers one was a middleaged black woman in a purple coat the other a pale acneridden adolescent who was staring at the kiss my white ass graffiti on the ceiling with spacedout eyes kaufman was in the first car he had a journey of thirtyfive minutes duration ahead of him he let his eyes slide closed reassured by the rhythmical rocking of the train it was a tedious journey and he was tired he didnt see mahoganys face either staring through the door between the cars looking through for some more meat at th street the black woman got out nobody got in kaufman opened his eyes briefly taking in the empty platform at th then shut them again the doors hissed closed he was drifting in that warm somewhere between awareness and sleep and there was a fluttering of nascent dreams in his head it was a good feeling the train was off again rattling down into the tunnels maybe at the back of his dozing mind kaufman halfregistered that the doors between the second and first cars had been slid open maybe he smelt the sudden gush of tunnelair and registered that the noise of wheels was momentarily louder but he chose to ignore it maybe he even heard the scuffle as mahogany subdued the youth with the spacedout stare but the sound was too distant and the promise of sleep was too tempting he drowsed on for some reason his dreams were of his mothers kitchen she was chopping turnips and smiling sweetly as she chopped he was only small in his dream and was looking up at her radiant face while she worked chop chop chop his eyes jerked open his mother vanished the car was empty and the youth was gone how long had he been dozing he hadnt remembered the train stopping at west th street he got up his head full of slumber and almost fell over as the train rocked violently it seemed to have gathered quite a substantial head of speed maybe the driver was keen to be home wrapped up in bed with his wife they were going at a fair lick in fact it was bloody terrifying there was a blind drawn down over the window between the cars which hadnt been down before as he remembered a little concern crept into kaufmans sober head suppose hed been sleeping a long while and the guard had overlooked him in the car perhaps theyd passed far rockaway and the train was now speeding on its way to wherever they took the trains for the night fuck it he said aloud should he go forward and ask the driver it was such a bloody idiot question to ask where am i at this time of night was he likely to get more than a stream of abuse by way of reply then the train began to slow a station yes a station the train emerged from the tunnel and into the dirty light of the station at west th street hed missed no stops so where had the boy gone hed either ignored the warning on the car wall forbidding transfer between the cars while in transit or else hed gone into the drivers cabin up front probably between the drivers legs even now kaufman thought his lip curling it wasnt unheard of this was the palace of delights after all and everyone had their right to a little love in the dark kaufman shrugged to himself what did he care where the boy had gone the doors closed nobody had boarded the train it shunted off from the station the lights flickering as it used a surge of power to pick up some speed again kaufman felt the desire for sleep come over him afresh but the sudden fear of being lost had pumped adrenalin into his system and his limbs were tingling with nervous energy his senses were sharpened too even over the clatter and the rumble of the wheels on the tracks he heard the sound of tearing cloth coming from the next car was someone tearing their shirt off he stood up grasping one of the straps for balance the window between the cars was completely curtained off but he stared at it frowning as though he might suddenly discover xray vision the car rocked and rolled it was really travelling again another ripping sound was it rape with no more than a mild voyeuristic urge he moved down the seesawing car towards the intersecting door hoping there might be a chink in the curtain his eyes were still fixed on the window and he failed to notice the splatters of blood he was treading in until his heel slipped he looked down his stomach almost saw the blood before his brain and the ham on wholewheat was halfway up his gullet catching in the back of his throat blood he took several large gulps of stale air and looked away back at the window his head was saying blood nothing would make the word go away there was no more than a yard or two between him and the door now he had to look there was blood on his shoe and a thin trail to the next car but he still had to look he had to he took two more steps to the door and scanned the curtain looking for a flaw in the blind a pulled thread in the weave would be sufficient there was a tiny hole he glued his eye to it his mind refused to accept what his eyes were seeing beyond the door it rejected the spectacle as preposterous as a dreamed sight his reason said it couldnt be real but his flesh knew it was his body became rigid with terror his eyes unblinking could not close off the appalling scene through the curtain he stayed at the door while the train rattled on while his blood drained from his extremities and his brain reeled from lack of oxygen bright spots of light flashed in front of his vision blotting out the atrocity then he fainted he was unconscious when the train reached jay street he was deaf to the drivers announcement that all travellers beyond that station would have to change trains had he heard this he would have questioned the sense of it no trains disgorged all their passengers at jay street the line ran to mott avenue via the aqueduct race track past jfk airport he would have asked what kind of train this could be except that he already knew the truth was hanging in the next car it was smiling contentedly to itself from behind a bloody chainmail apron this was the midnight meat train theres no accounting for time in a dead faint it could have been seconds or hours that passed before kaufmans eyes flickered open again and his mind focussed on his newfound situation he lay under one of the seats now sprawled along the vibrating wall of the car hidden from view fate was with him so far he thought somehow the rocking of the car must have jockeyed his unconscious body out of sight he thought of the horror in car two and swallowed back vomit he was alone wherever the guard was there was no way he could call for help and the driver was he dead at his controls was the train even now hurtling through an unknown tunnel a tunnel without a single station to identify it towards its destruction and if there was no crash to be killed in there was always the butcher still hacking away a doors thickness from where kaufman lay whichever way he turned the name on the door was death the noise was deafening especially lying on the floor kaufmans teeth were shaking in their sockets and his face felt numb with the vibration even his skull was aching gradually he felt strength seeping back into his exhausted limbs he cautiously stretched his fingers and clenched his fists to set the blood flowing there again and as the feeling returned so did the nausea he kept seeing the grisly brutality of the next car hed seen photographs of murder victims before of course but these were no common murders he was in the same train as the subway butcher the monster who strung his victims up by the feet from the straps hairless and naked how long would it be before the killer stepped through that door and claimed him he was sure that if the slaughterer didnt finish him expectation would he heard movement beyond the door instinct took over kaufman thrust himself further under the seat and tucked himself up into a tiny ball with his sickwhite face to the wall then he covered his head with his hands and closed his eyes as tightly as any child in terror of the bogeyman the door was slid open click whoosh a rush of air up from the rails it smelt stranger than any kaufman had smelt before and colder this was somehow primal air in his nostrils hostile and unfathomable air it made him shudder the door closed click the butcher was close kaufman knew it he could be standing no more than a matter of inches from where he lay was he even now looking down at kaufmans back even now bending knife in hand to scoop kaufman out of his hiding place like a snail hooked from its shell nothing happened he felt no breath on his neck his spine was not slit open there was simply a clatter of feet close to kaufmans head then that same sound receding kaufmans breath held in his lungs til they hurt was expelled in a rasp between his teeth mahogany was almost disappointed that the sleeping man had alighted at west th street he was hoping for one more job to do that night to keep him occupied while they descended but no the man had gone the potential victim hadnt looked that healthy anyway he thought to himself he was an anaemic jewish accountant probably the meat wouldnt have been of any quality mahogany walked the length of the car to the drivers cabin hed spend the rest of the journey there my christ thought kaufman hes going to kill the driver he heard the cabin door open then the voice of the butcher low and hoarse hi hi they knew each other all done all done kaufman was shocked by the banality of the exchange all done what did that mean all done he missed the next few words as the train hit a particularly noisy section of track kaufman could resist looking no longer warily he uncurled himself and glanced over his shoulder down the length of the car all he could see was the butchers legs and the bottom of the open cabin door damn he wanted to see the monsters face again there was laughter now kaufman calculated the risks of his situation the mathematics of panic if he remained where he was sooner or later the butcher would glance down at him and hed be mincemeat on the other hand if he were to move from his hiding place he would risk being seen and pursued which was worse stasis and meeting his death trapped in a hole or making a break for it and confronting his maker in the middle of the car kaufman surprised himself with his mettle hed move infinitesimally slowly he crawled out from under the seat watching the butchers back every minute as he did so once out he began to crawl towards the door each step he took was a torment but the butcher seemed far too engrossed in his conversation to turn round kaufman had reached the door he began to stand up trying all the while to prepare himself for the sight he would meet in car two the handle was grasped and he slid the door open the noise of the rails increased and a wave of dank air stinking of nothing on earth came up at him surely the butcher must hear or smell surely he must turn but no kaufman skinned his way through the slit he had opened and so through into the bloody chamber beyond relief made him careless he failed to latch the door properly behind him and it began to slide open with the buffeting of the train mahogany put his head out of the cabin and stared down the car towards the door what the fucks that said the driver didnt close the door properly thats all kaufman heard the butcher walking towards the door he crouched a ball of consternation against the intersecting wall suddenly aware of how full his bowels were the door was pulled closed from the other side and the footsteps receded again safe for another breath at least kaufman opened his eyes steeling himself for the slaughterpen in front of him there was no avoiding it it filled every one of his senses the smell of opened entrails the sight of the bodies the feel of fluid on the floor under his fingers the sound of the straps creaking beneath the weight of the corpses even the air tasting salty with blood he was with death absolutely in that cubbyhole hurtling through the dark but there was no nausea now there was no feeling left but a casual revulsion he even found himself peering at the bodies with some curiosity the carcass closest to him was the remains of the pimply youth hed seen in car one the body hung upsidedown swinging back and forth to the rhythm of the train in unison with its three fellows an obscene dance macabre its arms dangled loosely from the shoulder joints into which gashes an inch or two deep had been made so the bodies would hang more neatly every part of the dead kids anatomy was swaying hypnotically the tongue hanging from the open mouth the head lolling on its slit neck even the youths penis flapped from side to side on his plucked groin the head wound and the open jugular still pulsed blood into a black bucket there was an elegance about the whole sight the sign of a job welldone beyond that body were the strungup corpses of two young white women and a darker skinned male kaufman turned his head on one side to look at their faces they were quite blank one of the girls was a beauty he decided the male had been puerto rican all were shorn of their head and body hair in fact the air was still pungent with the smell of the shearing kaufman slid up the wall out of the crouching position and as he did so one of the womens bodies turned around presenting a dorsal view he was not prepared for this last horror the meat of her back had been entirely cleft open from neck to buttock and the muscle had been peeled back to expose the glistening vertebrae it was the final triumph of the butchers craft here they hung these shaved bled slit slabs of humanity opened up like fish and ripe for devouring kaufman almost smiled at the perfection of its horror he felt an offer of insanity tickling the base of his skull tempting him into oblivion promising a blank indifference to the world he began to shake uncontrollably he felt his vocal cords trying to form a scream it was intolerable and yet to scream was to become in a short while like the creatures in front of him fuck it he said more loudly than hed intended then pushing himself off from the wall he began to walk down the car between the swaying corpses observing the neat piles of clothes and belongings that sat on the seats beside their owners under his feet the floor was sticky with drying bile even with his eyes closed to cracks he could see the blood in the buckets too clearly it was thick and heady flecks of grit turning in it he was past the youth now and he could see the door into car three ahead all he had to do was run this gauntlet of atrocities he urged himself on trying to ignore the horrors and concentrate on the door that would lead him back into sanity he was past the first woman a few more yards he said to himself ten steps at most less if he walked with confidence then the lights went out jesus christ he said the train lurched and kaufman lost his balance in the utter blackness he reached out for support and his flailing arms encompassed the body beside him before he could prevent himself he felt his hands sinking into the lukewarm flesh and his fingers grasping the open edge of muscle on the dead womans back his fingertips touching the bone of her spine his cheek was laid against the bald flesh of the thigh he screamed and even as he screamed the lights flickered back on and as they flickered back on and his scream died he heard the noise of the butchers feet approaching down the length of car one towards the intervening door he let go of the body he was embracing his face was smeared with blood from her leg he could feel it on his cheek like war paint the scream had cleared kaufmans head and he suddenly felt released into a kind of strength there would be no pursuit down the train he knew that there would be no cowardice not now this was going to be a primitive confrontation two human beings face to face and there would be no trick none that he couldnt contemplate using to bring his enemy down this was a matter of survival pure and simple the doorhandle rattled kaufman looked around for a weapon his eye steady and calculating his gaze fell on the pile of clothes beside the puerto ricans body there was a knife there lying amongst the rhinestone rings and the imitation gold chains a longbladed immaculately clean weapon probably the mans pride and joy reaching past the wellmuscled body kaufman plucked the knife from the heap it felt good in his hand in fact it felt positively thrilling the door was opening and the face of the slaughterer came into view kaufman looked down the abattoir at mahogany he was not terribly fearsome just another balding overweight man of fifty his face was heavy and his eyes deepset his mouth was rather small and delicately lipped in fact he had a womans mouth mahogany could not understand where this intruder had appeared from but he was aware that it was another oversight another sign of increasing incompetence he must dispatch this ragged creature immediately after all they could not be more than a mile or two from the end of the line he must cut the little man down and have him hanging up by his heels before they reached their destination he moved into car two you were asleep he said recognizing kaufman i saw you kaufman said nothing you should have left the train what were you trying to do hide from me kaufman still kept his silence mahogany grasped the hand of the cleaver hanging from his wellused leather belt it was dirty with blood as was his chainmail apron his hammer and his saw as it is he said ill have to do away with you kaufman raised the knife it looked a little small beside the butchers paraphernalia fuck it he said mahogany grinned at the little mans pretensions to defence you shouldnt have seen this its not for the likes of you he said taking another step towards kaufman its secret oh so hes the divinelyinspired type is he thought kaufman that explains something fuck it he said again the butcher frowned he didnt like the little mans indifference to his work to his reputation we all have to die some time he said you should be well pleased youre not going to be burnt up like most of them i can use you to feed the fathers kaufmans only response was a grin he was past being terrorized by this gross shambling hulk the butcher unhooked the cleaver from his belt and brandished it a dirty little jew like you he said should be thankful to be useful at all meats the best you can aspire to without warning the butcher swung the cleaver divided the air at some speed but kaufman stepped back the cleaver sliced his coatarm and buried itself in the puerto ricans shank the impact halfsevered the leg and the weight of the body opened the gash even further the exposed meat of the thigh was like prime steak succulent and appetizing the butcher started to drag the cleaver out of the wound and in that moment kaufman sprang the knife sped towards mahoganys eye but an error of judgement buried it instead in his neck it transfixed the column and appeared in a little gout of gore on the other side straight through in one stroke straight through mahogany felt the blade in his neck as a choking sensation almost as though he had caught a chicken bone in his throat he made a ridiculous halfhearted coughing sound blood issued from his lips painting them like lipstick on his womans mouth the cleaver clattered to the floor kaufman pulled out the knife the two wounds spouted little arcs of blood mahogany collapsed to his knees staring at the knife that had killed him the little man was watching him quite passively he was saying something but mahoganys ears were deaf to the remarks as though he was under water mahogany suddenly went blind he knew with a nostalgia for his senses that he would not see or hear again this was death it was on him for certain his hands still felt the weave of his trousers however and the hot splashes on his skin his life seemed to totter on its tiptoes while his fingers grasped at one last sense then his body collapsed and his hands and his life and his sacred duty folded up under a weight of grey flesh the butcher was dead kaufman dragged gulps of stale air into his lungs and grabbed one of the straps to steady his reeling body tears blotted out the shambles he stood in a time passed he didnt know how long he was lost in a dream of victory then the train began to slow he felt and heard the brakes being applied the hanging bodies lurched forward as the careering train slowed its wheels squealing on rails that were sweating slime curiosity overtook kaufman would the train shunt into the butchers underground slaughterhouse decorated with the meats he had gathered through his career and the laughing driver so indifferent to the massacre what would he do once the train had stopped whatever happened now was academic he could face anything at all watch and see the tannoy crackled the voice of the driver were here man better take your place eh take your place what did that mean the train had slowed to a snails pace outside the windows everything was as dark as ever the lights flickered then went out this time they didnt come back on kaufman was left in total darkness well be out in halfanhour the tannoy announced so like any station report the train had come to a stop the sound of its wheels on the tracks the rush of its passage which kaufman had grown so used to were suddenly absent all he could hear was the hum of the tannoy he could still see nothing at all then a hiss the doors were opening a smell entered the car a smell so caustic that kaufman clapped his hand over his face to shut it out he stood in silence hand to mouth for what seemed a lifetime see no evil hear no evil speak no evil then there was a flicker of light outside the window it threw the door frame into silhouette and it grew stronger by degrees soon there was sufficient light in the car for kaufman to see the crumpled body of the butcher at his feet and the sallow sides of meat hanging on every side of him there was a whisper too from the dark outside the train a gathering of tiny noises like the voices of beetles in the tunnel shuffling towards the train were human beings kaufman could see their outlines now some of them carried torches which burned with a dead brown light the noise was perhaps their feet on the damp earth or perhaps their tongues clicking or both kaufman wasnt as naive as hed been an hour before could there be any doubt as to the intention these things had coming out of the blackness towards the train the butcher had slaughtered the men and women as meat for these cannibals they were coming like diners at the dinnergong to eat in this restaurant car kaufman bent down and picked up the cleaver the butcher had dropped the noise of the creatures approach was louder every moment he backed down the car away from the open doors only to find that the doors behind him were also open and there was the whisper of approach there too he shrank back against one of the seats and was about to take refuge under them when a hand thin and frail to the point of transparency appeared around the door he could not look away not that terror froze him as it had at the window he simply wanted to watch the creature stepped into the car the torches behind it threw its face into shadow but its outline could be clearly seen there was nothing very remarkable about it it had two arms and two legs as he did its head was not abnormally shaped the body was small and the effort of climbing into the train made its breath coarse it seemed more geriatric than psychotic generations of fictional maneaters had not prepared him for its distressing vulnerability behind it similar creatures were appearing out of the darkness shuffling into the train in fact they were coming in at every door kaufman was trapped he weighed the cleaver in his hands getting the balance of it ready for the battle with these antique monsters a torch had been brought into the car and it illuminated the faces of the leaders they were completely bald the tired flesh of their faces was pulled tight over their skulls so that it shone with tension there were stains of decay and disease on their skin and in places the muscle had withered to a black pus through which the bone of cheek or temple was showing some of them were naked as babies their pulpy syphilitic bodies scarcely sexed what had been breasts were leathery bags hanging off the torso the genitalia shrunken away worse sights than the naked amongst them were those who wore a veil of clothes it soon dawned on kaufman that the rotting fabric slung around their shoulders or knotted about their midriffs was made of human skins not one but a dozen or more heaped haphazardly on top of each other like pathetic trophies the leaders of this grotesque mealline had reached the bodies now and the gracile hands were laid upon the shanks of meat and were running up and down the shaved flesh in a manner that suggested sensual pleasure tongues were dancing out of mouths flecks of spittle landing on the meat the eyes of the monsters were flickering back and forth with hunger and excitement eventually one of them saw kaufman its eyes stopped flickering for a moment and fixed on him a look of enquiry came over the face making a parody of puzzlement you it said the voice was as wasted as the lips it came from kaufman raised the cleaver a little calculating his chances there were perhaps thirty of them in the car and many more outside but they looked so weak and they had no weapons but their skin and bones the monster spoke again its voice quite well modulated when it found itself the piping of a oncecultured oncecharming man you came after the other yes it glanced down at the body of mahogany it had clearly taken in the situation very quickly old anyway it said its watery eyes back on kaufman studying him with care fuck you said kaufman the creature attempted a wry smile but it had almost forgotten the technique and the result was a grimace which exposed a mouthful of teeth that had been systematically filed into points you must now do this for us it said through the bestial grin we cannot survive without food the hand patted the rump of human flesh kaufman had no reply to the idea he just stared in disgust as the fingernails slid between the cleft in the buttocks feeling the swell of tender muscle it disgusts us no less than you said the creature but were bound to eat this meat or we die god knows i have no appetite for it the thing was drooling nevertheless kaufman found his voice it was small more with a confusion of feelings than with fear what are you he remembered the bearded man in the deli are you accidents of some kind we are the city fathers the thing said and mothers and daughters and sons the builders the lawmakers we made this city new york said kaufman the palace of delights before you were born before anyone living was born as it spoke the creatures fingernails were running up under the skin of the split body and were peeling the thin elastic layer off the luscious brawn behind kaufman the other creatures had begun to unhook the bodies from the straps their hands laid in that same delighting manner on the smooth breasts and flanks of flesh these too had begun skinning the meat you will bring us more the father said more meat for us the other one was weak kaufman stared in disbelief me he said feed you what do you think i am you must do it for us and for those older than us for those born before the city was thought of when america was a timberland and desert the fragile hand gestured out of the train kaufmans gaze followed the pointing finger into the gloom there was something else outside the train which hed failed to see before much bigger than anything human the pack of creatures parted to let kaufman through so that he could inspect more closely whatever it was that stood outside but his feet would not move go on said the father kaufman thought of the city hed loved were these really its ancients its philosophers its creators he had to believe it perhaps there were people on the surface bureaucrats politicians authorities of every kind who knew this horrible secret and whose lives were dedicated to preserving these abominations feeding them as savages feed lambs to their gods there was a horrible familiarity about this ritual it rang a bell not in kaufmans conscious mind but in his deeper older self his feet no longer obeying his mind but his instinct to worship moved he walked through the corridor of bodies and stepped out of the train the light of the torches scarcely began to illuminate the limitless darkness outside the air seemed solid it was so thick with the smell of ancient earth but kaufman smelt nothing his head bowed it was all he could do to prevent himself from fainting again it was there the precursor of man the original american whose homeland this was before passamaquoddy or cheyenne its eyes if it had eyes were on him his body shook his teeth chattered he could hear the noise of its anatomy ticking crackling sobbing it shifted a little in the dark the sound of its movement was awesome like a mountain sitting up kaufmans face was raised to it and without thinking about what he was doing or why he fell to his knees in the shit in front of the father of fathers every day of his life had been leading to this day every moment quickening to this incalculable moment of holy terror had there been sufficient light in that pit to see the whole perhaps his tepid heart would have burst as it was he felt it flutter in his chest as he saw what he saw it was a giant without head or limb without a feature that was analogous to human without an organ that made sense or senses if it was like anything it was like a shoal of fish a thousand snouts all moving in unison budding blossoming and withering rhythmically it was iridescent like mother of pearl but it was sometimes deeper than any colour kaufman knew or could put a name to that was all kaufman could see and it was more than he wanted to see there was much more in the darkness flickering and flapping but he could look no longer he turned away and as he did so a football was pitched out of the train and rolled to a halt in front of the father at least he thought it was a football until he peered more attentively at it and recognized it as a human head the head of the butcher the skin of the face had been peeled off in strips it glistened with blood as it lay in front of its lord kaufman looked away and walked back to the train every part of his body seemed to be weeping but his eyes they were too hot with the sight behind him they boiled his tears away inside the creatures had already set about their supper one he saw was plucking the blue sweet morsel of a womans eye out of the socket another had a hand in its mouth at kaufmans feet lay the butchers headless corpse still bleeding profusely from where its neck had been bitten through the little father who had spoken earlier stood in front of kaufman serve us it asked gently as you might ask a cow to follow you kaufman was staring at the cleaver the butchers symbol of office the creatures were leaving the car now dragging the halfeaten bodies after them as the torches were taken out of the car darkness was returning but before the lights had completely disappeared the father reached out and took hold of kaufmans face thrusting him round to look at himself in the filthy glass of the car window it was a thin reflection but kaufman could see quite well enough how changed he was whiter than any living man should be covered in grime and blood the fathers hand still gripped kaufmans face and its forefinger hooked into his mouth and down his gullet the nail scoring the back of his throat kaufman gagged on the intruder but had no will left to repel the attack serve said the creature in silence too late kaufman realized the intention of the fingers suddenly his tongue was seized tight and twisted on the root kaufman in shock dropped the cleaver he tried to scream but no sound came blood was in his throat he heard his flesh tearing and agonies convulsed him then the hand was out of his mouth and the scarlet spittlecovered fingers were in front of his face with his tongue held between thumb and forefinger kaufman was speechless serve said the father and stuffed the tongue into his own mouth chewing on it with evident satisfaction kaufman fell to his knees spewing up his sandwich the father was already shuffling away into the dark the rest of the ancients had disappeared into their warren for another night the tannoy crackled home said the driver the doors hissed closed and the sound of power surged through the train the lights flickered on then off again then on the train began to move kaufman lay on the floor tears pouring down his face tears of discomfiture and of resignation he would bleed to death he decided where he lay it wouldnt matter if he died it was a foul world anyway the driver woke him he opened his eyes the face that was looking down at him was black and not unfriendly it grinned kaufman tried to say something but his mouth was sealed up with dried blood he jerked his head around like a driveller trying to spit out a word nothing came but grunts he wasnt dead he hadnt bled to death the driver pulled him to his knees talking to him as though he were a threeyearold you got a job to do my man theyre very pleased with you the driver had licked his fingers and was rubbing kaufmans swollen lips trying to part them lots to learn before tomorrow night lots to learn lots to learn he led kaufman out of the train they were in no station he had ever seen before it was whitetiled and absolutely pristine a stationkeepers nirvana no graffiti disfigured the walls there were no tokenbooths but then there were no gates and no passengers either this was a line that provided only one service the meat train a morning shift of cleaners were already busy hosing the blood off the seats and the floor of the train somebody was stripping the butchers body in preparation for dispatch to new jersey all around kaufman people were at work a rain of dawn light was pouring through a grating in the roof of the station motes of dust hung in the beams turning over and over kaufman watched them entranced he hadnt seen such a beautiful thing since he was a child lovely dust over and over and over and over the driver had managed to separate kaufmans lips his mouth was too wounded for him to move it but at least he could breathe easily and the pain was already beginning to subside the driver smiled at him then turned to the rest of the workers in the station id like to introduce mahoganys replacement our new butcher he announced the workers looked at kaufman there was a certain deference in their faces which he found appealing kaufman looked up at the sunlight now falling all around him he jerked his head signifying that he wanted to go up into the open air the driver nodded and led him up a steep flight of steps and through an alleyway and so out on to the sidewalk it was a beautiful day the bright sky over new york was streaked with filaments of pale pink cloud and the air smelt of morning the streets and avenues were practically empty at a distance an occasional cab crossed an intersection its engine a whisper a runner sweated past on the other side of the street very soon these same deserted sidewalks would be thronged with people the city would go about its business in ignorance never knowing what it was built upon or what it owed its life to without hesitation kaufman fell to his knees and kissed the dirty concrete with his bloody lips silently swearing his eternal loyalty to its continuance the palace of delights received the adoration without comment the yattering and jack why the powers had sent it out from hell to stalk jack polo the yattering couldnt discover whenever he passed a tentative enquiry along the system to his master just asking the simple question what am i doing here it was answered with a swift rebuke for its curiosity none of its business came the reply its business was to do or die trying and after six months of pursuing polo the yattering was beginning to see extinction as an easy option this endless game of hide and seek was to nobodys benefit and to the yatterings immense frustration it feared ulcers it feared psychosomatic leprosy worst of all it feared losing its temper completely and killing the man outright in an uncontrollable fit of pique what was jack polo anyway a gherkin importer by the balls of leviticus he was simply a gherkin importer his life was worn out his family was dull his politics were simpleminded and his theology nonexistent the man was a noaccount one of natures blankest little numbers why bother with the likes of him this wasnt a faust a pactmaker a soulseller this one wouldnt look twice at the chance of divine inspiration hed sniff shrug and get on with his gherkin importing yet the yattering was bound to that house long night and longer day until he had the man a lunatic or as good as it was going to be a lengthy job if not interminable yes there were times when even psychosomatic leprosy would be bearable if it meant being invalided off this impossible mission for his part jack j polo continued to be the most unknowing of men he had always been that way indeed his history was littered with the victims of his naпvetй when his late lamented wife had cheated on him he was the last one to find out and the clues theyd left behind them a blind deaf and dumb man would have become suspicious not jack he pottered about his dull business and never noticed the tang of the adulterers cologne nor the abnormal regularity with which his wife changed the bedlinen he was no less disinterested in events when his younger daughter amanda confessed her lesbianism to him his response was a sigh and a puzzled look well as long as you dont get pregnant darling he replied and sauntered off into the garden blithe as ever what chance did a fury have with a man like that to a creature trained to put its meddling fingers into the wounds of the human psyche polo offered a surface so glacial so utterly without distinguishing marks as to deny malice any hold whatsoever events seemed to make no dent in his perfect indifference his lifes disasters seemed not to scar his mind at all when eventually he was confronted with the truth about his wifes infidelity he couldnt bring himself to be hurt or humiliated these things happen he said to himself backing out of the bathroom to let them finish what theyd started che sera sera che sera sera the man muttered that damn phrase with monotonous regularity he seemed to live by that philosophy of fatalism letting attacks on his manhood ambition and dignity slide off his ego like rainwater from his bald head the yattering had heard polos wife confess all to her husband and the scene had made it wince there was the distraught sinner begging to be accused bawled at struck even and instead of giving her the satisfaction of his hatred polo had just shrugged and let her say her piece without a word of interruption until she had no more to embosom shed left at length more out of frustration and sorrow than guilt the yattering had heard her tell the bathroom mirror how insulted she was at her husbands lack of righteous anger a little while after shed flung herself off the balcony of the roxy cinema her suicide was in some ways convenient for the fury with the wife gone and the daughters away from home it could plan for more elaborate tricks to unnerve its victim without ever having to concern itself with revealing its presence to creatures the powers had not marked for attack but the absence of the wife left the house empty during the days and that soon became a burden of boredom the yattering found scarcely supportable the hours from nine to five alone in the house often seemed endless it would mope and wander planning bizarre and impractical revenges upon the poloman pacing the rooms heartsick companioned only by the clicks and whirrs of the house as the radiators cooled or the refrigerator switched itself on and off the situation rapidly became so desperate that the arrival of the midday post became the highpoint of the day and an unshakeable melancholy would settle on the yattering if the postman had nothing to deliver and passed by to the next house when jack returned the games would begin in earnest the usual warmup routine it would meet jack at the door and prevent his key from turning in the lock the contest would go on for a minute or two until jack accidentally found the measure of the yatterings resistance and won the day once inside it would start all the lampshades swinging the man would usually ignore this performance however violent the motion perhaps he might shrug and murmur subsidence under his breath then inevitably che sera sera in the bathroom the yattering would have squeezed toothpaste around the toiletseat and have plugged up the showerhead with soggy toiletpaper it would even share the shower with jack hanging unseen from the rail that held up the shower curtain and murmuring obscene suggestions in his ear that was always successful the demons were taught at the academy the obscenities in the ear routine never failed to distress clients making them think they were conceiving of these pernicious acts themselves and driving them to selfdisgust then to selfrejection and finally to madness of course in a few cases the victims would be so inflamed by these whispered suggestions theyd go out on the streets and act upon them under such circumstances the victim would often be arrested and incarcerated prison would lead to further crimes and a slow dwindling of moral reserves and the victory was won by that route one way or another insanity would out except that for some reason this rule did not apply to polo he was imperturbable a tower of propriety indeed the way things were going the yattering would be the one to break it was tired so very tired endless days of tormenting the cat reading the funnies in yesterdays newspaper watching the game shows they drained the fury lately it had developed a passion for the woman who lived across the street from polo she was a young widow and seemed to spend most of her life parading around the house stark naked it was almost unbearable sometimes in the middle of a day when the postman failed to call watching the woman and knowing it could never cross the threshold of polos house this was the law the yattering was a minor demon and his soulcatching was strictly confined to the perimeters of his victims house to step outside was to relinquish all powers over the victim to put itself at the mercy of humanity all june all july and most of august it sweated in its prison and all through those bright hot months jack polo maintained complete indifference to the yatterings attacks it was deeply embarrassing and it was gradually destroying the demons selfconfidence seeing this bland victim survive every trial and trick attempted upon him the yattering wept the yattering screamed in a fit of uncontrollable anguish it boiled the water in the aquarium poaching the guppies polo heard nothing saw nothing at last in late september the yattering broke one of the first rules of its condition and appealed directly to its masters autumn is hells season and the demons of the higher dominations were feeling benign they condescended to speak to their creature what do you want asked beelzebub his voice blackening the air in the lounge this man the yattering began nervously yes this polo yes i am without issue upon him i cant get panic upon him i cant breed fear or even mild concern upon him i am sterile lord of the flies and i wish to be put out of my misery for a moment beelzebubs face formed in the mirror over the mantelpiece you want what beelzebub was part elephant part wasp the yattering was terrified i want to die you cannot die from this world just die from this world fade away be replaced you will not die but i cant break him the yattering shrieked tearful you must why because we tell you to beelzebub always used the royal we though unqualified to do so let me at least know why im in this house the yattering appealed what is he nothing hes nothing beelzebub found this rich he laughed buzzed trumpeted jack johnson polo is the child of a worshipper at the church of lost salvation he belongs to us but why should you want him hes so dull we want him because his soul was promised to us and his mother did not deliver it or herself come to that she cheated us she died in the arms of a priest and was safely escorted to the word that followed was anathema the lord of the flies could barely bring himself to pronounce it heaven said beelzebub with infinite loss in his voice heaven said the yattering not knowing quite what was meant by the word polo is to be hounded in the name of the old one and punished for his mothers crimes no torment is too profound for a family that has cheated us im tired the yattering pleaded daring to approach the mirror please i beg you claim this man said beelzebub or you will suffer in his place the figure in the mirror waved its black and yellow trunk and faded where is your pride said the masters voice as it shrivelled into distance pride yattering pride then he was gone in its frustration the yattering picked up the cat and threw it into the fire where it was rapidly cremated if only the law allowed such easy cruelty to be visited upon human flesh it thought if only if only then itd make polo suffer such torments but no the yattering knew the laws as well as the back of its hand they had been flayed on to its exposed cortex as a fledgling demon by its teachers and law one stated thou shalt not lay palm upon thy victims it had never been told why this law pertained but it did thou shalt not so the whole painful process continued day in day out and still the man showed no sign of yielding over the next few weeks the yattering killed two more cats that polo brought home to replace his treasured freddy the first of these poor victims was drowned in the toilet bowl one idle friday afternoon it was a pretty satisfaction to see the look of distaste register on polos face as he unzipped his fly and glanced down but any pleasure the yattering took in jacks discomfiture was cancelled out by the blithely efficient way in which the man dealt with the dead cat hoisting the bundle of soaking fur out of the pan wrapping it in a towel and burying it in the back garden with scarcely a murmur the third cat that polo brought home was wise to the invisible presence of the demon from the start there was indeed an entertaining week in midnovember when life for the yattering became almost interesting while it played cat and mouse with freddy the third freddy played the mouse cats not being especially bright animals the game was scarcely a great intellectual challenge but it made a change from the endless days of waiting haunting and failing at least the creature accepted the yatterings presence eventually however in a filthy mood the demon lost its temper with the cat it was sharpening its nails on the nylon carpet clawing and scratching at the pile for hours on end the noise put the demons metaphysical teeth on edge it looked at the cat once briefly and it flew apart as though it had swallowed a live grenade the effect was spectacular the results were gross catbrain catfur catgut everywhere polo got home that evening exhausted and stood in the doorway of the diningroom his face sickened surveying the carnage that had been freddy iii damn dogs he said damn damn dogs there was anger in his voice yes exulted the yattering anger the man was upset there was clear evidence of emotion on his face elated the demon raced through the house determined to capitalize on its victory it opened and slammed every door it smashed vases it set the lampshades swinging polo just cleaned up the cat the yattering threw itself downstairs tore up a pillow impersonated a thing with a limp and an appetite for human flesh in the attic and giggling polo just buried freddy iii beside the grave of freddy ii and the ashes of freddy i then he retired to bed without his pillow the demon was utterly stumped if the man could not raise more than a flicker of concern when his cat was exploded in the diningroom what chance had it got of ever breaking the bastard there was one last opportunity left it was approaching christs mass and jacks children would be coming home to the bosom of the family perhaps they could convince him that all was not well with the world perhaps they could get their fingernails under his flawless indifference and begin to break him down hoping against hope the yattering sat out the weeks to late december planning its attacks with all the imaginative malice it could muster meanwhile jacks life sauntered on he seemed to live apart from his experience living his life as an author might write a preposterous story never involving himself in the narrative too deeply in several significant ways however he showed his enthusiasm for the coming holiday he cleared his daughters rooms immaculately he made their beds up with sweetsmelling linen he cleaned every speck of cats blood out of the carpet he even set up a christmas tree in the lounge hung with iridescent balls tinsel and presents once in a while as he went about the preparations jack thought of the game he was playing and quietly calculated the odds against him in the days to come he would have to measure not only his own suffering but that of his daughters against the possible victory and always when he made these calculations the chance of victory seemed to outweigh the risks so he continued to write his life and waited snow came soft pats of it against the windows against the door children arrived to sing carols and he was generous to them it was possible for a brief time to believe in peace on earth late in the evening of the twentythird of december the daughters arrived in a flurry of cases and kisses the youngest amanda arrived home first from its vantage point on the landing the yattering viewed the young woman balefully she didnt look like ideal material in which to induce a breakdown in fact she looked dangerous gina followed an hour or two later a smoothlypolished woman of the world at twentyfour she looked every bit as intimidating as her sister they came into the house with their bustle and their laughter they rearranged the furniture they threw out the junkfood in the freezer they told each other how much they had missed each others company within the space of a few hours the drab house was repainted with light and fun and love it made the yattering sick whimpering it hid its head in the bedroom to block out the din of affection but the shockwaves enveloped it all it could do was sit and listen and refine its revenge jack was pleased to have his beauties home amanda so full of opinions and so strong like her mother gina more like his mother poised perceptive he was so happy in their presence he could have wept and here was he the proud father putting them both at such risk but what was the alternative if he had cancelled the christmas celebrations it would have looked highly suspicious it might even have spoiled his whole strategy waking the enemy to the trick that was being played no he must sit tight play dumb the way the enemy had come to expect him to be the time would come for action at am on christmas morning the yattering opened hostilities by throwing amanda out of bed a paltry performance at best but it had the intended effect sleepily rubbing her bruised head she climbed back into bed only to have the bed buck and shake and fling her off again like an unbroken colt the noise woke the rest of the house gina was first in her sisters room whats going on theres somebody under the bed what gina picked up a paperweight from the dresser and demanded the assailant come out the yattering invisible sat on the window seat and made obscene gestures at the women tying knots in its genitalia gina peered under the bed the yattering was clinging to the light fixture now persuading it to swing backwards and forwards making the room reel theres nothing there there is amanda knew oh yes she knew theres something here gina she said something in the room with us im sure of it no gina was absolute its empty amanda was searching behind the wardrobe when polo came in whats all the din theres something in the house daddy i was thrown out of bed jack looked at the crumpled sheets the dislodged mattress then at amanda this was the first test he must lie as casually as possible looks like youve been having nightmares beauty he said affecting an innocent smile there was something under the bed amanda insisted theres nobody here now but i felt it well ill check the rest of the house he offered without enthusiasm for the task you two stay here just in case as polo left the room the yattering rocked the light a little more subsidence said gina it was cold downstairs and polo could have done without padding around barefoot on the kitchen tiles but he was quietly satisfied that the battle had been joined in such a petty manner hed halffeared that the enemy would turn savage with such tender victims at hand but no hed judged the mind of the creature quite accurately it was one of the lower orders powerful but slow capable of being inveigled beyond the limits of its control carefully does it he told himself carefully does it he traipsed through the entire house dutifully opening cupboards and peering behind the furniture then returned to his daughters who were sitting at the top of the stairs amanda looked small and pale not the twentytwoyearold woman she was but a child again nothing doing he told her with a smile its christmas morning and all through the house gina finished the rhyme nothing is stirring not even a mouse not even a mouse beauty at that moment the yattering took its cue to fling a vase off the lounge mantelpiece even jack jumped shit he said he needed some sleep but quite clearly the yattering had no intention of letting them alone just yet che sera sera he murmured scooping up the pieces of the chinese vase and putting them in a piece of newspaper the house is sinking a little on the left side you know he said more loudly it has been for years subsidence said amanda with quiet certainty would not throw me out of my bed gina said nothing the options were limited the alternatives unattractive well maybe it was santa claus said polo attempting levity he parcelled up the pieces of the vase and wandered through into the kitchen certain that he was being shadowed every step of the way what else can it be he threw the question over his shoulder as he stuffed the newspaper into the waste bin the only other explanation here he became almost elated by his skimming so close to the truth the only other possible explanation is too preposterous for words it was an exquisite irony denying the existence of the invisible world in the full knowledge that even now it breathed vengefully down his neck you mean poltergeists said gina i mean anything that goes bang in the night but were grownup people arent we we dont believe in bogeymen no said gina flatly i dont but i dont believe the house is subsiding either well itll have to do for now said jack with nonchalant finality christmas starts here we dont want to spoil it talking about gremlins now do we they laughed together gremlins that surely bit deep to call the hellspawn a gremlin the yattering weak with frustration acid tears boiling on its intangible cheeks ground its teeth and kept its peace there would be time yet to beat that atheistic smile off jack polos smooth fat face time aplenty no halfmeasures from now on no subtlety it would be an all out attack let there be blood let there be agony theyd all break amanda was in the kitchen preparing christmas dinner when the yattering mounted its next attack through the house drifted the sound of kings college choir little town of bethlehem how still we see thee lie the presents had been opened the g and ts were being downed the house was one warm embrace from roof to cellar in the kitchen a sudden chill permeated the heat and the steam making amanda shiver she crossed to the window which was ajar to clear the air and closed it maybe she was catching something the yattering watched her back as she busied herself about the kitchen enjoying the domesticity for a day amanda felt the stare quite clearly she turned round nobody nothing she continued to wash the brussels sprouts cutting into one with a worm curled in the middle she drowned it the choir sang on in the lounge jack was laughing with gina about something then a noise a rattling at first followed by a beating of somebodys fists against a door amanda dropped the knife into the bowl of sprouts and turned from the sink following the sound it was getting louder all the time like something locked in one of the cupboards desperate to escape a cat caught in the box or a bird it was coming from the oven amandas stomach turned as she began to imagine the worst had she locked something in the oven when shed put in the turkey she called for her father as she snatched up the oven cloth and stepped towards the cooker which was rocking with the panic of its prisoner she had visions of a basted cat leaping out at her its fur burned off its flesh halfcooked jack was at the kitchen door theres something in the oven she said to him as though he needed telling the cooker was in a frenzy its thrashing contents had all but beaten off the door he took the oven cloth from her this is a new one he thought youre better than i judged you to be this is clever this is original gina was in the kitchen now whats cooking she quipped but the joke was lost as the cooker began to dance and the pans of boiling water were twitched off the burners on to the floor scalding water seared jacks leg he yelled stumbling back into gina before diving at the cooker with a yell that wouldnt have shamed a samurai the oven handle was slippery with heat and grease but he seized it and flung the door down a wave of steam and blistering heat rolled out of the oven smelling of succulent turkeyfat but the bird inside had apparently no intentions of being eaten it was flinging itself from side to side on the roasting tray tossing gouts of gravy in all directions its crisp brown wings pitifully flailed and flapped its legs beat a tattoo on the roof of the oven then it seemed to sense the open door its wings stretched themselves out to either side of its stuffed bulk and it half hopped half fell on to the oven door in a mockery of its living self headless oozing stuffing and onions it flopped around as though nobody had told the damn thing it was dead while the fat still bubbled on its baconstrewn back amanda screamed jack dived for the door as the bird lurched into the air blind but vengeful what it intended to do once it reached its three cowering victims was never discovered gina dragged amanda into the hallway with her father in hot pursuit and the door was slammed closed as the blind bird flung itself against the panelling beating on it with all its strength gravy seeped through the gap at the bottom of the door dark and fatty the door had no lock but jack reasoned that the bird was not capable of turning the handle as he backed away breathless he cursed his confidence the opposition had more up its sleeve than hed guessed amanda was leaning against the wall sobbing her face stained with splotches of turkey grease all she seemed able to do was deny what shed seen shaking her head and repeating the word no like a talisman against the ridiculous horror that was still throwing itself against the door jack escorted her through to the lounge the radio was still crooning carols which blotted out the din of the bird but their promises of goodwill seemed small comfort gina poured a hefty brandy for her sister and sat beside her on the sofa plying her with spirits and reassurance in about equal measure they made little impression on amanda what was that gina asked her father in a tone that demanded an answer i dont know what it was jack replied mass hysteria ginas displeasure was plain her father had a secret he knew what was going on in the house but he was refusing to cough up for some reason what do i call the police or an exorcist neither for gods sake theres nothing going on gina really her father turned from the window and looked at her his eyes spoke what his mouth refused to say that this was war jack was afraid the house was suddenly a prison the game was suddenly lethal the enemy instead of playing foolish games meant harm real harm to them all in the kitchen the turkey had at last conceded defeat the carols on the radio had withered into a sermon on gods benedictions what had been sweet was sour and dangerous he looked across the room at amanda and gina both for their own reasons were trembling polo wanted to tell them wanted to explain what was going on but the thing must be there he knew gloating he was wrong the yattering had retired to the attic wellsatisfied with its endeavours the bird it felt had been a stroke of genius now it could rest a while recuperate let the enemys nerves tatter themselves in anticipation then in its own good time it would deliver the coup de grace idly it wondered if any of the inspectors had seen his work with the turkey maybe they would be impressed enough by the yatterings originality to improve its job prospects surely it hadnt gone through all those years of training simply to chase halfwitted imbeciles like polo there must be something more challenging available than that it felt victory in its invisible bones and it was a good feeling the pursuit of polo would surely gain momentum now his daughters would convince him that there was something terrible afoot he would crack he would crumble maybe hed go classically mad tear out his hair rip off his clothes smear himself with his own excrement oh yes victory was close and wouldnt his masters be loving then wouldnt it be showered with praise and power one more manifestation was all that was required one final inspired intervention and polo would be so much blubbering flesh tired but confident the yattering descended into the lounge amanda was lying fulllength on the sofa asleep she was obviously dreaming about the turkey her eyes rolled beneath her gossamer lids her lower lip trembled gina sat beside the radio which was silenced now she had a book open on her lap but she wasnt reading it the gherkin importer wasnt in the room wasnt that his footstep on the stair yes he was going upstairs to relieve his brandyfull bladder ideal timing the yattering crossed the room in her sleep amanda dreamt something dark flitting across her vision something malign something that tasted bitter in her mouth gina looked up from her book the silver balls on the tree were rocking gently not just the balls the tinsel and the branches too in fact the tree the whole tree was rocking as though someone had just seized hold of it gina had a very bad feeling about this she stood up the book slid to the floor the tree began to spin christ she said jesus christ amanda slept on the tree picked up momentum gina walked as steadily as she could across to the sofa and tried to shake her sister awake amanda locked in her dreams resisted for a moment father said gina her voice was strong and carried through into the hall it also woke amanda downstairs polo heard a noise like a whining dog no like two whining dogs as he ran down the stairs the duet became a trio he burst into the lounge half expecting all the hosts of hell to be in there dogheaded dancing on his beauties but no it was the christmas tree that was whining whining like a pack of dogs as it spun and spun the lights had long since been pulled from their sockets the air stank of singed plastic and pinesap the tree itself was spinning like a top flinging decorations and presents off its tortured branches with the largesse of a mad king jack tore his eyes from the spectacle of the tree and found gina and amanda crouching terrified behind the sofa get out of here he yelled even as he spoke the television sat up impertinently on one leg and began to spin like the tree gathering momentum quickly the clock on the mantelpiece joined the pirouetting the pokers beside the fire the cushions the ornaments each object added its own singular note to the orchestration of whines which were building up second by second to a deafening pitch the air began to brim with the smell of burning wood as friction heated the spinning tops to flashpoint smoke swirled across the room gina had amanda by the arm and was dragging her towards the door shielding her face against the hail of pine needles that the stillaccelerating tree was throwing off now the lights were spinning the books having flung themselves off the shelves had joined the tarantella jack could see the enemy in his minds eye racing between the objects like a juggler spinning plates on sticks trying to keep them all moving at once it must be exhausting work he thought the demon was probably close to collapse it couldnt be thinking straight overexcited impulsive vulnerable this must be the moment if ever there was a moment to join battle at last to face the thing defy it and trap it for its part the yattering was enjoying this orgy of destruction it flung every movable object into the fray setting everything spinning it watched with satisfaction as the daughters twitched and scurried it laughed to see the old man stare popeyed at this preposterous ballet surely he was nearly mad wasnt he the beauties had reached the door their hair and skin full of needles polo didnt see them leave he ran across the room dodging a rain of ornaments to do so and picked up a brass toasting fork which the enemy had overlooked bricabrac filled the air around his head dancing around with sickening speed his flesh was bruised and punctured but the exhilaration of joining battle had overtaken him and he set about beating the books and the clocks and the china to smithereens like a man in a cloud of locusts he ran around the room bringing down his favourite books in a welter of fluttering pages smashing whirling dresden shattering the lamps a litter of broken possessions swamped the floor some of it still twitching as the life went out of the fragments but for every object brought low there were a dozen still spinning still whining he could hear gina at the door yelling to him to get out to leave it alone but it was so enjoyable playing against the enemy more directly than hed ever allowed himself before he didnt want to give up he wanted the demon to show itself to be known to be recognized he wanted confrontation with the old ones emissary once and for all without warning the tree gave way to the dictates of centrifugal force and exploded the noise was like a howl of death branches twigs needles balls lights wire ribbons flew across the room jack his back to the explosion felt a gust of energy hit him hard and he was flung to the ground the back of his neck and his scalp were shot full of pineneedles a branch naked of greenery shot past his head and impaled the sofa fragments of tree pattered to the carpet around him now other objects around the room spun beyond the tolerance of their structures were exploding like the tree the television blew up sending a lethal wave of glass across the room much of which buried itself in the opposite wall fragments of the televisions innards so hot they singed the skin fell on jack as he elbowed himself towards the door like a soldier under bombardment the room was so thick with a barrage of shards it was like a fog the cushions had lent their down to the scene snowing on the carpet porcelain pieces a beautifullyglazed arm a courtesans head bounced on the floor in front of his nose gina was crouching at the door urging him to hurry her eyes narrowed against the hail as jack reached the door and felt her arms around him he swore he could hear laughter from the lounge tangible audible laughter rich and satisfied amanda was standing in the hall her hair full of pineneedles staring down at him he pulled his legs through the doorway and gina slammed the door shut on the demolition what is it she demanded poltergeist ghost mothers ghost the thought of his dead wife being responsible for such wholesale destruction struck jack as funny amanda was half smiling good he thought shes coming out of it then he met the vacant look in her eyes and the truth dawned shed broken her sanity had taken refuge where this fantastique couldnt get at it whats in there gina was asking her grip on his arm so strong it stopped the blood i dont know he lied amanda amandas smile didnt decay she just stared on at him through him you do know no youre lying i think he picked himself off the floor brushing the pieces of porcelain the feathers the glass off his shirt and trousers i think i shall go for a walk behind him in the lounge the last vestiges of whining had stopped the air in the hallway was electric with unseen presences it was very close to him invisible as ever but so close this was the most dangerous time he mustnt lose his nerve now he must stand up as though nothing had happened he must leave amanda be leave explanations and recriminations until it was all over and done with walk gina said disbelievingly yes walk i need some fresh air you cant leave us here ill find somebody to help us clear up but mandy shell get over it leave her be that was hard that was almost unforgivable but it was said now he walked unsteadily towards the front door feeling nauseous after so much spinning at his back gina was raging you cant just leave are you out of your mind i need the air he said as casually as his thumping heart and his parched throat would permit so ill just go out for a moment no the yattering said no no no it was behind him polo could feel it so angry now so ready to twist off his head except that it wasnt allowed ever to touch him but he could feel its resentment like a physical presence he took another step towards the front door it was with him still dogging his every step his shadow his fetch unshakeable gina shrieked at him you sonofabitch look at mandy shes lost her mind no he mustnt look at mandy if he looked at mandy he might weep he might break down as the thing wanted him to then everything would be lost shell be all right he said barely above a whisper he reached for the front door handle the demon bolted the door quickly loudly no temper left for pretence now jack keeping his movements as even as possible unbolted the door top and bottom it bolted again it was thrilling this game it was also terrifying if he pushed too far surely the demons frustration would override its lessons gently smoothly he unbolted the door again just as gently just as smoothly the yattering bolted it jack wondered how long he could keep this up for somehow he had to get outside he had to coax it over the threshold one step was all that the law required according to his researches one simple step unbolted bolted unbolted bolted gina was standing two or three yards behind her father she didnt understand what she was seeing but it was obvious her father was doing battle with someone or something daddy she began shut up he said benignly grinning as he unbolted the door for the seventh time there was a shiver of lunacy in the grin it was too wide and too easy inexplicably she returned the smile it was grim but genuine whatever was at issue here she loved him polo made a break for the back door the demon was three paces ahead of him scooting through the house like a sprinter and bolting the door before jack could even reach the handle the key was turned in the lock by invisible hands then crushed to dust in the air jack feigned a move towards the window beside the back door but the blinds were pulled down and the shutters slammed the yattering too concerned with the window to watch jack closely missed his doubling back through the house when it saw the trick that was being played it let out a little screech and gave chase almost sliding into jack on the smoothlypolished floor it avoided the collision only by the most balletic of manoeuvres that would be fatal indeed to touch the man in the heat of the moment polo was again at the front door and gina wise to her fathers strategy had unbolted it while the yattering and jack fought at the back door jack had prayed shed take the opportunity to open it she had it stood slightly ajar the icy air of the crisp afternoon curled its way into the hallway jack covered the last yards to the door in a flash feeling without hearing the howl of complaint the yattering loosed as it saw its victim escaping into the outside world it was not an ambitious creature all it wanted at that moment beyond any other dream was to take this humans skull between its palms and make a nonsense of it crush it to smithereens and pour the hot thought out on to the snow to be done with jack j polo forever and forever was that so much to ask polo had stepped into the squeakyfresh snow his slippers and trouserbottoms buried in chill by the time the fury reached the step jack was already three or four yards away marching up the path towards the gate escaping escaping the yattering howled again forgetting its years of training every lesson it had learned every rule of battle engraved on its skull was submerged by the simple desire to have polos life it stepped over the threshold and gave chase it was an unpardonable transgression somewhere in hell the powers felt the sin and knew the war for jack polos soul was lost jack felt it too he heard the sound of boiling water as the demons footsteps melted to steam the snow on the path it was coming after him the thing had broken the first rule of its existence it was forfeit he felt the victory in his spine and his stomach the demon overtook him at the gate its breath could clearly be seen in the air though the body it emanated from had not yet become visible jack tried to open the gate but the yanering slammed it shut che sera sera said jack the yattering could bear it no longer he took jacks head in his hands intending to crush the fragile bone to dust the touch was its second sin and it agonized the yattering beyond endurance it bayed like a banshee and reeled away from the contact sliding in the snow and falling on its back it knew its mistake the lessons it had had beaten into it came hurtling back it knew the punishment too for leaving the house for touching the man it was bound to a new lord enslaved to this idiotcreature standing over it polo had won he was laughing watching the way the outline of the demon formed in the snow on the path like a photograph developing on a sheet of paper the image of the fury came clear the law was taking its toll the yattering could never hide from its master again there it was plain to polos eyes in all its charmless glory maroon flesh and bright lidless eye arms flailing tail thrashing the snow to slush you bastard it said its accent had an australian lilt you will not speak unless spoken to said polo with quiet but absolute authority understood the lidless eye clouded with humility yes the yattering said yes mister polo yes mister polo its tail slipped between its legs like that of a whipped dog you may stand thank you mr polo it stood not a pleasant sight but one jack rejoiced in nevertheless theyll have you yet said the yattering who will you know it said hesitantly name them beelzebub it answered proud to name its old master the powers hell itself i dont think so polo mused not with you bound to me as proof of my skills arent i the better of them the eye looked sullen arent i yes it conceded bitterly yes you are the better of them it had begun to shiver are you cold asked polo it nodded affecting the look of a lost child then you need some exercise he said youd better go back into the house and start tidying up the fury looked bewildered even disappointed by this instruction nothing more it asked incredulously no miracles no helen of troy no flying the thought of flying on a snowspattered afternoon like this left polo cold he was essentially a man of simple tastes all he asked for in life was the love of his children a pleasant home and a good trading price for gherkins no flying he said as the yattering slouched down the path towards the door it seemed to alight upon a new piece of mischief it turned back to polo obsequious but unmistakably smug could i just say something it said speak its only fair that i inform you that its considered ungodly to have any contact with the likes of me heretical even is that so oh yes said the yattering warming to its prophecy people have been burned for less not in this day and age polo replied but the seraphim will see it said and that means youll never go to that place what place the yattering fumbled for the special word it had heard beelzebub use heaven it said triumphant an ugly grin had come on to its face this was the cleverest manoeuvre it had ever attempted it was juggling theology here jack nodded slowly nibbling at his bottom lip the creature was probably telling the truth association with it or its like would not be looked upon benignly by the host of saints and angels he probably was forbidden access to the plains of paradise well he said you know what i have to say about that dont you the yattering stared at him frowning no it didnt know then the grin of satisfaction it had been wearing died as it saw just what polo was driving at what do i say polo asked it defeated the yattering murmured the phrase che sera sera polo smiled theres a chance for you yet he said and led the way over the threshold closing the door with something very like serenity on his face pig blood blues you could smell the kids before you could see them their young sweat turned stale in corridors with barred windows their bolted breath sour their heads musty then their voices subdued by the rules of confinement dont run dont shout dont whistle dont fight they called it a remand centre for adolescent offenders but it was near as damn it a prison there were locks and keys and warders the gestures of liberalism were few and far between and they didnt disguise the truth too well tetherdowne was a prison by sweeter name and the inmates knew it not that redman had any illusions about his pupilstobe they were hard and they were locked away for a reason most of them would rob you blind as soon as look at you cripple you if it suited them no sweat he had too many years in the force to believe the sociological lie he knew the victims and he knew the kids they werent misunderstood morons they were quick and sharp and amoral like the razors they hid under their tongues they had no use for sentiment they just wanted out welcome to tetherdowne was the womans name leverton or leverfall or im doctor leverthal leverthal yes hardbitten bitch hed met at we met at the interview yes were glad to see you mr redman neil please call me neil we try not to go on a first name basis in front of the boys we find they think theyve got a finger into your private life so id prefer you to keep christian names purely for offduty hours she didnt offer hers probably something flinty yvonne lydia hed invent something appropriate she looked fifty and was probably ten years younger no makeup hair tied back so severely he wondered her eyes didnt pop youll be beginning classes the day after tomorrow the governor asked me to welcome you to the centre on his behalf and apologise to you that he cant be here himself there are funding problems arent there always regrettably yes im afraid were swimming against the tide here the general mood of the country is very law and order orientated what was that a nice way of saying beat the shit out of any kid caught so much as jaywalking yes hed been that way himself in his time and it was a nasty little culdesac every bit as bad as being sentimental the fact is we may lose tetherdowne altogether she said which would be a shame i know it doesnt look like much but its home he laughed the joke fell among thieves she didnt even seem to hear it you her tone hardened you have a solid background in the police force our hope is that your appointment here will be welcomed by the funding authorities so that was it token expoliceman brought in to appease the powers that be to show willing in the discipline department they didnt really want him here they wanted some sociologist whod write up reports on the effect of the classsystem on brutality amongst teenagers she was quietly telling him that he was the odd man out i told you why i left the force you mentioned it invalided out i wouldnt take a desk job it was as simple as that and they wouldnt let me do what i did best danger to myself according to some of them she seemed a little embarrassed by his explanation her a psychologist too she should have been devouring this stuff it was his private hurt he was making public here he was coming clean for christs sake so i was out on my backside after twentyfour years he hesitated then said his piece im not a token policeman im not any kind of policeman the force and i parted company understand what im saying good good she didnt understand a bloody word he tried another approach id like to know what the boys have been told been told about me well something of your background i see theyd been warned here come the pigs it seemed important he grunted you see so many of these boys have real aggression problems thats a source of difficulty for so very many of them they cant control themselves and consequently they suffer he didnt argue but she looked at him severely as though he had oh yes they suffer thats why were at such pains to show some appreciation of their situation to teach them that there are alternatives she walked across to the window from the second storey there was an adequate view of the grounds tetherdowne had been some kind of estate and there was a good deal of land attached to the main house a playingfield its grass sere in the midsummer drought beyond it a cluster of outhouses some exhausted trees shrubbery and then rough wasteland off to the wall hed seen the wall from the other side alcatraz would have been proud of it we try to give them a little freedom a little education and a little sympathy theres a popular notion isnt there that delinquents enjoy their criminal activities this isnt my experience at all they come to me guilty broken one broken victim flicked a vee at leverthals back as he sauntered along the corridor hair slicked down and parted in three places a couple of homegrown tattoos on his forearm unfinished they have committed criminal acts however redman pointed out yes but and must presumably be reminded of the fact i dont think they need any reminding mr redman i think they burn with guilt she was hot on guilt which didnt surprise him theyd taken over the pulpit these analysts they were up where the biblethumpers used to stand with the threadbare sermons on the fires below but with a slightly less colourful vocabulary it was fundamentally the same story though complete with the promises of healing if the rituals were observed and behold the righteous shall inherit the kingdom of heaven there was a pursuit on the playing field he noticed pursuit and now a capture one victim was laying into another smaller victim with his boot it was a fairly merciless display leverthal caught the scene at the same time as redman excuse me i must she started down the stairs your workshop is third door on the left if you want to take a look she called over her shoulder ill be right back like hell she would judging by the way the scene on the field was progressing it would be a three crowbar job to prize them apart redman wandered along to his workshop the door was locked but through the wired glass he could see the benches the vices the tools not bad at all he might even teach them some woodwork if he was left alone long enough to do it a bit frustrated not to be able to get in he doubled back along the corridor and followed leverthal downstairs finding his way out easily on to the sunlit playing field a little knot of spectators had grown around the fight or the massacre which had now ceased leverthal was standing staring down at the boy on the ground one of the warders was kneeling at the boys head the injuries looked bad a number of the spectators looked up and stared at the new face as redman approached there were whispers amongst them some smiles redman looked at the boy perhaps sixteen he lay with his cheek to the ground as if listening for something in the earth lacey leverthal named the boy for redman is he badly hurt the man kneeling beside lacey shook his head not too bad bit of a fall nothing broken there was blood on the boys face from his mashed nose his eyes were closed peaceful he could have been dead wheres the bloody stretcher said the warder he was clearly uncomfortable on the droughthardened ground theyre coming sir said someone redman thought it was the aggressor a thin lad about nineteen the sort of eyes that could sour milk at twenty paces indeed a small posse of boys was emerging from the main building carrying a stretcher and a red blanket they were all grinning from ear to ear the band of spectators had begun to disperse now that the best of it was over not much fun picking up the pieces wait wait said redman dont we need some witnesses here who did this there were a few casual shrugs but most of them played deaf they sauntered away as if nothing had been said redman said we saw it from the window leverthal was offering no support didnt we he demanded of her it was too far to lay any blame i think but i dont want to see any more of this kind of bullying do you all understand me shed seen lacey and recognized him easily from that distance why not the attacker too redman kicked himself for not concentrating without names and personalities to go with the faces it was difficult to distinguish between them the risk of making a misplaced accusation was high even though he was almost sure of the curdling eyed boy this was no time to make mistakes he decided this time hed have to let the issue drop leverthal seemed unmoved by the whole thing lacey she said quietly its always lacey he asks for it said one of the boys with the stretcher brushing a sheaf of blondwhite hair from his eyes he doesnt know no better ignoring the observation leverthal supervised laceys transfer to the stretcher and started to walk back to the main building with redman in tow it was all so casual not exactly wholesome lacey she said cryptically almost by way of explanation and that was all so much for compassion redman glanced back as they tucked the red blanket around laceys still form two things happened almost simultaneously the first somebody in the group said thats the pig the second laceys eyes opened and looked straight into redmans wide clear and true redman spent a good deal of the next day putting his workshop in order many of the tools had been broken or rendered useless by untrained handling saws without teeth chisels that were chipped and edgeless broken vices hed need money to resupply the shop with the basics of the trade but now wasnt the time to start asking wiser to wait and be seen to do a decent job he was quite used to the politics of institutions the force was full of it about fourthirty a bell started to ring a good way from the workshop he ignored it but after a time his instincts got the better of him bells were alarms and alarms were sounded to alert people he left his tidying locked the workshop door behind him and followed his ears the bell was ringing in what was laughingly called the hospital unit two or three rooms closed off from the main block and prettied up with a few pictures and curtains at the windows there was no sign of smoke in the air so it clearly wasnt a fire there was shouting though more than shouting a howl he quickened his pace along the interminable corridors and as he turned a corner towards the unit a small figure ran straight into him the impact winded both of them but redman grabbed the lad by the arm before he could make off again the captive was quick to respond lashing out with his shoeless feet against redmans shin but he had him fast let me go you fucking calm down calm down his pursuers were almost there hold him fucker fucker fucker fucker hold him it was like wrestling a crocodile the kid had all the strength of fear but the best of his fury was spent tears were springing into his bruised eyes as he spat in redmans face it was lacey in his arms unwholesome lacey ok we got him redman stepped back as the warder took over putting lacey in a hold that looked fit to break the boys arm two or three others were appearing round the corner two boys and a nurse a very unlovely creature let me go let me go lacey was yelling but any stomach for the fight had gone out of him a pout came to his face in defeat and still the cowlike eyes turned up accusingly at redman big and brown he looked younger than his sixteen years almost prepubescent there was a whisper of bumfluff on his cheek and a few spots amongst the bruises and a badlyapplied dressing across his nose but quite a girlish face a virgins face from an age when there were still virgins and still the eyes leverthal had appeared too late to be of use whats going on the warder piped up the chase had taken his breath and his temper he locked himself in the lavatories tried to get out through the window why the question was addressed to the warder not to the child a telling confusion the warder confounded shrugged why redman repeated the question to lacey the boy just stared as though hed never been asked a question before you the pig he said suddenly snot running from his nose pig he means policeman said one of the boys the noun was spoken with a mocking precision as though he was addressing an imbecile i know what he means lad said redman still determined to outstare lacey i know very well what he means are you be quiet lacey said leverthal youre in enough trouble as it is yes son im the pig the war of looks went on a private battle between boy and man you dont know nothing said lacey it wasnt a snide remark the boy was simply telling his version of the truth his gaze didnt flicker all right lacey thats enough the warder was trying to haul him away his belly stuck out between pyjama top and bottom a smooth dome of milk skin let him speak said redman what dont i know he can give his side of the story to the governor said leverthal before lacey could reply its not your concern but it was very much his concern the stare made it his concern so cutting so damned the stare demanded that it become his concern let him speak said redman the authority in his voice overriding leverthal the warder loosened his hold just a little why did you try and escape lacey cause he came back who came back a name lacey who are you talking about for several seconds redman sensed the boy fighting a pact with silence then lacey shook his head breaking the electric exchange between them he seemed to lose his way somewhere a kind of puzzlement gagged him no harms going to come to you lacey stared at his feet frowning i want to go back to bed now he said a virgins request no harm lacey i promise the promise seemed to have precious little effect lacey was struck dumb but it was a promise nevertheless and he hoped lacey realised that the kid looked exhausted by the effort of his failed escape of the pursuit of staring his face was ashen he let the warder turn him and take him back before he rounded the corner again he seemed to change his mind he struggled to loose himself failed but managed to twist himself round to face his interrogator henessey he said meeting redmans eyes once more that was all he was shunted out of sight before he could say anything more henessey said redman feeling like a stranger suddenly whos henessey leverthal was lighting a cigarette her hands were shaking ever so slightly as she did it he hadnt noticed that yesterday but he wasnt surprised hed yet to meet a head shrinker who didnt have problems of their own the boys lying she said henesseys no longer with us a little pause redman didnt prompt it would only make her jumpy laceys clever she went on putting the cigarette to her colourless lips he knows just the spot eh youre new here and he wants to give you the impression that hes got a mystery all of his own it isnt a mystery then henessey she snorted good god no he escaped custody in early may he and lacey she hesitated without wanting to he and lacey had something between them drugs perhaps we never found out gluesniffing mutual masturbation god knows what she really did find the whole subject unpleasant distaste was written over her face in a dozen tight places how did henessey escape we still dont know she said he just didnt turn up for rollcall one morning the place was searched from top to bottom but hed gone is it possible hed come back a genuine laugh jesus no he hated the place besides how could he get in he got out leverthal conceded the point with a murmur he wasnt especially bright but he was cunning i wasnt altogether surprised when he went missing the few weeks before his escape hed really sunk into himself i couldnt get anything out of him and up until then hed been quite talkative and lacey under his thumb it often happens younger boy idolizes an older more experienced individual lacey had a very unsettled family background neat thought redman so neat he didnt believe a word of it minds werent pictures at an exhibition all numbered and hung in order of influence one marked cunning the next impressionable they were scrawls they were sprawling splashes of graffiti unpredictable unconfinable and little boy lacey he was written on water classes began the next day in a heat so oppressive it turned the workshop into an oven by eleven but the boys responded quickly to redmans straight dealing they recognized in him a man they could respect without liking they expected no favours and received none it was a stable arrangement redman found the staff on the whole less communicative than the boys an oddball bunch all in all not a strong heart amongst them he decided the routine of tetherdowne its rituals of classification of humiliation seemed to grind them into a common gravel increasingly he found himself avoiding conversation with his peers the workshop became a sanctuary a home from home smelling of newly cut wood and bodies it was not until the following monday that one of the boys mentioned the farm nobody had told him there was a farm in the grounds of the centre and the idea struck redman as absurd nobody much goes down there said creeley one of the worst woodworkers on gods earth it stinks general laughter all right lads settle down the laughter subsided laced with a few whispered jibes where is this farm creeley its not even a farm really sir said creeley chewing his tongue its just a few huts stink they do sir especially now he pointed out of the window to the wilderness beyond the playing field since hed last looked out at the sight that first day with leverthal the wasteland had ripened in the sweaty heat ranker with weeds than ever creeley pointed out a distant brick wall all but hidden behind a shield of shrubs see it sir yes i see it thats the sty sir another round of sniggers whats so funny he wheeled on the class a dozen heads snapped down to their work i wouldnt go down there sir its high as a fucking kite creeley wasnt exaggerating even in the relative cool of the late afternoon the smell wafting off the farm was stomach turning redman just followed his nose across the field and past the outhouses the buildings he glimpsed from the workshop window were coming out of hiding a few ramshackle huts thrown up out of corrugated iron and rotting wood a chicken run and the brickbuilt sty were all the farm could offer as creeley had said it wasnt really a farm at all it was a tiny domesticated dachau filthy and forlorn somebody obviously fed the few prisoners the hens the half dozen geese the pigs but nobody seemed bothered to clean them out hence that rotten smell the pigs particularly were living in a bed of their own ordure islands of dung cooked to perfection in the sun peopled with thousands of flies the sty itself was divided into two separate compartments divided by a high brick wall in the forecourt of one a small mottled pig lay on its side in the filth its flank alive with ticks and bugs another smaller pig could be glimpsed in the gloom of the interior lying on shitthick straw neither showed any interest in redman the other compartment seemed empty there was no excrement in the forecourt and far fewer flies amongst the straw the accumulated smell of old faecal matter was no less acute however and redman was about to turn away when there was a noise from inside and a great bulk righted itself he leaned over the padlocked wooden gate blotting out the stench by an act of will and peered through the doorway of the sty the pig came out to look at him it was three times the size of its companions a vast sow that might well have mothered the pigs in the adjacent pen but where her farrows were filthyflanked the sow was pristine her blushing pink frame radiant with good health her sheer size impressed redman she must have weighed twice what he weighed he guessed an altogether formidable creature a glamorous animal in her gross way with her curling blonde lashes and the delicate down on her shiny snout that coarsened to bristles around her lolling ears and the oily fetching look in her dark brown eyes redman a city boy had seldom seen the living truth behind or previous to the meat on his plate this wonderful porker came as a revelation the bad press that hed always believed about pigs the reputation that made the very name a synonym for foulness all that was given the lie the sow was beautiful from her snuffling snout to the delicate corkscrew of her tail a seductress on trotters her eyes regarded redman as an equal he had no doubt of that admiring him rather less than he admired her she was safe in her head he in his they were equal under a glittering sky close to her body smelt sweet somebody had clearly been there that very morning sluicing her down and feeding her her trough redman now noticed still brimmed with a mush of slops the remains of yesterdays meal she hadnt touched it she was no glutton soon she seemed to have the sum of him and grunting quietly she turned around on her nimble feet and returned to the cool of the interior the audience was over that night he went to find lacey the boy had been removed from the hospital unit and put in a shabby room of his own he was apparently still being bullied by the other boys in his dormitory and the alternative was this solitary confinement redman found him sitting on a carpet of old comic books staring at the wall the lurid covers of the comics made his face look milkier than ever the bandage had gone from his nose and the bruise on the bridge was yellowing he shook laceys hand and the boy gazed up at him there was a real turn about since their last meeting lacey was calm even docile the handshake a ritual redman had introduced whenever he met boys out of the workshop was weak are you well the boy nodded do you like being alone yes sir youll have to go back to the dormitory eventually lacey shook his head you cant stay here forever you know oh i know that sir youll have to go back lacey nodded somehow the logic didnt seem to have got through to the boy he turned up the corner of a superman comic and stared at the splashpage without scanning it listen to me lacey i want you and i to understand each other yes yes sir i cant help you if you lie to me can i no why did you mention kevin henesseys name to me last week i know that he isnt here any longer he escaped didnt he lacey stared at the threecolour hero on the page didnt he hes here said lacey very quietly the kid was suddenly distraught it was in his voice and in the way his face folded up on itself if he escaped why should he come back that doesnt really make much sense to me does it make much sense to you lacey shook his head there were tears in his nose that muffled his words but they were clear enough he never went away what you mean he never escaped hes clever sir you dont know kevin hes clever he closed the comic and looked up at redman in what way clever he planned everything sir all of it you have to be clear you wont believe me then thats the end because you wont believe me he hears you know hes everywhere he doesnt care about walls dead people dont care about nothing like that dead a smaller word than alive but it took the breath away he can come and go said lacey any time he wants are you saying henessey is dead said redman be careful lacey the boy hesitated he was aware that he was walking a tight rope very close to losing his protector you promised he said suddenly cold as ice promised no harm would come to you it wont i said that and i meant it but that doesnt mean you can tell me lies lacey what lies sir henessey isnt dead he is sir they all know he is he hanged himself with the pigs redman had been lied to many times by experts and he felt hed become a good judge of liars he knew all the telltale signs but the boy exhibited none of them he was telling the truth redman felt it in his bones the truth the whole truth nothing but that didnt mean that what the boy was saying was true he was simply telling the truth as he understood it he believed henessey was deceased that proved nothing if henessey were dead he is sir if he were how could he be here the boy looked at redman without a trace of guile in his face dont you believe in ghosts sir so transparent a solution it flummoxed redman henessey was dead yet henessey was here hence henessey was a ghost dont you sir the boy wasnt asking a rhetorical question he wanted no he demanded a reasonable answer to his reasonable question no boy said redman no i dont lacey seemed unruffled by this conflict of opinion youll see he said simply youll see in the sty at the perimeter of the grounds the great nameless sow was hungry she judged the rhythm of the days and with their progression her desires grew she knew that the time for stale slops in a trough was past other appetites had taken the place of those piggy pleasures she had a taste since the first time for food with a certain texture a certain resonance it wasnt food she would demand all the time only when the need came on her not a great demand once in a while to gobble at the hand that fed her she stood at the gate of her prison listless with anticipation waiting and waiting she snaffled she snorted her impatience becoming a dull anger in the adjacent pen her castrated sons sensing her distress became agitated in their turn they knew her nature and it was dangerous she had after all eaten two of their brothers living fresh and wet from her own womb then there were noises through the blue veil of twilight the soft brushing sound of passage through the nettles accompanied by the murmur of voices two boys were approaching the sty respect and caution in every step she made them nervous and understandably so the tales of her tricks were legion didnt she speak when angered in that possessed voice bending her fat porky mouth to talk with a stolen tongue wouldnt she stand on her back trotters sometimes pink and imperial and demand that the smallest boys be sent into her shadow to suckle her naked like her farrow and wouldnt she beat her vicious heels upon the ground until the food they brought for her was cut into petit pieces and delivered into her maw between trembling finger and thumb all these things she did and worse tonight the boys knew they had not brought what she wanted it was not the meat she was due that lay on the plate they carried not the sweet white meat that she had asked for in that other voice of hers the meat she could if she desired take by force tonight the meal was simply stale bacon filched from the kitchens the nourishment she really craved the meat that had been pursued and terrified to engorge the muscle then bruised like a hammered steak for her delectation that meat was under special protection it would take a while to coax it to the slaughter meanwhile they hoped she would accept their apologies and their tears and not devour them in her anger one of the boys had shit his pants by the time he reached the stywall and the sow smelt him her voice took on a different timbre enjoying the piquancy of their fear instead of the low snort there was a higher hotter note out of her it said i know i know come and be judged i know i know she watched them through the slats of the gate her eyes glinting like jewels in the murky night brighter than the night because living purer than the night because wanting the boys knelt at the gate their heads bowed in supplication the plate they both held lightly covered with a piece of stained muslin well she said the voice was unmistakable in their ears his voice out of the mouth of the pig the elder boy a black kid with a cleft palate spoke quietly to the shining eyes making the best of his fear its not what you wanted were sorry the other boy uncomfortable in his crowded trousers murmured his apology too well get him for you though we will really well bring him to you very soon as soon as we possibly can why not tonight said the pig hes being protected a new teacher mr redman the sow seemed to know it all already she remembered the confrontation across the wall the way hed stared at her as though she was a zoological specimen so that was her enemy that old man shed have him oh yes the boys heard her promise of revenge and seemed content to have the matter taken out of their hands give her the meat said the black boy the other one stood up removing the muslin cloth the bacon smelt bad but the sow nevertheless made wet noises of enthusiasm maybe she had forgiven them go on quickly the boy took the first strip of bacon between finger and thumb and proffered it the sow turned her mouth sideways up to it and ate showing her yellowish teeth it was gone quickly the second the third fourth fifth the same the sixth and last piece she took with his fingers snatched with such elegance and speed the boy could only cry out as her teeth champed through the thin digits and swallowed them he withdrew his hand from over the sty wall and gawped at this mutilation she had done only a little damage considering the top of his thumb and half his index finger had gone the wounds bled quickly fully splashing on to his shirt and his shoes she grunted and snorted and seemed satisfied the boy yelped and ran tomorrow said the sow to the remaining supplicant not this old pigmeat it must be white white and lacy she thought that was a fine joke yes the boy said yes of course without fail she ordered yes or i come for him myself do you hear me yes i come for him myself wherever hes hiding i will eat him in his bed if i wish in his sleep i will eat off his feet then his legs then his balls then his hips yes yes i want him said the sow grinding her trotter in the straw hes mine henessey dead said leverthal head still down as she wrote one of her interminable reports its another fabrication one minute the child says hes in the centre the next hes dead the boy cant even get his story straight it was difficult to argue with the contradictions unless one accepted the idea of ghosts as readily as lacey there was no way redman was going to try and argue that point with the woman that part was a nonsense ghosts were foolishness just fears made visible but the possibility of henesseys suicide made more sense to redman he pressed on with his argument so where did lacey get this story from about henesseys death its a funny thing to invent she deigned to look up her face drawn up into itself like a snail in its shell fertile imaginations are par for the course here if you heard the tales ive got on tape the exoticism of some of them would blow your head open have there been suicides here in my time she thought for a moment pen poised two attempts neither i think intended to succeed cries for help was henessey one she allowed herself a little sneer as she shook her head henessey was unstable in a completely different direction he thought he was going to live forever that was his little dream henessey the nietzchean superman he had something close to contempt for the common herd as far as he was concerned he was a breed apart as far beyond the rest of us mere mortals as he was beyond that wretched he knew she was going to say pig but she stopped just short of the word those wretched animals on the farm she said looking back down at her report henessey spent time at the farm no more than any other boy she lied none of them like farm duties but its part of the work rota mucking out isnt a very pleasant occupation i can testify to that the lie he knew shed told made redman keep back laceys final detail that henesseys death had taken place in the pigsty he shrugged and took an entirely different tack is lacey under any medication some sedatives are the boys always sedated when theyve been in a fight only if they try to make escapes we havent got enough staff to supervise the likes of lacey i dont see why youre so concerned i want him to trust me i promised him i dont want him let down frankly all this sounds suspiciously like special pleading the boys one of many no unique problems and no particular hope of redemption redemption it was a strange word rehabilitation whatever you choose to call it look redman ill be frank theres a general feeling that youre not really playing ball here oh we all feel i think this includes the governor that you should let us go about our business the way were used to learn the ropes before you start interfering she nodded its as good a word as any youre making enemies thank you for the warning this jobs difficult enough without enemies believe me she attempted a conciliatory look which redman ignored enemies he could live with liars he couldnt the governors room was locked as it had been for a full week now explanations differed as to where he was meetings with funding bodies was a favourite reason touted amongst the staff though the secretary claimed she didnt exactly know there were seminars at the university he was running somebody said to bring some research to bear on the problems of remand centres maybe the governor was at one of those if mr redman wanted he could leave a message the governor would get it back in the workshop lacey was waiting for him it was almost sevenfifteen classes were well over what are you doing here waiting sir what for you sir i wanted to give you a letter sir for me mam will you get it to her you can send it through the usual channels cant you give it to the secretary shell forward it youre allowed two letters a week laceys face fell they read them sir in case you write something you shouldnt and if you do they burn them and youve written something you shouldnt he nodded what about kevin i told her all about kevin about what happened to him im not sure youve got your facts right about henessey the boy shrugged its true sir he said quietly apparently no longer caring if he convinced redman or not its true hes there sir in her in who what are you talking about maybe lacey was speaking as leverthal had suggested simply out of his fear there had to be a limit to his patience with the boy and this was just about it a knock on the door and a spotty individual called slape was staring at him through the wired glass come in urgent telephone call for you sir in the secretarys office redman hated the telephone unsavoury machine it never brought good tidings urgent who from slape shrugged and picked at his face stay with lacey will you slape looked unhappy with the prospect here sir he asked here yes sir im relying on you so dont let me down no sir redman turned to lacey the bruised look was a wound now open as he wept give me your letter ill take it to the office lacey had thrust the envelope into his pocket he retrieved it unwillingly and handed it across to redman say thank you thank you sir the corridors were empty it was television time and the nightly worship of the box had begun they would be glued to the black and white set that dominated the recreation room sitting through the pap of cop shows and game shows and wars from the world shows with their jaws open and their minds closed a hypnotized silence would fall on the assembled company until a promise of violence or a hint of sex then the room would erupt in whistles obscenities and shouts of encouragement only to subside again into sullen silence during the dialogue as they waited for another gun another breast he could hear gunfire and music even now echoing down the corridor the office was open but the secretary wasnt there gone home presumably the clock in the office said eightnineteen redman amended his watch the telephone was on the hook whoever had called him had tired of waiting leaving no message relieved as he was that the call wasnt urgent enough to keep the caller hanging on he now felt disappointed not to be speaking to the outside world like crusoe seeing a sail only to have it sweep by his island ridiculous this wasnt his prison he could walk out whenever he liked he would walk out that very night and be crusoe no longer he contemplated leaving laceys letter on the desk but thought better of it he had promised to protect the boys interests and that he would do if necessary hed post the letter himself thinking of nothing in particular he started back towards the workshop vague wisps of unease floated in his system clogging his responses sighs sat in his throat scowls on his face this damn place he said aloud not meaning the walls and the floors but the trap they represented he felt he could die here with his good intentions arrayed around him like flowers round a stiff and nobody would know or care or mourn idealism was weakness here compassion and indulgence unease was all unease and silence that was what was wrong though the television still popped and screamed down the corridor there was silence accompanying it no wolfwhistles no catcalls redman darted back to the vestibule and down the corridor to the recreation room smoking was allowed in this section of the building and the area stank of stale cigarettes ahead the noise of mayhem continued unabated a woman screamed somebodys name a man answered and was cut off by a blast of gunfire stories halftold hung in the air he reached the room and opened the door the television spoke to him get down hes got a gun another shot the woman blonde bigbreasted took the bullet in her heart and died on the sidewalk beside the man shed loved the tragedy went unwatched the recreation room was empty the old armchairs and graffiticarved stools placed around the television set for an audience who had better entertainment for the evening redman wove between the seats and turned the television off as the silverblue fluorescence died and the insistent beat of the music was cut dead he became aware in the gloom in the hush of somebody at the door who is it slape sir i told you to stay with lacey he had to go sir go he ran off sir i couldnt stop him damn you what do you mean you couldnt stop him redman started to recross the room catching his foot on a stool it scraped on the linoleum a little protest slape twitched im sorry sir he said i couldnt catch him ive got a bad foot yes slape did limp which way did he go slape shrugged not sure sir well remember no need to lose your temper sir the sir was slurred a parody of respect redman found his hand itching to hit this pusfilled adolescent he was within a couple of feet of the door slape didnt move aside out of my way slape really sir theres no way you can help him now hes gone i said out of my way as he stepped forward to push slape aside there was a click at navellevel and the bastard had a flickknife pressed to redmans belly the point bit the fat of his stomach theres really no need to go after him sir what in gods name are you doing slape were just playing a game he said through teeth gone grey theres no real harm in it best leave well alone the point of the knife had drawn blood warmly it wended its way down into redmans groin slape was prepared to kill him no doubt of that whatever this game was slape was having a little fun all of his own killing teacher it was called the knife was still being pressed infinitesimally slowly through the wall of redmans flesh the little rivulet of blood had thickened into a stream kevin likes to come out and play once in a while said slape henessey yes you like to call us by our second names dont you thats more manly isnt it that means were not children that means were men kevin isnt quite a man though you see sir hes never wanted to be a man in fact i think he hated the idea you know why he thought once you were a man you started to die and kevin used to say hed never die never die never i want to meet him everybody does sir hes charismatic thats the doctors word for him charismatic i want to meet this charismatic fellow soon now i said soon redman took the knifehand at the wrist so quickly slape had no chance to press the weapon home the adolescents response was slow doped perhaps and redman had the better of him the knife dropped from his hand as redmans grip tightened the other hand took slape in a stranglehold easily rounding his emaciated neck redmans palm pressed on his assailants adams apple making him gargle wheres henessey you take me to him the eyes that looked down at redman were slurred as his words the irises pinpricks take me to him redman demanded slapes hand found redmans cut belly and his fist jabbed the wound redman cursed letting his hold slip and slape almost slid out of his grasp but redman drove his knee into the others groin fast and sharp slape wanted to double up in agony but the neckhold prevented him the knee rose again harder and again again spontaneous tears ran down slapes face coursing through the minefield of his boils i can hurt you twice as badly as you can hurt me redman said so if you want to go on doing this all night im happy as a sandboy slape shook his head grabbing his breath through his constricted windpipe in short painful gasps you dont want any more slape shook his head again redman let go of him and flung him across the corridor against the wall whimpering with pain his face crimped he slid down the wall into a foetal position hands between his legs wheres lacey slape had begun to shake the words tumbled out where dyou think kevins got him wheres kevin slape looked up at redman puzzled dont you know i wouldnt ask if i did would i slape seemed to pitch forward as he spoke letting out a sigh of pain redmans first thought was that the youth was collapsing but slape had other ideas the knife was suddenly in his hand again snatched from the floor and slape was driving it up towards redmans groin he sidestepped the cut with a hairs breadth to spare and slape was on his feet again the pain forgotten the knife slit the air back and forth slape hissing his intention through his teeth kill you pig kill you pig then his mouth was wide and he was yelling kevin kevin help me the slashes were less and less accurate as slape lost control of himself tears snot and sweat sliming his face as he stumbled towards his intended victim redman chose his moment and delivered a crippling blow to slapes knee the weak leg he guessed he guessed correctly slape screamed and staggered back reeling round and hitting the wall face on redman followed through pressing slapes back too late he realized what hed done slapes body relaxed as his knife hand crushed between wall and body slid out bloody and weapon less slape exhaled deathair and collapsed heavily against the wall driving the knife still deeper into his own gut he was dead before he touched the ground redman turned him over hed never become used to the suddenness of death to be gone so quickly like the image on the television screen switched off and blank no message the utter silence of the corridors became overwhelming as he walked back towards the vestibule the cut on his stomach was not significant and the blood had made its own scabby bandage of his shirt knitting cotton to flesh and sealing the wound it scarcely hurt at all but the cut was the least of his problems he had mysteries to unravel now and he felt unable to face them the used exhausted atmosphere of the place made him feel in his turn used and exhausted there was no health to be had here no goodness no reason he believed suddenly in ghosts in the vestibule there was a light burning a bare bulb suspended over the dead space by it he read laceys crumpled letter the smudged words on the paper were like matches set to the tinder of his panic mama they fed me to the pig dont believe them if they said i never loved you or if they said i ran away i never did they fed me to the pig i love you tommy he pocketed the letter and began to run out of the building and across the field it was well dark now a deep starless dark and the air was muggy even in daylight he wasnt sure of the route to the farm it was worse by night he was very soon lost somewhere between the playingfield and the trees it was too far to see the outline of the main building behind him and the trees ahead all looked alike the nightair was foul no wind to freshen tired limbs it was as still outside as inside as though the whole world had become an interior a suffocating room bounded by a painted ceiling of cloud he stood in the dark the blood thumping in his head and tried to orient himself to his left where he had guessed the outhouses to be a light glimmered clearly he was completely mistaken about his position the light was at the sty it threw the ramshackle chicken run into silhouette as he stared at it there were figures there several standing as if watching a spectacle he couldnt yet see he started towards the sty not knowing what he would do once he reached it if they were all armed like slape and shared his murderous intentions then that would be the end of him the thought didnt worry him somehow tonight to get off of this closeddown world was an attractive option down and out and there was lacey thered been a moment of doubt after speaking to leverthal when hed wondered why he cared so much about the boy that accusation of special pleading it had a certain truth to it was there something in him that wanted thomas lacey naked beside him wasnt that the subtext of leverthals remark even now running uncertainly towards the lights all he could think of was the boys eyes huge and demanding looking deep into his ahead there were figures in the night wandering away from the farm he could see them against the lights of the sty was it all over already he made a long curve around to the left of the buildings to avoid the spectators as they left the scene they made no noise there was no chatter or laughter amongst them like a congregation leaving a funeral they walked evenly in the dark each apart from the other heads bowed it was eerie to see these godless delinquents so subdued by reverence he reached the chickenrun without encountering any of them face to face there were still a few figures lingering around the pighouse the wall of the sows compartment was lined with candles dozens and dozens of them they burned steadily in the still air throwing a rich warm light on to brick and on to the faces of the few who still stared into the mysteries of the sty leverthal was among them as was the warder whod knelt at laceys head that first day two or three boys were there too whose faces he recognized but could put no name to there was a noise from the sty the sound of the sows feet on the straw as she accepted their stares somebody was speaking but he couldnt make out who an adolescents voice with a lilt to it as the voice halted in its monologue the warder and another of the boys broke rank as if dismissed and turned away into the dark redman crept a little closer time was of the essence now soon the first of the congregation would have crossed the field and be back in the main building theyd see slapes corpse raise the alarm he must find lacey now if indeed lacey was still to be found leverthal saw him first she looked up from the sty and nodded a greeting apparently unconcerned by his arrival it was as if his appearance at this place was inevitable as if all routes led back to the farm to the straw house and the smell of excrement it made a kind of sense that shed believe that he almost believed it himself leverthal he said she smiled at him openly the boy beside her raised his head and smiled too are you henessey he asked looking at the boy the youth laughed and so did leverthal no she said no no no henessey is here she pointed into the sty redman walked the few remaining yards to the wall of the sty expecting and not daring to expect the straw and the blood and the pig and lacey but lacey wasnt there just the sow big and beady as ever standing amongst pats of her own ordure her huge ridiculous ears flapping over her eyes wheres henessey asked redman meeting the sows gaze here said the boy this is a pig she ate him said the youth still smiling he obviously thought the idea delightful she ate him and he speaks out of her redman wanted to laugh this made laceys tales of ghosts seem almost plausible by comparison they were telling him the pig was possessed did henessey hang himself as tommy said leverthal nodded in the sty another nod suddenly the pig took on a different aspect in his imagination he saw her reaching up to sniff at the feet of henesseys twitching body sensing the death coming over it salivating at the thought of its flesh he saw her licking the dew that oozed from its skin as it rotted lapping at it nibbling daintily at first then devouring it it wasnt too difficult to understand how the boys could have made a mythology of that atrocity inventing hymns to it attending upon the pig like a god the candles the reverence the intended sacrifice of lacey it was evidence of sickness but it was no more strange than a thousand other customs of faith he even began to understand laceys lassitude his inability to fight the powers that overtook him mama they fed me to the pig not mama help me save me just they gave me to the pig all this he could understand they were children many of them undereducated some verging on mental instability all susceptible to superstition but that didnt explain leverthal she was staring into the sty again and redman registered for the first time that her hair was unclipped and lay on her shoulders honeycoloured in the candlelight it looks like a pig to me plain and simple he said she speaks with his voice leverthal said quietly speaks in tongues you might say youll hear him in a while my darling boy then he understood you and henessey dont look so horrified she said he was eighteen hair blacker than youve ever seen and he loved me why did he hang himself to live forever she said so hed never be a man and die we didnt find him for six days said the youth almost whispering it in redmans ear and even then she wouldnt let anybody near him once she had him to herself the pig i mean not the doctor everyone loved kevin you see he whispered intimately he was beautiful and wheres lacey leverthals loving smile decayed with kevin said the youth where kevin wants him he pointed through the door of the sty there was a body lying on the straw back to the door if you want him youll have to go and get him said the boy and the next moment he had the back of redmans neck in a vicelike grip the sow responded to the sudden action she started to stamp the straw showing the whites of her eyes redman tried to shrug off the boys grip at the same time delivering an elbow to his belly the boy backed off winded and cursing only to be replaced by leverthal go to him she said as she snatched at redmans hair go to him if you want him her nails raked across his temple and nose just missing his eyes get off me he said trying to shake the woman off but she clung her head lashing back and forth as she tried to press him over the wall the rest happened with horrid speed her long hair brushed through a candle flame and her head caught fire the flames climbing quickly shrieking for help she stumbled heavily against the gate it failed to support her weight and gave inward redman watched helplessly as the burning woman fell amongst the straw the flames spread enthusiastically across the forecourt towards the sow lapping up the kindling even now in extremis the pig was still a pig no miracles here no speaking or pleading in tongues the animal panicked as the blaze surrounded her cornering her stamping bulk and licking at her flanks the air was filled with the stench of singeing bacon as the flames ran up her sides and over her head chasing through her bristles like a grassfire her voice was a pigs voice her complaints a pigs complaints hysterical grunts escaped her lips and she hurtled across the forecourt of the sty and out of the broken gate trampling leverthal the sows body still burning was a magic thing in the night as she careered across the field weaving about in her pain her cries did not diminish as the dark ate her up they seemed just to echo back and forth across the field unable to find a way out of the locked room redman stepped over leverthals fireridden corpse and into the sty the straw was burning on every side and the fire was creeping towards the door he halfshut his eyes against the stinging smoke and ducked into the pighouse lacey was lying as he had been all along back to the door redman turned the boy over he was alive he was awake his face bloated with tears and terror stared up off his straw pillow eyes so wide they looked fit to leap from his head get up said redman leaning over the boy his small body was rigid and it was all redman could do to prize his limbs apart with little words of care he coaxed the boy to his feet as the smoke began to swirl into the pighouse come on its all right come on he stood upright and something brushed his hair redman felt a little rain of worms across his face and glanced up to see henessey or what was left of him still suspended from the crossbeam of the pighouse his features were incomprehensible blackened to a drooping mush his body was raggedly gnawed off at the hip and his innards hung from the foetid carcass dangling in wormy loops in front of redmans face had it not been for the thick smoke the smell of the body would have been overpowering as it was redman was simply revolted and his revulsion gave strength to his arm he hauled lacey out of the shadow of the body and pushed him through the door outside the straw was no longer blazing as brightly but the light of fire and candles and burning body still made him squint after the dark interior come on lad he said lifting the kid through the flames the boys eyes were buttonbright lunaticbright they said futility they crossed the sty to the gate skipping leverthals corpse and headed into the darkness of the open field the boy seemed to be stirring from his stricken state with every step they took away from the farm behind them the sty was already a blazing memory ahead the night was as still and impenetrable as ever redman tried not to think of the pig it must be dead by now surely but as they ran there seemed to be a noise in the earth as something huge kept pace with them content to keep its distance wary now but relentless in its pursuit he dragged on laceys arm and hurried on the ground sun baked beneath their feet lacey was whimpering now no words as yet but sound at least it was a good sign a sign redman needed hed had about his fill of insanity they reached the building without incident the corridors were as empty as theyd been when hed left an hour ago perhaps nobody had found slapes corpse yet it was possible none of the boys had seemed in a fit mood for recreation perhaps they had slipped silently to their dormitories to sleep off their worship it was time to find a phone and call the police man and boy walked down the corridor towards the governors office hand in hand lacey had fallen silent again but his expression was no longer so manic it looked as though cleansing tears might be close he sniffed made noises in his throat his grip on redmans hand tightened then relaxed completely ahead the vestibule was in darkness somebody had smashed the bulb recently it still rocked gently on its cable illuminated by a seepage of dull light from the window come on theres nothing to be afraid of come on boy lacey bent to redmans hand and bit the flesh the trick was so quick he let the boy go before he could prevent himself and lacey was showing his heels as he scooted away down the corridor away from the vestibule no matter he couldnt get far for once redman was glad the place had walls and bars redman crossed the darkened vestibule to the secretarys office nothing moved whoever had broken the bulb was keeping very quiet very still the telephone had been smashed too not just broken smashed to smithereens redman doubled back to the governors room there was a telephone there hed not be stopped by vandals the door was locked of course but redman was prepared for that he smashed the frosted glass in the window of the door with his elbow and reached through to the other side no key there to hell with it he thought and put his shoulder to the door it was sturdy strong wood and the lock was good quality his shoulder ached and the wound in his stomach had reopened by the time the lock gave and he gained access to the room the floor was littered with straw the smell inside made the sty seem sweet the governor was lying behind his desk his heart eaten out the pig said redman the pig the pig and saying the pig he reached for the phone a sound he turned and met the blow fullface it broke his cheekbone and his nose the room mottled and went white the vestibule was no longer dark candles were burning it seemed hundreds of them in every corner on every edge but then his head was swimming his eyesight blurred with concussion it could have been a single candle multiplied by senses that could no longer be trusted to tell the truth he stood in the middle of the arena of the vestibule not quite knowing how he could be standing for his legs felt numb and useless beneath him at the periphery of his vision beyond the light of the candles he could hear people talking no not really talking they werent proper words they were nonsense sounds made by people who may or may not have been there then he heard the grunt the low asthmatic grunt of the sow and straight ahead she emerged from the swimming light of the candles she was bright and beautiful no longer her flanks were charred her beady eyes withered her snout somehow twisted out of true she hobbled towards him very slowly and very slowly the figure astride her became apparent it was tommy lacey of course naked as the day he was born his body as pink and as hairless as one of her farrow his face as innocent of human feeling his eyes were now her eyes as he guided the great sow by her ears and the noise of the sow the snaffling sound was not out of the pigs mouth but out of his his was the voice of the pig redman said his name quietly not lacey but tommy the boy seemed not to hear only then as the pig and her rider approached did redman register why he hadnt fallen on his face there was a rope around his neck even as he thought the thought the noose tightened and he was hauled off his feet into the air no pain but a terrible horror worse so much worse than pain opened in him a gorge of loss and regret and all he was sank away into it below him the sow and the boy had come to a halt beneath his jangling feet the boy still grunting had climbed off the pig and was squatting down beside the beast through the greying air redman could see the curve of the boys spine the flawless skin of his back he saw too the knotted rope that protruded from between his pale buttocks the end frayed for all the world like the tail of a pig the sow put its head up though its eyes were beyond seeing he liked to think that she suffered and would suffer now until she died it was almost sufficient to think of that then the sows mouth opened and she spoke he wasnt certain how the words came but they came a boys voice lilting this is the state of the beast it said to eat and be eaten then the sow smiled and redman felt though he had believed himself numb the first shock of pain as laceys teeth bit off a piece from his foot and the boy clambered snorting up his saviours body to kiss out his life sex death and star shine diane ran her scented fingers through the two days growth of ginger stubble on terrys chin i love it she said even the grey bits she loved everything about him or at least thats what she claimed when he kissed her i love it when he undressed her i love it when he slid his briefs off i love it i love it i love it shed go down on him with such unalloyed enthusiasm all he could do was watch the top of her ashblonde head bobbing at his groin and hope to god nobody chanced to walk into the dressingroom she was a married woman after all even if she was an actress he had a wife himself somewhere this tкteаtкte would make some juicy copy for one of the local rags and here he was trying to garner a reputation as a seriousminded director no gimmicks no gossip just art then even thoughts of ambition would be dissolved on her tongue as she played havoc with his nerveendings she wasnt much of an actress but by god she was quite a performer faultless technique immaculate timing she knew either by instinct or by rehearsal just when to pick up the rhythm and bring the whole scene to a satisfying conclusion when shed finished milking the moment dry he almost wanted to applaud the whole cast of calloways production of twelfth night knew about the affair of course thered be the occasional snide comment passed if actress and director were both late for rehearsals or if she arrived looking full and he flushed he tried to persuade her to control the catwiththecream look that crept over her face but she just wasnt that good a deceiver which was rich considering her profession but then la duvall as edward insisted on calling her didnt need to be a great player she was famous so what if she spoke shakespeare like it was hiawatha dum de dum de dum de dum so what if her grasp of psychology was dubious her logic faulty her projection inadequate so what if she had as much sense of poetry as she did propriety she was a star and that meant business there was no taking that away from her her name was money the elysium theatre publicity announced her claim to fame in three inch roman bold black on yellow diane duvall star of the love child the love child possibly the worst soap opera to cavort across the screens of the nation in the history of that genre two solid hours a week of underwritten characters and mindnumbing dialogue as a result of which it consistently drew high ratings and its performers became almost overnight brilliant stars in televisions rhinestone heaven glittering there the brightest of the bright was diane duvall maybe she wasnt born to play the classics but jesus was she good boxoffice and in this day and age with theatres deserted all that mattered was the number of punters on seats calloway had resigned himself to the fact that this would not be the definitive twelfth night but if the production were successful and with diane in the role of viola it had every chance and it might open a few doors to him in the west end besides working with the everadoring everdemanding miss d duvall had its compensations galloway pulled up his serge trousers and looked down at her she was giving him that winsome smile of hers the one she used in the letter scene expression five in the duvall repertoire somewhere between virginal and motherly he acknowledged the smile with one from his own stock a small loving look that passed for genuine at a yards distance then he consulted his watch god were late sweetie she licked her lips did she really like the taste that much id better fix my hair she said standing up and glancing in the long mirror beside the shower yes are you ok couldnt be better he replied he kissed her lightly on the nose and left her to her teasing on his way to the stage he ducked into the mens dressing room to adjust his clothing and dowse his burning cheeks with cold water sex always induced a giveaway mottling on his face and upper chest bending to splash water on himself galloway studied his features critically in the mirror over the sink after thirtysix years of holding the signs of age at bay he was beginning to look the part he was no more the juvenile lead there was an indisputable puffiness beneath his eyes which was nothing to do with sleeplessness and there were lines too on his forehead and round his mouth he didnt look the wunderkind any longer the secrets of his debauchery were written all over his face the excess of sex booze and ambition the frustration of aspiring and just missing the main chance so many times what would he look like now he thought bitterly if hed been content to be some unenterprising nobody working in a minor rep guaranteed a house of ten aficionados every night and devoted to brecht face as smooth as a babys bottom probably most of the people in the sociallycommitted theatre had that look vacant and content poor cows well you pays your money and you takes your choice he told himself he took one last look at the haggard cherub in the mirror reflecting that crows feet or not women still couldnt resist him and went out to face the trials and tribulations of act iii on stage there was a heated debate in progress the carpenter his name was jake had built two hedges for olivias garden they still had to be covered with leaves but they looked quite impressive running the depth of the stage to the cyclorama where the rest of the garden would be painted none of this symbolic stuff a garden was a garden green grass blue sky thats the way the audience liked it north of birmingham and terry had some sympathy for their plain tastes terry love eddie cunningham had him by the hand and elbow escorting him into the fray whats the problem terry love you cannot be serious about these fucking hedges tell uncle eddie youre not serious before i throw a fit eddie pointed towards the offending hedges i mean look at them as he spoke a thin plume of spittle fizzed in the air whats the problem terry asked again problem blocking love blocking think about it weve rehearsed this whole scene with me bobbing up and down like a march hare up right down left but it doesnt work if i havent got access round the back and look these fucking things are flush with the backdrop well they have to be for the illusion eddie i cant get round though terry you must see my point he appealed to the few others on stage the carpenters two technicians three actors i mean theres just not enough time eddie well reblock oh that took the wind out of his sails no urn i mean it seems easiest doesnt it yes i just liked i know well needs must what about the croquet well cut that too all that business with the croquet mallets the bawdy stuff itll all have to go im sorry i havent thought this through i wasnt thinking straight eddie flounced thats all you ever do love think straight titters terry let it pass eddie had a genuine point of criticism he had failed to consider the problems of the hedgedesign im sorry about the business but theres no way we can accommodate it you wont be cutting anybody elses business im sure said eddie he threw a glance over galloways shoulder at diane then headed for the dressingroom exit enraged actor stage left calloway made no attempt to stop him it would have worsened the situation considerably to spoil his departure he just breathed out a quiet oh jesus and dragged a wide hand down over his face that was the fatal flaw of this profession actors will somebody fetch him back he said silence wheres ryan the stage manager showed his bespectacled face over the offending hedge sorry ryan love will you please take a cup of coffee to eddie and coax him back into the bosom of the family ryan pulled a face that said you offended him you fetch him but galloway had passed this particular buck before he was a past master at it he just stared at ryan defying him to contradict his request until the other man dropped his eyes and nodded his acquiescence sure he said glumly good man ryan cast him an accusatory look and disappeared in pursuit of ed cunningham no show without belch said galloway trying to warm up the atmosphere a little someone grunted and the small halfcircle of onlookers began to disperse show over ok ok said galloway picking up the pieces lets get to work well run through from the top of the scene diane are you ready yes ok shall we run it he turned away from olivias garden and the waiting actors just to gather his thoughts only the stage working lights were on the auditorium was in darkness it yawned at him insolently row upon row of empty seats defying him to entertain them ah the loneliness of the longdistance director there were days in this business when the thought of life as an accountant seemed a consummation devoutly to be wished to paraphrase the prince of denmark in the gods of the elysium somebody moved galloway looked up from his doubts and stared through the swarthy air had eddie taken residence on the very back row no surely not for one thing he hadnt had time to get all the way up there eddie galloway ventured capping his hand over his eyes is that you he could just make the figure out no not a figure figures two people edging their way along the back row making for the exit whoever it was it certainly wasnt eddie that isnt eddie is it said galloway turning back into the fake garden no someone replied it was eddie speaking he was back on stage leaning on one of the hedges cigarette clamped between his lips eddie its all right said the actor goodhumouredly dont grovel i cant bear to see a pretty man grovel well see if we can slot the malletbusiness in somewhere said calloway eager to be conciliatory eddie shook his head and flicked ash off his cigarette no need really it didnt work too well anyhow the grand circle door creaked a little as it closed behind the visitors galloway didnt bother to look round theyd gone whoever they were there was somebody in the house this afternoon hammersmith looked up from the sheets of figures he was poring over oh his eyebrows were eruptions of wirethick hair that seemed ambitious beyond their calling they were raised high above hammersmiths tiny eyes in patently fake surprise he plucked at his bottom lip with nicotine stained fingers any idea who it was he plucked on still staring up at the younger man undisguised contempt on his face is it a problem i just want to know who was in looking at the rehearsal thats all i think ive got a perfect right to ask perfect right said hammersmith nodding slightly and making his lips into a pale bow there was talk of somebody coming up from the national said galloway my agents were arranging something i just dont want somebody coming in without me knowing about it especially if theyre important hammersmith was already studying the figures again his voice was tired terry if theres someone in from the south bank to look your opus over i promise you youll be the first to be informed all right the inflexion was so bloody rude so runalonglittleboy galloway itched to hit him i dont want people watching rehearsals unless i authorize it hammersmith hear me and i want to know who was in today the manager sighed heavily believe me terry he said i dont know myself i suggest you ask tallulah she was front of house this afternoon if somebody came in presumably she saw them he sighed again all right terry calloway left it at that he had his suspicions about hammersmith the man couldnt give a shit about theatre he never failed to make that absolutely plain he affected an exhausted tone whenever anything but money was mentioned as though matters of aesthetics were beneath his notice and he had a word loudly administered for actors and directors alike butterflies one day wonders in hammersmiths world only money was forever and the elysium theatre stood on prime land land a wise man could turn a tidy profit on if he played his cards right galloway was certain hed sell off the place tomorrow if he could manoeuvre it a satellite town like redditch growing as birmingham grew didnt need theatres it needed offices hypermarkets warehouses it needed to quote the councillors growth through investment in new industry it also needed prime sites to build that industry upon no mere art could survive such pragmatism tallulah was not in the box nor in the foyer nor in the green room irritated both by hammersmiths incivility and tallulahs disappearance galloway went back into the auditorium to pick up his jacket and go to get drunk the rehearsal was over and the actors long gone the bare hedges looked somewhat small from the back row of the stalls maybe they needed an extra few inches he made a note on the back of a show bill he found in his pocket hedges bigger a footfall made him look up and a figure had appeared on stage a smooth entrance upstage centre where the hedges converged galloway didnt recognize the man mr galloway mr terence galloway yes the visitor walked down stage to where in an earlier age the footlights would have been and stood looking out into the auditorium my apologies for interrupting your train of thought no problem i wanted a word with me if you would galloway wandered down to the front of the stalls appraising the stranger he was dressed in shades of grey from head to foot a grey worsted suit grey shoes a grey cravat pisselegant was galloways first uncharitable summation but the man cut an impressive figure nevertheless his face beneath the shadow of his brim was difficult to discern allow me to introduce myself the voice was persuasive cultured ideal for advertisement voiceovers soap commercials maybe after hammersmiths bad manners the voice came as a breath of good breeding my name is lichfield not that i expect that means much to a man of your tender years tender years well well maybe there was still something of the wunderkind in his face are you a critic galloway inquired the laugh that emanated from beneath the immaculatelyswept brim was ripely ironical in the name of jesus no lichfield replied im sorry then you have me at a loss no need for an apology were you in the house this afternoon lichfield ignored the question i realize youre a busy man mr calloway and i dont want to waste your time the theatre is my business as it is yours i think we must consider ourselves allies though we have never met ah the great brotherhood it made galloway want to spit the familiar claims of sentiment when he thought of the number of socalled allies that had cheerfully stabbed him in the back and in return the playwrights whose work hed smilingly slanged the actors hed crushed with a casual quip brotherhood be damned it was dog eat dog same as any oversubscribed profession i have lichfield was saying an abiding interest in the elysium there was a curious emphasis on the word abiding it sounded positively funereal from lichfields lips abide with me oh yes ive spent many happy hours in this theatre down the years and frankly it pains me to carry this burden of news what news mr galloway i have to inform you that your twelfth night will be the last production the elysium will see the statement didnt come as much of a surprise but it still hurt and the internal wince must have registered on calloways face ah so you didnt know i thought not they always keep the artists in ignorance dont they its a satisfaction the apollonians will never relinquish the accountants revenge hammersmith said galloway hammersmith bastard his clan are never to be trusted but then i hardly need to tell you that are you sure about the closure certainly hed do it tomorrow if he could but why ive done stoppard here tennessee williams always played to good houses it doesnt make sense it makes admirable financial sense im afraid and if you think in figures as hammersmith does theres no riposte to simple arithmetic the elysiums getting old were all getting old we creak we feel our age in our joints our instinct is to lie down and be gone away gone away the voice became melodramatically thin a whisper of longing how do you know about this i was for many years a trustee of the theatre and since my retirement ive made it my business to whats the phrase keep my ear to the ground its difficult in this day and age to evoke the triumph this stage has seen his voice trailed away in a reverie it seemed true not an effect then businesslike once more this theatre is about to die mr galloway you will be present at the last rites through no fault of your own i felt you ought to be warned thank you i appreciate that tell me were you ever an actor yourself what makes you think that the voice too rhetorical by half i know my curse im afraid i can scarcely ask for a cup of coffee without sounding like lear in the storm he laughed heartily at his own expense galloway began to warm to the fellow maybe he was a little archaiclooking perhaps even slightly absurd but there was a fullbloodedness about his manner that caught galloways imagination lichfield wasnt apologetic about his love of theatre like so many in the profession people who trod the boards as a secondbest their souls sold to the movies i have i will confess dabbled in the craft a little lichfield confided but i just dont have the stamina for it im afraid now my wife wife galloway was surprised lichfield had a heterosexual bone in his body my wife constantia has played here on a number of occasions and i may say very successfully before the war of course its a pity to close the place indeed but there are no last act miracles to be performed im afraid the elysium will be rubble in six weeks time and theres an end to it i just wanted you to know that interests other than the crassly commercial are watching over this closing production think of us as guardian angels we wish you well terence we all wish you well it was a genuine sentiment simply stated galloway was touched by this mans concern and a little chastened by it it put his own steppingstone ambitions in an unflattering perspective lichfield went on we care to see this theatre end its days in suitable style then die a good death damn shame too late for regrets by a long chalk we should never have given up dionysus for apollo what sold ourselves to the accountants to legitimacy to the likes of mr hammersmith whose soul if he has one must be the size of my fingernail and grey as a louses back we should have had the courage of our depictions i think served poetry and lived under the stars galloway didnt quite follow the allusions but he got the general drift and respected the viewpoint off stage left dianes voice cut the solemn atmosphere like a plastic knife terry are you there the spell was broken galloway hadnt been aware how hypnotic lichfields presence was until that other voice came between them listening to him was like being rocked in familiar arms lichfield stepped to the edge of the stage lowering his voice to a conspiratorial rasp one last thing terence yes your viola she lacks if youll forgive my pointing it out the special qualities required for the role galloway hung fire i know lichfield continued personal loyalties prevent honesty in these matters no galloway replied youre right but shes popular so was bearbaiting terence a luminous smile spread beneath the brim hanging in the shadow like the grin of the cheshire gat im only joking said lichfield his rasp a chuckle now bears can be charming terry there you are diane appeared overdressed as usual from behind the tabs there was surely an embarrassing confrontation in the air but lichfield was walking away down the false perspective of the hedges towards the backdrop here i am said terry who are you talking to but lichfield had exited as smoothly and as quietly as he had entered diane hadnt even seen him go oh just an angel said galloway the first dress rehearsal wasnt all things considered as bad as galloway had anticipated it was immeasurably worse cues were lost props mislaid entrances missed the comic business seemed illcontrived and laborious the performances either hopelessly overwrought or trifling this was a twelfth night that seemed to last a year halfway through the third act galloway glanced at his watch and realized an uncut performance of macbeth would now be over he sat in the stalls with his head buried in his hands contemplating the work that he still had to do if he was to bring this production up to scratch not for the first time on this show he felt helpless in the face of the casting problems cues could be tightened props rehearsed with entrances practised until they were engraved on the memory but a bad actor is a bad actor is a bad actor he could labour till doomsday neatening and sharpening but he could not make a silk purse of the sows ear that was diane duvall with all the skill of an acrobat she contrived to skirt every significance to ignore every opportunity to move the audience to avoid every nuance the playwright would insist on putting in her way it was a performance heroic in its ineptitude reducing the delicate characterization galloway had been at pains to create to a singlenote whine this viola was soapopera pap less human than the hedges and about as green the critics would slaughter her worse than that lichfield would be disappointed to his considerable surprise the impact of lichfields appearance hadnt dwindled galloway couldnt forget his actorly projection his posing his rhetoric it had moved him more deeply than he was prepared to admit and the thought of this twelfth night with this viola becoming the swansong of lichfields beloved elysium perturbed and embarrassed him it seemed somehow ungrateful hed been warned often enough about a directors burdens long before he became seriously embroiled in the profession his dear departed guru at the actors centre wellbeloved had told galloway from the beginning a director is the loneliest creature on gods earth he knows whats good and bad in a show or he should if hes worth his salt and he has to carry that information around with him and keep smiling it hadnt seemed so difficult at the time this job isnt about succeeding wellbeloved used to say its about learning not to fall on your sodding face good advice as it turned out he could still see wellbeloved handing out that wisdom on a plate his bald head shiny his living eye glittering with cynical delight no man on earth galloway had thought loved theatre with more passion than wellbeloved and surely no man could have been more scathing about its pretensions it was almost one in the morning by the time theyd finished the wretched runthrough gone through the notes and separated glum and mutually resentful into the night galloway wanted none of their company tonight no late drinking in one or others digs no mutual egomassage he had a cloud of gloom all to himself and neither wine women nor song would disperse it he could barely bring himself to look diane in the face his notes to her broadcast in front of the rest of the cast had been acidic not that it would do much good in the foyer he met tallulah still spry though it was long after an old ladys bedtime are you locking up tonight he asked her more for something to say than because he was actually curious i always lock up she said she was well over seventy too old for her job in the box office and too tenacious to be easily removed but then that was all academic now wasnt it he wondered what her response would be when she heard the news of the closure it would probably break her brittle heart hadnt hammersmith once told him tallulah had been at the theatre since she was a girl of fifteen well goodnight tallulah she gave him a tiny nod as always then she reached out and took galloways arm yes mr lichfield she began what about mr lichfield he didnt like the rehearsal he was in tonight oh yes she replied as though galloway was an imbecile for thinking otherwise of course he was in i didnt see him well no matter he wasnt very pleased galloway tried to sound indifferent it cant be helped your show is very close to his heart i realize that said galloway avoiding tallulahs accusing looks he had quite enough to keep him awake tonight without her disappointed tones ringing in his ears he loosed his arm and made for the door tallulah made no attempt to stop him she just said you should have seen constantia constantia where had he heard that name of course lichfields wife she was a wonderful viola he was too tired for this mooning over dead actresses she was dead wasnt she he had said she was dead hadnt he wonderful said tallulah again goodnight tallulah ill see you tomorrow the old crone didnt answer if she was offended by his brusque manner then so be it he left her to her complaints and faced the street it was late november and chilly no balm in the night air just the smell of tar from a freshly laid road and grit in the wind galloway pulled his jacket collar up around the back of his neck and hurried off to the questionable refuge of murphys bed and breakfast in the foyer tallulah turned her back on the cold and dark of the outside world and shuffled back into the temple of dreams it smelt so weary now stale with use and age like her own body it was time to let natural processes take their toll there was no point in letting things run beyond their allotted span that was as true of buildings as of people but the elysium had to die as it had lived in glory respectfully she drew back the red curtains that covered the portraits in the corridor that led from foyer to stalls barrymore irving great names and great actors stained and faded pictures perhaps but the memories were as sharp and as refreshing as spring water and in pride of place the last of the line to be unveiled a portrait of constantia lichfield a face of transcendent beauty a bone structure to make an anatomist weep she had been far too young for lichfield of course and that had been part of the tragedy of it lichfield the svengali a man twice her age had been capable of giving his brilliant beauty everything she desired fame money companionship everything but the gift she most required life itself shed died before she was yet twenty a cancer in the breast taken so suddenly it was still difficult to believe shed gone tears brimmed in tallulahs eyes as she remembered that lost and wasted genius so many parts constantia would have illuminated had she been spared cleopatra hedda rosalind electra but it wasnt to be shed gone extinguished like a candle in a hurricane and for those who were left behind life was a slow and joyless march through a cold land there were mornings now stirring to another dawn when she would turn over and pray to die in her sleep the tears were quite blinding her now she was awash and oh dear there was somebody behind her probably mr galloway back for something and here was she sobbing fit to burst behaving like the silly old woman she knew he thought her to be a young man like him what did he understand about the pain of the years the deep ache of irretrievable loss that wouldnt come to him for a while yet sooner than he thought but a while nevertheless tallie somebody said she knew who it was richard walden lichfield she turned round and he was standing no more than six feet from her as fine a figure of a man as ever she remembered him to be he must be twenty years older than she was but age didnt seem to bow him she felt ashamed of her tears tallie he said kindly i know its a little late but i felt youd surely want to say hello hello the tears were clearing and now she saw lichfields companion standing a respectful foot or two behind him partially obscured the figure stepped out of lichfields shadow and there was a luminous fineboned beauty tallulah recognized as easily as her own reflection time broke in pieces and reason deserted the world longedfor faces were suddenly back to fill the empty nights and offer fresh hope to a life grown weary why should she argue with the evidence of her eyes it was constantia the radiant constantia who was looping her arm through lichfields and nodding gravely at tallulah in greeting dear dead constantia the rehearsal was called for ninethirty the following morning diane duvall made an entrance her customary half hour late she looked as though she hadnt slept all night sorry im late she said her open vowels oozing down the aisle towards the stage galloway was in no mood for footkissing weve got an opening tomorrow he snapped and everybodys been kept waiting by you oh really she fluttered trying to be devastating it was too early in the morning and the effect fell on stony ground ok were going from the top galloway announced and everybody please have your copies and a pen ive got a list of cuts here and i want them rehearsed in by lunchtime ryan have you got the prompt copy there was a hurried exchange with the asm and an apologetic negative from ryan well get it and i dont want any complaints from anyone its too late in the day last nights run was a wake not a performance the cues took forever the business was ragged im going to cut and its not going to be very palatable it wasnt the complaints came warning or no the arguments the compromises the sour faces and muttered insults galloway would have rather been hanging by his toes from a trapeze than manoeuvring fourteen highlystrung people through a play twothirds of them scarcely understood and the other third couldnt give a monkeys about it was nervewracking it was made worse because all the time he had the prickly sense of being watched though the auditorium was empty from gods to front stalls maybe lichfield had a spy hole somewhere he thought then condemned the idea as the first signs of budding paranoia at last lunch galloway knew where hed find diane and he was prepared for the scene he had to play with her accusations tears reassurance tears again reconciliation standard format he knocked on the stars door who is it was she crying already or talking through a glass of something comforting its me oh can i come in yes she had a bottle of vodka good vodka and a glass no tears as yet im useless arent i she said almost as soon as hed closed the door her eyes begged for contradiction dont be silly he hedged i could never get the hang of shakespeare she pouted as though it were the bards fault all those bloody words the squall was on the horizon he could see it mustering its all right he lied putting his arm around her you just need a little time her face clouded we open tomorrow she said flatly the point was difficult to refute theyll tear me apart wont they he wanted to say no but his tongue had a fit of honesty yes unless ill never work again will i harry talked me into this that damn halfwitted jew good for my reputation he said bound to give me a bit more clout he said what does he know takes his ten bloody per cent and leaves me holding the baby im the one who looks the damn fool arent i at the thought of looking a fool the storm broke no light shower this it was a cloudburst or nothing he did what he could but it was difficult she was sobbing so loudly his pearls of wisdom were drowned out so he kissed her a little as any decent director was bound to do and that seemed to do the trick he applied the technique with a little more gusto his hands straying to her breasts ferreting under her blouse for her nipples and teasing them between thumb and forefinger it worked wonders there were hints of sun between the clouds now she sniffed and unbuckled his belt letting his heat dry out the last of the rain his fingers were finding the lacy edge of her panties and she was sighing as he investigated her gently but not too gently insistent but never too insistent somewhere along the line she knocked over the vodka bottle but neither of them cared to stop and right it so it sloshed on to the floor off the edge of the table counter pointing her instructions his gasps then the bloody door opened and a draught blew up between them cooling the point at issue galloway almost turned round then realized he was unbuckled and stared instead into the mirror behind diane to see the intruders face it was lichfield he was looking straight at galloway his face impassive im sorry i should have knocked his voice was as smooth as whipped cream betraying nary a tremor of embarrassment galloway wedged himself away buckled up his belt and turned to lichfield silently cursing his burning cheeks yes it would have been polite he said again my apologies i wanted a word with his eyes so deepset they were unfathomable were on diane your star he said galloway could practically feel dianes ego expand at the word the approach confounded him had lichfield undergone a volteface was he coming here the repentant admirer to kneel at the feet of greatness i would appreciate a word with the lady in private if that were possible the mellow voice went on well we were just of course diane interrupted just allow me a moment would you she was immediately on top of the situation tears forgotten ill be just outside said lichfield already taking his leave before he had closed the door behind him diane was in front of the mirror tissuewrapped finger skirting her eye to divert a rivulet of mascara well she was cooing how lovely to have a wellwisher do you know who he is his names lichfield galloway told her he used to be a trustee of the theatre maybe he wants to offer me something i doubt it oh dont be such a drag terence she snarled you just cant bear to have anyone else get any attention can you my mistake she peered at her eyes how do i look she asked fine im sorry about before before you know oh yes ill see you in the pub eh he was summarily dismissed apparently his function as lover or confidante no longer required in the chilly corridor outside the dressing room lichfield was waiting patiently though the lights were better here than on the illlit stage and he was closer now than hed been the night before galloway could still not quite make out the face under the wide brim there was something what was the idea buzzing in his head something artificial about lichfields features the flesh of his face didnt move as interlocking system of muscle and tendon it was too stiff too pink almost like scartissue shes not quite ready galloway told him shes a lovely woman lichfield purred yes i dont blame you um shes no actress though youre not going to interfere are you lichfield i wont let you perish the thought the voyeuristic pleasure lichfield had plainly taken in his embarrassment made galloway less respectful than hed been i wont have you upsetting her my interests are your interests terence all i want to do is see this production prosper believe me am i likely under those circumstances to alarm your leading lady ill be as meek as a lamb terence whatever you are came the testy reply youre no lamb the smile appeared again on lichfields face the tissue round his mouth barely stretching to accommodate his expression galloway retired to the pub with that predatory sickle of teeth fixed in his mind anxious for no reason he could focus upon in the mirrored cell of her dressingroom diane duvall was just about ready to play her scene you may come in now mr lichfield she announced he was in the doorway before the last syllable of his name had died on her lips miss duvall he bowed slightly in deference to her she smiled so courteous will you please forgive my blundering in earlier on she looked coy it always melted men mr galloway she began a very insistent young man i think yes not above pressing his attentions on his leading lady perhaps she frowned a little a dancing pucker where the plucked arches of her brows converged im afraid so most unprofessional of him lichfield said but forgive me an understandable ardour she moved upstage of him towards the lights of her mirror and turned knowing they would backlight her hair more flatteringly well mr lichfield what can i do for you this is frankly a delicate matter said lichfield the bitter fact is how shall i put this your talents are not ideally suited to this production your style lacks delicacy there was a silence for two beats she sniffed thought about the inference of the remark and then moved out of centrestage towards the door she didnt like the way this scene had begun she was expecting an admirer and instead she had a critic on her hands get out she said her voice like slate miss duvall you heard me youre not comfortable as viola are you lichfield continued as though the star had said nothing none of your bloody business she spat back but it is i saw the rehearsals you were bland unpersuasive the comedy is flat the reunion scene it should break our hearts is leaden i dont need your opinion thank you you have no style piss off no presence and no style im sure on the television you are radiance itself but the stage requires a special truth a soulfulness you frankly lack the scene was hotting up she wanted to hit him but she couldnt find the proper motivation she couldnt take this faded poseur seriously he was more musical comedy than melodrama with his neat grey gloves and his neat grey cravat stupid waspish queen what did he know about acting get out before i call the stage manager she said but he stepped between her and the door a rape scene was that what they were playing had he got the hots for her god forbid my wife he was saying has played viola good for her and she feels she could breathe a little more life into the role than you we open tomorrow she found herself replying as though defending her presence why the hell was she trying to reason with him barging in here and making these terrible remarks maybe because she was just a little afraid his breath close to her now smelt of expensive chocolate she knows the role by heart the parts mine and im doing it im doing it even if im the worst viola in theatrical history all right she was trying to keep her composure but it was difficult something about him made her nervous it wasnt violence she feared from him but she feared something im afraid i have already promised the part to my wife what she goggled at his arrogance and constantia will play the role she laughed at the name maybe this was high comedy after all something from sheridan or wilde arch catty stuff but he spoke with such absolute certainty constantia will play the role as if it was all cut and dried im not discussing this any longer buster so if your wife wants to play viola shell have to do it in the fucking street all right she opens tomorrow are you deaf or stupid or both control an inner voice told her youre overplaying losing your grip on the scene whatever scene this is he stepped towards her and the mirror lights caught the face beneath the brim full on she hadnt looked carefully enough when he first made his appearance now she saw the deeplyetched lines the gougings around his eyes and his mouth it wasnt flesh she was sure of it he was wearing latex appliances and they were badly glued in place her hand all but twitched with the desire to snatch at it and uncover his real face of course that was it the scene she was playing the unmasking lets see what you look like she said and her hand was at his cheek before he could stop her his smile spreading wider as she attacked this is what he wants she thought but it was too late for regrets or apologies her fingertips had found the line of the mask at the edge of his eyesocket and curled round to take a better hold she yanked the thin veil of latex came away and his true physiognomy was exposed for the world to see diane tried to back away but his hand was in her hair all she could do was look up into that allbut fleshless face a few withered strands of muscle curled here and there and a hint of a beard hung from a leathery flap at his throat but all living tissue had long since decayed most of his face was simply bone stained and worn i was not said the skull embalmed unlike constantia the explanation escaped diane she made no sound of protest which the scene would surely have justified all she could summon was a whimper as his handhold tightened and he hauled her head back we must make a choice sooner or later said lichfield his breath smelling less like chocolate than profound putrescence between serving ourselves and serving our art she didnt quite understand the dead must choose more carefully than the living we cannot waste our breath if youll excuse the phrase on less than the purest delights you dont want art i think do you she shook her head hoping to god that was the expected response you want the life of the body not the life of the imagination and you may have it thank you if you want it enough you may have it suddenly his hand which had been pulling on her hair so painfully was cupped behind her head and bringing her lips up to meet his she would have screamed then as his rotting mouth fastened itself on to hers but his greeting was so insistent it quite took her breath away ryan found diane on the floor of her dressingroom a few minutes before two it was difficult to work out what had happened there was no sign of a wound of any kind on her head or body nor was she quite dead she seemed to be in a coma of some kind she had perhaps slipped and struck her head as she fell whatever the cause she was out for the count they were hours away from a final dress rehearsal and viola was in an ambulance being taken into intensive care the sooner they knock this place down the better said hammersmith hed been drinking during office hours something galloway had never seen him do before the whisky bottle stood on his desk beside a halffull glass there were glassmarks ringing his accounts and his hand had a bad dose of the shakes whats the news from the hospital shes a beautiful woman he said staring at the glass galloway could have sworn he was on the verge of tears hammersmith how is she shes in a coma but her condition is stable thats something i suppose hammersmith stared up at galloway his erupting brows knitted in anger you runt he said you were screwing her werent you fancy yourself like that dont you well let me tell you something diane duvall is worth a dozen of you a dozen is that why you let this last production go on hammersmith because youd seen her and you wanted to get your hot little hands on her you wouldnt understand youve got your brain in your pants he seemed genuinely offended by the interpretation galloway had put on his admiration for miss duvall all right have it your way we still have no viola thats why im cancelling said hammersmith slowing down to savour the moment it had to come without diane duvall there would be no twelfth night and maybe it was better that way a knock on the door who the fucks that said hammersmith softly come it was lichfield galloway was almost glad to see that strange scarred face though he had a lot of questions to ask of lichfield about the state hed left diane in about their conversation together it wasnt an interview he was willing to conduct in front of hammersmith besides any halfformed accusations he might have had were countered by the mans presence here if lichfield had attempted violence on diane for whatever reason was it likely that he would come back so soon so smilingly who are you hammersmith demanded richard walden lichfield im none the wiser i used to be a trustee of the elysium oh i make it my business what do you want hammersmith broke in irritated by lichfields poise i hear the production is in jeopardy lichfield replied unruffled no jeopardy said hammersmith allowing himself a twitch at the corner of his mouth no jeopardy at all because theres no show its been cancelled oh lichfield looked at galloway is this with your consent he asked he has no say in the matter i have sole right of cancellation if circumstances dictate it its in his contract the theatre is closed as of today it will not reopen yes it will said lichfield what hammersmith stood up behind his desk and galloway realized hed never seen the man standing before he was very short we will play twelfth night as advertised lichfield purred my wife has kindly agreed to understudy the part of viola in place of miss duvall hammersmith laughed a coarse butchers laugh it died on his lips however as the office was suffused with lavender and constantia lichfield made her entrance shimmering in silk and fur she looked as perfect as the day she died even hammersmith held his breath and his silence at the sight of her our new viola lichfield announced after a moment hammersmith found his voice this woman cant step in at half a days notice why not said galloway not taking his eyes off the woman lichfield was a lucky man constantia was an extraordinary beauty he scarcely dared draw breath in her presence for fear shed vanish then she spoke the lines were from act v scene i if nothing lets to make us happy both but this my masculine usurpd attire do not embrace me till each circumstance of place time fortune do cohere and jump that i am viola the voice was light and musical but it seemed to resound in her body filling each phrase with an undercurrent of suppressed passion and that face it was wonderfully alive the features playing the story of her speech with delicate economy she was enchanting im sorry said hammersmith but there are rules and regulations about this sort of thing is she equity no said lichfield well you see its impossible the union strictly precludes this kind of thing theyd flay us alive whats it to you hammersmith said galloway what the fuck do you care youll never need set foot in a theatre again once this place is demolished my wife has watched the rehearsals she is word perfect it could be magic said galloway his enthusiasm firing up with every moment he looked at constantia youre risking the union galloway hammersmith chided ill take that risk as you say its nothing to me but if a little bird was to tell them youd have egg on your face hammersmith give her a chance give all of us a chance if equity blacks me thats my lookout hammersmith sat down again nobodyll come you know that dont you diane duvall was a star they would have sat through your turgid production to see her galloway but an unknown well its your funeral go ahead and do it i wash my hands of the whole thing its on your head galloway remember that i hope they flay you for it thank you said lichfield most kind hammersmith began to rearrange his desk to give more prominence to the bottle and the glass the interview was over he wasnt interested in these butterifies any longer go away he said just go away i have one or two requests to make lichfield told galloway as they left the office alterations to the production which would enhance my wifes performance what are they for constantias comfort i would ask that the lighting levels be taken down substantially shes simply not accustomed to performing under such hot bright lights very well id also request that we install a row of footlights footlights an odd requirement i realize but she feels much happier with footlights they tend to dazzle the actors said galloway it becomes difficult to see the audience nevertheless i have to stipulate their installation ok thirdly i would ask that all scenes involving kissing embracing or otherwise touching constantia be redirected to remove every instance of physical contact whatsoever everything everything for gods sake why my wife needs no business to dramatize the working of the heart terence that curious intonation on the word heart working of the heart galloway caught constantias eye for the merest of moments it was like being blessed shall we introduce our new viola to the company lichfield suggested why not the trio went into the theatre the rearranging of the blocking and the business to exclude any physical contact was simple and though the rest of the cast were initially wary of their new colleague her unaffected manner and her natural grace soon had them at her feet besides her presence meant that the show would go on at six galloway called a break announcing that theyd begin the dress at eight and telling them to go out and enjoy themselves for an hour or so the company went their ways buzzing with a newfound enthusiasm for the production what had looked like a shambles half a day earlier now seemed to be shaping up quite well there were a thousand things to be sniped at of course technical shortcomings costumes that fitted badly directorial foibles all par for the course in fact the actors were happier than theyd been in a good while even ed cunningham was not above passing a compliment or two lichfield found tallulah in the green room tidying tonight yes sir you must not be afraid im not afraid tallulah replied what a thought as if there may be some pain which i regret for you indeed for all of us i understand of course you do you love the theatre as i love it you know the paradox of this profession to play life ah tallulah to play life what a curious thing it is sometimes i wonder you know how long i can keep up the illusion its a wonderful performance she said do you think so do you really think so he was encouraged by her favourable review it was so gaffing to have to pretend all the time to fake the flesh the breath the look of life grateful for tallulahs opinion he reached for her would you like to die tallulah does it hurt scarcely at all it would make me very happy and so it should his mouth covered her mouth and she was dead in less than a minute conceding happily to his inquiring tongue he laid her out on the threadbare couch and locked the door of the green room with her own key shed cool easily in the chill of the room and be up and about again by the time the audience arrived at sixfifteen diane duvall got out of a taxi at the front of the elysium it was well dark a windy november night but she felt fine nothing could depress tonight not the dark not the cold unseen she made her way past the posters that bore her face and name and through the empty auditorium to her dressingroom there smoking his way through a pack of cigarettes she found the object of her affection terry she posed in the doorway for a moment letting the fact of her reappearance sink in he went quite white at the sight of her so she pouted a little it wasnt easy to pout there was a stiffness in the muscles of her face but she carried off the effect to her satisfaction galloway was lost for words diane looked ill no two ways about it and if shed left the hospital to take up her part in the dress rehearsal he was going to have to convince her otherwise she was wearing no makeup and her ashblonde hair needed a wash what are you doing here he asked as she closed the door behind her unfinished business she said listen ive got something to tell you god this was going to be messy weve found a replacement in the show she looked at him blankly he hurried on tripping over his own words we thought you were out of commission i mean not permanently but you know for the opening at least dont worry she said his jaw dropped a little dont worry whats it to me you said you came back to finish he stopped she was unbuttoning the top of her dress shes not serious he thought she cant be serious sex now ive done a lot of thinking in the last few hours she said as she shimmied the crumpled dress over her hips let it fall and stepped out of it she was wearing a white bra which she tried unsuccessfully to unhook ive decided i dont care about the theatre help me will you she turned round and presented her back to him automatically he unhooked the bra not really analysing whether he wanted this or not it seemed to be a fait accompli shed come back to finish what theyd been interrupted doing simple as that and despite the bizarre noises she was making in the back of her throat and the glassy look in her eyes she was still an attractive woman she turned again and galloway stared at the fullness of her breasts paler than hed remembered them but lovely his trousers were becoming uncomfortably tight and her performance was only worsening his situation the way she was grinding her hips like the rawest of soho strippers running her hands between her legs dont worry about me she said ive made up my mind all i really want she put her hands so recently at her groin on his face they were icy cold all i really want is you i cant have sex and the stage there comes a time in everyones life when decisions have to be made she licked her lips there was no film of moisture left on her mouth when her tongue had passed over it the accident made me think made me analyse what it is i really care about and frankly she was unbuckling his belt i dont give a shit now the zip about this or any other fucking play his trousers fell down ill show you what i care about she reached into his briefs and clasped him her cold hand somehow made the touch sexier he laughed closing his eyes as she pulled his briefs down to the middle of his thigh and knelt at his feet she was as expert as ever her throat open like a drain her mouth was somewhat drier than usual her tongue scouring him but the sensations drove him wild it was so good he scarcely noticed the ease with which she devoured him taking him deeper than shed ever managed previously using every trick she knew to goad him higher and higher slow and deep then picking up speed until he almost came then slowing again until the need passed he was completely at her mercy he opened his eyes to watch her at work she was skewering herself upon him face in rapture god he gasped that is so good oh yes oh yes her face didnt even flicker in response to his words she just continued to work at him soundlessly she wasnt making her usual noises the small grunts of satisfaction the heavy breathing through the nose she just ate his flesh in absolute silence he held his breath a moment while an idea was born in his belly the bobbing head bobbed on eyes closed lips clamped around his member utterly engrossed half a minute passed a minute a minute and a half and now his belly was full of terrors she wasnt breathing she was giving this matchless blowjob because she wasnt stopping even for a moment to inhale or exhale calloway felt his body go rigid while his erection wilted in her throat she didnt falter in her labour the relentless pumping continued at his groin even as his mind formed the unthinkable thought shes dead she has me in her mouth in her cold mouth and shes dead thats why shed come back got up off her mortuary slab and come back she was eager to finish what shed started no longer caring about the play or her usurper it was this act she valued this act alone shed chosen to perform it for eternity galloway could do nothing with the realization but stare down like a damn fool while this corpse gave him head then it seemed she sensed his horror she opened her eyes and looked up at him how could he ever have mistaken that dead stare for life gently she withdrew his shrunken manhood from between her lips what is it she asked her fluting voice still affecting life you youre not breathing her face fell she let him go oh darling she said letting all pretence to life disappear im not so good at playing the part am i her voice was a ghosts voice thin forlorn her skin which he had thought so flatteringly pale was on second view a waxen white you are dead he said im afraid so two hours ago in my sleep but i had to come terry so much unfinished business i made my choice you should be flattered you are flattered arent you she stood up and reached into her handbag which shed left beside the mirror galloway looked at the door trying to make his limbs work but they were inert besides he had his trousers round his ankles two steps and hed fall flat on his face she turned back on him with something silver and sharp in her hand try as he might he couldnt get a focus on it but whatever it was she meant it for him since the building of the new crematorium in one humiliation had come after another for the cemetery the tombs had been raided for lead coffinlinings the stones overturned and smashed it was fouled by dogs and graffiti very few mourners now came to tend the graves the generations had dwindled and the small number of people who might still have had a loved one buried there were too infirm to risk the throttled walkways or too tender to bear looking at such vandalism it had not always been so there were illustrious and influential families interred behind the marble faзades of the victorian mausoleums founder fathers local industrialists and dignitaries any and all who had done the town proud by their efforts the body of the actress constantia lichfield had been buried here though her grave was almost unique in the attention some secret admirer still paid to it nobody was watching that night it was too bitter for lovers nobody saw charlotte hancock open the door of her sepulchre with the beating wings of pigeons applauding her vigour as she shambled out to meet the moon her husband gerard was with her he less fresh than she having been dead thirteen years longer joseph jardine en famille was not far behind the hancocks as was marriott fletcher and anne snell and the peacock brothers the list went on and on in one corner alfred crawshaw was helping his lovely wife emma from the rot of their bed everywhere faces pressed at the cracks of the tomb lids was that not kezia reynolds with her child whod lived just a day in her arms and martin van de linde whose wife had never been found rosa and selina goldfinch upstanding women both and thomas jerrey and too many names to mention too many states of decay to describe sufficient to say they rose their burial finery fly born their faces stripped of all but the foundation of beauty still they came swinging open the back gate of the cemetery and threading their way across the wasteland towards the elysium in the distance the sound of traffic above a jet roared in to land one of the peacock brothers staring up at the winking giant as it passed over missed his footing and fell on his face shattering his jaw they picked him up fondly and escorted him on his way there was no harm done and what would a resurrection be without a few laughs so the show went on if music be the food of love play on give me excess of it that surfeiting the appetite may sicken and so die galloway could not be found at curtain but ryan had instructions from hammersmith to take the show up with or without the director hell be upstairs in the gods said lichfield in fact i think i can see him from here is he smiling asked eddie grinning from ear to ear then hes pissed the actors laughed there was a good deal of laughter that night the show was running smoothly and though they couldnt see the audience over the glare of the newlyinstalled footlights they could feel the waves of love and delight pouring out of the auditorium the actors were coming off stage elated theyre all sitting in the gods said eddie but your friends mr lichfield do an old ham good theyre quiet of course but such big smiles on their faces act i scene ii and the first entrance of constantia lichfield as viola was met with spontaneous applause such applause like the hollow roll of snare drums like the brittle beating of a thousand sticks on a thousand stretched skins lavish wanton applause and my god she rose to the occasion she began the play as she meant to go on giving her whole heart to the role not needing physicality to communicate the depth of her feelings but speaking the poetry with such intelligence and passion the merest flutter of her hand was worth more than a hundred grander gestures after that first scene her every entrance was met with the same applause from the audience followed by almost reverential silence backstage a kind of buoyant confidence had set in the whole company sniffed the success a success which had been snatched miraculously from the jaws of disaster there again applause applause in his office hammersmith dimly registered the brittle din of adulation through a haze of booze he was in the act of pouring his eighth drink when the door opened he glanced up for a moment and registered that the visitor was that upstart calloway come to gloat i daresay hammersmith thought come to tell me how wrong i was what do you want the punk didnt answer from the corner of his eye hammersmith had an impression of a broad bright smile on galloways face selfsatisfied halfwit coming in here when a man was in mourning i suppose youve heard the other grunted she died said hammersmith beginning to cry she died a few hours ago without regaining consciousness i havent told the actors didnt seem worth it galloway said nothing in reply to this news didnt the bastard care couldnt he see that this was the end of the world the woman was dead shed died in the bowels of the elysium thered be official enquiries made the insurance would be examined a postmortem an inquest it would reveal too much he drank deeply from his glass not bothering to look at galloway again your careerll take a dive after this son it wont just be me oh dear no still galloway kept his silence dont you care hammersmith demanded there was silence for a moment then galloway responded i dont give a shit jumped up little stagemanager thats all you are thats all any of you fucking directors are one good review and youre gods gift to art well let me set you straight about that he looked at galloway his eyes swimming in alcohol having difficulty focussing but he got there eventually galloway the dirty bugger was naked from the waist down he was wearing his shoes and his socks but no trousers or briefs his selfexposure would have been comical but for the expression on his face the man had gone mad his eyes were rolling around uncontrollably saliva and snot ran from mouth and nose his tongue hung out like the tongue of a panting dog hammersmith put his glass down on his blotting pad and looked at the worst part there was blood on galloways shirt a trail of it which led up his neck to his left ear from which protruded the end of diane duvalls nailfile it had been driven deep into galloways brain the man was surely dead but he stood spoke walked from the theatre there rose another round of applause muted by distance it wasnt a real sound somehow it came from another world a place where emotions ruled it was a world hammersmith had always felt excluded from hed never been much of an actor though god knows hed tried and the two plays hed penned were he knew execrable bookkeeping was his forte and hed used it to stay as close to the stage as he could hating his own lack of art as much as he resented that skill in others the applause died and as if taking a cue from an unseen prompter calloway came at him the mask he wore was neither comic nor tragic it was blood and laughter together cowering hammersmith was cornered behind his desk galloway leapt on to it and seized hammersmith by the tie philistine said galloway never now to know hammersmiths heart and broke the mans neck snap while below the applause began again do not embrace me till each circumstance of place time fortune do cohere and jump that i am viola from constantias mouth the lines were a revelation it was almost as though this twelfth night were a new play and the part of viola had been written for constantia lichfield alone the actors who shared the stage with her felt their egos shrivelling in the face of such a gift the last act continued to its bittersweet conclusion the audience as enthralled as ever to judge by their breathless attention the duke spoke give me thy hand and let me see thee in thy womans weeds in the rehearsal the invitation in the line had been ignored noone was to touch this viola much less take her hand but in the heat of the performance such taboos were forgotten possessed by the passion of the moment the actor reached for constantia she forgetting the taboo in her turn reached to answer his touch in the wings lichfield breathed no under his breath but his order wasnt heard the duke grasped violas hand in his life and death holding court together under this painted sky it was a chilly hand a hand without blood in its veins or a blush in its skin but here it was as good as alive they were equals the living and the dead and nobody could find just cause to part them in the wings lichfield sighed and allowed himself a smile hed feared that touch feared it would break the spell but dionysus was with them tonight all would be well he felt it in his bones the act drew to a close and malvolio still trumpeting his threats even in defeat was carted off one by one the company exited leaving the clown to wrap up the play a great while ago the world began with hey ho the wind and the rain but thats all one our play is done and well strive to please you every day the scene darkened to blackout and the curtain descended from the gods rapturous applause erupted that same rattling hollow applause the company their faces shining with the success of the dress rehearsal formed behind the curtain for the bow the curtain rose the applause mounted in the wings galloway joined lichfield he was dressed now and hed washed the blood off his neck well we have a brilliant success said the skull it does seem a pity that this company should be dissolved so soon it does said the corpse the actors were shouting into the wings now calling for galloway to join them they were applauding him encouraging him to show his face he put a hand on lichfields shoulder well go together sir he said no no i couldnt you must its your triumph as much as mine lichfield nodded and they went out together to take their bows beside the company in the wings tallulah was at work she felt restored after her sleep in the green room so much unpleasantness had gone taken with her life she no longer suffered the aches in her hip or the creeping neuralgia in her scalp there was no longer the necessity to draw breath through pipes encrusted with seventy years muck or to rub the backs of her hands to get the circulation going not even the need to blink she laid the fires with a new strength pressing the detritus of past productions into use old backdrops props costuming when she had enough combustibles heaped she struck a match and set the flame to them the elysium began to burn over the applause somebody was shouting marvellous sweethearts marvellous it was dianes voice they all recognized it even though they couldnt quite see her she was staggering down the centre aisle towards the stage making quite a fool of herself silly bitch said eddie whoops said galloway he was at the edge of the stage now haranguing him got all you wanted now have you this your new ladylove is it is it he was trying to clamber up her hands gripping the hot metal hoods of the footlights her skin began to singe the fat was well and truly in the fire for gods sake somebody stop her said eddie but she didnt seem to feel the searing of her hands she just laughed in his face the smell of burning flesh wafted up from the footlights the company broke rank triumph forgotten somebody yelled kill the lights a beat and then the stage lights were extinguished diane fell back her hands smoking one of the cast fainted another ran into the wings to be sick somewhere behind them they could hear the faint crackle of flames but they had other calls on their attention with the footlights gone they could see the auditorium more clearly the stalls were empty but the balcony and the gods were full to bursting with eager admirers every row was packed and every available inch of aisle space thronged with audience somebody up there started clapping again alone for a few moments before the wave of applause began afresh but now few of the company took pride in it even from the stage even with exhausted and light dazzled eyes it was obvious that no man woman or child in that adoring crowd was alive they waved fine silk handkerchiefs at the players in rotted fists some of them beat a tattoo on the seats in front of them most just clapped bone on bone galloway smiled bowed deeply and received their admiration with gratitude in all his fifteen years of work in the theatre he had never found an audience so appreciative bathing in the love of their admirers constantia and richard lichfield joined hands and walked downstage to take another bow while the living actors retreated in horror they began to yell and pray they let out howls they ran about like discovered adulterers in a farce but like the farce there was no way out of the situation there were bright flames tickling the roofjoists and billows of canvas cascaded down to right and left as the flies caught fire in front the dead behind death smoke was beginning to thicken the air it was impossible to see where one was going somebody was wearing a toga of burning canvas and reciting screams someone else was wielding a fire extinguisher against the inferno all useless all tired business badly managed as the roof began to give lethal falls of timber and girder silenced most in the gods the audience had more or less departed they were ambling back to their graves long before the fire department appeared their cerements and their faces lit by the glow of the fire as they glanced over their shoulders to watch the elysium perish it had been a fine show and they were happy to go home content for another while to gossip in the dark the fire burned through the night despite the never less than gallant efforts of the fire department to put it out by four in the morning the fight was given up as lost and the conflagration allowed its head it had done with the elysium by dawn in the ruins the remains of several persons were discovered most of the bodies in states that defied easy identification dental records were consulted and one corpse was found to be that of giles hammersmith another that of ryan xavier and most shockingly a third that of diane duvall star of the love child burned to death read the tabloids she was forgotten in a week there were no survivors several bodies were simply never found they stood at the side of the motorway and watched the cars careering through the night lichfield was there of course and constantia radiant as ever galloway had chosen to go with them so had eddie and tallulah three or four others had also joined the troupe it was the first night of their freedom and here they were on the open road travelling players the smoke alone had killed eddie but there were a few more serious injuries amongst their number sustained in the fire burned bodies broken limbs but the audience they would play for in the future would forgive them their pretty mutilations there are lives lived for love said lichfield to his new company and lives lived for art we happy band have chosen the latter persuasion there was a ripple of applause amongst the actors to you who have never died may i say welcome to the world laughter further applause the lights of the cars racing north along the motorway threw the company into silhouette they looked to all intents and purposes like living men and women but then wasnt that the trick of their craft to imitate life so well the illusion was indistinguishable from the real thing and their new public awaiting them in mortuaries churchyards and chapels of rest would appreciate the skill more than most who better to applaud the sham of passion and pain they would perform than the dead who had experienced such feelings and thrown them off at last the dead they needed entertainment no less than the living and they were a sorely neglected market not that this company would perform for money they would play for the love of their art lichfield had made that clear from the outset no more service would be done to apollo now he said which road shall we take north or south north said eddie my mothers buried in glasgow she died before i ever played professionally id like her to see me north it is then said lichfield shall we go and find ourselves some transport he led the way towards the motorway restaurant its neon flickering fitfully keeping the night at lights length the colours were theatrically bright scarlet lime cobalt and a wash of white that splashed out of the windows on to the car park where they stood the automatic doors hissed as a traveller emerged bearing gifts of hamburgers and cake to the child in the back of his car surely some friendly driver will find a niche for us said lichfield all of us said galloway a truck will do beggars cant be too demanding said lichfield and we are beggars now subject to the whim of our patrons we can always steal a car said tallulah no need for theft except in extremity lichfield said constantia and i will go ahead and find a chauffeur he took his wifes hand nobody refuses beauty he said what do we do if anyone asks us what were doing here asked eddie nervously he wasnt used to this role he needed reassurance lichfield turned towards the company his voice booming in the night what do you do he said play life of course and smile in the hills the cities it wasnt until the first week of the yugoslavian trip that mick discovered what a political bigot hed chosen as a lover certainly hed been warned one of the queens at the baths had told him judd was to the right of attila the hun but the man had been one of judds exaffairs and mick had presumed there was more spite than perception in the character assassination if only hed listened then he wouldnt be driving along an interminable road in a volkswagen that suddenly seemed the size of a coffin listening to judds views on soviet expansionism jesus he was so boring he didnt converse he lectured and endlessly in italy the sermon had been on the way the communists had exploited the peasant vote now in yugoslavia judd had really warmed to his theme and mick was just about ready to take a hammer to his selfopinionated head it wasnt that he disagreed with everything judd said some of the arguments seemed quite sensible but then what did he know he was a dance teacher judd was a journalist a professional pundit he felt like most journalists mick had encountered that he was obliged to have an opinion on everything under the sun especially politics that was the best trough to wallow in you could get your snout eyes head and front hooves in that mess of muck and have a fine old time splashing around it was an inexhaustible subject to devour a swill with a little of everything in it because everything according to judd was political the arts were political sex was political religion commerce gardening eating drinking and farting all political jesus it was mindblowingly boring killingly love deadeningly boring worse still judd didnt seem to notice how bored mick had become or if he noticed he didnt care he just rambled on his arguments getting windier and windier his sentences lengthening with every mile they drove judd mick had decided was a selfish bastard and as soon as their honeymoon was over hed part with the guy it was not until their trip that endless motiveless caravan through the graveyards of mideuropean culture that judd realized what a political lightweight he had in mick the guy showed precious little interest in the economics or the politics of the countries they passed through he registered indifference to the full facts behind the italian situation and yawned yes yawned when he tried to debate the russian threat to world peace he had to face the bitter truth mick was a queen there was no other word for him all right perhaps he didnt mince or wear jewellery to excess but he was a queen nevertheless happy to wallow in a dreamworld of early renaissance frescoes and yugoslavian icons the complexities the contradictions even the agonies that made those cultures blossom and wither were just tiresome to him his mind was no deeper than his looks he was a wellgroomed nobody some honeymoon the road south from belgrade to novi pazar was by yugoslavian standards a good one there were fewer potholes than on many of the roads theyd travelled and it was relatively straight the town of novi pazar lay in the valley of the river raska south of the city named after the river it wasnt an area particularly popular with the tourists despite the good road it was still inaccessible and lacked sophisticated amenities but mick was determined to see the monastery at sopocani to the west of the town and after some bitter argument hed won the journey had proved uninspiring on either side of the road the cultivated fields looked parched and dusty the summer had been unusually hot and droughts were affecting many of the villages crops had failed and livestock had been prematurely slaughtered to prevent them dying of malnutrition there was a defeated look about the few faces they glimpsed at the roadside even the children had dour expressions brows as heavy as the stale heat that hung over the valley now with the cards on the table after a row at belgrade they drove in silence most of the time but the straight road like most straight roads invited dispute when the driving was easy the mind rooted for something to keep it engaged what better than a fight why the hell do you want to see this damn monastery judd demanded it was an unmistakable invitation weve come all this way mick tried to keep the tone conversational he wasnt in the mood for an argument more fucking virgins is it keeping his voice as even as he could mick picked up the guide and read aloud from it there some of the greatest works of serbian painting can still be seen and enjoyed including what many commentators agree to be the enduring masterpiece of the raska school the dormition of the virgin silence then judd im up to here with churches its a masterpiece theyre all masterpieces according to that bloody book mick felt his control slipping two and a half hours at most i told you i dont want to see another church the smell of the places makes me sick stale incense old sweat and lies its a short detour then we can get back on to the road and you can give me another lecture on farming subsidies in the sandzak im just trying to get some decent conversation going instead of this endless tripe about serbian fucking masterpieces stop the car what stop the car judd pulled the volkswagen into the side of the road mick got out the road was hot but there was a slight breeze he took a deep breath and wandered into the middle of the road empty of traffic and of pedestrians in both directions in every direction empty the hills shimmered in the heat off the fields there were wild poppies growing in the ditches mick crossed the road squatted on his haunches and picked one behind him he heard the vws door slam what did you stop us for judd said his voice was edgy still hoping for that argument begging for it mick stood up playing with the poppy it was close to seeding late in the season the petals fell from the receptacle as soon as he touched them little splashes of red fluttering down on to the grey tarmac i asked you a question judd said again mick looked round judd was standing the far side of the car his brows a knitted line of burgeoning anger but handsome oh yes a face that made women weep with frustration that he was gay a heavy black moustache and eyes you could watch forever and never see the same light in them twice why in gods name thought mick does a man as fine as that have to be such an insensitive little shit judd returned the look of contemptuous appraisal staring at the pouting pretty boy across the road it made him want to puke seeing the little act mick was performing for his benefit it might just have been plausible in a sixteenyearold virgin in a twentyfiveyearold it lacked credibility mick dropped the flower and untucked his tshirt from his jeans a tight stomach then a slim smooth chest were revealed as he pulled it off his hair was ruffled when his head reappeared and his face wore a broad grin judd looked at the torso neat not too muscular an appendix scar peering over his faded jeans a gold chain small but catching the sun dipped in the hollow of his throat without meaning to he returned micks grin and a kind of peace was made between them mick was unbuckling his belt want to fuck he said the grin not faltering its no use came an answer though not to that question what isnt were not compatible want a bet now he was unzipped and turning away towards the wheatfield that bordered the road judd watched as mick cut a swathe through the swaying sea his back the colour of the grain so that he was almost camouflaged by it it was a dangerous game screwing in the open air this wasnt san francisco or even hampstead heath nervously judd glanced along the road still empty in both directions and mick was turning deep in the field turning and smiling and waving like a swimmer buoyed up in a golden surf what the hell there was nobody to see nobody to know just the hills liquid in the heathaze their forested backs bent to the business of the earth and a lost dog sitting at the edge of the road waiting for some lost master judd followed micks path through the wheat unbuttoning his shirt as he walked fieldmice ran ahead of him scurrying through the stalks as the giant came their way his feet like thunder judd saw their panic and smiled he meant no harm to them but then how were they to know that maybe hed put out a hundred lives mice beetles worms before he reached the spot where mick was lying stark bollock naked on a bed of trampled grain still grinning it was good love they made good strong love equal in pleasure for both there was a precision to their passion sensing the moment when effortless delight became urgent when desire became necessity they locked together limb around limb tongue around tongue in a knot only orgasm could untie their backs alternately scorched and scratched as they rolled around exchanging blows and kisses in the thick of it creaming together they heard the phutphutphut of a tractor passing by but they were past caring they made their way back to the volkswagen with bodythreshed wheat in their hair and their ears in their socks and between their toes their grins had been replaced with easy smiles the truce if not permanent would last a few hours at least the car was baking hot and they had to open all the windows and doors to let the breeze cool it before they started towards novi pazar it was four oclock and there was still an hours driving ahead as they got into the car mick said well forget the monastery eh judd gaped i thought i couldnt bear another fucking virgin they laughed lightly together then kissed tasting each other and themselves a mingling of saliva and the aftertaste of salt semen the following day was bright but not particularly warm no blue skies just an even layer of white cloud the morning air was sharp in the lining of the nostrils like ether or peppermint vaslav jelovsek watched the pigeons in the main square of popolac courting death as they skipped and fluttered ahead of the vehicles that were buzzing around some about military business some civilian an air of sober intention barely suppressed the excitement he felt on this day an excitement he knew was shared by every man woman and child in popolac shared by the pigeons too for all he knew maybe that was why they played under the wheels with such dexterity knowing that on this day of days no harm could come to them he scanned the sky again that same white sky hed been peering at since dawn the cloudlayer was low not ideal for the celebrations a phrase passed through his mind an english phrase hed heard from a friend to have your head in the clouds it meant he gathered to be lost in a reverie in a white sightless dream that he thought wryly was all the west knew about clouds that they stood for dreams it took a vision they lacked to make a truth out of that casual turn of phrase here in these secret hills wouldnt they create a spectacular reality from those idle words a living proverb a head in the clouds already the first contingent was assembling in the square there were one or two absentees owing to illness but the auxiliaries were ready and waiting to take their places such eagerness such wide smiles when an auxiliary heard his or her name and number called and was taken out of line to join the limb that was already taking shape on every side miracles of organization everyone with a job to do and a place to go there was no shouting or pushing indeed voices were scarcely raised above an eager whisper he watched in admiration as the work of positioning and buckling and roping went on it was going to be a long and arduous day vaslav had been in the square since an hour before dawn drinking coffee from imported plastic cups discussing the halfhourly meteorological reports coming in from pristina and mitrovica and watching the starless sky as the grey light of morning crept across it now he was drinking his sixth coffee of the day and it was still barely seven oclock across the square metzinger looked as tired and as anxious as vaslav felt theyd watched the dawn seep out of the east together metzinger and he but now they had separated forgetting previous companionship and would not speak until the contest was over after all metzinger was from podujevo he had his own city to support in the coming battle tomorrow theyd exchange tales of their adventures but for today they must behave as if they didnt know each other not even to exchange a smile for today they had to be utterly partisan caring only for the victory of their own city over the opposition now the first leg of popolac was erected to the mutual satisfaction of metzinger and vaslav all the safety checks had been meticulously made and the leg left the square its shadow falling hugely across the face of the town hall vaslav sipped his sweet sweet coffee and allowed himself a little grunt of satisfaction such days such days days filled with glory with snapping flags and high stomachturning sights enough to last a man a lifetime it was a golden foretaste of heaven let america have its simple pleasures its cartoon mice its candycoated castles its cults and its technologies he wanted none of it the greatest wonder of the world was here hidden in the hills ah such days in the main square of podujevo the scene was no less animated and no less inspiring perhaps there was a muted sense of sadness underlying this years celebration but that was understandable nita obrenovic podujevos loved and respected organizer was no longer living the previous winter had claimed her at the age of ninetyfour leaving the city bereft of her fierce opinions and her fiercer proportions for sixty years nita had worked with the citizens of podujevo always planning for the next contest and improving on the designs her energies spent on making the next creation more ambitious and more lifelike than the last now she was dead and sorely missed there was no disorganization in the streets without her the people were far too disciplined for that but they were already falling behind schedule and it was almost seventwentyfive nitas daughter had taken over in her mothers stead but she lacked nitas power to galvanize the people into action she was in a word too gentle for the job in hand it required a leader who was part prophet and part ringmaster to coax and bully and inspire the citizens into their places maybe after two or three decades and with a few more contests under her belt nita obrenovics daughter would make the grade but for today podujevo was behindhand safetychecks were being overlooked nervous looks replaced the confidence of earlier years nevertheless at six minutes before eight the first limb of podujevo made its way out of the city to the assembly point to wait for its fellow by that time the flanks were already lashed together in popolac and armed contingents were awaiting orders in the town square mick woke promptly at seven though there was no alarm clock in their simply furnished room at the hotel beograd he lay in his bed and listened to judds regular breathing from the twin bed across the room a dull morning light whimpered through the thin curtains not encouraging an early departure after a few minutes staring at the cracked paintwork on the ceiling and a while longer at the crudely carved crucifix on the opposite wall mick got up and went to the window it was a dull day as he had guessed the sky was overcast and the roofs of novi pazar were grey and featureless in the flat morning light but beyond the roofs to the east he could see the hills there was sun there he could see shafts of light catching the bluegreen of the forest inviting a visit to their slopes today maybe they would go south to kosovska mitrovica there was a market there wasnt there and a museum and they could drive down the valley of the ibar following the road beside the river where the hills rose wild and shining on either side the hills yes today he decided they would see the hills it was eightfifteen by nine the main bodies of popolac and podujevo were substantially assembled in their allotted districts the limbs of both cities were ready and waiting to join their expectant torsos vaslav jelovsek capped his gloved hands over his eyes and surveyed the sky the cloudbase had risen in the last hour no doubt of it and there were breaks in the clouds to the west even on occasion a few glimpses of the sun it wouldnt be a perfect day for the contest perhaps but certainly adequate mick and judd breakfasted late on hemendeks roughly translated as ham and eggs and several cups of good black coffee it was brightening up even in novi pazar and their ambitions were set high kosovska mitrovica by lunchtime and maybe a visit to the hillcastle of zvecan in the afternoon about ninethirty they motored out of novi pazar and took the srbovac road south to the ibar valley not a good road but the bumps and potholes couldnt spoil the new day the road was empty except for the occasional pedestrian and in place of the maize and corn fields theyd passed on the previous day the road was flanked by undulating hills whose sides were thickly and darkly forested apart from a few birds they saw no wildlife even their infrequent travelling companions petered out altogether after a few miles and the occasional farmhouse they drove by appeared locked and shuttered up black pigs ran unattended in the yard with no child to feed them washing snapped and billowed on a sagging line with no washerwoman in sight at first this solitary journey through the hills was refreshing in its lack of human contact but as the morning drew on an uneasiness grew on them shouldnt we have seen a signpost to mitrovica mick he peered at the map maybe weve taken the wrong road if thered been a sign id have seen it i think we should try and get off this road bear south a bit more meet the valley closer to mitrovica than wed planned how do we get off this bloody road thereve been a couple of turnings dirttracks well its either that or going on the way we are judd pursed his lips cigarette he asked finished them miles back in front of them the hills formed an impenetrable line there was no sign of life ahead no frail wisp of chimney smoke no sound of voice or vehicle all right said judd we take the next turning anythings better than this they drove on the road was deteriorating rapidly the potholes becoming craters the hummocks feeling like bodies beneath the wheels then there a turning a palpable turning not a major road certainly in fact barely the dirttrack judd had described the other roads as being but it was an escape from the endless perspective of the road they were trapped on this is becoming a bloody safari said judd as the vw began to bump and grind its way along the doleful little track wheres your sense of adventure i forgot to pack it they were beginning to climb now as the track wound its way up into the hills the forest closed over them blotting out the sky so a shifting patchwork of light and shadow scooted over the bonnet as they drove there was birdsong suddenly vacuous and optimistic and a smell of new pine and undug earth a fox crossed the track up ahead and watched a long moment as the car grumbled up towards it then with the leisurely stride of a fearless prince it sauntered away into the trees wherever they were going mick thought this was better than the road theyd left soon maybe theyd stop and walk a while to find a promontory from which they could see the valley even novi pazar nestled behind them the two men were still an hours drive from popolac when the head of the contingent at last marched out of the town square and took up its position with the main body this last exit left the city completely deserted not even the sick or the old were neglected on this day noone was to be denied the spectacle and the triumph of the contest every single citizen however young or infirm the blind the crippled babes in arms pregnant women all made their way up from their proud city to the stamping ground it was the law that they should attend but it needed no enforcing no citizen of either city would have missed the chance to see that sight to experience the thrill of that contest the confrontation had to be total city against city this was the way it had always been so the cities went up into the hills by noon they were gathered the citizens of popolac and podujevo in the secret well of the hills hidden from civilized eyes to do ancient and ceremonial battle tens of thousands of hearts beat faster tens of thousands of bodies stretched and strained and sweated as the twin cities took their positions the shadows of the bodies darkened tracts of land the size of small towns the weight of their feet trampled the grass to a green milk their movement killed animals crushed bushes and threw down trees the earth literally reverberated with their passage the hills echoing with the booming din of their steps in the towering body of podujevo a few technical hitches were becoming apparent a slight flaw in the knitting of the left flank had resulted in a weakness there and there were consequent problems in the swivelling mechanism of the hips it was stiffer than it should be and the movements were not smooth as a result there was considerable strain being put upon that region of the city it was being dealt with bravely after all the contest was intended to press the contestants to their limits but breaking point was closer than anyone would have dared to admit the citizens were not as resilient as they had been in previous contests a bad decade for crops had produced bodies less wellnourished spines less supple wills less resolute the badly knitted flank might not have caused an accident in itself but further weakened by the frailty of the competitors it set a scene for death on an unprecedented scale they stopped the car hear that mick shook his head his hearing hadnt been good since he was an adolescent too many rock shows had blown his eardrums to hell judd got out of the car the birds were quieter now the noise hed heard as they drove came again it wasnt simply a noise it was almost a motion in the earth a roar that seemed seated in the substance of the hills thunder was it no too rhythmical it came again through the soles of the feet boom mick heard it this time he leaned out of the car window its up ahead somewhere i hear it now judd nodded boom the earththunder sounded again what the hell is it said mick whatever it is i want to see it judd got back into the volkswagen smiling sounds almost like guns he said starting the car big guns through his russianmade binoculars vaslav jelovsek watched the startingofficial raise his pistol he saw the feather of white smoke rise from the barrel and a second later heard the sound of the shot across the valley the contest had begun he looked up at twin towers of popolac and podujevo heads in the clouds well almost they practically stretched to touch the sky it was an awesome sight a breathstopping sleepstabbing sight two cities swaying and writhing and preparing to take their first steps towards each other in this ritual battle of the two podujevo seemed the less stable there was a slight hesitation as the city raised its left leg to begin its march nothing serious just a little difficulty in coordinating hip and thigh muscles a couple of steps and the city would find its rhythm a couple more and its inhabitants would be moving as one creature one perfect giant set to match its grace and power against its mirrorimage the gunshot had sent flurries of birds up from the trees that banked the hidden valley they rose up in celebration of the great contest chattering their excitement as they swooped over the stampingground did you hear a shot asked judd mick nodded military exercises judds smile had broadened he could see the headlines already exclusive reports of secret manoeuvres in the depths of the yugoslavian countryside russian tanks perhaps tactical exercises being held out of the wests prying sight with luck he would be the carrier of this news boom boom there were birds in the air the thunder was louder now it did sound like guns its over the next ridge said judd i dont think we should go any further i have to see i dont were not supposed to be here i dont see any signs theyll cart us away deport us i dont know i just think boom ive got to see the words were scarcely out of his mouth when the screaming started podujevo was screaming a deathcry someone buried in the weak flank had died of the strain and had begun a chain of decay in the system one man loosed his neighbour and that neighbour loosed his spreading a cancer of chaos through the body of the city the coherence of the towering structure deteriorated with terrifying rapidity as the failure of one part of the anatomy put unendurable pressure on the other the masterpiece that the good citizens of podujevo had constructed of their own flesh and blood tottered and then a dynamited skyscraper it began to fall the broken flank spewed citizens like a slashed artery spitting blood then with a graceful sloth that made the agonies of the citizens all the more horrible it bowed towards the earth all its limbs dissembling as it fell the huge head that had brushed the clouds so recently was flung back on its thick neck ten thousand mouths spoke a single scream for its vast mouth a wordless infinitely pitiable appeal to the sky a howl of loss a howl of anticipation a howl of puzzlement how that scream demanded could the day of days end like this in a welter of falling bodies did you hear that it was unmistakably human though almost deafeningly loud judds stomach convulsed he looked across at mick who was as white as a sheet judd stopped the car no said mick listen for christs sake the din of dying moans appeals and imprecations flooded the air it was very close weve got to go on now mick implored judd shook his head he was prepared for some military spectacle all the russian army massed over the next hill but that noise in his ears was the noise of human flesh too human for words it reminded him of his childhood imaginings of hell the endless unspeakable torments his mother had threatened him with if he failed to embrace christ it was a terror hed forgotten for twenty years but suddenly here it was again freshfaced maybe the pit itself gaped just over the next horizon with his mother standing at its lip inviting him to taste its punishments if you wont drive i will mick got out of the car and crossed in front of it glancing up the track as he did so there was a moments hesitation no more than a moments when his eyes flickered with disbelief before he turned towards the windscreen his face even paler than it had been previously and said jesus christ in a voice that was thick with suppressed nausea his lover was still sitting behind the wheel his head in his hands trying to blot out memories judd judd looked up slowly mick was staring at him like a wildman his face shining with a sudden icy sweat judd looked past him a few metres ahead the track had mysteriously darkened as a tide edged towards the car a thick deep tide of blood judds reason twisted and turned to make any other sense of the sight than that inevitable conclusion but there was no saner explanation it was blood in unendurable abundance blood without end and now in the breeze there was the flavour of freshly opened carcasses the smell out of the depths of the human body part sweet part savoury mick stumbled back to the passengers side of the vw and fumbled weakly at the handle the door opened suddenly and he lurched inside his eyes glazed back up he said judd reached for the ignition the tide of blood was already sloshing against the front wheels ahead the world had been painted red drive for fucks sake drive judd was making no attempt to start the car we must look he said without conviction we have to we dont have to do anything said mick but get the hell out of here its not our business planecrash theres no smoke those are human voices micks instinct was to leave well alone he could read about the tragedy in a newspaper he could see the pictures tomorrow when they were grey and grainy today it was too fresh too unpredictable anything could be at the end of that track bleeding we must judd started the car while beside him mick began to moan quietly the vw began to edge forward nosing through the river of blood its wheels spinning in the queasy foaming tide no said mick very quietly please no we must was judds reply we must we must only a few yards away the surviving city of popolac was recovering from its first convulsions it stared with a thousand eyes at the ruins of its ritual enemy now spread in a tangle of rope and bodies over the impacted ground shattered forever popolac staggered back from the sight its vast legs flattening the forest that bounded the stampingground its arms flailing the air but it kept its balance even as a common insanity woken by the horror at its feet surged through its sinews and curdled its brain the order went out the body thrashed and twisted and turned from the grisly carpet of podujevo and fled into the hills as it headed into oblivion its towering form passed between the car and the sun throwing its cold shadow over the bloody road mick saw nothing through his tears and judd his eyes narrowed against the sight he feared seeing around the next bend only dimly registered that something had blotted the light for a minute a cloud perhaps a flock of birds had he looked up at that moment just stolen a glance out towards the northeast he would have seen popolacs head the vast swarming head of a maddened city disappearing below his line of vision as it marched into the hills he would have known that this territory was beyond his comprehension and that there was no healing to be done in this corner of hell but he didnt see the city and he and micks last turningpoint had passed from now on like popolac and its dead twin they were lost to sanity and to all hope of life they rounded the bend and the ruins of podujevo came into sight their domesticated imaginations had never conceived of a sight so unspeakably brutal perhaps in the battlefields of europe as many corpses had been heaped together but had so many of them been women and children locked together with the corpses of men there had been piles of dead as high but ever so many so recently abundant with life there had been cities laid waste as quickly but ever an entire city lost to the simple dictate of gravity it was a sight beyond sickness in the face of it the mind slowed to a snails pace the forces of reason picked over the evidence with meticulous hands searching for a flaw in it a place where it could say this is not happening this is a dream of death not death itself but reason could find no weakness in the wall this was true it was death indeed podujevo had fallen thirtyeight thousand seven hundred and sixtyfive citizens were spread on the ground or rather flung in ungainly seeping piles those who had not died of the fall or of suffocation were dying there would be no survivors from that city except that bundle of onlookers that had traipsed out of their homes to watch the contest those few podujevians the crippled the sick the ancient few were now staring like mick and judd at the carnage trying not to believe judd was first out of the car the ground beneath his suedes was sticky with coagulating gore he surveyed the carnage there was no wreckage no sign of a plane crash no fire no smell of fuel just tens of thousands of fresh bodies all either naked or dressed in an identical grey serge men women and children alike some of them he could see wore leather harnesses tightly buckled around their upper chests and snaking out from these contraptions were lengths of rope miles and miles of it the closer he looked the more he saw of the extraordinary system of knots and lashings that still held the bodies together for some reason these people had been tied together side by side some were yoked on their neighbours shoulders straddling them like boys playing at horse back riding others were locked arm in arm knitted together with threads of rope in a wall of muscle and bone yet others were trussed in a ball with their heads tucked between their knees all were in some way connected up with their fellows tied together as though in some insane collective bondage game another shot mick looked up across the field a solitary man dressed in a drab overcoat was walking amongst the bodies with a revolver dispatching the dying it was a pitifully inadequate act of mercy but he went on nevertheless choosing the suffering children first emptying the revolver filling it again emptying it filling it emptying it mick let go he yelled at the top of his voice over the moans of the injured what is this the man looked up from his appalling duty his face as deadgrey as his coat uh he grunted frowning at the two interlopers through his thick spectacles whats happened here mick shouted across at him it felt good to shout it felt good to sound angry at the man maybe he was to blame it would be a fine thing just to have someone to blame tell us mick said he could hear the tears throbbing in his voice tell us for gods sake explain greycoat shook his head he didnt understand a word this young idiot was saying it was english he spoke but thats all he knew mick began to walk towards him feeling all the time the eyes of the dead on him eyes like black shining gems set in broken faces eyes looking at him upside down on heads severed from their seating eyes in heads that had solid howls for voices eyes in heads beyond howls beyond breath thousands of eyes he reached greycoat whose gun was almost empty he had taken off his spectacles and thrown them aside he too was weeping little jerks ran through his big ungainly body at micks feet somebody was reaching for him he didnt want to look but the hand touched his shoe and he had no choice but to see its owner a young man lying like a flesh swastika every joint smashed a child lay under him her bloody legs poking out like two pink sticks he wanted the mans revolver to stop the hand from touching him better still he wanted a machinegun a flamethrower anything to wipe the agony away as he looked up from the broken body mick saw greycoat raise the revolver judd he said but as the word left his lips the muzzle of the revolver was slipped into greycoats mouth and the trigger was pulled greycoat had saved the last bullet for himself the back of his head opened like a dropped egg the shell of his skull flying off his body went limp and sank to the ground the revolver still between his lips we must began mick saying the words to nobody we must what was the imperative in this situation what must they do we must judd was behind him help he said to mick yes we must get help we must go go that was what they must do on any pretext for any fragile cowardly reason they must go get out of the battlefield get out of the reach of a dying hand with a wound in place of a body we have to tell the authorities find a town get help priests said mick they need priests it was absurd to think of giving the last rites to so many people it would take an army of priests a water cannon filled with holy water a loudspeaker to pronounce the benedictions they turned away together from the horror and wrapped their arms around each other then picked their way through the carnage to the car it was occupied vaslav jelovsek was sitting behind the wheel and trying to start the volkswagen he turned the ignition key once twice third time the engine caught and the wheels span in the crimson mud as he put her into reverse and backed down the track vaslav saw the englishmen running towards the car cursing him there was no help for it he didnt want to steal the vehicle but he had work to do he had been a referee he had been responsible for the contest and the safety of the contestants one of the heroic cities had already fallen he must do everything in his power to prevent popolac from following its twin he must chase popolac and reason with it talk it down out of its terrors with quiet words and promises if he failed there would be another disaster the equal of the one in front of him and his conscience was already broken enough mick was still chasing the vw shouting at jelovsek the thief took no notice concentrating on manoeuvring the car back down the narrow slippery track mick was losing the chase rapidly the car had begun to pick up speed furious but without the breath to speak his fury mick stood in the road hands on his knees heaving and sobbing bastard said judd mick looked down the track their car had already disappeared fucker couldnt even drive properly we have we have to catch up said mick through gulps of breath how on foot we havent even got a map its in the car jesus christ almighty they walked down the track together away from the field after a few metres the tide of blood began to peter out just a few congealing rivulets dribbled on towards the main road mick and judd followed the bloody tyre marks to the junction the srbovac road was empty in both directions the tyre marks showed a left turn hes gone deeper into the hills said judd staring along the lonely road towards the bluegreen distance hes out of his mind do we go back the way we came itll take us all night on foot well hop a lift judd shook his head his face was slack and his look lost dont you see mick they all knew this was happening the people in the farms they got the hell out while those people went crazy up there therell be no cars along this road ill lay you anything except maybe a couple of shitdumb tourists like us and no tourist would stop for the likes of us he was right they looked like butchers splattered with blood their faces were shining with grease their eyes maddened well have to walk said judd the way he went he pointed along the road the hills were darker now the sun had suddenly gone out on their slopes mick shrugged either way he could see they had a night on the road ahead of them but he wanted to walk somewhere anywhere as long as he put distance between him and the dead in popolac a kind of peace reigned instead of a frenzy of panic there was a numbness a sheeplike acceptance of the world as it was locked in their positions strapped roped and harnessed to each other in a living system that allowed for no single voice to be louder than any other nor any back to labour less than its neighbours they let an insane consensus replace the tranquil voice of reason they were convulsed into one mind one thought one ambition they became in the space of a few moments the singleminded giant whose image they had so brilliantly recreated the illusion of petty individuality was swept away in an irresistible tide of collective feeling not a mobs passion but a telepathic surge that dissolved the voices of thousands into one irresistible command and the voice said go the voice said take this horrible sight away where i need never see it again popolac turned away into the hills its legs taking strides half a mile long each man woman and child in that seething tower was sightless they saw only through the eyes of the city they were thoughtless but to think the citys thoughts and they believed themselves deathless in their lumbering relentless strength vast and mad and deathless two miles along the road mick and judd smelt petrol in the air and a little further along they came upon the vw it had overturned in the reedclogged drainage ditch at the side of the road it had not caught fire the drivers door was open and the body of vaslav jelovsek had tumbled out his face was calm in unconsciousness there seemed to be no sign of injury except for a small cut or two on his sober face they gently pulled the thief out of the wreckage and up out of the filth of the ditch on to the road he moaned a little as they fussed about him rolling micks sweater up to pillow his head and removing the mans jacket and tie quite suddenly he opened his eyes he stared at them both are you all right mick asked the man said nothing for a moment he seemed not to understand then english he said his accent was thick but the question was quite clear yes i heard your voices english he frowned and winced are you in pain said judd the man seemed to find this amusing am i in pain he repeated his face screwed up in a mixture of agony and delight i shall die he said through gritted teeth no said mick youre all right the man shook his head his authority absolute i shall die he said again the voice full of determination i want to die judd crouched closer to him his voice was weaker by the moment tell us what to do he said the man had closed his eyes judd shook him awake roughly tell us he said again his show of compassion rapidly disappearing tell us what this is all about about said the man his eyes still closed it was a fall thats all just a fall what fell the city podujevo my city what did it fall from itself of course the man was explaining nothing just answering one riddle with another where were you going mick inquired trying to sound as unagressive as possible after popolac said the man popolac said judd mick began to see some sense in the story popolac is another city like podujevo twin cities theyre on the map wheres the city now said judd vaslav jelovsek seemed to choose to tell the truth there was a moment when he hovered between dying with a riddle on his lips and living long enough to unburden his story what did it matter if the tale was told now there could never be another contest all that was over they came to fight he said his voice now very soft popolac and podujevo they come every ten years fight said judd you mean all those people were slaughtered vaslav shook his head no no they fell i told you well how do they fight mick said go into the hills was the only reply vaslav opened his eyes a little the faces that loomed over him were exhausted and sick they had suffered these innocents they deserved some explanation as giants he said they fought as giants they made a body out of their bodies do you understand the frame the muscles the bone the eyes nose teeth all made of men and women hes delirious said judd you go into the hills the man repeated see for yourselves how true it is even supposing mick began vaslav interrupted him eager to be finished they were good at the game of giants it took many centuries of practice every ten years making the figure larger and larger one always ambitious to be larger than the other ropes to tie them all together flawlessly sinews ligaments there was food in its belly there were pipes from the loins to take away the waste the bestsighted sat in the eyesockets the best voiced in the mouth and throat you wouldnt believe the engineering of it i dont said judd and stood up it is the body of the state said vaslav so softly his voice was barely above a whisper it is the shape of our lives there was a silence small clouds passed over the road soundlessly shedding their mass to the air it was a miracle he said it was as if he realized the true enormity of the fact for the first time it was a miracle it was enough yes it was quite enough his mouth closed the words said and he died mick felt this death more acutely than the thousands they had fled from or rather this death was the key to unlock the anguish he felt for them all whether the man had chosen to tell a fantastic lie as he died or whether this story was in some way true mick felt useless in the face of it his imagination was too narrow to encompass the idea his brain ached with the thought of it and his compassion cracked under the weight of misery he felt they stood on the road while the clouds scudded by their vague grey shadows passing over them towards the enigmatic hills it was twilight popolac could stride no further it felt exhaustion in every muscle here and there in its huge anatomy deaths had occurred but there was no grieving in the city for its deceased cells if the dead were in the interior the corpses were allowed to hang from their harnesses if they formed the skin of the city they were unbuckled from their positions and released to plunge into the forest below the giant was not capable of pity it had no ambition but to continue until it ceased as the sun slunk out of sight popolac rested sitting on a small hillock nursing its huge head in its huge hands the stars were coming out with their familiar caution night was approaching mercifully bandaging up the wounds of the day blinding eyes that had seen too much popolac rose to its feet again and began to move step by booming step it would not be long surely before fatigue overcame it before it could lie down in the tomb of some lost valley and die but for a space yet it must walk on each step more agonizingly slow than the last while the night bloomed black around its head mick wanted to bury the carthief somewhere on the edge of the forest judd however pointed out that burying a body might seem in tomorrows saner light a little suspicious and besides wasnt it absurd to concern themselves with one corpse when there were literally thousands of them lying a few miles from where they stood the body was left to lie therefore and the car to sink deeper into the ditch they began to walk again it was cold and colder by the moment and they were hungry but the few houses they passed were all deserted locked and shuttered every one what did he mean said mick as they stood looking at another locked door he was talking metaphor all that stuff about giants it was some trotskyist tripe judd insisted i dont think so i know so it was his deathbed speech hed probably been preparing for years i dont think so mick said again and began walking back towards the road oh hows that judd was at his back he wasnt toeing some party line are you saying you think theres some giant around here someplace for gods sake mick turned to judd his face was difficult to see the twilight but his voice was sober with belief yes i think he was telling the truth thats absurd thats ridiculous no judd hated mick that moment hated his naivetй his passion to believe any halfwitted story if it had a whiff of romance about it and this this was the worst the most preposterous no he said again no no no the sky was porcelain smooth and the outline of the hills black as pitch im fucking freezing said mick out of the ink are you staying here or walking with me judd shouted were not going to find anything this way well its a long way back were just going deeper into the hills do what you like im walking his footsteps receded the dark encased him after a minute judd followed the night was cloudless and bitter they walked on their collars up against the chill their feet swollen in their shoes above them the whole sky had become a parade of stars a triumph of spilled light from which the eye could make as many patterns as it had patience for after a while they slung their tired arms around each other for comfort and warmth about eleven oclock they saw the glow of a window in the distance the woman at the door of the stone cottage didnt smile but she understood their condition and let them in there seemed to be no purpose in trying to explain to either the woman or her crippled husband what they had seen the cottage had no telephone and there was no sign of a vehicle so even had they found some way to express themselves nothing could be done with mimes and facepullings they explained that they were hungry and exhausted they tried further to explain they were lost cursing themselves for leaving their phrasebook in the vw she didnt seem to understand very much of what they said but sat them down beside a blazing fire and put a pan of food on the stove to heat they ate thick unsalted pea soup and eggs and occasionally smiled their thanks at the woman her husband sat beside the fire making no attempt to talk or even look at the visitors the food was good it buoyed their spirits they would sleep until morning and then begin the long trek back by dawn the bodies in the field would be being quantified identified parcelled up and dispatched to their families the air would be full of reassuring noises cancelling out the moans that still rang in their ears there would be helicopters lorry loads of men organizing the clearingup operations all the rites and paraphernalia of a civilized disaster and in a while it would be palatable it would become part of their history a tragedy of course but one they could explain classify and learn to live with all would be well yes all would be well come morning the sleep of sheer fatigue came on them suddenly they lay where they had fallen still sitting at the table their heads on their crossed arms a litter of empty bowls and bread crusts surrounded them they knew nothing dreamt nothing felt nothing then the thunder began in the earth in the deep earth a rhythmical tread as of a titan that came by degrees closer and closer the woman woke her husband she blew out the lamp and went to the door the night sky was luminous with stars the hills black on every side the thunder still sounded a full half minute between every boom but louder now and louder with every new step they stood at the door together husband and wife and listened to the nighthills echo back and forth with the sound there was no lightning to accompany the thunder just the boom boom boom it made the ground shake it threw dust down from the doorlintel and rattled the windowlatches boom boom they didnt know what approached but whatever shape it took and whatever it intended there seemed no sense in running from it where they stood in the pitiful shelter of their cottage was as safe as any nook of the forest how could they choose out of a hundred thousand trees which would be standing when the thunder had passed better to wait and watch the wifes eyes were not good and she doubted what she saw when the blackness of the hill changed shape and reared up to block the stars but her husband had seen it too the unimaginably huge head vaster in the deceiving darkness looming up and up dwarfing the hills themselves with its ambition he fell to his knees babbling a prayer his arthritic legs twisted beneath him his wife screamed no words she knew could keep this monster at bay no prayer no plea had power over it in the cottage mick woke and his outstretched arm twitching with a sudden cramp wiped the plate and the lamp off the table they smashed judd woke the screaming outside had stopped the woman had disappeared from the doorway into the forest any tree any tree at all was better than this sight her husband still let a string of prayers dribble from his slack mouth as the great leg of the giant rose to take another step boom the cottage shook plates danced and smashed off the dresser a clay pipe rolled from the mantelpiece and shattered in the ashes of the hearth the lovers knew the noise that sounded in their substance that earththunder mick reached for judd and took him by the shoulder you see he said his teeth bluegrey in the darkness of the cottage see see there was a kind of hysteria bubbling behind his words he ran to the door stumbling over a chair in the dark cursing and bruised he staggered out into the night boom the thunder was deafening this time it broke all the windows in the cottage in the bedroom one of the roofjoists cracked and flung debris downstairs judd joined his lover at the door the old man was now face down on the ground his sick and swollen fingers curled his begging lips pressed to the damp soil mick was looking up towards the sky judd followed his gaze there was a place that showed no stars it was a darkness in the shape of a man a vast broad human frame a colossus that soared up to meet heaven it was not quite a perfect giant its outline was not tidy it seethed and swarmed he seemed broader too this giant than any real man his legs were abnormally thick and stumpy and his arms were not long the hands as they clenched and unclenched seemed oddlyjointed and overdelicate for its torso then it raised one huge flat foot and placed it on the earth taking a stride towards them boom the step brought the roof collapsing in on the cottage everything that the carthief had said was true popolac was a city and a giant and it had gone into the hills now their eyes were becoming accustomed to the night light they could see in ever more horrible detail the way this monster was constructed it was a masterpiece of human engineering a man made entirely of men or rather a sexless giant made of men and women and children all the citizens of popolac writhed and strained in the body of this fleshknitted giant their muscles stretched to breaking point their bones close to snapping they could see how the architects of popolac had subtly altered the proportions of the human body how the thing had been made squatter to lower its centre of gravity how its legs had been made elephantine to bear the weight of the torso how the head was sunk low on to the wide shoulders so that the problems of a weak neck had been minimized despite these malformations it was horribly lifelike the bodies that were bound together to make its surface were naked but for their harnesses so that its surface glistened in the starlight like one vast human torso even the muscles were well copied though simplified they could see the way the roped bodies pushed and pulled against each other in solid cords of flesh and bone they could see the intertwined people that made up the body the backs like turtles packed together to offer the sweep of the pectorals the lashed and knotted acrobats at the joints of the arms and the legs alike rolling and unwinding to articulate the city but surely the most amazing sight of all was the face cheeks of bodies cavernous eyesockets in which heads stared five bound together for each eyeball a broad flat nose and a mouth that opened and closed as the muscles of the jaw bunched and hollowed rhythmically and from that mouth lined with teeth of bald children the voice of the giant now only a weak copy of its former powers spoke a single note of idiot music popolac walked and popolac sang was there ever a sight in europe the equal of it they watched mick and judd as it took another step towards them the old man had wet his pants blubbering and begging he dragged himself away from the ruined cottage into the surrounding trees dragging his dead legs after him the englishmen remained where they stood watching the spectacle as it approached neither dread nor horror touched them now just an awe that rooted them to the spot they knew this was a sight they could never hope to see again this was the apex after this there was only common experience better to stay then though every step brought death nearer better to stay and see the sight while it was still there to be seen and if it killed them this monster then at least they would have glimpsed a miracle known this terrible majesty for a brief moment it seemed a fair exchange popolac was within two steps of the cottage they could see the complexities of its structure quite clearly the faces of the citizens were becoming detailed white sweatwet and content in their weariness some hung dead from their harnesses their legs swinging back and forth like the hanged others children particularly had ceased to obey their training and had relaxed their positions so that the form of the body was degenerating beginning to seethe with the boils of rebellious cells yet it still walked each step an incalculable effort of coordination and strength boom the step that trod the cottage came sooner than they thought mick saw the leg raised saw the faces of the people in the shin and ankle and foot they were as big as he was now all huge men chosen to take the full weight of this great creation many were dead the bottom of the foot he could see was a jigsaw of crushed and bloody bodies pressed to death under the weight of their fellow citizens the foot descended with a roar in a matter of seconds the cottage was reduced to splinters and dust popolac blotted the sky utterly it was for a moment the whole world heaven and earth its presence filled the senses to overflowing at this proximity one look could not encompass it the eye had to range backwards and forwards over its mass to take it all in and even then the mind refused to accept the whole truth a whirling fragment of stone flung off from the cottage as it collapsed struck judd full in the face in his head he heard the killing stroke like a ball hitting a wall a playyard death no pain no remorse out like a light a tiny insignificant light his deathcry lost in the pandemonium his body hidden in the smoke and darkness mick neither saw nor heard judd die he was too busy staring at the foot as it settled for a moment in the ruins of the cottage while the other leg mustered the will to move mick took his chance howling like a banshee he ran towards the leg longing to embrace the monster he stumbled in the wreckage and stood again bloodied to reach for the foot before it was lifted and he was left behind there was a clamour of agonized breath as the message came to the foot that it must move mick saw the muscles of the shin bunch and marry as the leg began to lift he made one last lunge at the limb as it began to leave the ground snatching a harness or a rope or human hair or flesh itself anything to catch this passing miracle and be part of it better to go with it wherever it was going serve it in its purpose whatever that might be better to die with it than live without it he caught the foot and found a safe purchase on its ankle screaming his sheer ecstasy at his success he felt the great leg raised and glanced down through the swirling dust to the spot where he had stood already receding as the limb climbed the earth was gone from beneath him he was a hitchhiker with a god the mere life he had left was nothing to him now or ever he would live with this thing yes he would live with it seeing it and seeing it and eating it with his eyes until he died of sheer gluttony he screamed and howled and swung on the ropes drinking up his triumph below far below he glimpsed judds body curled up pale on the dark ground irretrievable love and life and sanity were gone gone like the memory of his name or his sex or his ambition it all meant nothing nothing at all boom boom popolac walked the noise of its steps receding to the east popolac walked the hum of its voice lost in the night after a day birds came foxes came flies butterflies wasps came judd moved judd shifted judd gave birth in his belly maggots warmed themselves in a vixens den the good flesh of his thigh was fought over after that it was quick the bones yellowing the bones crumbling soon an empty space which he had once filled with breath and opinions darkness light darkness light he interrupted neither with his name end
