the black corridor by michael moorcock version chapter one space is infinite it is dark space is neutral it is cold stars occupy minute areas of space they are clustered a few billion here a few billion there as if seeking conso lation in numbers space does not care space does not threaten space does not comfort it does not sleep it does not wake it does not dream it does not hope it does not fear it does not love it does not hate it does not encourage any of these qualities space cannot be measured it cannot be angered it cannot be placated it cannot be summed up space is there space is not large and it is not small it does not live and it does not die it does not offer truth and neither does it lie space is a remorseless senseless impersonal fact space is the absence of time and of matter through this silence moves a tiny pellet of metal it moves so slowly as to seem not to move at all it is a lonely little object in its own terms it is a long way from its planet of origin in the solid blackness it gives off faint light in that great life denying void it contains life a few wisps of gas hang on it a certain amount of its own waste matter surrounds it cans and packages and bits of paper globules of fluid things rejected by its system as beyond reconstitution they cling to its sides for want of anything better to cling to and inside the spacecraft is ryan ryan is dressed neatly in regulation coveralls which are light grey in colour and tend to match the vast expanse of controls pre dominantly grey and green which surround him ryan himself is pale and his hair is mainly grey he might have been designed to tone in with the ship ryan is a tall man with heavy greyblack eyebrows that meet near the bridge of his nose he has grey eyes and full firm lips that are at the moment pressed tightly together he seems physically very fit ryan knows that he has to keep himself in shape ryan paces the spaceship he paces down the central passage way to the main control cabin and there he checks the coordinates the consumption indicators the regeneration indicators and he checks all his figures at length with those of the ships computer he is quietly satisfied everything is perfectly in order exactly as it should be ryan goes to the desk near the ships big central screen although activated the screen shows no picture it casts a greenish light on to the desk ryan sits down and reaches out towards the small console on the desk he depresses a stud and speaking in a clear level voice he makes his standard log entry day number one thousand four hundred and sixty three spaceship hope dempsey en route for munich speed holds steady at point nine of c all systems functioning according to original expectations no other variations we are all comfortable signing off ryan acting commander the entry will be filed in the ships records and will also be auto matically broadcast back to earth now ryan slides open a drawer and takes from it a large red book it is his personal logbook he unclips a stylus from a pocket in his coveralls scratches his head and writes slowly and carefully he puts down the date december th ad he takes another stylus from his pocket and underlines this date in red he looks up at the blank screen and seems to make a decision he writes the silence of these infinite spaces frightens me he underlines the phrase in red he writes i am lonely i am controlling a desperate longing yet i know that it is not my function to feel lonely i almost wish for an emergency so that i could wake at least one of them up mr ryan pulls himself together he takes a deep breath and be gins a more formal entry the third of his eighthourly reports when he has finished he gets up puts the red logbook away replaces his stylii neatly in his pocket goes over to the main console and makes a few fine adjustments to the instruments he leaves the main control cabin enters a short companion way opens a door he is in his living quarters it is a small compartment and very tidy on one wall is a console with a screen that shows him the interior of the main control cabin set in the opposite wall is a double bunk he undresses disposes of his coveralls lies down and takes a sedative he sleeps his breathing is heavy and regular at first he goes into the ballroom it is dusk there are long windows looking out on to a darkening lawn the floor gleams the lights overhead are dim on the ballroom floor formally dressed couples slowly rotate in perfect time to the music the music is low and rather sombre all the couples wear round very black spectacles their faces are pale their features almost invisible in the dim light the round black glasses give them a masklike appearance around the floor other couples are sitting out they stare for ward through their dark glasses as the couples move the music becomes quieter and quieter slower and slower and now the couples revolve more slowly too the music fades now a low psalmlike moaning begins it is in the room but it does not come from the dancers the mood in the room changes at last the dancers stand perfectly still listening to the song the seated men and women stand up the chanting grows louder the people in the room become angry they are angry with a particular individual above the chanting louder and faster comes the beat ing of a rapid drum the dancers are angry angry angry ryan awakes and remembers the past chapter two ryan and mrs ryan shyly entered their new apartment and laid down the large nearly brandnew suitcase it came to rest on the floor of the lobby they released the handle the suitcase rocked and then was still ryans attention left the case and focused on the shining tub in which grew a diminutive orange tree mothers kept it well watered murmured mrs ryan yes said ryan shes very good about things like that yes awkwardly ryan took her in his arms mrs ryan embraced him there was a certain reserve in her movements as if she were frightened of him or of the consequences her action might provoke a feeling of tenderness overwhelmed ryan he smiled down at her upturned face reached out his hand to stroke her jawline she smiled uncertainly well he said lets inspect the family mansion hand in hand they wandered through the apartment over the pale gold carpets past the simulated oak furniture of the living room to stare out through the long window at the apartment blocks opposite not too close said ryan with satisfaction wouldnt it be ter rible to live like the benedictsso near the next block that you can see right into their rooms and they can see right into yours awful agreed mrs ryan no privacy no privacy at all they wandered past the walltowall television into the kitchen they opened cupboards and surveyed the contents they pressed buttons to slide out the washing machine and the refrigerator they turned on the infragrill played with the telephone touched the walls they went into the two empty bedrooms looking out of the windows turning on the lights their feet noisy on the tiles of the floors last of all they went into the main bedroom where the coloured lights of the walls shifted idly in the bright sunshine from the windows they opened the wardrobes in which their clothes had been neatly laid out mrs ryan patted her hair in front of the huge convex mirror opposite the bed shyly they stood looking out of the window ryan pressed the button on the sill and the blinds slid down arent the walls beautiful mrs ryan turned to look at the multicoloured lights playing over the flat surfaces not as beautiful as you she looked round at him oh you ryan reached out and touched her shoulder touched her left breast touched her waist mrs ryan glanced at the windows as if to reassure herself that the blinds were drawn and no one could see in oh im so happy she whispered so am i ryan moved closer drew her to him holding her buttocks cupped in his heavy hands he kissed her lightly on the nose then strongly on the mouth his hand left her buttock and moved down her thigh pushing up the skirt feeling her flesh a flush came to mrs ryans face as he eased her towards the new bed she opened her lips and stroked the back of his neck she sighed his thumb traced the line of her pelvis she trembled and moved against him then the chinese jazz record started in the next apartment the ryans froze mrs ryan was bent backwards with mr ryans face buried in her neck the clangour of the record every note and every phrase was as audible as if the music poured from their own glowing walls they broke apart mrs ryan straightened her skirt damn them mr ryan raised his fists impotently good god dont tell me thats the kind of neighbours weve got hadnt you better what couldnt you she was confused you mean go and speak to them well i he frowned maybe this time ill just hammer on the wall slowly he took off his shoe ill show them he went to the wall and banged on it vigorously stood back shoe in hand and waited the music stopped he grinned that did it mrs ryan took a deep breath and said id better unpack ill help you said ryan he left the bedroom and approached the suitcase he took the handle in both hands and staggered back to where she was waiting together they unpacked the residue of their honeymoon the suntan lotions the damp bathing suits the tissuewrapped gifts for their parents they talked and they laughed as they took things out of the case and put them away but secretly they were sad as article after article came out all the souvenirs of that sunny three weeks on an island where no one else lived where there was freedom from observation the noise and demands of other people the case was empty mrs ryan reached into the waterproof pouch at the back and produced the tapes they had had processed when they reached the mainland heliport he fetched the player from the dressing table and they went into the livingroom to play the tapes on the tele vision in silence they looked at the pictures drinking in the landscapes they showed there were the mountains there the great blue ex panse of the sea there the heaths there were almost no shots of mr or mrs ryan there were only the views of the silent crags the sea and the moors of the island where they had been so happy a bird cried somewhat shakily the picture swept upwards towards the cloud slashed sky a kittyhawk dived into the distance there was the sound of the breakers in the background suddenly the picture cut out mrs ryan looked at mr ryan with tears in her eyes we must go back there soon she said very soon he smiled and the chinese jazz as loud as ever shrieked through the room the ryans sat rigidly in front of the television screen ryan clenched his teeth jesus god ill he stood up ill kill the bastards he gestured irresolutely there are laws ill call the police mrs ryan held his hand theres no need to speak to them darling just put a note through their door warn them they must have heard of the noise prevention act you could write to the caretaker as well ryan rubbed his lips once tell them they could be heavily fined said his wife if theyre reasonable theyll all right ryan pursed his lips this time thats what ill do next timeand i mean it ill knock on the door and confront them he went into the living room to write the notes mrs ryan made tea the chinese jazz went on and on ryan wrote the notes with short jerky movements of his pen and i warn you that if this noise continues i will be forced to contact the police and inform them of your conduct i have also told the caretaker of my intention at very least you will be evicted but you must also be aware of the heavy penalties you could receive under section vii of the noise prevention act of he read back over the letter it was a bit pompous he hesitated perhaps if he no it would do he finished the letters put them into envelopes and sealed them as mrs ryan directed the tea trolley into the livingroom that will do thank you she told it suddenly the music stopped in midbar ryan looked at his wife and laughed maybe thats the answer maybe its robots making that row mrs ryan smiled she picked up the teapot look ill do that said ryan if youll just put these into the internal mail slot outside the front door all right mrs ryan replaced the pot but what shall i do if i meet them she nodded towards the neighbouring flat ignore them completely of course they surely wont try to involve you in conversation you might as well ignore anybody else you meet outside if we start making contact with all the people in this block well never have any bloody privacy thats what mother said said mrs ryan right she took the two letters and went out of the living room and into the lobby ryan heard the front door click open he straightened his head as he heard another voice it was a womans voice highpitched and cheerful he heard mrs ryan mumble something heard her footsteps as she entered hastily and shut the front door firmly what on earth was that he asked as she returned to the living room its like living in a zoo maybe it was a mistake it was the woman who lives on the other side of us she was com ing back with her shopping she welcomed me to the block i said thank you very much and slid back in here oh christ i hope theyre not going to pester us said ryan i dont think so she seemed quite embarrassed to be chatting with a stranger in cosy uninterrupted silence the ryans drank their tea and ate their sandwiches and cake when they had finished mrs ryan ordered the trolley back to the kitchen and she and ryan sat together on the couch watching the tapes on the television they were beginning to feel at ease in their little home mrs ryan smiled at the screen and pointed there was a scene of cliffs a cave remember that old fisherman we found in there that day i was never so startled in my life you said a steady knocking began ryan swung round seeking the source of the noise over here said a voice ryan got up outside the window was the head and torso of a man in overalls his grinning red face was capped by a mop of clashing ginger hair his teeth were ragged and yellow mrs ryan put her hand to her mouth as ryan dashed to the window what the bloody hell do you think youre doing pushing your fucking face in our window without warning ryan trembled with rage whats the matter with you havent you ever heard of privacy cant we get a moments peace and quiet its a bloody conspiracy the mans grin faded as ryan ranted on his muffled voice came through the pane look here he said theres no need to be like that i never knew you was back did i i was asked by the old lady to keep the windows clean while you was away which i have done without if i may say so any payment whatsoever so before you complain about my bloody habits i suggest you settle up how much ryan put his hand in his pocket come onhow much three pounds seven ryan opened the window and put four pound notes on the out side sill there you are keep the change and while youre at it dont bother to come back we dont need you im going to clean the windows myself the man grinned cynically oh yeah he tucked the money into his overall pocket i hope youve got a head for heights then theyre all telling me theyre going to clean their own windows from now on have you seen them half of them dont do the out sides they cant stand the height see you should see em filthy you can hardly see out for the dirt it must be like the black hole of calcutta in most of them flats still its none of my business im sure if people want to live in the dark thats their affair not mine too right said ryan you nosy bloody the windowcleaners eyes hardened look mate clear off said ryan fiercely go on the man shrugged gave his yellow grin again and touched his carroty hair sardonically in a salute cheerio then smiler he began to lower himself down the wall towards the distant ground ryan turned to look at his wife mrs ryan was not on the couch any more he heard sobs and followed the sound mrs ryan was stretched across the bed face down weeping hysterically he touched her shoulder cheer up love hes gone now she shrugged off his hand cheer up ill ive always been a private person she cried its all right for you you werent brought up like me people in our neighbour hood never intruded they didnt come poking their faces through windows why did you bring me here why darling i find it all just as distasteful as you do ryan told her honestly well just have to sort it out step by step show people that we like to keep ourselves to ourselves be calm mrs ryan continued to cry please dont cry darling mr ryan ran his hands through his hair ill straighten things out you wont see anyone you dont know she turned on the bed im sorry one thing after another my nerves i know he sat down on the edge of the bed and began to stroke her hair come on well watch a musical on the tv then well and as mrs ryans sobs abated there came the familiar sound of the chinese jazz it was muted now but it was still loud enough to lacerate the ryans sensitive ears mrs ryan moaned and covered her head as the tinkling the jangling the thudding of the music beat against her ryan helpless stood and stared down at his weeping wife then he turned and began to bang and bang and bang and bang on the wall until all the colours disappeared but the music kept on playing chapter three mr ryan has done his exercises bathed dressed and break fasted he has left his cabin and has paced down the main passageway to the central control cabin he has checked the coordinates the consumption indicators the regeneration indicators and run com putations through the machine he seats himself at the tidy steel desk below the big screen that has no picture around him the dials and the indicators move unobtrusively mr ryan takes out the heavy redcovered logbook from its steel drawer he unclips his pen using the oldfashioned log appeals to his imagination his sense of pioneerdom it is the one touch of the historic the link with the great captains and explorers of the past the logbook is ryans poem he enters the date december th ad he underlines it he begins to write the first of his eighthourly reports day number one thousand four hundred and sixty four spaceship hope dempsey en route for munich speed steady at point nine of c all systems functioning according to original expectations no other variations all occupants are comfortable and in good health under this statement ryan signs his name and rules a neat line he then stands up and reads the entry into the machine ryans report is on its way to earth he likes to vary this routine therefore when he makes his next report he will do it orally first and write it second ryan stands up checks the controls glances around and is satisfied that all is in order since embarkation on the hope dempsey three years ago he has lost weight and in spite of his treatments under the lamps colour ryan exercises and eats well and relatively speaking he is in the best possible condition for a man living at twothirds earth gravity on earth it would be doubtful if he could run a hundred yards walk along the corridor of a train move a table from one side of a room to another his muscles are maintained but they have forgotten much and ryans mind basically still the same has also forgotten much in the narrow confines of the perfectly running ship but ryan has his will his will makes him keep to the perfect routine which will take the ship and its occupants to the star that will which has held ryan the ship and its instruments and pas sengers together for three years and will hold them together functioning correctly for the next three ryan trusts his will thus in the private and unofficial section of the red logbook the section which is never read over to earth ryan writes today is alexs tenth birthday another birthday he will miss this is very saddening however it is the kind of sacrifice we must make for ourselves and for others in our attempt to make a better life i find myself increasingly lonely for the company of my dear wife and children and my other old friends and good companions broadcasts from earth no longer reach us and soon i shall be reduced for stimulation to those old shipmates of mine my videotapes my audio tapes and my books but all this must be if we are to achieve our end to gain anything worthwhile demands endurance and discipline in three minutes it will be time to perform the duty i find most painful emotionally and yet most essential every day i am seized by the same mixture of reluctance because i know the distress it will cause me and yet there is an eagerness to fulfill my task i shall go now and do what i have to ryan closes the red logbook and places it back in the steel drawer so that the near edges of the book rest evenly against the bottom of the drawer he replaces his pen in his pocket and stands up he glances once more at the controls and with a firm step leaves the room he walks up the metallic central corridor of the ship at the end there is a door the door is secured by heavy spin screws ryan presses a button at the side of the door and the screws automatic ally retract the door swings open and ryan stands for a moment on the threshold the room is a small one instantly bright as the heavy door opens there are no screens to act as portholes and the walls gleam with a platinum sheen the room is empty except for the thirteen long containers one of the containers is empty plastic sheets are drawn two thirds of the way up over the twelve full containers through the semitransparent material covering the remainder of the tops can be seen a thick dark green fluid through the fluid can be seen the faces and shoulders of the passengers the passengers are in hibernation and will remain so until the ship lands unless an emergency arises which will be important enough for ryan to awaken them in their gallons of green fluid they sleep at their heads is a panel revealing the active working of their bodies on the plastic cover is a small identification panel giving their names their dates of birth and the date of their engulfment into suspended animation on the indicator panel is a line marked dreams on each panel the line is steady ryan looks tenderly down into the faces of his family and friends josephine ryan his wife blonde and plumpfaced her naked shoulders still pink and smooth rupert ryan the dark face of his son so like his the bony shoulders just beginning to broaden into manhood alexander ryan the fairer face of his younger son eyes amazingly still open so blue thin shoulders of an active small boy ryan looking on the faces of his closest relatives feels close to tears at their loss but he controls himself and paces past the other containers sydney ryan his uncle an old man false teeth very white revealed through open mouth eyes closed thin wrinkled shoulders john ryan ryans brother ryan thinks that now he is thinner less muscular he must look more like john than he has ever done even when they were children john has the same short face thick brows his exposed shoul ders are narrow knotted isabel ryan his brother johns first wife her crowded teeth exposed in a snarl in her narrow jaw pale face pale hair pale thin shoulders ryan feels a spasm of relief that isabel is lying in her container instead of around him erect and needlelike talking to him in her high voice ryan does not notice the passing thought does not need to correct himself janet ryan so lovely his brother johns second wife soft cheeks soft shoulders long wavy black hair suspended in the green fluid a gentle smile through pink generous lips as if she were dreaming pleasant dreams fred masterson narrow face thin narrow shoulders furrowed brow tracy masterson j mastersons wife a pretty woman looking as stupid in her container as she did out of it james henry shock of red hair float ing seagreen eyes open in the green fluid looking like some drowned merman ryan moves past him and stops at the eleventh container ida henry poor girl matted hair pale brown sunken young cheeks drooping mouth there are two arrested lives in that container ryan thought ida henrys wife and her coming child what would be the result of that long gestation of mother and child both in foetal fluid felicity henry henrys other wife and idas twin sister her hair is smoother and shinier her cheeks less sunken than her sisters not pregnant ryan reaches the last container and looks into it the white bottom of the container shines up at him surrounded by his sleep ing companions he has the urge to get into the container and try it out suspecting his impulse he squares his shoulders and walks firmly from the room the door hisses shut behind nun he touches the stud that replaces the screws he walks back down the silent corridor and reenters the control cabin he makes rapid notes on a small pad of paper he takes from his breast pocket he moves to the computer and runs his calculations through if necessary the computer could be switched to fully automatic but this is not considered good for the psychology of crew mem bers ryan nods with satisfaction when the replies come he returns to the desk and puts the charts back in the drawer as he does this another spurt of paper comes from the com puter ryan examines it it reads report on personnel in containers not supplied ryan purses his lips and punches in the reports josephine ryan condition steady rupert ryan condition steady alexander ryan condition steady sidney ryan condition steady john ryan condition steady isabel ryan condition steady janet ryan condition steady fred masterson condition steady tracy masterson condition steady james henry condition steady ida henry condition steady felicity henry condition steady your own condition suggests the computer ryan pauses and then reports i am lonely the computer tells him instantly fill your time according to the sug gested programme if the condition con tinues inject icc proditol per diem do not take more discontinue the dosage as soon as possible and at all costs after days ryan straightens his shoulders signs off and walks away from the computer he walks down the corridor to his own accommodation he inflates a red easy chair sits down and presses a stud on the wall the tv screen in front of him begins to roll off a list of its offerings films plays music dancing and discussion and educational pro grammes in his weakness ryan does not choose the agricultural information he is committed to studying he selects an old polish film soon the screen is full of people walking talking eating getting on streetcars watching scenery kissing and arguing ryan feels tears on his cheeks but he has an hour of relaxation due to him and he will take it in whatever form it comes as ryan watches bearing his expected melancholy with stoicism his mind wanders he hears echoing in his head the report on his undead companions in their cavernous containers josephine ryan condition steady rupert ryan condition steady alexander ryan sidney ryan john ryan isabel ryan janet ryan fred masterson james henry ida henry felicity henry the parade of the faces he once knew passes in front of him he imagines them as they were before they were immersed in their halflife in the seagreen fluid chapter four james henrys pale hands stubby and freckled shook as he bent forward in his chair and stared into fred mastersons face do something fred do something thats what im saying masterson gazed back thin eyebrows raised cynically long forehead creased by parallels of wrinkles such as he asked after a pause henrys hands clenched as he said society is polluted physic ally and morally polluted by radioactivity were continually told is within an acceptable level though we see signs every day that this just isnt so i cannot allow ida or felicity to bear children with the world as it is today and worse in a way than the actual environment is the infinite corruption of man himself each day we grow more rotten like sacks of pus until the few of us who try to cling to the old standards try to stay decent are more and more threatened by the others threatened by their corruption threat ened by their violence were living in a mad world masterson and youre advising patience beside him on the ryans couch were his two wives tired identically pale identically thin as if the split cell which produced them had only contained the materials for one healthy woman and had been forced to make two as henry spoke they both gazed at him from their pale blue eyes and followed every word as if he were speaking their thoughts masterson did not reply to james henrys tirade he merely stared about him as if he were thoroughly tired of the discussion the furniture of the ryans living room had been pushed back against the walls to seat the group which met there every week the blinds were drawn and the lights were on seated on his own with his back to the window was ryans uncle sidney a thin obstinate old man with a tonsure of brown hair round his bald head the rest of the group was seated around the other walls the seat in front of the window like the front row at public meetings was always the last to be filled fred masterson and his wife tracy who wore a wellcut black floorlength dress the conservative fashion of the moment and fully made up black lips sat opposite the henry family on their sofa next to masterson sat john ryans first wife isabel she was a dowdy pinchfaced woman on johns left sat his other wife the beautiful janet against the fourth wall were ryan and his wife josephine the women wore blacks and browns the men were quietly dressed in darkcoloured tunics and trousers the room bare in the centre entirely without ornament had a dull look ryan sat and in his head worked out some estimates for a new line of product in his head as a silence fell between james henry and fred masterson he turned his mind away from his business problems and said this is after all only a discussion group we havent the power or the means to alter things henry opened his green eyes wider and said urgently cant you see ryan that the days of discussion are practically over were living in chaos and all were doing is talking about it at the meeting next month we havent agreed to a meeting next month yet said master son well if we dont well be fools henry crossed his legs in an agitated manner at the meeting next month we must urge that pressure tracy mastersons face was taut with stress ive got to go home now fred masterson looked at her helplessly try to hang on no tracy hunched her shoulders no its people all around me i know theyre all friends i know they dont mean to a couple more minutes no its like being shut up in a box she folded her hands in her lap and sat with her eyes downcast she could say no more josephine ryan rose and took her by the arm ill give you some pills and you can sleep in our bed come on dear she drew the younger woman up by the arm and led her into the kitchen henry looked at masterson well you know why your wife is like this it all dates from the time when she was caught up in that ufo demonstration in powell square and thats an ex perience any one of us could have at any timeas things are now as he spoke there came the sound of chanting from nearby streets a window broke in the distance and there were shouts a noisy song began from the bedroom tracy masterson started to scream fred masterson got up paused for a moment and then ran towards the sound the rest of the group sat frozen listening as the hubbub came closer in the bedroom tracy masterson screamed and shouted no no no no no no no no josephine ryan came back leaning against the doorway the pills will take effect soon dont worry about her who are the people in the street no one replied tracy screamed again who are the people in the street josephine moved further into the roomwho the noisy voices subsided giving way to the same low chanting in a minor key which had begun the procession now ryan and his friends could hear some of the words shut up the land shut up the sky we must be alone strangers strangers all must die we must be alone alone alone alone shut out the fearful darkening skies let us be alone no strangers coming through the skies we must be alone no threats no fears no strangers here no thieves who come by night alone alone alone its them then the patriots mrs ryan looked at the others again no one replied the chanting was close under the windows now the lights went out the room was left in complete darkness tracy mastersons screams had diminished to a whimper as the drug took hold bloody awful verses whatever else uncle sidney cleared his throat the group sat surrounded by a chanting which seemed in the utter darkness to be coming from all over the room suddenly it stopped there was the sound of running and sharp cries then a pitiful high screaming like the sound of an animal being killed uncle sidney stirred in his chair by the window and stood up lets have a look out then he said calmly his finger went to the button on the window sill as james henry shouted no ryan was halfway across the room arms stretched toward his uncle it was too late the blind shot up the window covering the whole of one wall was open to the night ryan stood petrified in the middle of the floor as the flickering light cast by a thousand torches in the street played over him henry half out of his seat stood up and was completely still josephine ryan stood in the middle of the floor with the bottle of pills in her hand the darkclad women sat in their seats without moving the cries and the terrible high scream went on uncle sidney looked down into the street on the other side in the high block opposite all the windows were blinded oh my god said uncle sidney oh my god there was silence until josephine ryan said what is it uncle sidney said nothing he looked downwards mrs ryan took a deep breath she walked firmly over to the window ryan watched her she steeled herself looked swiftly down into the street stepped back its too horrible that really is too horrible uncle sidneys face was hard he continued to watch the crowd had caught a young man of twenty one of the people who lived in the block opposite they had tied him to an old wooden door propped the door against a steel power supply post drenched the door and the young man with petrol and set light to him the young man lay at an angle on the blazing door he writhed and he screamed as the flames consumed him the crowd pressed closely round those in front being perpetually pushed too close to the flames by the people at the back who wanted to see their torches and the light cast over them by their human bonfire revealed chiefly men most of them in their thirties and forties the women among them were younger all were dressed in dark long clothing in the front the people were crouched tensely watching the young man burn a young woman with cropped blonde hair yelled burn stranger burn the men about her took up the cry burn burn burn burn the young man writhed in the flames gave a final frantic twist of his body and was still when he had stopped screaming the crowd became quiet apparently they were exhausted they sat or stood about breathing heavily wiping their faces and hands and mouths uncle sidney pressed the blind button in silence the blind slid down blotting out the torches the fire the silent crowd below he sat heavily in his chair the crackling of the fire could be heard in the ryans living room mrs ryan took her hand from her eyes walked out to the kitchen and went to the sink the men and women in the room heard her running water into a tumbler heard her drink and put the tumbler into the dishwasher heard the door of the washer close uncle sidney sat in his chair looking at the floor what did you want the blind open for james henry demanded eh uncle sidney shrugged and continued to stare at the floor eh what difference does it make said uncle sidney what bloody difference you had no right to expose us to thatparticularly the women said james henry uncle sidney looked up and there were a few tears in his eyes his voice was strained it happened didnt it whats that got to do with it we dont want to get involved its not even your home it was josephines window which was un covered whenthis thingtook place shell be the one accused uncle sidney didnt reply it happened thats all i know it happened and it happened here very horrifying to see no doubt said henry but that doesnt make any difference to the fact that the patriots have got some of the right ideas even if they do put them into practice in a very dis tasteful way he sniffed besides some people enjoy watching that sort of thing revel in it as bad as them uncle sidneys eyes expressed vague astonishment do what what did you want to watch it for then i didnt want to watch it so you say masterson appeared in the doorway and said tracys gone to sleep at last whats been happening patriots was it ryan nodded they just burnt a man outside in the street masterson wrinkled his nose bloody lunatics if they really want to get rid of them theres plenty of legal machinery to help them quite said henry no need to take the law into their own hands what bothers me is this odd antispace notion of theirs quite said masterson theyve been reassured time and time again that there are no alien bodies in the skies theyve been given a dozen different kinds of proof and yet they continue to believe in an alien attack there could be some truth in it couldnt there janet said timidly no smoke without fire eh the three men looked at her i suppose so masterson agreed he made a dismissive gesture but its extremely unlikely mrs ryan directed the trolley through the door the group sat drinking coffee and eating cake drink up while its hot mrs ryans voice had an edge to it isabel ryan flinched and said no thank you josephine it doesnt agree with me josephines mouth turned down isabel hasnt been very well her husband john said defensively ryan tried to smooth things over he smiled at isabel youre quite right to be careful he said the whole group knew from isabels demeanour although no one would have stated it that isabel was experiencing a phase where she supposed people were trying to poison her she would eat and drink nothing she had not prepared herself most of them knew what it was like they had gone through the same thing at one time or another it was best to ignore it anyway it wasnt unheard of for people who believed that sort of thing to be perfectly right they all knew men and women who had imagined that they were being poisoned who later had died inexplicably one of us ought to attend the next big meeting of the patriots said ryan it would be interesting to know what theyre up to its dangerous john ryans face was stern id like to know though ryan shrugged its best to investigate a thing isnt it we ought to find out what theyre really saying well go in a band then said james henry safety in numbers eh his wives looked at him fearfully right said masterson time to tune into the report of the nimmoite rally at parliament the government will fall tonight they watched the nimmoite rally on the television they watched it while more cries and shouts sounded from the street below they watched as a group passed playing drums and pipes they did not look round they watched the nimmoite rally until the president appeared in the house of commons and offered his resignation chapter five that night there were riots and fires all over the city the ryans and their friends watched the riots and fires sitting behind their closed blinds staring at the large bright wall which was their television the city was being ripped and battered and bloodied they drank their coffee and they ate their cake and they watched the men fall under the police clubs watched the girls and boys savaged by police dogs heard the hooting and yelling of the looters saw the fire service battling to control the fifes the ryans and their friends had seen a great many riots and foes in their lives but never so many at a single time they watched almost critically for a while but as the programmes wore on mrs ryan became quieter and quieter more mechanical in her presentation of coffee of sugar of things to eat it was when she saw her favourite department store go up in flames that she finally put her head in her arms and sobbed mrs ryan had been married for fourteen years for fourteen years she had carried the weight of her vigorous husbands moods and ambitions she had reared children battled with her fear of other people of the outside had made almost all family decisions she had done her best now she wept ryan was startled he went over and patted her tried to comfort her but she could not be stopped she went on crying ryan looked up from his wife and stared at uncle sidney in front of them unheeded glass was smashing into the streets crowds were running and shouting the top of the monument built to commemorate the great fire of was crowned with flames put her to bed said uncle sidney you cant do or say any thing effective its the situation thats getting her down put her to bed the group watched as sensible josephine ryan was supported out of the room by her husband josephine ryan was about to be sedated and put to bed next to the unconscious tracy masters ida and felicity henry seeing their senior woman carried off became alarmed ida shuddered and felicity said where will it end youre becoming inhuman said uncle sidney switched off in the grave unless we do something fast james henry said brutally apparently he hadnt heard uncle sidney in the grave he said again what are you two going to do eh and he laughed nastily into the pale identical faces of his two sapless wives fred masterson looked at uncle sidney and uncle sidney looked at fred masterson they shrugged almost at the same time and there was henry laughing as usual as usual leaning for ward in his chair as usual springy full of ideas head crowned by that energetic mass of red hair which gave the impression of a man getting extra fuel from somewhere as james henry pushed his features aggressively towards the faces of his tired twin girlbrides it seemed impossible not to think that he was somehow plugged into their vital forces in some manner draining off energy before it could reach the women to power their thin narrow feet their stopped backs their limp hair their lacklustre eyes uncle sidney possessed by this thought laughed heartily into the room what the hell are you laughing at sidney demanded james henry uncle sidney shook his head and stopped james henry glared at him what was so funny then never mind said uncle sidney its enough to be able to laugh at all the way things are then keep laughing sidney said james henry keep at it chum youll be fucking crying soon enough sidney grinned so much for the good old values didnt you know there were ladies present what dyou mean well when i was a young man we didnt use that sort of language in front of ladies what sort of language you old fool you said fucking james said uncle sidney straightfaced of course i didnt i dont believe in a man has to have a very limited vocabulary if he needs to resort to swearing like that what are you trying to prove sidney again the look of vague astonishment crept into uncle sidneys eyes forget it he said at length are you trying to start something i dont want to start anything more no said uncle sidney the television screen jumped from one scene to another fires and riots riots and fires james henry turned to his wives did i say anything objection able in unison they shook their heads he glared again at uncle sidney there you are okay all right uncle sidney looked away i proved i didnt say anything said james henry insistently fair enough theyre my witnesses he pointed back at his wives they told you sure what do you mean sure i meant i believe you im sorry i must have misheard you james henry relaxed and smiled you might apologise then to all of us i should have thought i apologise to all of you uncle sidney said all of you ryan watched from the doorway and he was frowning he looked at uncle sidney he looked at james henry he looked at ida and felicity he looked at fred masterson then he looked at the television screen it was not so different it was frightening nothing seemed real or perhaps it was that nothing seemed any more real than anything else he went towards the television with the intention of switching it off then he paused he was overwhelmed with the feeling that if he turned the switch not just the television picture would fade but also the scene in the room he shuddered mr ryan shuddered full of fear and hopelessness full of de pression full of doubt it had been a bad day the day was really something of an historic day he thought today marked the turning point in his countrys historyperhaps the worlds history perhaps it was the beginning of a new dark age he came to a decision and reached forward to switch off chapter six seated in his little cabin the television flickering gently in front of him the foreign voices speaking their lines ryan falls against his will into a doze surely he knew when he sat down when he selected a film in an alien language that this would be the result perhaps he did but would not acknowledge the thought ryan a man tormented by nightmares during his official hours of sleep who rises every morning with the indefinable despair of a man who has dreamed of horrors he cannot even remember ryan is desperate for rest through the caverns of his brain pound the sounds of heart and blood the drums of life he hears them dimly at first ryan is standing in the ballroom the dance floor has a dull shine the lights in the candelabra are low they give off a bluish light black streamers decorate the walls there are masks suspended at eye level on them the masks show human faces k e e p going p e e k the spaceship is on course for munich travelling at just below the speed of light the spaceship is on course for munich i know that i des des sciences histoire des sciences his toire des sciences it is true however i am willing to tell whoever wishes to know there is no need to tell there is no one to tell it does not matter k e e p going p e e k which way in the ballroom the masks show human faces faces distorted by anger lust and greed suddenly one of the masks shows his wife josephine her face ferociously distorted there is his youngest child alexander his mouth is open his eyes are blank alexander a drooling idiot the couples are circling to the chanting music it grows slower and slower and they revolve slower and slower they are dressed in dark clothes they have the firm and welldefined faces of the practical selfinterested wellfed middle classes they are people of substance their eyes are masked by the round sunglasses the long closed windows at the end of the room look out into blackness the music gets slower the men and women revolve more slowly so slowly they barely move at all the music almost stops there is a slow beating of a drum the music is heard more loudly it is like a psalm sung by a chorus of monks it is a funeral dirge the song sung when a man is about to be buried the drums beat louder the music quickens a high screaming note comes in and holds steady through the dirge the drum beats faster the music quickens the high screams grow louder the dancers bunch in the middle of the room staring towards the window through their round black covered eyes they begin to talk quietly among themselves they are discussing something and looking at the window on the night of the fair there was an acci dent q what was

and his wife and their two children standing in front of the window his arm is around josephine on one side and his other arm spans the shoulders of the two boys on the other the crowd is talking about them ryan feels fear for his wife and children the crowd talks more angrily looks at ryan and his family the scream behind the music is louder the singing more urgent the drum beats faster faster faster the spaceship is on course for munich on course travelling at just below the speed of light the spaceship is on course for munich condition steady condition steady condition steady the light flashes on and off as if trying to warn him of something rather than to reassure him he frowns at the big sign is there something wrong with the hibernating personnel something he has not noticed something the instruments have not registered and ryan awakes sweating in his red inflatable chair and stares blindly at the minute flat figures on the television screen his body is limp and his mouth is dry he licks his lips and sighs aloud then he sets his mouth in a firm line switches off the set and leaves the room his feet echo along the passageway he reaches a cubicle containing a long white bed he straps himself on and is massaged when he is finished his body aches and his mind is still not clear it is now time for ryan to eat he returns to his room and gets food he eats and he tastes nothing when he has finished he raises the cover over the porthole screen in his room and looks out through the simulated window into the vastness of space for a second he feels that he sees a dark figure out there in the void he clears his vision rapidly and stares out at the stars he cannot see the planet that he and his companions are bound for he has been in space for three years he will be in space for another two years and he cannot see his destination yet he has only the word of the space physicists that it exists and that it can support the thirteen lives he carries with him a planet of barnards star munich he is alone in space in charge of his ship and the lives of the other twelve he is more than halfway to his destination the sudden remembrance of what he has done sweeps over him along with his fear with the torment caused by the solitude ryan feels pride he causes the cover to sweep down over the porthole he leaves his room and walks into the control room to continue his duties but he cannot get rid of the lingering feeling of depression the sense of something not done this sense of a task unfulfilled makes him work with even greater intensity even greater efficiency he frowns there is still something left undone he rechecks everything he runs tests through the computer he inspects every instrument and doublechecks it to make sure it is reading accurately everything is perfect he has forgotten nothing the feeling almost disappears chapter seven when he has read his report into the machine ryan goes to the desk beneath the screen and opens the drawer where his red logbook is lying ready for his remarks first he sits down at his desk and hums a song as he completes some calculations he works quickly and mechanically to complete his task he lays it aside satisfied he has fifteen minutes free now he produces the red logbook from the drawer again rules a line under his formal report and writes alone in the craft i experience the heights and depths of emotion untempered by the needs of less mechanical work than i do now uninterrupted by the presence of others he reads this over frowns shrugs continues this means deep pain and being a prey to my own feelings it also means great joy an hour ago i stared out of my porthole at the enormous vista and recollected what i what we as a group have done to save ourselves my mind goes back to how we were and forward to what we will be ryans stylus hovers over the page he makes writing motions over the book but he cannot phrase his thoughts at length he gives up rules another line under his entry shuts the book and replaces it in the drawer he changes his mind gets the book out again and begins to write rapidly the world was sick and even our group was tinged with unhealthi ness we were not lilywhite we sold out some of our ideals but perhaps the difference was that we knew we were selling out we admitted what we were doing and so remained rational when almost everyone else had gone insane it is true too that we became somewhat hardened to the horrors around us shut them out even condoned some of them even fell in with the herd from time to time but we had our objectives our sense of purpose it kept us going however i dont deny that we dirtied our hands sometimes i dont deny that i got carried away sometimes and did things that i now am inclined to regret but perhaps it was worth it after all we survived perhaps that is all the justification needed we kept our heads and we are now on our way to colonise a new planet start a new society on cleaner more decent more rational lines cynics might think that an impossible ideal it will all get just as bad in time theyd say well maybe it wont maybe this time we really can build a sane society none of us is perfect especially this crew we all have our rows and we all have qualities that the others find annoying but the point is that we are a family being a family we can have our argu ments our strong disagreements even our hatreds to a degree and still survive that is our strength ryan yawns and checks the time he still has a few minutes free time to spare he looks at the paper and begins to write again when i look back to our days on earth particularly towards the end i realise just how tense we were the ship routine has relaxed me allowed me to realise just what i had become i dont like what i became perhaps one has to become a wolf however to fight wolves it will never happen again there were times i cannot deny when i lost hold of my ideals even my senses some of the events are hazy some are almost completely forgotten though doubtless one of my relatives or friends will be able to remind me i can hardly believe that it took such a short time for society to collapse that was what caused the trauma of course the suddenness of it all obviously there were signs of the coming crises and perhaps i should have taken more heed of those signs but then all chaos suddenly broke loose throughout the world what we tuttutted at in the manner of older people slightly disconcerted by the changing times i now realise were much more serious indications of social unrest sudden increases in population decreases in food production they were the old problems that the jeremiah had been going on about for years but they were suddenly with us perhaps we had been deliberately refusing to face the problem just as people had refused to consider the possibility of war with germany in the late thirties we homo sapiens have a great capacity for burying our heads in the sand while pretending to face out the issues ryan smiles grimly its true he thinks people under stress usually start dealing with half a dozen surrogate issues leaving the real issues completely untouched because theyre too difficult to cope with like the man who lost the sixpence in the house but decided to look for it outside because the light was better and he would thus save his candles he adds in his log and theres always some bloody messiah to answer their needs someone whom they will follow blindly because they are too fearful to rely on their own good sense its like don quixote leading the gadarene swine ryan chuckles aloud leaders fuhrers duces prophets visionaries gurus for a hundred years the world was ruled by bad poets a good politician is only something of a visionaryessentially he must be a man who sees the needs of people in practical and immediate terms and tries to do something about it visionaries are fine for inspiring people but they are the worst choice as leaders they attempt to impose their rather simple visions on an extremely complicated world why have politics and art become so mixed up together in the last hundred years why have bad artists been given nations as canvases on which to paint their tatty sketchy rubbish perhaps because politics like religion before it was dead as an effective force and something new had to be found and art stood in until whatever it was turned up will something turn up its hard to say well probably never know on munich if the world survives or not thank god we had the initiative to get this ship on her way to the stars no more time for writing ryan puts the logbook away quickly and begins his regular check of the ships nuclear drive running a check on virtually every separate component he taught himself the procedure for running the ship he was not trained as an astronaut no one planned that he should be the man standing in the control cabin at that particular moment until comparatively recently ryan was in fact a business man a pretty successful business man as he does the routine checking he thinks about himself before he even conceived the idea of travelling into space he sees himself a strongly built man of forty standing with his back to the vast plate glass window of his large thickly carpeted office his heavy healthy face was pugnacious his back was broad his thick stubbyfingered hands were clasped behind his back where ryan is now a monk a man dedicated to his ship and his unconscious companions a man charged like a cleric in the dark ages with preserving the knowledge and lives contained in this moving monasterythen he was a man almost perpetually in a state of combat ten thousand years before he would have been a savage standing in front of his pack hair bristling teeth bared bone club in hand instead ryan had been a toymaker not a kindly old peasant whittling puppets in a pretty little cottage ryan had owned a firm averaging a million pounds a year in profits producing toy videophones plastic hammers miniature miracles of rocketry talking lifesize dolls kneehigh cars with automatic gear changes genuine all electric cooking machines real baaing sheep things which jumped sped made noises and broke when their calculated lifespan was over and were thrown secretly and with curses by parents into the rapid waste disposal units of cities all over the western world ryan pressed the button which connected him with the office of his manager owen powell powell appeared on the screen he was on his hands and knees on the office floor watching two dolls three foot high walk about the carpet as he heard the buzz of the interoffice communicator he was saying to one of the dolls hello gwendolen as he said hello ryan the doll replied in a beautifully modulated voice hello owen thats the personalised doll you were talking about is it ryan said thats it powell straightened up i knew they could do it if they tried lovely isnt she the child voiceprints her in the shop on its birthday say after that she can give any one of twenty five responses to its questions but only to the child imagine that a doll which can speak apparently intelligently but only to you the kids go mad about it if the price is right ryan said powell was an enthusiast a man who would really if he had not had a twenty thousand pound a year job with ryan have been perfectly happy carving toys in an old peasants hut he looked disconcerted by ryans discouraging remark well maybe we can get the price down to twenty pounds retail what would you say to that not bad ryan deliberately gave powell no encouragement powell was a man who would work hard for a smile and stop working when you gave it reasoned ryan therefore it was better to smile seldom in his direction never mind all that now ryan rubbed his eyebrows theres plenty of time to get it right before christmas when well try a few out see how they go and produce a big line by spring for the follow ing christmas powell nodded agreed now said ryan i want you to do two things for me one get in touch with the factory and tell ames to use the mark iv pin on the queen of dolls two ring davies and tell him were stopping all deliveries until he pays hell never keep going during august if we do that objected powell if we stop delivering hell have to close down man well only get a fraction of what he owes us i dont care ryan gestured dismissively im not letting davies get away with another ten thousand pounds worth of goods so that hell pay us in the end if were lucky i will not do business on that basis thats final all right powell shrugged thats reasonable enough i think so ryan broke the connection he reached into his desk and took out a bottle of green pills he poured water into a glass from an oldfashioned carafe on his immaculate desk he swallowed the pills and put the glass down unconsciously he resumed his stance head jutting slightly for ward hands behind back he had a decision to make powell was a good manager a bit sloppy sometimes forgetful but on the whole efficient he was not quarrelsome like the ambitious conroy or withdrawn like his last manager evers what he had mistaken at first for decent behaviour respect for another mans privacy had gone beyond reason in evers when a manager refused to speak to the firms managing director on the interoffice communicator broke the connection con sistently in fact business became impossible ryan could certainly respect his feelings sympathize with them as it happened so would any other selfrespecting person but facts were facts you could not run a business without talking to other people strangers they might be uncongenial they might be but if you couldnt stand a brief conversation on the communicator then you were no use to a firm ryan reflected that he himself was finding it increasingly dis tasteful to get in touch with many of his key workers but since it was that or go under he forced himself to do so powell was certainly a good manager inventive and clever too on the other hand ryan thought he had come to hate him he was childish there was no other word for it that open countenance that smile a smile which said that he would take to anybody who took to him there was something doglike about it just pat him on the head and he would wag his tail to and fro jump up and lick your face sickening really ryan thought to himself it made you feel sick to think about it he had no reticences no reserves a man shouldnt be so friendly and of course ryan thought when you looked at the facts it all came down to powells being welsh that was the welshman for you openfaced and friendly when they spoke to you and clannishly against you behind your back the welsh gangs were some of the worst in the city ryan reflected that he had not bought his machine gun and taught his wife and elder son how to use it just for fun that was the welsh all handshakes and smiles when you met them and all the time their sons were stoning your relatives three streets away ryan tapped his teeth together old saunders of happyvoice had shaken him a bit when he had got on the communicator just to warn him about powell it might help he had said if that manager of yours powell changed his name you cant deny it sounds welsh and theres been an awful lot of trouble with those welsh nationalists recently between ourselves it only needs one word from a competitor of yours say moonbeam toys via their pro and youll be branded in the press as an employer of welsh labour and thats never likely to help sales because people remember just at that critical moment when theyre choosing between one of your products and one of another firms they remember and then they dont buy a ryan toy see what i mean one word from you to old powell and hell change his name to smith and youre in the clear ryan had smiled bluffly and made assurances when he had cut off the communicator two thoughts came to him one he knew powell would be first confused and then obstinate about changing his name two and worse that saunders did not think for one instant that powell was a welshman he just thought he had an unfortunate name ryan realised that he was right out on a limb where his com petitors refused to take on employees with suspect names however impeccable their backgrounds ryan had an actual living breath ing welshman working for him someone who could quite easily be a nationalist working for the welsh cause a somewhat obscure cause as ryan saw it it was bloody ridiculous how could he have got so out of touch why hadnt he thought of it ryan frowned no it was stupid powell was too absorbed in his work to worry about politics he was the last person to get involved in anything like that still a name was a name the nationalists had been causing quite a bit of trouble lately and things had really got bad with the assassination of the king the welsh nationalists had claimed it was their work but other groups of extremists had also made the same claim from a practical point of view ryan thought powell was an embarrassment no question of it yet he couldnt fire a man on suspicion ryans face took on an overrosy tinge and his thick hands gripped each other a little more firmly behind his back im in fucking trouble here he thought he pinched his nose and then reached out to buzz for his personnel manager frederick masterson was sitting at his desk working on a graph masterson was in physical terms the exact complement to ryan where ryan was thickset and ruddy masterson was tall thin and pale as the communicator buzzed in his office he dropped the pencil from his long thin hand and looked at the screen in alarm seeing ryan a thin smile came to his lips oh its you he said fred i want details of any staff we employ with foreign or strangesounding names or foreign backgrounds of any kind just to be on the safe side you realise im not planning a purge he laughed briefly just as well masterson grinned your names irish isnt it begorrah ryan said come off it fred im no more irish than you are not a single relative or ancestor for the past hundred years has even seen ireland let alone come from it i know i know said fred call me oirish agin and oill knock ye over the hade wid me shillelegh skip the funny imitations fred ryan said shortly the firms at stake you know how bloody smallminded a lot of people are well it seems to be getting worse i just dont want to take any chances i want you to probe if necessary turn the whole depart ment over to examining personnel records for the slightest hint of anything peculiar examine marriages family background school ing previous places of employment no action at this stage im not planning to victimise anyone not at the moment said masterson a funny note in his voice oh come off it fred i just want to be prepared in case any competitors start going for us naturally ill protect my employees to the hilt this is one way of making sure i can protect them against any scandal for a start masterson sighed what about those with negro blood i mean the west indians got around a bit before they were all sent back okay i dont think anyones got anything against blacks at the moment have they not at the moment fine but you never know no i want to protect them fred of course ryan cut the communicator and sighed an image flashed into his mind and with a start he remembered a dream he had had the previous night it was funny the way you suddenly remembered dreams long after you had dreamt them it had been to do with a cat his old house where he had lived with his parents it had had a big overgrown back garden and they had kept several cats the dream was to do with the air rifle he had had and a white and ginger cat an interloper that had entered the garden someone not himself as he remembered the dream had shot the cat he had not wanted to shoot the cat himself but had gone along with this other person they had shot the cat once and it had been patched up by neighbours there had been a piece of sticking plaster on its left flank the person had fired the gun and badly wounded the cat but the animal had not appeared to notice it had still come confidently along the wall tail up and pur ring towards the french windows it had had a big bloody wound in its side but it hadnt seemed to be aware of it the cat had entered the house and come into the kitchen still purring and eaten from the bowl of one of the resident cats ryan had not known whether to kill it to put it out of its misery or whether to let it be it hadnt actually seemed to be in any misery that was the strange thing ryan shook his head a disturbing dream why should he remember it now he had never after all owned a white and ginger cat ryan shrugged good god this was no time for worrying about silly dreams he would have to do some hard thinking some realistic thinking he prided himself that if he was nothing else he was a pragmatist not an ogre he was wellknown for his good qualities as an employer he had the best staff in the toy industry people were only too eager to come and work for ryan toys the pay was better the conditions were better ryan was much respec ted by his fellow employers and by the trades unions there had never been any trouble at ryan toys but he had the business to consider and of course ultimately the country for ryans exports were high or had been thought ryan before the massive wave of national ism had swept the world and all but frozen trade save for the basic necessities still it would pass a bit of a shakeup for everybody it wasnt a bad thing made people keep their feet on the ground one had to know how to ride these peculiar political crises that came and went he wasnt particularly politically minded himself a liberal with a small l was how he liked to describe himself he had an excellent profitsharing scheme in the factory lots of fringe benefits and an agreement with the unions that on his death the workers would take over control of the factory paying a certain percentage of profits to his dependants he was all for socialism so long as it was phased in painlessly he steadfastly refused to have a private doctor and took his chances with the national health service along with everybody else while he was not overfriendly with his workers he was on good terms with them and they liked him this silly racialistic stuff would come and go the odds were that it wouldnt affect the factory at all ryan took a deep breath he was getting overanxious that was his trouble probably that bloody davies account preying on his mind it was just as well to take a stiff line with davies even if it meant losing a few thousand he would rather kiss the money goodbye if it meant kissing goodbye to the worries that went with it he buzzed through to powell again powell was once again on his knees fiddling with a doll ah said powell straightening up did you take care of those couple of items powell yes i spoke to ames and i phoned davies he said hed do his best good man ryan said and switched off hastily as a delighted grin spread over powells face chapter eight ryan is working on a small problem that has come up con cerning the liquid regeneration unit in the forward part of the ship it is malfunctioning slightly and the water has a slight taste of urine in it a spare part is needed and he is instructing the little servorobot to replace the defunct element that was what had saved him of course he thought his prag matism he had kept his head while all around people were losing theirs getting hysterical making stupid decisions or worse making no decisions at all he smiles he had always made quick decisions even when those decisions were unpalatable or possibly unfashionable in terms of the current thinking of the time it was his basic hard headedness that had kept him going longer than most of them allowed him to hang on to a lot more helped him to the point where he was now safely out of the mess that was the disrupted insane society of earth and that is how he intends to remain he must keep cool not let the depression the aching loneliness the weaker elements of his character take him over ill make it he murmurs confidently to himself ill make it those people are going to get their chance to start all over again he yawns the muscles at the back of his neck are aching he wriggles his shoulders hoping to limber the muscles up but the ache remains hell have to do something about that must stay fit at all costs not just himself to think of he isnt proud of everything he did on earth some of those decisions would not have been made under different circumstances but he didnt go mad not the way so many of the others did he stayed sane just barely sometimes but he made it through to the other side he kept his eyes clear and saw things as they really were while a lot of other people were chasing wild geese or phantom tigers it was a struggle naturally and sometimes he had made mistakes but his common sense hadnt let him down not in the long run what had someone once said to him he nodded to himself that was it youre a survivor ryan a natural bloody survivor it was truer now of course than ever before he was a survivor the survivor he and his friends and rela tives he was making for the clean fresh world untainted by mankind leaving the rest of them to rot in the shit heap they had created yet he mustnt feel proud pride goeth before a fall mustnt get egocentric there had been a good deal of luck involved it wasnt such a bad idea to test himself from time to time run through that old time religion stuff the seven deadly sins check his own psyche out the way he checked the ship check for pride check for envy check for sloth check for gluttony and so forth it didnt do any harm it kept him sane and he didnt reject the possibility that he could go insane there was always a chance he had to watch for the signs check them in time a stitch in time saves nine that was how he had always operated and he hadnt done badly after all repair completed reports the computer ryan is satisfied congratulations he says cheerfully keep up the good work chum the point was he thinks that he unlike so many of the rest had never been to a psychiatrist in his life hed been his own psy chiatrist gluttony for instance could indicate some kind of disturbance that came out in obsessive eating therefore if he found himself overeating he searched for a reason hunted out the cause of the problem it was the same with work if it started to get on top of you then stop take a holiday it meant you could work better when you got back and didnt spend all your time bawling out your staff for mistakes that were essentially your own creation he presses a faucet button and samples the water he smacks his lips its fine he is relaxing the disturbing dreams the sense of depression have been replaced by a feeling of wellbeing he has compensated in time instead of looking back at the bad times he is looking back at the good times that is how it should be chapter nine masterson flashed ryan about a week after he had begun his checkup ryan had been feeling good for days the davies matter was settled davies had paid up twothirds of the amount and they had called it quits to show no hard feelings ryan had even paid off the mortgage on davies apartment so that he would have some where secure to live after he had sold up his business morning fred whats new ive been doing that work you asked for any results i think all the results are in ive drawn up a graph of our find ings on the subject how does the graph look itll come as a shock to you masterson pursed his lips i think id better come and talk to you personally show you the stuff ive got okay well of course yes okay fred when do you want to come here right away give me half an hour fine ryan used the half hour to prepare himself for mastersons visit tidying his desk putting everything away that could be put away straightening the chairs when masterson arrived he was sitting at his desk smiling masterson spread out the graph i see what you mean said ryan good heavens just as well we decided to do this eh it confirms what i already believed said masterson ten per cent of your employees chiefly from the factories in the north are actually of wholly foreign parentage australian and irish in the main another ten per cent had parents born outside england itself ie in scotland wales and the republic of ireland three per cent of your staff although born and educated in england are jewish about half a per cent have negro or asiatic blood thats the general picture ryan rubbed his nose bloody difficult eh masterson masterson shrugged it could be used against us there are a number of ways if the government offers tax relief to firms employ ing one hundred per cent english labour as theyre talking of doing then we arent going to benefit from the tax relief then there are wholesalers and retailers embargos if our rivals release this information lastly theres the customers ryan licked his lips thoughtfully its a tricky one fred yes tricky oh fuck fred ryan scratched his head theres only one assumption isnt there if you want to survive said fred yes it means sacrificing a few in order to protect the many well pay them generous severance pay of course its something like thirtyfive per cent of your employees well phase them out gradually of course ryan sighed ill have to have a talk with the unions i dont think theyll give us any trouble theyll see the sense of it they always have make sure of it said masterson first naturally whats up fred you seem fed up about some thing well you know as well as i do what this means youll have to get rid of powell too he wont suffer from it im not a bloody monster fred youve got to adjust though its the only way to survive weve got to be realistic if i stood on some abstract ideal the whole firm would collapse within six months you know that the one thing all political parties are agreed on is that many of our troubles stem from an overindulgent attitude towards foreign labour which ever way the wind blows in the near future theres no escaping that one and the way our rivals are fighting these days we cant afford to go around wearing kid gloves and sniffing bloody daffodils i realise that said masterson of course powell wont feel a thing hed rather be running a dolls hospital or a toyshop anyway ill do that ill buy him a bloody toyshop what do you say that way everybodys happy okay said masterson sounds a good idea he rolled up the charts ill leave the breakdown with you to go over he made for the door thanks a lot fred ryan said gratefully a lot of hard work very useful thanks its my job said masterson cheerio keep smiling he left the office ryan was relieved that he had gone he couldnt help the irrational feeling of invasion he had whenever anyone came into his office he sat back humming and studied mastersons figures you had to stay ahead of the game but masterson had put his finger on the only real problem he disliked the idea of firing powell in spite of the mans unbearable friendliness his nauseating candour his stupid assumption that you only bad to give one happy grin to open the great dam of smiles swirling about in everyone ryan grinned in spite of himself that summed up poor old powell all right as a manager as a creative man powell was first class ryan could think of no one in the business who could more than half fill his place he wasnt any trouble he was content a willing worker putting in much longer hours than were expected of him but was that just his goodheartedness ryan wondered a light was dawning now he could see it powell was probably just grate ful to have a job he knew that no one in any business would employ him just like a bloody welshman to hang on and on not letting you know the facts creeping about getting good money out of you not letting you know that his very presence was threatening to ruin your business trying to make himself indispensible in the hopes that youd never find out about him and fire him pleasant and agreeable and cooperative maybe even a front for some sort of welsh nationalist sabotage then the knife in the back the bullet from the window the enemy in the alley stop it ryan told himself powell wasnt like that he didnt need to build the man up into a villain to justify sacking him there was only one reason for sacking him he was an embarrassment he could harm the firm ryan relaxed he sat down at his desk opened a drawer and took out his packed lunch he opened the thermos flask and poured himself a cup of coffee he placed his meal on the miniature heater in the lower compartment of the luncheon box thank god he thought for the abolition of those communal lunches with other business men or the firms executives thank god that communal eating had finally died the death what could have been more disgusting than sitting munching and swallowing with a gang of total strangers sitting there staring at their moving mouths offering them items wine salt pepper water to make their own consumption more palatable talking to them face to face as they nourished themselves the conversion of the canteens had provided muchneeded office space as well ryan took a fork and dug into the plate the food was now thoroughly heated once he had eaten he felt even more relaxed he had thought it all out he didnt waste time when it came to decisions no point in moralising he wiped his lips the problem had assumed its proper proportions it would cost him a bit in golden and silver handshakes but it was worth it he could probably get cheaper staff anyway considering the huge volume of unemployment and recoup his losses by the end of the year this way everybody gains something nobody lost he picked up the sheets of names and figures and began to study them closely chapter ten thats how it was thinks ryan a cop out now he looked back but a graceful cop out no one got badly hurt it could have been worse it was the difference between a stupid approach and an intelligent approach to the same problem it had been the same when he had got the group out of that riot at the patriot meeting when had that been january yes january the civilised world had been expecting the end there had been all the usual sort of apocalyptic stuff which ryan had dismissed as a symptom of radical social change he had not been able to believe then that things were going to get worse there had been penitential marches through the streets even scourgings public confessions and january had been the month of that oddball move to close the camps for foreigners the camps had been decently maintained the people lived as well as anyone outside the camps perhaps better in certain circumstances it had also been the month when the patriots had tried to open the camps up to more people to a more sinister less identifiable group ryan remembers the crowd in trafalgar square a crowd fifty thousand strong covering the square pushed up the steps of the national gallery and st martins pushed inside the gallery and the church right up against the altar the crowd had blocked the streets all around it was horrifying disgusting people like rats in a box even now ryan feels sick remembering how he felt then he and the group had gone along but they were now regret ting it whenever the crowd got too noisy or violent the troops fired over their heads it had been snowing the searchlights played over the plinth where the leading patriots stood and they flashed over the heads of the crowd picked up large flakes of snow as they drifted down on the dense mass of people the patriot leaders collars of their dark coats turned up stood in the snow looking over the crowd and as they spoke their voices were enormously amplified deafeningly amplified reaching all the way up the mall to where queen anne sat in her lonely room hearing the words on tv and from the meeting itself a quarter of a mile away reaching all the way down whitehall to parliament itself parliament that discredited institution they are turning on each other now thought ryan looking at the faces of the patriots there were signs of dissension there if he wasnt mistaken there would be a split soon but meanwhile there were the usual speeches coming distorted into the mind partly because of the amplification system partly because of the wind partly because of the usual ungraspable political cliches the speakers used the snow kept falling on the upturned faces of the crowd an orderly crowd of responsible people there were few interrupters the presence of the troops and the paid patriot guards made sure of that colin beesley patriot leader and member of parliament stood up to speak beesley a large thickset man in a long black overcoat and a large hat was an extremist his political manner was of the old school the churchillian school which still touched many people who wanted their politicians to be strong his tone was pon derous his words spoken slowly and relatively clearly were portentous unlike the others he did not speak generally about the patriot cause for he had come to make a fresh statement as he began to speak the wind dropped and his words came through with a sudden clarity over the crowd in the square the crowds in the streets down as far as westminster along to buckingham palace as far as piccadilly circus in the other direction aliens among us he said his head lowered and thrust towards the crowd there are aliens among us we do not know where they come from we do not know how they landed we do not know how many there are but we do know one thing my friends people of england they are among us ryan standing uncomfortably in the middle of the crowd in the square grimaced sceptically at his friend masterson who stood beside him ryan couldnt believe in a group of aliens contriving to land on earth without anyones knowledge not when the skies were scanned for invaders from special observation posts built all over the country but masterson was listening seriously and intently to beesley ryan turned his attention back to the platform we cannot tell who they are yet they are among us beesleys voice droned on they look like us sound like us in every respect they are human but they are not human they are non human they are antihuman he paused lowered his voice how you say do we know about the aliens how have we found out about the existence of this pollution of these creatures who move about our society like cancer cells in a healthy body we know by the evidence of our own eyes we know the aliens exist because of who they are what happens when they are about otherwise how can we explain the existence of chaos blood lust lawbreaking riot revolution in our midst how can we explain the deaths of the little children battered to death by the fanatics of yorkshire the waves of rioting and looting all over the west country the satanic practices of religious maniacs in the fens how can we explain the hatred and the suspicion the murder ratenow three times what it was five years ago a full ten times what it was in how can we explain the fact that we have so few children when a few years ago the birth rate had doubled disaster is upon us who is stirring up and fomenting all this disorder bloodshed and ruin who who ryan glancing into the faces of the people about him could almost believe they were listening seriously were they or was the presence of the troops and the patriot guards preventing them from catcalling or just walking away from this nonsense he looked at the faces of the police around the platform they were staring up at beesley brutefaced men listening to him with close attention ryan scarcely able to believe it realised that beesleys stories of the hidden invaders was being taken seriously by the majority of the vast crowd as beesley went on speaking describing the hidden marauders makers of chaos in their midst the crowd began to murmur in agreement their bases are somewhere beesley went on we must find them fellow patriots we must eliminate them like wasp nests and there came from the crowd a great hissed susurrus yesssss we must find the polluters and wipe them out forever whether they come from space or are the agents of another power we do not know as yet we must discover where they originate and the crowd like a cold wind through the ruins answered yessssss hes lost them thought ryan sceptically if he doesnt give them something a bit more concrete than that hes got to tell them how to pick out these menacing figures they have to destroy who are they how do we find them asked beesley how how how indeed his tone became divinely reasonable you all know in your heart of hearts who they are they are the men and women too make no mistake they are women as well who are different you know them you can tell them at a glance they look different their eyes are different they express doubt where you and i know certainty they are the men who associate with strangers and people of doubtful character the men and women who throw suspicion on what we are fighting for they are the sceptics the heretics the mockers when you meet them they make you doubt everything even yourself they laugh a lot and smile too often they attempt by jesting to throw a poor light on our ideals they are the people who hang back when plans are suggested for purifying our land they defend the objects of our patriotic anger they hang back from duty many are drunkards licentious scoffers you know these people friends you know them these men who have been sent here to undermine a righteous society you have always known them now is the time to pluck them out and deal with them as they deserve and before he had finished speaking the crowd was in uproar there were shouts and screams ryan poked masterson who was staring incredulously at the platform in the ribs lets get out he said theres going to be trouble only for the aliens said james henry at his other elbow come on ryan lets sniff em out and snuff em out ryan looked at henry in astonishment henrys green eyes were ablaze for crying out loud henry he turned to his brother john john looked back vaguely and suddenly under the gaze of his elder brother seemed to pull him self together hes right said john wed better think of getting home this is real mass hysteria jesus christ henrys mouth hardened im staying look ryan was jolted by the crowd snow fell down his neck henry you cant possibly do what you like ryan weve heard the call to deal with these aliens lets deal with them they wouldnt be likely to come here tonight would they ryan shouted then he stopped realising that he was beginning to answer in henrys terms that was the first step towards being convinced good god henry this is too classic for words were rational men agreed which makes our duty even clearer the crowd was pushing the four men backwards and forwards the men had to shout to be heard over the roar of the rabble james come home and talk it over this isnt the place ryan insisted standing his ground with difficulty from some where came the sound of gunfire then the gunfire stopped ryan found he was shouting into relative silence you wont take that aliens nonsense seriously when youve got a drink inside you back at our flat a man put his head over henrys shoulder his red face was flushed what was that friend he said to ryan i wasnt talking to you oh no i heard what you said thats of interest to everyone here youre one of them if you ask me i didnt ryan looked contemptuously at the sweating face but were all entitled to our own opinions if you think its true i wont argue with you shut up masterson cried tugging at ryans sleeve shut up and come home bloody alien the redfaced man shouted a bloody nest of them instantly it seemed to ryan the crowd was on them he came rapidly to a decision keeping his head even in this situation calm down all of you he said in his most commanding voice my point is that we might make mistakes in this situation the aliens have to be found but we need to work systematically to find them use a scientific approach dont you see the aliens them selves could be stirring things up for us making us turn on each other the redfaced man frowned its a point he said grudgingly now i believe that if there are aliens here tonight they are not going to be in the middle of the crowd they are going to be on the edges trying to sneak away ryan continued that seems reasonable said james henry lets get after them ryan led the way shouting with the rest aliens aliens stop the aliens get them now over there in the streets pushing through the crowd was like trying to trudge through a quagmire every step every breath ryan took was painful ryan led them pace by pace through the packed throng up the steps into the national gallery and as the crowd thinned out in the galleries themselves through a window at the back through yards over walls and car parks until they escaped the redfaced man and his friends and were finally in the moving mass of oxford street only james henry didnt seem aware of what ryan had done as they reached hyde park he pulled at ryans torn coat hey what are we supposed to be doing i thought we were going after the aliens i know something about the aliens that wasnt mentioned tonight ryan said what ill tell you when we get back to my place when they finally reached ryans flat they were exhausted what about the aliens then james henry asked as the door closed behind them the worst aliens are the patriots said ryan they are the most obvious of the antihumans henry was puzzled surely not ryan took a deep breath and went to the drinks cabinet began fixing drinks for them all as they sat panting in the chairs in the living room the patriots murmured henry i suppose its just pos sible ryan handed him his drink i thought he said that the discoveries in space would give us all a better perspective instead it seems that the perspective has been even more narrowed and distorted once people only feared other races other nations other groups with opposed or different interests now they fear everything its gone too far henry im still not with you james henry said simply paranoia what is paranoia henry being afraid of things suspecting plots all that stuff it can be defined more closely it is an irrational fear an irrational suspicion often it is in fact a refusal to face the real cause of ones anxiety to invent causes because the true cause is either too disturbing too frightening too horrible to face or too difficult to cope with thats what paranoia actually is henry so so the patriots have offered us a surrogate they have offered us something to concentrate on that is nothing really to do with the true causes of the ills of society its common enough hitler supplied it to the germans in the form of the jews and the bol sheviks mccarthy supplied it to the americans in the form of the communist conspiracy even our own enoch powell supplied it in the form of the west indian immigrants in the sixties and seventies there are plenty of examples james henry frowned you say they were wrong eh well im not so sure we were right to get rid of the west indians when we did we were right to restrict jobs to englishmen when we did you have to draw the line somewhere ryan ryan sighed and what about these aliens from space then where do they fit in what are they doing to the economy they are an invention a crude invention at that of the patriots to describe anyone who is opposed to their insane schemes where do you think the term witchhunt comes from henry james henry sipped his drink thoughtfully perhaps i did get a bit overexcited ryan patted him on the shoulder we all are its the strain the tension and it is particularly the uncertainty we dont know where were going weve no goals because we cant rely on society any longer the patriots offer certainty and thats what weve got to find for ourselves youd better explain john ryan said from his chair have you got any suggestions ryan spread his hands that was my suggestion that we find a goal a rational goal find a way out of this mess and ryan now sitting at his desk in the great ship reflects that it was that evening which was the turning point that decision which brought him to where he is now aboard the spaceship hope dempsey heading towards munich barnards star at point nine of c chapter eleven there is no sound here in space no light no life only the dim glow of distant stars as the tiny craft moves so slowly through the great neutral blackness and ryan as he goes methodically about his duties thinks with a heavy heart of the familiarity and warmth of his early years of the births of his children of studying their first schoolbooks talk ing to his friends in the evenings at their flat of his wife now resting like some comfortable sleeping beauty unaware of him in the fluids of her casket just a pellet travelling through space thinks ryan nearly all the living tissue contained in the pellet is unconscious in the waters of the caskets once they had moved and acted they had been happy until the threats had become obvious until life had become unbearable for them ryan rubs his eyes and writes out his routine report he under lines it in red reads it into the machine sits down again before the log book he writes another day has passed i am frightened sometimes that i am becoming too much of a vegetable i am an active man by nature i will need to be active when we land i wonder if i have become too passive still this is idle speculation his speculations were never idle he reflects the moment the problem was clearly seen he began to think along positive lines the problem was straightforward society was breaking down and death and destruction were becoming increasingly widespread he wished to survive and he wished for his friends and family to survive there was nowhere in the world that could any longer be considered a safe refuge nuclear war was bound to arise soon there had been only one answer the stars and there had been only one project for reaching the stars unmanned research craft had brought back evidence that there was a planetary system circling barnards star and that two of those planets were in many respects similar to earth the research project had been united nations sponsored the first important multilateral project between the great powers it had been a last attempt to draw the nations of the world together to make them consider themselves one race ryan shakes his head it had been too late of course ryan writes i keep fit as best i can an odd thought just popped into my head it gives some idea of how closely one has to watch oneself it occurred to me that a way of keeping fit would be to wake one of the other men so that we could have sparring matches play football or something like that i began to see the sense of this and began to rationalise it so that it seemed advantageous to all concerned to wake say my brother john or even one of the women there are several ways of keeping fit and alert getting exercise ridicu lous undisciplined ideas it is just as well i keep the log it helps me keep perspective he grins a great way of cheating on old john hed never know he shudders naturally he couldnt there was josephine too it would betray the whole ideal of the mission if he betrayed them i think ill go and take a cold shower he writes jokingly he signs the book underlines his entry in red closes the book puts it neatly away gets up makes a last check of the instruments asks the computer a couple of routine questions is satisfied by the answers leaves the control cabin true to his word mr ryan has his cold shower it does the trick he feels much better humming to himself he enters his own cabin selects the tape of messiaens turangalila symphony and sits down to listen to the strange and beautiful melodies of the ondes martenot by the sixth movement he is asleep the gallery is vast and made of solid platinum he paces it it is the bridge of a massive ship but the ship does not sail across the ocean it sails through foliage dark tangled foliage foliage that the douanier himself might have painted menacing foliage perhaps it is a jungle river a river like the amazon or one of those mysterious unmapped rivers of new guinea that as a boy he had wished to explore ship foliage river he is alone on the ship but for the sound of the engines strangely melodic and the cries of the unseen birds in the jungle he leans over the rail of the bridge looking for the waters of the river but there are no waters beneath the ship is only vegetation crushed and bent by the passage of the great vessel the ship rolls he falls and from somewhere comes a sound that is oddly sympathetic something is pitying him he rejects the pity he falls to the ground and the ship passes on he is alone in the jungle and he hears the sounds of lumbering monsters in the murk he searches with his eyes for the monsters but he cannot see them cannot trace the origin of their noise a woman appears she is dark lush exotic she parts her red lips and takes him by the hand into the shadowy darkness of the tropical foliage birds continue to cry and to squawk he begins to kiss her wet hot mouth he feels her hand on his penis he runs his hand into her crutch and her pants are wet with her juices he tries to make love to her but for some reason she is wary expect ing discovery she will not remove her clothing they make love as best they can then she gets up and leads him through the dark jungle corridors into a clearing they are in a bar girls club hostesses or prostitutes he cannot tell fill the place there are a few men probably ponces or gigolos he feels at ease here he relaxes he puts his arm around the dark woman and puts his other arm around a young blonde with a lined decaying face someone he knew all the faces in fact are familiar he tries to remember them he concentrates on remembering them dimly he begins to re member them after the fair they were all lead q please define specific situation ardour the more they sang ahead q please define specific

screams he wakes up the tape machine is humming rhythmically he shudders he has an erection his mouth is dry he has a pain above his left temple his legs are trembling his hands are gripping the plastic of his chair pinching it in handfuls like a housewife inspecting a chicken the muscles at the back of his neck ache horribly he shakes his head what wasnt true the symphony has come to an end he gets up and switches off the machine frowning and massaging his neck he yawns then he remembers the dream the jungle the women he grins with relief recognising the source of the exclamation the denial with which he had woken himself up just simple oldfashioned guilt feelings obviously he had considered waking janet cheating on his brother had dreamed accordingly had denied his feelings and had come awake with a start all that proved was that he had a conscience he stretches scratching his head he leaves the cabin and goes to take another shower as he washes he smiles again its just as well to let those secret thoughts out into the open no good burying them where they can fester into something much worse catch him off his guard and possibly wreck the entire mission maybe make him wake up the others that would be fatal a wave of depression hits him its bloody hard he thinks bloody he pulls himself together his old reflexes are as good as ever keeping fit isnt just a matter of exercising the body one has to exercise the brain too make constant checks to be sure its working smoothly he must be getting unduly sensitive however for his conscience was never that much of a burden to him he laughs he knows what he must do its the old trouble the problem of leisure it was unhealthy not to put your mind to something other than its own workings he was developing the neuroses of the rich the nonworkers or would start to if he wasnt careful the dream is a warning or rather his reaction to the dream is a warning tomorrow he will start studying the agricultural programmes get interested in something other than himself refreshed his aches and pains vanishing he returns to his cabin sorts out the agricultural programmes ready for the next day then he goes to bed chapter twelve although he is alone on board he faithfully follows all the rituals as if there were a full crew in attendance as a boy i used to swim through cold water in the streams that ran between the pines he thinks at the time set for the daily conferences he sits at the head of the table and reviews the few events and projected tasks with which he is involved he eats at the formal meal times uses formal language in all his dealings with the ship makes formal checks and radios formal log entries back to earth his only break with formal routine is the red logbook he keeps in the desk he makes the formal tours to the hibernation section nick named crew storage by the personnel when they first came aboard as a young man i stood on hills in the wind and stared at moody skies he thinks and i wrote awful sentimental selfpitying verse until the other lads found it and took the piss out of me so much i gave it up i went into business instead just as well he touches the button and the spin screws automatically retract i wonder what would have happened to me art thrives in chaos whats good for art isnt good for business he pauses by the first container and looks into the patient face of his wife mrs ryan cleaned down the walls of her apartment she was using the appropriate fluid all the time she cleaned she kept her face averted from the long window forming the far wall of the apartment when she had finished cleaning she took the can of fluid back to the kitchen and put it on the right shelf frowning uncertainly she stood in the middle of the kitchen then she drew a deep breath and she reached towards the shelf again touching another can the can was labelled plantfood she grasped the can she lifted it from the shelf she coughed and covered her mouth with her free hand she drew another breath she walked into the lobby and sprayed the orange tree that stood in its shining metallic tub she went back to the living room with its coloured walls expensive cushiony plastic chairs the wall to wall tv she turned on the tv the wall opposite the window was instantly alive with whirling dancing figures watching them gyrate mrs ryan relaxed a trifle she looked at the can in her hand and put it down on the table she watched the dancers her eyes were drawn back to the can still lying on the table she began to sit down then she stood up again mrs ryans fresh fortyyearold face crumpled slightly her lips moved she had the expression of a resolute but frightened child halfready to cry if the expected accident occurred she picked up the can and walked to the walllong window with her eyes halfclosed she located the button which controlled the raising and lowering of the blinds with the room in darkness she sprayed the plants on the windowsill she took the can back to the kitchen and placed it on the shelf she stood in the kitchen doorway for a while staring into the dark ness of the living room lit only by the flicker of the tv then she crossed the room to the window and placed her hand on the button controlling the blind she turned her back to the window and found the button with her left hand there was a big production number on tv she stared at it unmoving then she pressed the button and sprang away from the window as the blinds rushed up and the room was flooded with daylight again she hurried into the kitchen turning off the tv as she went past she made some coffee and sat down to drink it the room was silent the empty window looked out on to the apartment block opposite their empty windows stared back few cars ran in the street between the blocks inside the apartment in the kitchen mrs ryan sat with her coffee cup raised like a puppet whose motor had cut out in mid action the telephone buzzed mrs ryan sat still the telephone went on buzzing mrs ryan sighed and approached the instrument set at head height on the kitchen wall she ducked down against the wall and reached up to remove the mouthpiece its me uncle sidney said the voice from the screen above her head oh its you uncle sidney said mrs ryan she backed away from the wall still holding the mouthpiece and sat down near the kitchen table dont come too close said uncle sidney uncle sidney said mrs ryan pitifully ive asked you not to call during the day when no ones at home after all i dont know who you are it might be anyone im sorry im sure i just wanted to ask if youd like to come over tonight the cars being repaired said mrs ryan he had to go by bus this morning i told him not to but he insisted i dont know mrs ryan broke off a sadly bewildered look on her face there was silence then she and uncle sidney spoke together ive got to clean mrs ryan said cant you come said uncle sidney uncle sidney ive got to clean the front door today and i know i know that as soon as i open the door the woman from the next apartment will come out and pretend shes going to use the garbage disposal do you realise what its like living next to a woman like that uncle sidneys lined face dropped well if you wont visit your uncle you wont he said do you know how long its been since i saw you and him and the kids three months im sorry uncle sidney mrs ryan looked at the floor noticing a smear on one of the tiles you wouldnt come to see us i suppose on my own uncle sidney said contemptuously he cut the connection mrs ryan sat by the kitchen table holding the mouthpiece in her hand she stood up slowly and replaced it it seemed to her that she could not get the cleaner and the spray from the cupboard she could not cross the kitchen and go through the living room into the lobby she could not alone open the front door she could not open the front door she might mrs ryans mind became dark fearful confused she was swept around the whirlpool of her brain helpless and still in spite of herself struggling she could not open the door she could not mrs ryan uttered a low moan and went into the bedroom even in daylight the walls shimmered with many colours the bed was neatly covered with the white bedspread the shining dressing table was clear mrs ryan picked up the only sign of occupancy a pair of mr ryans outdoor shoes she opened a concealed cupboard and threw them in violently she ran to the window pressed the button on the sill the blinds came down quickly the walls of the room glowed and flickered mrs ryan paced to and fro past the bed to the darkened window back from the window to the bed back and forth she stopped and turned on soft soothing music she ran out of the room and locked the front door she came back into the bedroom shut that door lay down on the bed listening to the music even the music seemed slightly harsh today she closed her eyes and the faces came she opened her eyes and reached towards the bedside cupboard took out her sleeping pills swallowed a pill and lay down again the music was almost raucous she turned it off she lay in silence waiting for sleep it was am chapter thirteen mrs ryan began to dream she was walking across the field away from the house she had lived in when she was eight if she turned round she could see her mother framed in the kitchen window her head bent over the stove behind her she could hear shouts of her brothers playing hideandseek mrs ryan trod over the springy turf dreamily floated over the bright grass she could hear birds singing in the trees at the edges of the field mrs ryan was floating floating over the fields far from the house how sunny it was how the birds sang she was walking again she turned to look for the house but she was too far away she could not see it the sky was darkening she could only dimly see the trees on either side of the field she seemed to hear a noise a babble of talk at once ahead of her she saw a dark crowd approaching talking among themselves as they came closer she could still not distinguish one person from another she had the impression that there were men women and children but the mass was still a dark blur of heads bodies limbs formless and faceless the crowd advanced the cackle of voices growing louder she stood transfixed in the field she could not move and the voices grew clearer look there she is shes there shes really there she felt the mood of the crowd change she felt a terrible fear shes there thats her thats her shes there shes there she stood rooted to the spot her legs too heavy to carry her shes there shes there thats her thats her the dark crowd began to run towards her it yelled and cried out she could hear high vengeful screams from the women the crowd was almost on her and mrs ryan woke with a start in her bedroom in the light of the shimmering walls she looked at the clock it was am trembling she lay there on the white bedspread righting her way out of the dream she gazed blankly at the walls blinking her eyes to rid herself of the image of the black blank faces of that terrible crowd she rose and walked heavily from the room she went into the kitchen and took a pill to clear her head sighing she removed the can of cleaner from the shelf walked through the living room out into the lobby and up to the front door she put her hand on the latch mrs ryan hesitated stiffened her back and opened the front door she crept outside into the long corridor the corridor was bright and white it stretched away from her on either side set in the walls were the doors all painted in fresh dark colours slowly mrs ryan began to spray the cleaner on the surface of the door once the door was covered with the white film she began to rub it off faster and faster nearly done she thought to herself nearly done thank god thank god soon finished thank god very slowly the blue door of the apartment opposite began to open a woman looked through the crack of the door she and mrs ryan stared at each other in shock the womans hand went to her mouth mrs ryan recovered herself first leaving the door half covered in white cleaning fluid she ran back inside her apartment and slammed the door almost at the same moment the other woman shut her own door mrs ryan stood in the middle of her kitchen gasping for breath that bitch she said aloud that bitch what does she want to persecute me for why does she always do that to me spying on me all the time bitch bitch bitch she went to the shelf took down a bottle of capsules and swallowed two she went into the living room and fell down on the plastic couch she switched on the tv there was a picture of a family eating a turkey dinner the turkey and its trimmings were laid out brightly on a gay table the family parents and three teenage children were joking mrs ryan watched the programme with a faint smile curling round her mouth she was soon asleep it was am the boys woke her up she told them what bad happened and they told ryan ryan was sympathetic you need a holiday old girl he said well see what we can do id rather not she said i prefer to stay at home its just the interference from the neighbours im proud of my home of course you are well see what we can do it was pm time passes so slowly she said it depends how you look at it he replied she suffered a lot thinks ryan maybe i could have been more helpful he shrugs the thought off a pointless exercise there was nothing to be gained from selfrecrimination if one didnt like what one had done the best thing was to decide not to do it again and leave it at that that was the pragmatic attitude the scientific attitude he looks down at the sleeping face of his wife and he smiles tenderly touching the top of the container even her condition improved once they had decided on their goal she was basically a sensible woman her condition was no different from that of millions of others in the cities all over the world if they had taken one of the abandoned houses in the country perhaps she would have been happier but probably not the isolation of the places beyond the cities was pretty unbearable she had liked the country as a girl of course that was partly what the dream was about he guessed that dream of hers it had recurred relatively frequently not unlike that recurring dream of his he starts to pace between the containers checking them automatically what is time after all do we meet in our dreams pointless mystical speculation everything seems to be in order the containers are functioning correctly ryan yawns and stretches fighting off the sinking feeling in his stomach ignoring the impulse to wake at least some of the occupants of the containers they must not be awakened until the ship nears the planet that is its destination this is his penance his test his reward he has one last look at his sleeping boys then he leaves the compartment and makes his way back to the main control cabin sends his report back to earth all is well aboard the spaceship hope dempsey he writes a short entry in bis red logbook on the other side of those thin walls is infinite space there is no life for billions of miles no man has ever been more alone in his cabin he takes three pills disposes of his clothes lies down as he begins to fall asleep a numb desperate feeling tells him that tonight could be another of those nights of fitful nightmare ridden sleep his routine demands that he sleep regularly his health will break if he does not ryan lies on his narrow couch willing himself not to rise the pills take effect and ryan sleeps he dreams that he is in his office it is dark he has drawn the blinds to shut out the city noise and the view of the shining office towers opposite he sits at his desk doing nothing his hands are curled on the desk before him the fingernails are torn he is afraid he sees his wife in their flat she is sitting in the darkened living room doing nothing he sees the bedroom in which his two sons lie sleeping under heavy sedation the youngest fiveyearold alexander groans in his sleep thrusts an arm thin as a foreigners out of the covers the arm dangles lifelessly down from his bed he moans again his brother rupert who is twelve lies on his back eyes half open in his coma staring blindly at the ceiling back in the livingroom ryan sees the hunched figure of his wife again he sees himself sitting at his office desk staring into the half dark the family is waiting it is waiting in fear it does not know what to expect it knows that it will come from the others there is a scratching noise behind him ryan halfparalysed with terror turns slowly round to see what it is he faces the window now the blind is shaking as if it were being blown by the wind there is something behind the blind something from out side trying to enter the office ryan breathes in holds his breath hard in some animal instinct to make himself so immobile that he will not be noticed the blind shakes and shakes a bony hand comes through the fabric leaving no gap or tear merely sliding through as if the material were smoke or air ryan gazes at the hand it belongs to an old woman thin fingered with pronounced tendons the nails are painted red there are three large rings two diamond ones on the middle finger a large amethyst on the slender slightly curved little finger the hand appears to part the blind and a face peers in it is the face of an old woman the wrinkled eyelids are carefully painted blue the mouth is blackened the lined cheeks powdered the old woman looks ryan straight in the eyes and smiles reveal ing yellow teeth the edges slightly serrated with age ryan stares at the old woman she continues to give him a confidential intimate smile her hand appears again through another part of the blind it holds a pair of round dark glasses the hand moved towards her face it places the glasses over her eyes then the hand disappears through the blind again leaving no gap or rent in it the old blackened mouth continues to smile below the obliterated eyes then the old womans face in the centre of the blind begins to droop the smile disappears the lips begin to curve in a snarl ryan is terrified he cannot scream he wants to say the following words i did not but he cannot he cannot say the i he gets up from his bed he is sweating naked he leaves the cabin and walks down the bright corridor enters the main control cabin and stares at the dancing shifting indicators at the ever busy computer he listens to the faint hum of the engine which is propelling the little pellet of steel through the void the computer has left him a message he walks over to the machine and reads it it says there is a loss of communication a loss please ensure that in future information is given in the correct form repeat the correct form what is the exact nature of the situa tion repeat what is the exact nature of the situation repeat what is the exact nature of the situation uncomprehendingly ryan stares at the message what has gone wrong he has carried out his duties impeccably his days have been dedicated to order the routine of the ship what has he done wrong or worse what mistake can be occurring inside the computer he rips off the printout and reads it seeking a clue it has all the fluency and random lack of sense of a message from a ouija board and as he reads the computer spills out more cannot read your last message unless information is given in the correct form i cannot assist please repeat your last message in the correct form wearily ryan organises the machine to rerun his last message it reads triumphant in the bloody sky and the human form is no more i must control this sort of thing thinks ryan he wanders to the desk and takes out his red logbook he writes i must keep better control of things he struggles back to the computer and realises he has left his red logbook on the desk he weaves back to the desk and carefully but with great difficulty puts the book in its drawer slowly he closes the door he returns to the computer he erases the messages as best he can by condemning them to the computers deepest memory cells he walks wearily from the control room i must control this sort of thing i must forget these nightmares i must maintain order it could wreck the computer and then i would be finished everything depends on me triumphant in the bloody sky and the human form ryan weeps he paces the corridor back to his prison takes three more pills and sleeps he dreams of the factory a huge hall somewhat darker in ryans dream than it was in reality it is filled with large silent machines only the throbbing of the tiled floor indicates the activity of the machines at the end of each machine is a large drum into which spill the parts used in the making of ryan toys there are the smooth heads legs arms and torsos of dolls the woolly heads legs and torsos of lambs tigers and rabbits the metal legs heads and torsos of mechanical puppets there are the tiny powerpacs for the bellies of ryan toys there are the metal parts for ryan toys dredgers oilpumps spacecraft there are the great shining grinning heads of rytoy realboys and rytoy realgirls the great probosces of rytoy realphants the vast machines turn out their parts steadily and inexorably as each drum fills it glides away and is replaced by another which is in turn steadily filled ryan is a witness to this scene he knows that he will be involved if they find out he sees a whitecoated mechanic walk along the files of machines and disappear through a door at the end of the hall did the mechanic notice him the drums roll away and are replaced by empty ones suddenly ryan sees the parts rise as if in weightlessness they join together assembling in midair as each toy is completed or as completed as it can be with the parts available it sinks to the floor of the hall and begins to operate a row of golden haired realboys lifesize but armless revolve slowly singing frere jacques in their high voices a cluster of woolly lambs gambol mechanically raising and dipping their heads on the floor the large trunks of the realphants plunge and rise the spacecraft hover a foot above the floor emitting humming noises ryrobots strut and clank about running into the machines and toppling over two great heaps of musical building blocks chime out the letters printed on their sides i am a i am m i am u the piles fall and tumble as ryan kicks them the realgirls link hands and dance around him tossing their blonde curls the ryan battlewagons run about the floor shooting their miniature missiles ryan looks fondly at the action music and chatter of his toys the whole of the tiled floor is being gradually covered with toys in motion all these things are ryans made and sold by ryan he looks at the building blocks and smiles some have fallen and spelled out amusement in the middle of this cheerful scene ryan ceases to dream and falls fast asleep in accordance with the regulations ensuring that no member of the government or the civil service could be identified save by his rank thus ensuring the absence of blackmail bribery favour seeking andor giving and so forth the man from the ministry wore a black cloth over his face it had neat holes for his eyes and his mouth ryan sitting behind his office desk contemplated the man from the ministry somewhat nervously will you have a cup of tea he asked i think not ryan could almost see the expression of suspicious distaste on the mans face he had made a tactical blunder ah said ryan mr ryan began the official yes said ryan as if in confirmation yes indeed mr ryan you seem unaware that this country is in a state of war ah no since birmingham launched its completely unprovoked attack on london mr ryan and bombed the reservoirs of shepperton and staines the official government of south england has had to requisition a great deal of private industry if it has been discovered that it has not been contributing to our war effort as efficiently as it might thats a threat is it ryan said thickly a friendly tip mr ryan weve turned over as fast as we can ryan explained we were a bloody toy factory you know overnight we had to change to manufacturing weapon parts and communications equipment naturally we havent had a completely smooth ride on the other hand weve done our best your production is not up to scratch mr ryan i wonder if your heart is in the war effort some people do not seem to realise that the old society has been swept away that the patriots are bent on ordering an entirely new kind of nation now that the remnants of the alien groups have been pushed back beyond the thames though attacked from all sides though sustaining three hydrogen bomb drops from france the patriots have managed to hold this land of ours together they can only do it with the full cooperation of people like yourself mr ryan we arent getting the raw materials ryan said half the things we need dont arrive its a bloody shambles that sounds like a criticism of the government mr ryan you know im a registered patriot supporter not all registered supporters have remained loyal mr ryan well i am loyal ryan half believed himself as he shouted at the man from the ministry he and the group bad decided early on that the patriots would soon hold the power and had taken the precaution of joining the party its just that we cant work more than ten bloody miracles a day youve got a week im afraid mr ryan the official got up closing his briefcase and then it will be a temporary requisition order until our borders are secure again youll take over you will continue to manage the factory if you prove efficient you will enjoy the status of any other civil servant ryan nodded what about compensation mr ryan said the official grimly wearily there is a dis credited cabinet that fled to birmingham to escape retribution among other things that was discovered about that particular cabinet was that it was corrupt industrialists were lining their pockets with the connivance of government officials that sort of thing is all over now all over naturally you will receive a receipt guaranteeing the return of your business when the situation has been normalised we hope however that it wont have to happen keep trying mr ryan keep trying good luck to you ryan watched the official leave he would have to warn the group that things were moving a little faster than anticipated he wondered how things were in the rest of the world very few reports came through these days the united states were now dis united and at war united europe had fragmented into thousands of tiny principalities rather as england had as for russia and the far east the only information he had had for months was that a horde thousands of times greater than the golden horde was sweeping in all directions possibly none of the information was true he hoped that the town of surgut on the siberian plain was still untouched everything depended on that ryan got up and left the office it was time to go home chapter fourteen when he awakes he feels relieved alert and refreshed he eats his breakfast as soon as he has exercised and walks to the control room where he runs through all the routine checks and adjustments until lunchtime after lunch he goes to the little gym behind the main control cabin and vaults and climbs and swings until it is time to inspect hibernation he unlocks the door of hibernation and makes a routine and unemotional check a minor alteration is required in the rate of fluid flow on number seven container he makes the alteration again the routine checks the reiteration during the normal conference period he then does two hours study of the agricultural programmes he learns a great deal it is a much more interesting subject that he would have guessed then it is time to report to the computer and read the log through to earth if anyone is left on earth to hear it he makes the last of his reports for this period day number one thousand four hundred and sixtysix space ship hope dempsey en route for munich speed steady at point nine of c all systems functioning according to original expectations no other variations all occupants are comfortable and in good health ryan goes to the desk and takes out his red logbook he frowns scrawled across a page are the words i must keep better control of things it hardly looks like his writing yet it must be and when did he write it he has not had time to make any entries in the log until now it could have been at any time today or last night he frowns when he cannot remember he takes a deep breath and he rules two heavy red lines under the entry writes the date below it and begins all continues well i maintain my routine and am hopeful for the future today i feel less bedevilled by loneliness and have more con fidence in my ability to carry out my mission our ship carries us steadily onwards i am confident that all is well i am confident he stops writing and scratches his head staring at the phrase above the entry i must keep control of things i am confident that my period of nightmares and nearhysteria is over i have regained control of myself and therefore he considers tearing out this page and beginning it afresh but that would not be in accord with the regulations he is following he sucks his lower lip am doubtless much more cheerful the above phrase is something of a puzzle to me for at this point i cannot remember writing it perhaps i was under even greater stress than i imagined and wrote it last night after finishing the ordinary entry well it was good advice the advice of this stranger who could only have been myself it gives me a slightly eery feeling however i must admit i expect i will remember when i wrote it i hope so in the meantime there is no point in my racking my brains the information will come when my unconscious is ready to let me have it otherwise all ok the gloom and doom period is over at least for the time being i am in a thoroughly constructive and balanced state of mind he signs off with a flourish and humming puts the book in the desk closes the drawer gets up takes a last look around the control room and goes out into the passage before returning to his cabin he goes to the library and gets a couple of educational tapes in his cabin he studies the programmes for a while and then goes to sleep he dreams again he is on the new planet a pleasant landscape a valley with some sort of digging instrument he is working the soil he is alone and at peace there is no sign of the spaceship or of the other occupants this does not worry him he is alone and at peace next morning he continues with his routine work he eats he makes his formal log entries he manages to get an extra hour of study he is beginning to understand the principles of agriculture he returns to the control room to make the last of his reports the standard one which according to his routine he first enters in his logbook and then reads out to the computer he then sits down and picks up his stylus to begin his private entry he enters the date another pleasant and uneventful day spent largely in the pursuit of knowledge i am beginning to feel like some old scholar i can understand the attraction suddenly in the pursuit of information for its own sake in a way of course it is an escape i can see that even the most sophisticated sort of academic activity is at least in part a rejection of the realities of ordinary living my studies naturally are perfectly practical in that i will need a great deal of knowledge about every possible kind of agriculture when we the computer is flashing a signal it wants his attention frowning ryan gets up and goes over to the main console he reads the computers message condition of occupants of containers not reported ryan gasps it is true for the first time he has not checked the hibernation compartment he realises now that he was so caught up in his studies he must have forgotten he replies to the com puter report follows shortly reproving himself for this stupid lapse relieved that the com puter is programmed to check every function he performs and to remind him of any oversights he marches along the corridor to the hibernation room he touches the stud to open the door but the door remains closed he presses the stud harder still the door does not open ryan feels a moments panic could there be someone else aboard the ship a stowaway of some kind who he rejects the notion as stupid and then he returns to the main control cabin and gives the computer a question hibernation compartment door will not open please advise there is a pause before the computer replies emergency lock effective you must deactivate at main console ryan licks his lips and goes to the main console he scans the door plan and sees that the computer is correct he touches a stud on the console and cuts off the emergency lock was the mistake his or the computers perhaps the emergency lock was activated at the same time as he made the mysterious log entry he returns to the hibernation room and opens the door he enters the compartment chapter fifteen the containers gleam a pure soft white he walks to the first and inspects it it contains his wife josephine ryan his blonde pinkfaced wife blue eyes peacefully closed lies in her green fluid she looks so natural that ryan half expects her to open her eyes and smile at him josephine heart of the ship so glad to be setting out on her great adventure so glad to be free from the torture of living in the city with its unbearable atmosphere of hostility ryan smiles as he remembers the eager step with which she came aboard on the day of the takeoff how she had lost almost over night the sadness and the fear which had afflicted her indeed which had been afflicting them all he sighs how pleasant to be together again rupert ryan alexander ryan ryan walks fairly quickly past the containers where his two sons immature faces gaze in startlement at the bright ceiling sydney ryan ryan stares for a while at the wrinkled old face lips slightly drawn back over the false teeth the thin muscley old shoulders showing above the plastic sheet drawn over the main length of the containers john ryan isabel ryan isabel still weary looking even though at peace janet ryan ah janet thinks ryan with a surge of affection he loved josephine but by god he loved janet passionately he frowned the problem had not been over when they went into hibernation it would take a great deal of selfdiscipline on his part to make sure that it did not start all over again fred masterson tracy masterson james henry ida henry felicity henry everything is as it should be everybody is sleeping peacefully only ryan is awake he blinks only ryan is awake because it is better for one man to suffer acute loneliness and isolation than for several to live in tension one strong man ryan raises his eyebrows and leaves hibernation ryan reports to the computer josephine ryan condition steady rupert ryan condition steady alexander ryan condition steady sidney ryan condition steady john ryan condition steady isabel ryan condition steady janet ryan condition steady fred masterson condition steady tracy masterson condition steady james henry condition steady ida henry condition steady felicity henry condition steady the computer says earlier you reported yourself lonely does this condition still obtain ryan replies condition easier since then he moves to his desk and picks up his diary he writes land a short while ago the computer reported an oversight of mine id forgotten to report on the condition of the personnel the first time ive done anything like that and the last i hope then i discovered that the emergency locks in hibernation had been sealed and i had to come back and unseal them i must have done that too when i made the above entry i feel relaxed and at ease now the previous mistakes and i suppose mild blackouts must have been the result of the strain which i now seem to have overcome ryan winds up the entry closes the log puts it away leaves the control room he goes to his cabin and sets aside the educational tapes too much concentration he thinks mustnt overdo it its incredible how one has to watch the balance a very delicate equilibrium involved here very delicate he starts to watch an old patriot propaganda play about the discovery of a cell of the free yorkshire underground and its eventual elimination he turns it off he hears something he turns his head from the viewer it is a year since he heard a footstep not his own but now he can hear footsteps he sits there feeling sweat prickle under his hair listening to what seems to be the sound of echoing steps in the passage outside there is some stranger aboard he listens as the steps approach the door of the compartment then they pass he forces himself out of his chair and gets to the door he touches the stud to open the door it opens slowly outside the passageway stretches on both sides the length of the ships crew quarters the only sound is the faint hum of the ships system ryan gets a glass of water and drinks it he switches the viewer back on half smiling typical auditory hallucination of a lonely man he thinks the programme ends ryan decides to get some exercise he leaves his cabin and makes for the gym as he walks along the corridor he feels footsteps moving behind him he ignores the feeling with a shrug then comes a moments panic he gives way to the impulse to turn sharply there is of course no one there ryan reaches the gym he has the impression that he is being watched as he runs through his exercises he lies down on a couch for fifteen minutes before beginning the second half of the exercise routine he remembers family holidays on the isle of skye that was in the very early years of course before skye was taken over as an experimental area for research into algae food substitutes he remembers the pleasant evenings he and josephine used to have with tracy and fred masterson he remembers the evening walks through the roof gardens with his wife he remembers christmases he remembers sunsets he remembers the smell of the rain on the fields of the place where he was born he remembers the smell of his toy factories the hot metal the paint the freshly cut timber he remembers his mother she had been one of the victims of the shortlived hospitals euthanasia act the act had been repealed by the nimmoites during their short period of power the only sensible thing they did thinks ryan he sleeps once again he is on the planet in the valley but this time he is panicstricken that the ship and the others have left him he begins to run he runs into the jungle he sees a dark woman he is in his own toy factory among the dancing toys he takes pleasure at the sight of these things he has made they all function together so joyfully he sees the musical building blocks they still spell out a word amu with dawning fear he hears above the bangs and clangs of the mechanical toys the drone of the dirgelike music which in other dreams accompanies the dancers in the darkened ballroom the music rises almost drowning out the sounds made by the moving toys ryan feels himself standing rooted with fear in the middle of his gyrating models the music grows louder the toys spin to and fro round and round they begin to climb on top of each other lamb on dredger girl doll on piles of bricks making a huge pyramid close to him the pyramid grows and grows until it is at the level of his eyes the music grows louder and louder in his terror ryan anticipates a point in the music when the pyramid of still moving toys collapses on him he struggles to free himself from the toils of little mechanical bodies as he struggles he awakes he lies there and hears himself groan i thought they were over ive got to do something about it he gets off the couch and abandons the idea of exercise he stares around at the exercising machines i can remain master of myself ryan says i can he goes back to the control room adjusts various dials checks that his time devices are working accurately and makes the following statement to the computer am troubled by nightmares the computer replies know this inject cc proditol per diem do not take more discontinue the dose as soon as possible and at all costs after days ryan rubs his lips then he bites the nail of his right forefinger ryan paces the ship passageways engine room supplies room exercise room control room own cabin spare cabins observation room library he does not look at the door of the hibernation room he does not walk along the passage towards the door he continues his angry prowling for half an hour or more trying to collect his thoughts the footsteps follow him most of the time footsteps he knows do not exist echoing up and down the passageways he begins to hear frag ments of the voices of his companions the men and women now suspended in green fluid in the containers that must remain sealed until planetfall daddy daddy cries his youngest child alexander ryan hears the thud of his feet in the passage he overhears an argument between ida and felicity henry dont keep telling me how you feel i dont want to know felicity snaps at her pregnant twin sister you dont realise what its like says the other on a familiar note of complaint no no i dont he hears felicity say hysterically he hears the noise of a slap and idas weeping a door bangs let me see to it ryan he hears james henry say im patiently the voice seems to echo all over the ship he hears fred and tracy mastersons feet coming rapidly along the passageway his wife josephine is behind them daddy daddy the childs feet come scudding up to him ryan turns his head this way and that where are the sounds coming from janet ryan sings far away homeward bound where the fields are like honey ryan cannot hear the words properly he cranes his neck to listen but the words are still indistinct uncle sidney is singing too there was a man who had a mouse hididdleumtumtido he baked it in an apple pie there was a man who had a mouse isabel ryans voice comes from somewhere around him i cant bear any more then the rumble of john ryan his brother talking to her saying something ryan cannot catch janet singing both boys are running running running and ryan in the centre of all this noise sinks to the floor of the passage cocks his head listening to the voices as he crouches there it seems to him that the voices must be coming from the room at the end of the passage automatically he gets to his feet and with a stiff gait starts to walk up the passageway towards the door the voices grow louder i hate to see a man playing at being indispensible it benefits neither him nor the people about him says james henry the lord thy god is a jealous god and thou shall have no other god than him advises uncle sidney never mind dear never mind isobel ryan is telling someone alexander is crying muffled sobs into the pillow janet ryan is singing in her high clear voice homeward bound were homeward bound where the singing birds welcome such lovers as we ida and felicity henry are still arguing take it i dont want to take it you must take it its what you need i know what i need be sensible drink it now as ryan reaches the door the voices rise as he touches the stud they are louder still conversations statements songs sobs laughter arguments all coming towards him in an indistinguishable medley then the door is open the noises cease abruptly and ryan is left in the silence staring at the thirteen containers twelve full and labelled with the names and dates of the occupants the owners of the voices lie there quietly in their pale fluid ryan stands there in the doorway suddenly realising again that he is alone that the noise has ceased that he has opened the door at an unscheduled time his companions continue to sleep peaceful and unaware of the torment he is undergoing they are all at condition steady which is more than i am thinks ryan tears come to his eyes from the door he cannot see the people in the containers he counts the containers there are still thirteen he looks at the thirteenth his own he draws in his breath his lips curl back in a frightened feral snarl he steps out into the passageway and slams the heel of his hand against the door shutting it he begins to run very slowly down the passage until he comes to the end then he leans against a bulkhead breathing heavily he gasps and gasps again then he straightens his back and sets off slowly for the control room i shall have to think about that injection i might not be able to carry on without it id hoped to hold out longer than this doesnt do to get too reliant on that sort of thing it is supposed to be addictive after all maybe one dose will do the trick one might be all i need at any rate i darent go on without it ryan decides to have his first injection the next morning the proditol is an enzyme inhibiting substance that works directly on new cell matter entering the brain it has the effect of preventing the release of harmful substances into the cells causing lack of connection with the outside world and thus delusions ryan partly for prides sake partly for reasons he does not fully understand is very unwilling to take the drug but ryan is dedicated to the ship its occupants its goal there is little he would not do in order to be able to continue with the steady schedule of the ship and fulfill his responsibility towards its occupants ryan has made his decision plenty of sleeping pills tonight and the proditol tomorrow he goes to his sleeping compartment but then wanders back to the main control room he asks for details of the action of the drug icc proditol icc proditol also ma cccussr icc proditol is a fast acting drug of the enzyme inhibitor variety it begins to take effect within ten min utes of injection its full effect is felt wtthin the hour following after this the mind of the patient should be relieved of all impressions of a delusory nature in the severest cases the drug will control adverse symp toms for hours after which if delusions return a further injection should be administered in many cases this will not be necessary in no circumstances however should the drug be administered daily for more than days ryan acknowledges the message and walks to the control rooms main porthole he activates the screen and looks out at space the holographic illusion is complete space and the distant suns the tiny points of light so far away ryans brows contract he notices trails in the blackness they appear to be wisps of vapour and yet they are plainly not escaping from the ship it is something like smoke from an open fire trailing in the dark he passes his hand across his eyes and peers forward again the trails are still there he is alarmed he casts his mind over the data he has accumu lated hoping to think of something that will account for the vapour could they be left by the ships of another spacetravelling race it must be a possibility meanwhile the wisps continue to rise there are more and more of them now they swirl together break apart and reform ryan to his horror begins to hear a faint noise a kind of buzzing and ringing in his ears as the noise begins the gases begin to unite to shape themselves once again ryan passes a hand over his eyes the noises in his ears continue as he looks out of the porthole once more a terrible suspicion comes over him and instantly staring at him gravely with a small malicious smile on her lips is the old woman her eyes are shielded by the round dark glasses she is blacklipped her old skin covered in powder she puts the clawlike hand to the window and is gone ryan gasps and is about to turn from the window in panic when he sees the shapes ahead of him out there in space are the whirling figures of his nightmare the figures of the insane dancers in the darkened ballroom they are far away ryan hears their music in his ears as they dance slowly and proudly to the distant chant he watches paralysed as they come closer to the ship he sees their stiff bodies their plump respectable faces the expensive dark brocades of the womens dresses the good dark suits of the men he observes the wellnurtured upright bodies the straight backs the air of dignity and comportment with which they circle so correctly in time to the music the dark circles which are their eyes stare blindly at each other their faces are rigid below the dark glasses they circle through the void towards ryan and the music becomes louder more solemn more threatening daddy daddy alexander is crying ryan is unable to move cold light falls on the dancers they come closer to the ship closer to ryan standing terrified at his window daddy ryan hears the insistent voice and frowns is alex really up ryan smiles the boy was never one to stay in bed if he could help it but alexander ryan is not in bed he is in hibernation the dancers dance on they are not real ryan realises that he should give his attention to his son not to the illusory dancers out there in space they cant get in they cant confront him they cant take off in one terrible gesture the glasses which encircle their eyes revealing get back to bed alex they are very close now the music slows they are just a few paces from the ship they turn to face ryan with their blinded eyes slowly they take a step one step two steps three steps towards ryan they are clustered some thirty of them a foot from ryan standing just outside the window and then ryan realises with greater terror that it has been an illusion the dancers were not outside what he was seeing was a reflection in the window the dancers are actually behind him they have been in the ship all the time he dare not turn he stares instead into the mirror they stare back then ryan sees the other behind the crowd of dancers are his friends and relatives all stare at him from blank eyes all stare at him as if they do not know him as if indeed he does not exist for them josephine her plump face expressionless her blonde hair tumbling to her plump shoulders cruel in her indifference his two sons alexander and rupert startled expressions in their round eyes uncle sidney his stringing arm gripping the two boys round their thin shoulders his lips drawn back in a snarl his eyes on an object somewhere above ryans head there are the henry twins one healthy one tired by pregnancy but hand in hand and staring through ryan with identical hazel eyes there is tracy masterson looking vacuously past ryans left shoulder there is fred masterson ryans oldest friend a sympathetic expression on his face there is brother john puzzled tired uncomprehending there is isabel looking bitterly at john there is james henry red hair gleaming in the mirrorlight glaring meaninglessly through ryan and as he looks ryan sees the dancers in front take their last step towards him he wheels to face them he stares into the cool orderly control room the screens the dials the indicators the instruments the computer console grey and green muted colours quite he looks back at the porthole there is only blackness in one way this seems worse to ryan he begins to beat at the porthole howling and cursing where are you where are you you shits you cunts you bastards you bleeders you fuckers you horrors they are there again not the dancers only his friends and rela tives but they still cannot see him he waves to them mouths friendly words at them they do not understand they come a little closer and suddenly ryan feels their malice is shocked and horrified he looks at them and his expression is puzzled he tries to signal to them that they know him that he is their friend they crowd closer let us in they cry let us in let us in let us in let us in let us in let us in let us in the clamour around the ship increases hands claw at the window hands tear their way through the fabric of the porthole you fools youll destroy the ship be sensible wait ryan begs them youll bring the deaths of all of us dont dont dont but they are ripping the whole of the wall away exposing it to frigid space youll wreck the expedition stop it they cannot hear him his throat is tight he faints chapter sixteen ryan is lying on the floor of the control room his sleeve is rolled up and an ampoule of icc proditol lies near him the ampoule is empty he blinks at some point he must have realised what he had to do to stop the hallucinations he is impressed by his own strength of will how are you now he knows the voice he feels fear then relief it is his brother johns voice he looks up his jacket has been folded under his head john stalwart and stolid looks down at him you were in a bad way old son john how did you wake up something to do with the computer i think theres probably an emergency waking system if anything happens to the man on duty im glad of that i was a real idiot to carry on on my own i realised everything else about my condition except the extent of the strain i was insisting to myself that i didnt need anyone else to help me well youre okay now ill help you you can go into hiber nation if you like no that wont be necessary ryan says hastily ill be able to manage now ive got someone to share my troubles with he laughs feebly its just plain oldfashioned loneliness he shudders he still thinks he can see things in the corners of his eyes i hope of course says john he is convinced he isnt just trying to humour ryan john was always a hard man to convince therefore ryan is satisfied thank god for the emergency system eh says john a trifle awkwardly amen to that says ryan he wishes the emergency system had awakened that other member of johns family his young wife janet if someone had to be awake he dismisses the thought and gets up being with john is almost like being alone he thinks for john is not the most voluble of men still ryan gets up john is efficiently checking the instruments youd better get off to your bed old chap says john ill look after things here gratefully ryan goes to his cabin he lies in the dark grateful for the drug which has driven away his visions slightly nervous of the fact that john has joined him john probably knows about the affair he had with janet johns younger wife perhaps he doesnt care then again perhaps he does john isnt a particularly vengeful man but it would be just as well to be on guard ryan remembers the other affair he had the affair with sarah carson old carsons daughter carsons toy business had been ryans closest competitor carson was chairman of moonbeam toys and had known ryan for years they had both started off with saunders toys in the old days and had been running pretty much neck and neck ever since their rivalry had been a friendly one and they often met for lunch or dinner before the habit of communal eating became unfashion able when that happened they would still converse over the video carson became a fanatical patriot one day and as far as ryan was concerned no longer worth speaking to but by this time it was evident that the patriots were by far the most powerful political group in the country and ryan decided it would do him no harm to be carsons friend he even attended some meetings with carson and other patriots registering himself as a member it was at one of these meetings that he met sarah a tall beautiful girl of twentytwo who did not seem particularly convinced by her fathers views josephine was going through a particularly bad time as were the two boys all three of them spent twothirds of the day under sedation and ryan himself though he sympathised with their problems needed some form of relaxation the form of relaxation he chose was sarah carson or rather she chose him the moment she saw him she made a heavy play for him they took to meeting at an all but finished hotel for a few shillings they could hire a whole suite the bottom had dropped out of the hotel business by that time very few people trusted hotels or liked to leave home sarah pulled ryan out of his depression and gave him something to look forward to at night she was passionate and she had stamina ryan took to sleeping during the day ryan used the patriot meetings as an excuse and continued with sarah and her father to turn up at several then carson had an argument with the rest of his group carson had lately formed the opinion that the earth far from being a planet circling through space was in fact a hollowed out bubble in an infinity of rock instead of walking about on the outside of a sphere we were walking about on the inside of one carson went off to form his own group and soon had a healthy following who shared the hollow earth belief with him sarah continued to go with her father to his meetings she knew he had a weak heart and also acted sometimes as his chauffeur then carson formed the impression that ryan was an enemy sarah told ryan this its the old story if youre not with me youre against me hes getting a bit funny lately she said im worried about his heart she stroked ryans chest as they lay together in the hotel bed hes told me to stop seeing you darling are you going to i think so just to humour him hes eligible for a nuthouse now you know even the bloody patriot fanatics think hes barmy hes my old dad she said i love him youre hung up on him if you ask me darling i wouldnt have gone for you if i didnt have a hefty father complex would i ryan felt anger stupid old fool carson and now his daughter trying to put him down that was clever he said bitterly i didnt know you had such sharp knives in your arsenal come off it darling you brought it up anyway i was only joking youre not at all bad for your age thanks he got up scowling he put a glass under the tap in the washbasin and filled it with water he sipped the water gingerly and then threw it down the sink christ im sure theyre putting something in the water these days havent you heard she stretched out in the bed her body was nearperfect she seemed to be taunting him with it theres everything in the water lsd cyanide stuff to rot your brain you name it he grunted sure i think its probably just dead rats he got his shirt and began to put it on its time we were going its nine oclock the curfew starts at ten you dont want one last fuck for old times sake you mean it then about not seeing each other again i mean it darling make no mistake the condition hes in it would kill him hed be better off dead thats as may be she swung her long legs off the bed and began to dress will you give me a lift home for old times sake the mixture of rage and depression was getting on top of him he tried to shrug it off but it got worse with all his business worries production falling custom declining debts unpaid he didnt need this he knew there was no chance of her changing her mind she was a direct girl her pass at him had been direct now the brushoff was direct he hadnt realised how much she had been bolstering his ego it was ridiculous to rely on something like that but he had been his feelings now told him so they left the hotel the sun was red in the sky his car was in the street outside the curfew seemed pretty pointless for there was hardly anyone in oxford street at all ryan stood by the car looking at the ruins of the burntout department stores the gutted office blocks mementos of the winter riots sarah carson looked out of the window admiring the view she said youre a bit of a romantic on the quiet arent you i suppose i am he said as he climbed into the car and started the engine though ive always considered myself a realist just a selfish romantic youre making it harder than you need to he said as he took the car down the street sorry im not much of a sentimentalist you cant afford to be these days you want me to take you all the way back to croydon you dont expect me to walk through the antifem zone do you zone have they got control of a whole area now all but theyre trying to set up their own little state in balham allowing no women in at all any woman they catch they kill lovely ryan sniffed they might have the right bloody attitude dont get morbid sweetie can we go round balham its the quickest route since the brighton road got blown to bits in brixton try going round the other side then ill see they drove for a while in silence london was bleak blackened and broken ever thought of getting out sarah said as he drove down vauxhall bridge road trying to avoid the potholes he had begun to feel slightly sick partly her he thought and partly the damned agoraphobia where is there to go he said the rest of the world seems to be worse off than england sure and you need money to live abroad he said since nobody recognises anyone elses currency any more what would i live on you think people are going to buy a lot of toys this christmas she was looking at the completely flattened houses on the right his depression and his anger grew he shrugged he knew she was right you and my old dad are in the wrong business she said cheer fully at least he had the sense to go into politics thats a bit more secure for a while at any rate maybe he drove over the bridge it shook as he crossed a strong windll finish that she said shut up sarah he gripped the wheel hard oh god try to finish this thing off gracefully darling i thought you were such a good business man such a cunning bastard such a cool bird working out all the odds thats what you told me no need to throw it in my face ive got plans my love that you havent an inkling of not the spaceship idea she laughed how you didnt tell me darling i went through your briefcase a couple of weeks ago are you really serious youre not going to take thirteen people to siberia and steal that un spaceship thats been standing idle for the last year its ready to go theyre still bickering over who owns what bit of it and whose nationals have got a right to go in it itll never take off ryan smiled secretly youre nuttier than my old man sweetie ryan scowled wait till i tell my friends she said ill be dining out on it for weeks youd better not tell anyone my love he spoke through his teeth i mean it come on darling we all have our illusions but this is ridicu lous how would you fly one of those things its fully automatic he said its the most sophisticated piece of machinery ever invented and you think theyre going to let you pinch it were already in touch with the people at the station he said they seem to agree we can do it how are you in touch with them its not hard sarah oldfashioned radio for some time a few scientifically minded pragmatists like myself have been working towards a way of getting out of this mess since it seems impossible to save the human race from sinking back to the dark ages you could have saved it once sarah said turning to look directly at him if you hadnt been so bloody careful so bloody selfish it wasnt as simple as that your generation and the generation before that could have done something the seeds of all this ridiculous paranoia and xenophobia were there then god such a waste this century could have been a century of utopia you and your mothers and fathers turned it into hell it might look like that darling it was like that he shrugged and now youre getting out she said leaving the mess behind your talk of pragmatism is so much bloody balls youre as much an escaper as my poor daft old dad maybe more of one and less pleasant for that because you might fucking succeed they were driving through stockwell the sun was setting but no street lighting came on you feel guilty because youre letting me down dont you he said thats what all this display is about isnt it no youre a good fuck but i never cared much for your character darling youll have to go a long way to find a better one in these dark days he tried to say it as a joke but it was evident he believed it selfish and opinionated she said pragmatism ugh ill drop you off here then shall i he stopped the car it sank on its cushion of air she peered out into the darknesswheres here balham he said dont play games darling lets get this over with you were taking me all the way to croydon remember im a bit tired of your smalltalk darling all right she leaned back ill button my lip i promise ill say nothing until we get to croydon and then ill give you a sweet thank you but he had made his decision it wasnt malice it was self preservation it was for josephine and the boys and for the group he wasnt enjoying what he was doing get out of the car sarah you take me bloody home the way you said you would out she looked into his eyes my god ryan go on he pushed her shoulder leaned over her and opened the door go on jesus christ all right she picked up her handbag from the seat and got out of the car its something of a classic situation but a bit too classic really the sex wars hotted up in this part of the world thats your problem he said im not likely to get out of this alive ryan thats your problem she took a deep breath i wont tell anyone about your stupid spaceship idea if thats whats worrying you whod believe me anyway ive got a family and friends to worry about sarah they believe me you dirty shit she walked off into the darkness they must have been waiting for her all the time because she screamed a highpitched ugly scream she cried out for him to help her her second scream was cut short ryan closed the door of the car and locked it he started the engine and switched on the headlights he saw her face in the lights it stuck out above the black mass of antifems in their monklike robes it was only her face her body lay on the ground still clasping her handbag her head was on the end of the pole chapter seventeen ryan lies in his bunk with his logbook and his stylus he has been there for two days now john comes in occasionally but doesnt bother him realising that he does not want to be disturbed he lets ryan get his own food when he wants to and looks after the running of the ship to make sure that ryan rests he has even turned off the console in ryans cabin ryan spends most of his time with the logbook he removed it from the desk originally to make sure that john didnt come across it he reads over the first entry he made when he brought it back to the cabin what i did to sarah can be justified of course in that she could have ruined this project i had to be sure nothing wrecked it the fact that we are all safe and aboard is evidence that i took the right precautions trusting no one outside the group making sure that everything was done with the utmost secrecy we kept contact only with the russian groupabout the last outpost of rational humanity that we knew about would i have done it in that way if she had not turned me down in such an unpleasant manner i dont know considering the state of things at the time i behaved no worse no less humanely than any one else you had to fight fire with fire and if it and certain other things is on my conscience at least it isnt on anyone elses conscience the boys are clean so is josephine so are most of the others he sighs as he reads the entry over he shifts his body in the bunk all right old chap john has come as silently as ever into the cabin he looks a trifle tired himself im fine ryan closes the book quickly fine are you all right im coping very well ill let you know if anything crops up thanks john leaves ryan returns his attention to the log turning the pages until he comes to a fresh one he continues writing there is no doubt about it i have blood on my hands thats probably the reason ive been having bad dreams any normal halfway decent man would i took it on myself to do at least i didnt involve anyone else when we hijacked the albion transport i had hoped there would be no trouble neither would there have been i think if the crew had been all english incredible i always knew the irish were excitable but that stupid fellow who tried to get the gun from me in midair deserved all he got he must have been irish theres no other explanation i was never a racialist but one had to admit that there were certain virtues the english have which other races dont share i suppose that is racialism of a sort but not the unhealthy sort i was horrified when i heard that the foreigners in the camps were being starved to death i would have done something about it if i could but by that time it had gone too far maybe sarah was right maybe i could have stopped it if i hadnt been so selfish i always considered myself to be an enlightened man a liberal man i was known for it he stops again staring at the wall the rot had set in before my day hbombs nuclear radiation chemical poisoning insufficient birth control mismanaged eco nomics misguided political theories and then panic and no room for error throw a spanner in the works of a society as sophisticated and highly tuned as ours was and thats it chaos they tried to bring simple answers to complicated problems they looked for messiahs when they should have been looking at the prob lems humanitys old trouble but this time humanity did for itself absolutely it is odd he thinks that i will never know how it all turned out just as well of course from the point of view of our kids we left just in time they were bombing each other to smithereens another few days he writes and we wouldnt have made it i timed it pretty well all things considered ryan had led the party out to london airport where the big albion transport was preparing to take off on its bombing mission over dublin they were all in military kit for ryan was posing as a general with his staff they had driven straight out on to the runway and were up the steps and into the plane before anyone knew what had happened at gunpoint ryan had told the pilot to take off within quarter of an hour they were heading for russia it had been over the landing strip on the bleak siberian plain that the irishman he must have been an irishman had pan icked how an irishman had managed to remain under cover with out revealing his evident racial characteristics ryan would never know for two hours ryan had sat in the copilots seat with his purdy automatic trained on the pilot while henry and masterson looked after the rest of the crew and john ryan and uncle sidney stayed with the families ryan was tired he felt drained of energy his body ached and the butt of the gun was slippery with the sweat from his hands he felt filthy and his flesh was cold as the albion came down through the clouds he saw the huge spaceship standing on the launching field it was surrounded by webs of gantries like a caged bird of prey like prometheus bound his attention was on the ship when the irish pilot leapt from his seat you damned traitor you disgusting renegade the pilot lunged for the gun screaming at the top of his voice his face writhing with his hatred and his insanity ryan fell back pressing the trigger the purdy muttered and a stream of tiny explosive bullets hit the pilot all over bit chest and face and his bloody body collapsed on top of ryan pilotless the big transport began to shake ryan pushed the body off him and reached up to throw the lever that would put the plane automatically on emergency landing procedure the planes rockets fired and the transport juddered as its trajectory was arrested it began to go down vertically on its rockets ryan wiped the sweat from his lip and then retched he had smeared the pilots blood all over his mouth he cleaned his face with his sleeve watching as the plane neared the ground screaming towards the overgrown airstrip to the north of the launching field john ryan put his head into the cabin my god what happened the pilot just went mad ryan said hoarsely youd better check everyones got their safety belts on john were going to make a heavy landing the albion was close to the ground now its rockets burning the concrete strip ryan buckled his own safety belt five feet above the ground the rockets cut out and the plane bellyflopped on to the concrete shaken ryan got out of his seat and stumbled into the crew section alexander was crying and tracey masterson was screaming and ida henry was moaning but the rest were very quiet john ryan said get the doors open and get everybody out of the plane as soon as possible will you he still held the purdy john ryan nodded and ryan went aft to where masterson and henry were covering the rest of the crew what was all that about james henry said suspiciously you trying to kill us all ryan the pilot lost his head we had to make an emergency rocket powered landing vertical ryan looked over the rest of the crew four boys and a woman of about thirty they all looked scared did you know your captain was irish ryan asked them and you were going to bomb dublin you can bet your life he was going to try and make a landing the crew stared at him incredulously well it was true ryan said but dont worry ive dealt with him the woman said you murdered him is that what you did selfdefence said ryan selfdefence isnt murder all right fred henry you go and help everybody get off this bloody plane the woman said he was no more irish than i am anyway what does it matter no wonder your people are losing ryan answered contemptu ously when everyone was off the ship ryan shot the crew it was the only safe thing to do while they were alive there was a chance that they would seize control of the albion and do something foolish tishchenko was a harriedlooking man of about fifty he gravely shook hands with ryan and then guided him by the elbow across the barren concrete towards the control buildings the wind was cold and moaned beyond the launching site the plain stretched in all directions featureless and greengrey ryans people trudged behind them tishchenko was the man whom ryan had contacted originally the contact had been made through allard who had been one of the people vainly trying to keep the un together in the last days allard an old schoolfriend of ryans had been sent to a patriot camp not long after he had put ryan in touch with tishchenko it is a great pleasure said tishchenko as they entered the building that had been converted to living quarters it was cold and gloomy and something of an achievement that in the midst of all this insane xenophobia a little international group of sane men and women can work together on a project as important as this one he smiled and its good to be able to look at a woman again i can tell you ryan was tired he nodded rubbing his eyes one of the reasons the russian group had been so eager to deal with his group was because of the number of women he could bring with him you are weary tishchenko said come he led them up two flights of stairs and showed them their accommodation camp beds had been lined around the walls of three rooms it is about the best we can provide tishchenko apologised amenities are few every thing had to go to the ship he went to the window and drew back the blankets that covered it there she is they gathered around the window and looked at the spacecraft she towered into the sky she has been ready to fly for two years tishchenko shook his head it has taken two years to provision her the civil war here and then the chinese invasion is what protected us we were all but forgotten about who else is here now ryan asked just russians tishchenko smiled just two russians myself and lipche a couple of americans a chinese two italians three germans a frenchman thats it ryan drew a deep breath he felt odd the shock of the killings he supposed ill be back in a few minutes to take you down to dinner tishchenko told him ryan looked upwhat dinner we all eat together on the floor below oh i see i couldnt said josephine ryan i really couldnt were not used to it you see said james henry our customs well tishchenko looked puzzled and very slightly perturbed well if youd like to arrange to bring the food up here i suppose we can do that then perhaps we can meet after meals you have been in the thick of things of course we have been isolated we havent really experienced yes said ryan it has been very nasty im sorry some of our social sicknesses have rather rubbed off on us give us a day or two to settle well be all right then im sure good said tishchenko ryan watched him leave he sensed a certain antipathy in the russians manner he hoped there would not be trouble with him russians could not always be trusted for one moment he won dered if they had been led into a complicated trap could this team of scientists just be after the women would they dispense with the men now that they had served their purpose ryan pulled himself together an irrational idea he would have to watch himself more carefully he had had no sleep for two nights get some rest now he told himself and youll be your old self in the morning the thirteen english people and the eleven scientists toured the ship it is all completely automatic said schonberg one of the germans he smiled and patted alexander on the head a child could run it the english party rested and more relaxed were in better spirits even james henry who had been the most suspicious of all seemed better and your probes proved conclusively that there are two planets in the system capable of supporting human life he said to boulez the frenchman the french scientist smiled one of them could be earth about the same amount of land and sea very similar ecology there was bound to be a planet like it somewhere we were just lucky to discover one this early buccella one of the italians was taking a strong interest in pointing out certain features of the ship to janet ryan typical italian thought ryan he glanced at his brother john who was listening carefully as shan the chinese tried to explain about the regeneration units shans english was not very good back in their own quarters ryan asked his brother did you notice that italian buccella and janet together what do you mean together john said with a grin ryan shrugged its your problem the preparations continued swiftly news came in of massive nuclear bombardments taking place all over the globe they took to working night and day resting when they could no longer keep their eyes open and at length the ship was ready buccella shan and boulez were going on the ship with the others the rest were staying behind their job was to get the ship off the ground they were taking over the duties of some fifty technicians liftoff day arrived chapter eighteen ryan scratches his nose with the tip of his stylus he writes one could not afford to be sentimental in those days perhaps when we land on the new planet we can relax and indulge all those pleasant human vices it would be nice to feel at peace again the way one did as a child he shifts in his bunk and looks up good god janet youre up janet ryan smiles down at him were all up john thought it wisest i suppose he knows what hes doing its not part of the original plan john wants to see how it works out can i get you anything he grins no thanks love ive got my proditol to keep me cool it seems to be working fine ive been doing some pretty sober thinking since i decided to stay in bed for a bit john says youd got pretty obsessive were following ship routine to the point of your own breakdown i can see i was half crazy now im very well very relaxed youll soon be in control of things again she smiles i certainly will janet leaves the cabin ryan writes janet has just been in to see me apparently brother john feels its best for everybody to be up and about i expect josephine and the boys will be along soon janet looks as beautiful as ever you couldnt really blame that italian chap for going overboard for her a sick joke that i suppose when i caught him with her in johns own cabin i felt sick the man was a complete stinker playing around like that he had to be dealt with his friends had their eyes on the girls too that was plain they were only waiting for a chance to get their hands on them while our backs were turned i was a fool to trust a pack of foreigners i know that now it became evident that his friends were in on the plot with him the way they took his part they threatened the security of the whole mission with their utterly irrational intentions on the girls and the boys too i shouldnt wonder i suppose it was that they hadnt seen any women for so long it went to their heads they couldnt control themselves in a way one can sympathise of course it showed just what a threat to the safety of the ship they were when they tried to steal my gun i had to shoot buccella then and his friends when they wouldnt stop coming at me we pushed the corpses through the airlock everybody agreed i had done the right thing he sighs it has been hard keeping control of everything for so long making unpleasant decisions strange that josephine and the boys havent come in yet john is probably staging the wakeup procedure he closes the log and puts it and the stylus under his pillow he leans back looking forward to seeing his wife and children he dozes he sleeps he dreams q who are you kidding a had a noise trouble he stands in the control room he is sure he has forgotten some thing some crucial operation he checks the computer but it is babbling nonsense puns and facetious remarks flow from it he casts around for the source of the trouble looks for a way to switch off the computer but it will not switch off the life of the ship depends on the computer but it is the ship or ryan as ryan sees it he starts to batter at the computer with a chair youre killing me hahahahaha ha says the computer ryan turns through the porthole he sees the dancers again their faces pressed against the glass youre in league with them he tells the computer youre on their side am oneveryonesside am a scientific instrument am utterly prag matic says the computer youre laughing at me now ryan says almost pathetically youre taking a rise out of me arent you my duty is to look after you all and keep you safe and sound repeat safe and sound you cynical bugger he sees a sweet old lady shaking her head a wry smile on her face language she says language it is his mother her maiden name was hope dempsey he christened the ship after her you tell the computer to stop getting at me ma he begs naughty thing says his mother you leave my little boy alone but the computer continues to mock him you were never a sweet old lady anyway says ryan she turns into the hag who haunts him and he screams josephine stands over him she is holding an empty ampoule of proditol youll feel better in a moment darling she says how are you now better already he says smiling in relief you dont know how pleased i am to see you jo where are the boys theyre not quite awake yet you know it takes a bit of time she sits on the edge of his bunk theyll be here soon you should have woken us up earlier you know its too much of a strain for one man even you i realise that now he says she gives the old slightly nervous slightly tender smile take it easy she says let the proditol do its stuff she catches sight of the red logbook sticking from under his pillow whats that darling my logbook he says a sort of private diary really if its private id rather keep it that way until ive had a look through it when i feel better of course its the only thing that kept me halfway sane he explains of course with one hand supporting his head ryan lies in his bunk and writes alexander and rupert both look fit and well and everybody seems singularly cheerful it seems as if we have all benefited from rest and with breaking ties with earth we feel free again i can hear them bustling about in the ship laughter a general mood of easy co operation what a change from the early days on the ship when even uncle sidney seemed jealous of my command even sullen sus picious old james henry has an almost saintly manner i my morbid thoughts melt like snow in springtime my obsession for janet has disappeared part of the same morbid mood i suppose james henrys new attitude surprises me most if it wasnt for the fact that everybody is in better spirits id suspect that he was once again harbouring plans to get rid of me and run the ship himself it is amaz ing what a change of environment can do john was wise to awaken everybody plainly i had become too worried that the tensions would start up again were going to make a fine colony on new earth and thank god for proditol those scientists certainly covered every angle ive decided to put all morbid thoughts of the past out of my mind i was a different person perhaps a sick person when i did what i did to indulge in selfrecrimination now is stupid and benefits nobody my breakdown was caused by the chaos that crept over society it reflected the breakdown of that society i could almost date its beginning for me when our own air force or at least what had been our own air force dropped napalm and fragmentation bombs on london my psyche i suppose reflected the environment but enough of that ive made up my mind no more morbid self examination no need for it now anyway the days will pass more quickly now that everybody is up and about and so cheerful well be landing on that planet before we realise it he signs the page closes the book and tucks it under his pillow he feels a little weak doubtless the effects of the drug he sleeps and dreams that the ship has landed on the isle of skye and every one is swimming in the sea he watches them all swim out james henry janet ryan josephine ryan rupert ryan sidney ryan fred masterson alexander ryan ida and felicity henry tracy masterson isabel ryan they are laughing and shouting they all swim out into the sea a week passes ryan spends less time writing in his log book and more time sleeping he feels confident that john and the others are running the ship well one night he is awakened by pangs of hunger and he realises that nobody has thought to bring him any food he frowns an image of the foreigners comes into his mind he saw a camp only once but it was enough they were not being gassed or burned or shot they were being systematically starved to death the cheapest way his stomach rumbles he gets up and leaves his cabin he enters the storeroom and takes a meal pack from a bin chewing at the pack he pads back to his cabin he has a slight headache probably the effects of the proditol they have given him a dose every day for the past ten days or so it will be time to finish the doses soon he sleeps chapter nineteen ryan makes an entry in his log i have now been resting for two weeks and the difference is amazing i have lost weight i was too heavy anyway and my brain has cleared i have had insights into my own behaviour amazing what a clever rationaliser i am and my body is relaxed i will soon be ready to resume control of the ship josephine enters she is holding an ampoule of proditol in her hand time for your shot dear she smiles hey what are you trying to do to me he grins at her four teen days is the maximum period for that stuff i dont need it any more her smile fades one more shot cant do you any harm dear can it he swings himself out of the bunk whats up be jokes is there something you dont want me to know about of course not ryan unfolds a suit from the pack in the cupboard he lays it on the bed im going to take a shower he says then ill go into the control room and see how everyones getting along without me youre not well enough yet dear says josephine her pink face anxious please stay in bed a bit longer even if you wont let me give you the proditol im fine ryan frowns he feels a return of his old feelings of suspicion maybe he should have something more to keep him calm yet if he has any more proditol he exceeds the dose and risks his life id like to stay in my bunk all the time he smiles honest i would but the suggested dosage period is over jo ive got to get up sometime he leaves the cabin and takes his shower he comes back in josephine has gone she has laid out a fresh disposable suit on the bed he puts it on he walks along the passage towards the main control room and be remembers that he has left his diary under his pillow there is a chance that someone will give in to the temptation to read it it would be better if no one saw his comments after all some of them were pretty insane some of it is a bit like a prisoner of the inquisi tion confessing to anything that is suggested to him he smiles and returns to his cabin he picks up the logbook and puts it in his locker sealing the locker he still feels weak he sits on the edge of the bunk for a moment for some time now he has been aware of a sound now it impinges on his consciousness a highpitched whine he recog nises the noise an emergency in the control room he gets up and runs out of his cabin down the passage into the main control room the computer is flashing a sign urgent attention required urgent attention required james henry is at the control he turns as ryan enters hello ryan how are you now im fine whats the emergency nothing much im coping with it what is it though a new circuit needed in the heat control unit in the hydroponics section cut out the emergency signal would you ryan automatically does as henry asks him henry makes a few adjustments to the controls then turns to ryan with a smile glad to see youre okay again ive been managing pretty well to your absence thats great ryan feels a touch of anger at henrys slightly patronising tone ryan looks around the control room everything else seems to be as he left it at the time of his breakdown wheres everybody else he asks studying resting checking out various functions standard ship routine you seem to be working together very well ryan says better than before weve got something in common now after all ryan feels a touch of panic he doesnt know why is there something in henrys tone a sort of triumph what do you mean henry shrugs our great mission of course says ryan he sucks his lower lip of course but what did james henry really mean is it that they have got rid of him do they believe that he was the cause of their tension is that what henry is insinuating ryan feels his throat go dry he feels his anger rising he controls himself he isnt thinking clearly he still needs to rest josephine was right well keep up the good work james he says turning to leave if theres anything i can do you could check the hibernation room some time henry says what ryan frowns i said you could check the hydration loom in hydroponics sure now any time you feel like it okay im still a bit shaky ill get back to my bunk i think i think youd better im perfectly all right now sure but you could still do with some rest ryan again controls his temper yes well ill see you later im here whenever you need me captain again the feeling that james henry is mocking him just as he used to before it became intolerable he feels faint no henry is right hes still not properly re covered he staggers back to his cabin he falls into his bunk he sleeps and he dreams he is in the control room again james henry stands there james henry is trying to supersede him james henry has always wished to take over command of the group and of the spaceship but james henry is not stable enough to command if he takes over from ryan the whole safety of the ship becomes at risk ryan knows that there is only one thing to do to stop henrys plotting against him he raises the purdy automatic the same gun that he used on the aircraft he levels it at james henry he takes a deep breath and begins to squeeze the trigger the computer flashes urgent attention required urgent attention required henry turns ryan hides the gun behind his back henry signals to him to have a look at the computer ryan approaches it sus piciously you are in no condition to command this craft repeat you are in no condition to command this craft repeat you are in no condition to com mand this craft take one dose icc pro ditol instantly and repeat dose daily for fourteen days you are in no condition to command this craft you are en dangering the entire expedition if you do not follow these instructions at once repeat at once ryan looks contemptuously at henry youll use anything to try to discredit me wont you henry says calmly you are a sick man ryan the computers right why dont you ryan raises the purdy automatic and fires one bullet into henrys skull the mans head jerks back he opens his mouth to say something ryan fires again james henry falls ryan scowls at the computer the next ones for you if you go on playing games with me chum he turns the cutout switch you are in no condition to command this urgent attention required urgent at tension tension everywhere not any time to think craft repeat you are in no condition to there is d q what is the exact nature of the catas trophe ryan wakes up sweating his suit is torn the bunk is in a mess he climbs off the bunk and stands on the floor shaking the proditol just hasnt been enough but he cant risk taking any more he strips the bunk and disposes of the covers he takes off his clothes and disposes of them a feeling of desperation engulfs him is he really incurable will he never shake the nightmares he was sure he was better and yet suppose they havent been giving him proditol suppose they are deliberately poisoning him no not his friends not his family they couldnt be so cruel and yet hasnt he been cruel hasnt he done as much for expediencys sake he sobs drawing in huge breaths ryan falls on his bunk and weeps he weeps for a long while before he hears his brother johns voice whats the matter old chap he looks up johns face is sympathetic but can he trust him im still getting the nightmares john theyre just as bad worse if anything john spreads his hands helplessly you must try to rest take some sleeping pills try to sleep for gods sake theres nothing to worry about the responsibility was too much for you no one man should have to bear such a burden youre afraid that you might weaken but it is right to weaken sometimes you expect too much of yourself old son yes ryan rubs at his face ive done my best john for all of you of course what of course you have people are never grateful were grateful old chap im a murderer john i murdered for your sake you took too much on it was selfdefence thats what i think but try to rest more tears fall from ryans eyes ill try john the music has started again the drums are beating ryan watches the dancers circle about the control room they are smiling fixed insincere smiles james henry dances with one of them he has two holes in his forehead ryan wakes up the dream is so vivid that ryan can hardly believe he did not shoot james henry obviously he didnt john would have men tioned it he gets out of his bunk and pulls on a new suit of cover alls he leaves the cabin and goes to the control room it is empty silent save for the muted noises of the instruments there is no sign of any sort of struggle ryan smiles at his own stupidity and leaves the control room only when he is back in his bunk does he realise that there should have been someone on watch he frowns things are relaxed but should they be lax he feels he should go and check but he is sleepy he awakes to find the smiling face of his wife josephine bending over him how are you still rough he says you were right i should have stayed in my bunk longer youll be fit and well soon he nods but he is not confident she seems to understand this dont worry she says softly dont worry i suspect everyone jo even you thats not healthy is it dont worry she goes towards the door fred mastersons thinking of drop ping in later do you want to see him old fred sure fred masterson sat on the edge of ryans bunk youre still feeling a bit under the weather i hear fred said still got the old persecution sniff eh ryan nods i once heard someone say that if you had persecu tion feelings it usually meant you were being persecuted he says though not always from the source you suspect thats a bit complicated for me fred laughs you know old fred simpleminded ryan smiles slowly he is pleased to see fred i cracked up once fred continues do you remember that awful business with tracy ryan shakes his head no come on you remember when i thought tracy was having it off with james henry you must remember when wed only been on the ship for a month ryan frowns no i cant remember did you mention it mention it i should think i did you helped me out of that one it was you who suggested that tracy would be better off if she was in hibernation oh yes yes i do remember she was overwrought we all were we decided that in order to ease the tension she should enter her container a bit earlier than scheduled thats right of course off course says masterson ryan looks at him youre notyoure not having a joke with me are you fred why should i do that im still getting a touch of the trouble i had earlier visual hallucinations its nasty i bet it is ryan turns in the bunk im a bit tired now fred ill be off then see you keep smiling see you says ryan when masterson has gone he frowns he really doesnt re member much about tracy and mastersons problems with her it begins to dawn on him that he might not be as disturbed as he thinks if he is in a bad way might not some of the others be in equally poor shape maybe fred masterson has a few delusions of his own to contend with it is a likely explanation he had better be careful and he had better humour fred next time he sees him he begins to worry if they are all in bad shape then that could threaten the smooth running of the ship it is up to him to get well soon keep a careful eye on the others people under stress do odd things after all they get peculiar paranoid notions like james henrys next time he sees john hell suggest reasonably that james henry have another spell of hibernation for his own sake and the sake of the rest of them it could be suggested quite subtly to james chapter twenty ryans dreams continue once again he is in the control room most of his dreams take place in the control room now he stares through the porthole at the void at the dancers with their round black glasses at his friends and family who stand behind the dancers sometimes he sees the old woman when occasionally he wakes and it is not now very often he realises that he must be under heavy sedation he hears the musicthe highpitched musicand it makes his flesh crawl dimly he wonders what is happening to him what his onetime friends his treacherous family are doing to him there is now no question in his mind that he is the victim of some com plicated deception that he has been victim to this deception per haps even before the spaceship took off certainly after it left earth he does not know why they should be working against him how ever particularly since he is the chief engineer of their salvation he is too weak too drugged to do more than speculate about their plans was this why they were all originally put into hibernation he seems to remember something about that now was that why he was so insistent that they should not be awakened until the end of the journey could be but he had to crack up temporarily the ships emergency system awakened john who awakened the others and now they are in control they have him in their power it is even possible that they are not his family and friends at all but could have brainwashed him into thinking they are he remembers that old patriot rally they look like us sound like us in every respect they are human but they are not human god it couldnt be true but what other explanation is there for the strange behaviour of the rest of the personnel on board the hope dempsey ryan moves restlessly on the bunk he has cracked up no doubt about that and the reason too is obvious strain over work too much responsibility but there is no such explanation when he thinks about it for the behaviour of the others the others are mad or they are not human no he murmurs not josephine and the boys id realise it surely not janet warm little janet not uncle sidney and john and fred masterson and the women and james henry half believed the patriots he couldnt be one unless he was so cunning he he rolls on the bunk no he groans no john comes into the cabin whats the matter old son whats bothering you now ryan looks up at him wanting to trust his brother wanting to confide in him but he cant betray me he mutters youve betrayed me john come off it john tries to laugh what would i want to betray you for how could i betray you were on your side remember the old days us against the world the only ones who could see the terrible state the world was in the only ones who had a plan to deal with it remember your apartment the last bastion of rationalism in an insane world but johns tone seems to be mocking ryan cant be sure his brother was always straightforward not like him to take that tone unless this man is not his brother john we were an elite remember john smiles sane scientific approaches to our problems all right what did i say nothing i was only trying to help i bet you were youre not my bloody brother my brother wouldnt couldnt of course im your brother east heath road remember east heath road where we were born there was actually a heath there in those days hampstead heath there used to be a fair there on bank holidays you must remember that but do you ryan looks directly at the man or are you just very good at learning that sort of information eh come on old son leave me alone you bastard leave me alone or ill youll what get out youll what get out after the fair we kidded her q please define specific situation after the pair we kids were q please define specific situation after a pear we did the q please define specific situation after a lair we rid the q please define specific situation after the affair we killed her thank you no no no no no no no no no no no no o no no no nono no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no n no nononono nononono no ryan rises from his bunk he is weak he is trembling he vomits he vomits over the floor of his cabin i need kelp he staggers from the cabin into the main control room it is empty no one on watch the computer is flashing its signal urgent attention required urgent attention required urgent attention required he is suspicious of the computer warily he approaches it the computer says condition of occupants of containers not reported repeat condition of occupants of containers not reported report your own condition repeat report your own condition log not filed sixteen days repeat log not filed sixteen days condition of occupants of ryan is astonished it is plain to him that whoever else is running the ship they are not running it as efficiently as he had been doing he replies to the computer occupants no longer in containers my own condition is poor i have been out of operation for sixteen days will file reports as soon as pos sible please acknowledge he waits for a second the computer replies thank you looking forward to hearing your log entries however you are wrong about occupants of containers they are still in con tainers sorry to hear your own condi tion poor suggest you switch me to fully automatic until your condition improves did you take recom mended dose proditol repeat did you take recommended dose proditol ryan is staring incredulously at the second part of the message automatically he replies yes i took recommended dose proditol and before the computer replies he leaves the main control room and runs through the dark corridors of the ship until he comes to the hibernation room he touches the stud and nothing happens the emergency locks must again be operating someone has switched them on john or someone pretending to be john he runs back to the main control room and switches off the emergency locks runs back down the corridors to the hibernation room he opens the door and dashes in there they are as they were when he last saw them sleeping in the peace of the hibernation fluid has he imagined no someone locked the hibernation room before someone locked it again there is at least one other person aboard probably the person posing as john he knew there was something odd about him an alien aboard it is the only explanation he realises that he does not remember seeing any of the people together doubtless the creature can change shape he shudders he couldnt have imagined the creature because the proditol cleared his delusions at least for a while he stares round the hibernation room and he sees the purdy pistol hanging on the wall it is odd that it should be here but providential he goes to the wall and removes the pistol it is low on ammunition but there is some he leaves the hibernation room and returns to main control hastily he reports on the occupants of the containers then he goes to look for the alien just as he has on his routine inspections he paces the ship gun in hand he checks every cabin every cabinet every room he finds no one he sits down at the desk below the blank tv screen in the main control room and he frowns he realises that he has no idea of the characteristics the alien may possess he could live outside the ship in some ship of his own attached like a barnacle perhaps covering the airlock of the hope dempsey the big tv screen above his head is used for scanning the hull now he puts it into operation it scans every inch of the hull nothing ryan realises he has eaten virtually nothing for two weeks that explains his weakness the creature he remembers now never brought him food he only brought him drugs and tried in the shape of his wife josephine to administer more perhaps it was not proditol at all ryan clutches the back of his neck massaging it he holds the gun firmly in his other hand there is a polite cough from behind him he wheels fred masterson stands there or a creature that has assumed the shape of fred masterson ryan covers it with his gun but he does not shoot at once ryan says fred masterson youre the only one i can trust its tracy ryan hears himself saying what about tracy ive killed her i didnt mean to we were having an argument and i must have stabbed her shes dead she was having an affair with james henry what do you intend to do fred ive already done it but i need your help as commander i cant hide it from you i put her in her container you could say you suggested it you could tell everybody she needed rest so you sug gested she hibernate a little earlier than scheduled ryan screams at him youre lying youre lying what do you know about that please help me says masterson please ryan fires the pistol careful not to waste ammunition masterson falls ryan smiles his headache blinds him for a moment he rubs his eyes he goes to see if masterson is dead masterson has vanished the alien cannot be killed again ryan feels sick he feels defeated he feels impotent his headache is worse he looks up the dancers are there the group is there the old woman is there ryan screams and runs out of the control room down the passage into his cabin he seals the cabin door he collapses on his bunk chapter twentyone sitting in the sealed cabin ryan tries to think things out there is no alien aboard i am merely hallucinating that is the most obvious explanation but it does not explain everything it does not explain why the door to the hibernation room was locked it does not explain why the proditol did not work he blinks of course i had no proditol i merely deceived myself into believing i had had it that was why i invented johns sudden awakening and i suppose i could have switched on the emergency locks without realising it the strain was too much for me some mechanism in my own brain tried to stop me working so hard it invented the help so that i could relax for a couple of weeks not worry about running the ship ryan grins with relief the explanation fits and thus i felt guilty about the personnel in the containers because i had abandoned them my talk of their betrayal of me was really my belief that i had betrayed them ryan looks down at the gun still clutched in his hand he shudders and throws it to the floor uncle sidney stands near the door youre doing fine arent you he says go away uncle sidney you are an illusion you are all illusions your place is in your container ill wake you up when we reach the new planet ryan leans back in his bunk go on off you go youre a fool uncle sidney says youve been deceiving yourself all along well before you got into this predicament you were as paranoid as anyone else on earth you were just better at rationalising your paranoia thats all you dont deserve to have escaped none of us deserves it youre clever but youre all alone now its better than having you lot around all the time ryan grins go on get out its true says josephine ryan uncle sidneys right we were humouring you towards the end you know it didnt seem to make much difference to me and the boys whether we went up in an hbomb attack or up in a spaceship in a way i think id have pre ferred the hbomb i wouldnt have had to listen to your self righteous pronouncements day in and day out until you until i what until go on say it ryan laughs in her face go on jo say it until i went into hibernation bloody shrinking violet ryan sneers at her if id have had a stronger woman you needed one she says ill admit that shut up you got rid of the strong one didnt you says fred masterson did her in eh shut up just like you did james henry in says janet ryan after you helped fred cover up tracys death shot him in the control room with that gun didnt you shut up you got worse and worse says john ryan we tried to help you we put you under sedation we humoured you but you had to do it didnt you do what tell me put me in hibernation says john ryan ryan laughs you too ida and felicity henry laugh harshly idas hands are folded over her swollen abdomen you lost all your friends didnt you ryan says felicity you sold yourself the alien story didnt you in the end after being so scornful about it you swallowed it when you could least afford to shut up youll go too youve got us all in hibernation says james henry but we can still talk to you well be able to talk to you again when we wake up ryan laughs what are you laughing about dad says alexander ryan let us in on it dad go on says rupert ryan ryan stops laughing he clears his throat out you go boys he says you dont want to be involved in this but we are involved says alex its not our fault our dads a silly old fart she turned you against me says ryan anyone can see youre a silly old fart dad rupert says reasonably i did my best for you ryan says i gave you everything everything says josephine she sniffs things will be different on the new planet ill have time for you and the boys he tone is placatory i had so much work to do so many plans to make i had to be so careful and you were isabel ryan winks at him werent you youd better shut up isobel i warned you before to keep your mouth shut about that he glances at janet janet bursts out laughing i slept with you because i was shit scared of you she says shut up i was afraid youd do it to me too do what he dares her what she looks at the floor put me in hibernation she murmurs ryan sneers at them all not one with guts is there you all wanted to get rid of me you all thought you could plan behind my back but you forgot he taps his head ive got brains im rational i worked it out scientifically pragmatically i used a system didnt i and i beat you all you didnt get me says tracy masterson ryan screams chapter twentytwo ryan is better now the hallucinations have passed some dreams still disturb him but not seriously he paces the spaceship he paces down the central passageway to the main control cabin and there he checks the coordinates the consumption indicators the regeneration indicators and he checks all his figures at length with those of the ships computer everything is perfectly in order exactly as it should be near the ships big central screen is a desk although activated the screen shows no picture but it casts a greenish light on to the desk ryan sits down and depresses a stud on the small console on his desk in a clear level voice he makes his standard log entry day number one thousand four hundred and ninety spaceship hope dempsey en route for munich speed holds steady at point nine of c all systems functioning according to original expectations no other variations we are all comfortable signing off ryan commander ryan now slides open a drawer and takes from it a large red book it is a new book with only one page filled in he enters the date and underlines it in red he writes another day without much to report i am a little depressed but i felt worse yesterday and i think my spirits are improving i am rather lonely and sometimes wish i could wake someone else up so that we could talk a little together but that would be unwise i persevere i keep myself mentally active and physically fit its my duty all the horror and humiliation and wretchedness of earth is far behind us we shall be starting a new race soon and the world well build will be a cleaner world a sane world a world built according to knowledge and sanity not fear and guilt ryan finished his entry and neatly puts his book away the computer is flashing at him he goes over to it and reads report on personnel in containers not supplied a stupid oversight ryan punches in the reports josephine ryan condition steady rupert ryan condition steady alexander ryan condition steady sidney ryan condition steady john ryan condition steady isabel ryan condition steady janet ryan condition steady fred masterson condition steady he hesitates for a moment then he continues tracy masterson condition steady james henry condition steady ida henry condition steady felicity henry condition steady your own condition suggests the computer ryan shrugs condition steady he reports ryan sleeps he is in the ballroom it is dusk and long windows look out on to a darkening lawn formally dressed couples slowly rotate in perfect time to the music which is low and sombre all the couples have round very black glasses hiding their eyes their pale faces are almost invisible in the dim light ryan awakes he smiles wondering what the dream can mean he gets up and stretches for some reason he remembers old owen powell the man he had to dismiss the man who killed him self that gave him a bad turn at the time still he dismisses the thought no point in dwelling on the past when the futures so much more important he switches on the agriculture programme might just as well do a bit of homework until he can get back to sleep he falls asleep in front of the screen the spacecraft moves through the silence of the cosmos it moves so slowly as to seem not to move at all it is a lonely little object space is infinite it is dark space is neutral it is cold the end
