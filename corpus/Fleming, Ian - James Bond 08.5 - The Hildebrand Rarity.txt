the hildebrand rarity the stingray was about six feet from wingtip to wingtip and perhaps ten feet long from the blunt wedge of its nose to the end of its deadly tail it was dark grey with that violet tinge that is so often a danger signal in the underwater world when it rose up from the pale golden sand and swam a little distance it was as if a black towel was being waved through the water james bond his hands along his flanks and swimming with only a soft trudge of his fins followed the black shadow across the wide palmfringed lagoon waiting for a shot he rarely killed fish except to eat but there were exceptions big moray eels and all the members of the scorpionfish family now he proposed to kill the stingray because it looked so extraordinarily evil it was ten oclock in the morning of a day in april and the lagoon belle anse near the southernmost tip of mahe the largest island in the seychelles group was glassy calm the northwest monsoon had blown itself out months before and it would be may before the southeast monsoon brought refreshment now the temperature was eighty in the shade and the humidity ninety and in the enclosed waters of the lagoon the water was near blood heat even the fish seemed to be sluggish a tenpound green parrotfish nibbling algae from a lump of coral paused only to roll its eyes as bond passed overhead and then went back to its meal a school of fat grey chub swimming busily broke courteously in half to let bonds shadow by and then joined up and continued on their opposite course a chorus line of six small squids normally as shy as birds did not even bother to change their camouflage at his passage bond trudged lazily on keeping the stingray just in sight soon it would get tired or else be reassured when bond the big fish on the surface did not attack then it would settle on to a patch of flat sand change its camouflage down to the palest almost translucent grey and with soft undulations of its wingtips bury itself in the sand the reef was coming nearer and now there were outcrops of coral niggerheads and meadows of seagrass it was like arriving in a town from open country everywhere the jewelled reef fish twinkled and glowed and the giant anemones of the indian ocean burned like flames in the shadows colonies of spined seaeggs made sepia splashes as if someone had thrown ink against the rock and the brilliant blue and yellow feelers of langoustes quested and waved from their crevices like small dragons now and then among the seaweed on the brilliant floor there was the speckled glitter of a cowrie bigger than a golf ball the leopard cowrie and once bond saw the beautiful splayed fingers of a venuss harp but all these things were now commonplace to him and he drove steadily on interested in the reef only as cover through which he could get to seaward of the ray and then pursue it back towards the shore the tactic worked and soon the black shadow with its pursuing brown torpedo were moving back across the great blue mirror in about twelve feet of water the ray stopped for the hundredth time bond stopped also treading water softly cautiously he lifted his head and emptied water out of his goggles by the time he looked again the ray had disappeared bond had a champion harpoongun with double rubbers the harpoon was tipped with a needlesharp trident a shortrange weapon but the best for reef work bond pushed up the safe and moved slowly forward his fins pulsing softly just below the surface so as to make no sound he looked around him trying to pierce the misty horizons of the great hail of the lagoon he was looking for any big lurking shape it would not do to have a shark or a large barracuda as witness of the kill fish sometimes scream when they are hurt and even when they do not the turbulence and blood caused by a sharp struggle bring the scavengers but there was not a living thing in sight and the sand stretched away into the smoky wings like the bare boards of a stage now bond could see the faint outline on the bottom he swam directly over it and lay motionless on the surface looking down there was a tiny movement in the sand two minute fountains of sand were dancing above the nostrillike holes of the spiracles behind the holes was the slight swelling of the things body that was the target an inch behind the holes bond estimated the possible upward lash of the tail and slowly reached his gun down and pulled the trigger below him the sand erupted and for an anxious moment bond could see nothing then the harpoon line came taut and the ray showed pulling away from him while its tail in reflex aggression lashed again and again over the body at the base of the tail bond could see the jagged poisonspines standing up from the trunk these were the spines that were supposed to have killed ulysses that pliny said would destroy a tree in the indian ocean where the sea poisons are at their most virulent one scratch from the rays sting would mean certain death cautiously keeping the ray on a taut line bond trudged after the furiously wrestling fish he swam to one side to keep the line away from the lashing tail which could easily sever it this tail was the old slavedrivers whip of the indian ocean today it is illegal even to possess one in the seychelles but they are handed down in the families for use on faithless wives and if the word goes round that this or that woman a eu la crapule the provenзal name for the sting ray it is as good as saying that that woman will not be about again for at least a week now the lashes of the tall were getting weaker and bond swam round and ahead of the ray pulling it after him towards the shore in the shallows the ray went limp and bond pulled it out of the water and well up on the beach but he still kept away from it it was as well he did so suddenly at some move from bond and perhaps in the hope of catching its enemy unawares the giant ray leapt clean into the air bond sprang aside and the ray fell on its back and lay with its white underbelly to the sun and the great ugly sickle of the mouth sucking and panting bond stood and looked at the stingray and wondered what to do next a short fat white man in khaki shirt and trousers came out from under the palm trees and walked towards bond through the scattering of seagrape and sundried wrack above highwater mark when he was near enough he called out in a laughing voice the old man and the sea who caught who bond turned it would be the only man on the island who doesnt carry a machete fidele be a good chap and call one of your men this animal wont die and hes got my spear stuck in him fidele barbey the youngest of the innumerable barbeys who own nearly everything in the seychelles came up and stood looking down at the ray thats a good one lucky you hit the right spot or hed have towed you over the reef and youd have had to let go your gun they take the hell of a time to die but come on ive got to get you back to victoria somethings come up something good ill send one of my men for the gun do you want the tail bond smiled i havent got a wife but what about some raie au beurre noir tonight not tonight my friend come where are your clothes on their way down the coast road in the station wagon fidele said ever hear of an american called milton krest well apparently he owns the krest hotels and a thing called the krest foundation one thing i can tell you for sure he owns the finest damned yacht in the indian ocean put in yesterday the wawekrest nearly two hundred tons hundred feet long everything in her from a beautiful wife down to a big transistor gramophone on gimbals so the waves wont jerk the needle walltowall carpeting an inch deep airconditioned throughout the only dry cigarettes this side of the african continent and the best afterbreakfast bottle of champagne since the last time i saw paris fidele barbey laughed delightedly my friend that is one hell of a bloody fine ship and if mr krest is a grand slam redoubled in bastards who the hell cares who cares anyway whats it got to do with you or me for the matter of that just this my friend we are going to spend a few days sailing with mr krest and mrs krest the beautiful mrs krest i have agreed to take the ship to chagrin the island i have spoken to you about it is bloody miles from here off the african banks and my family have never found any use for it except for collecting boobies eggs its only about three feet above sealevel i havent been to the damned place for five years any way this man krest wants to go there he s collecting marine specimens something to do with his foundation and theres some blasted little fish thats supposed to exist only around chagrin island at least krest says the only specimen in the world came from there sounds rather fun where do i come in i knew you were bored and that youd got a week before you sail so i said that you were the local under water ace and that youd soon find the fish if it was there and anyway that i wouldnt go without you mr krest was willing and thats that i knew youd be fooling around somewhere down the coast so i just drove along until one of the fishermen told me there was a crazy white man trying to commit suicide alone at belle anse and i knew that would be you bond laughed extraordinary the way these island people are afraid of the sea youd think theyd have got on terms with it by now damned few of the seychellois can even swim roman catholic church doesnt like them taking their clothes off bloody nonsense but there it is and as for being afraid dont forget youve only been here for a month shark barracuda you just havent met a hungry one and stonefish ever seen a man thats stepped on a stonefish his body bends backwards like a bow with the pain sometimes its so frightful his eyes literally fall out of their sockets they very seldom live bond said unsympathetically they ought to wear shoes or bind their feet up when they go on the reef theyve got these fish in the pacific and the giant clam into the bargain its damned silly everybody moans about how poor they are here although the seas absolutely paved with fish and there are fifty varieties of cowrie under those rocks they could make another good living selling those round the world fidele barbey laughed boisterously bond for governor thats the ticket next meeting of legco ill put the idea up youre just the man for the job farsighted full of ideas plenty of drive cowries thats splendid theyll balance the budget for the first time since the patchouli boom after the war we sell seashells from the seychelles thatll be our slogan ill see you get the credit youll be sir james in no time make more money that way than trying to grow vanilla at a loss they continued to wrangle with lighthearted violence until the palm groves gave way to the giant sangdragon trees on the outskirts of the ramshackle capital of mahe it had been nearly a month before when m had told bond he was sending him to the seychelles admiralty are having trouble with their new fleet base in the maldives communists creeping in from ceylon strikes sabotage the usual picture may have to cut their losses and fall back on the seychelles a thousand miles farther south but at least they look pretty secure but they dont want to be caught again colonial office say its safe as houses all the same ive agreed to send someone to give an independent view when makarios was locked up there a few years ago there were quite a few security scares japanese fishingboats hanging about one or two refugee crooks from england strong ties with france just go and have a good look m glanced out of the window at the driving march sleet dont get sunstroke bonds report which concluded that the only conceivable security hazard in the seychelles lay in the beauty and ready availability of the seychelloises had been finished a week before and then he had nothing to do but wait for the ss kampala to take him to mombasa he was thoroughly sick of the heat and the drooping palm trees and the plaintive cry of the terns and the interminable conversations about copra the prospect of a change delighted him bond was spending his last week in the barbey house and after calling there to pick up their bags they drove out to the end of long pier and left the car in the customs shed the gleaming white yacht lay half a mile out in the roadstead they took a pirogue with an outboard motor across the glassy bay and through the opening in the reef the wawekrest was not beautiful the breadth of beam and cluttered superstructure stunted her lines but bond could see at once that she was a real ship built to cruise the world and not just the florida keys she seemed deserted but as they came alongside two smartlooking sailors in white shorts and singlets appeared and stood by the ladder with boathooks ready to fend the shabby pirogue off the yachts gleaming paint they took the two bags and one of them slid back an aluminium hatch and gestured for them to go down a breath of what seemed to bond to be almost freezing air struck him as he went through and down a few steps into the lounge the lounge was empty it was not a cabin it was a room of solid richness and comfort with nothing to associate it with the interior of a ship the windows behind the halfclosed venetian blinds were full size as were the deep armchairs round the low central table the carpet was the deepest pile in pale blue the walls were panelled in a silvery wood and the ceiling was offwhite there was a desk with the usual writingmaterials and a telephone next to the big gramophone was a sideboard laden with drinks above the sideboard was what looked like an extremely good renoir the head and shoulders of a pretty darkhaired girl in a black and white striped blouse the impression of a luxurious livingroom in a town house was completed by a large bowl of white and blue hyacinths on the central table and by the tidy range of magazines to one side of the desk what did i tell you james bond shook his head admiringly this is certainly the way to treat the sea as if it damned well didnt exist he breathed in deeply what a relief to get a mouthful of fresh air id almost forgotten what it tastes like its the stuff outside thats fresh feller this is canned mr milton krest had come quietly into the room and was standing looking at them he was a tough leathery man in his early fifties he looked hard and fit and the faded blue jeans militarycut shirt and wide leather belt suggested that he made a fetish of doing so looking tough the pale brown eyes in the weatherbeaten face were slightly hooded and their gaze was sleepy and contemptuous the mouth had a downward twist that might be humorous or disdainful probably the latter and the words he had tossed into the room innocuous in themselves except for the patronizing feller had been tossed like small coin to a couple of coolies to bond the oddest thing about mr krest was his voice it was a soft most attractive lisping through the teeth it was exactly the voice of the late humphrey bogart bond ran his eyes down the man from the sparse closecropped black and grey hair like iron filings sprinkled over the bullet head to the tattooed eagle above a fouled anchor on the right forearm and then down to the naked leathery feet that stood nautically square on the carpet he thought this man likes to be thought a hemingway hero im not going to get on with him mr krest came across the carpet and held out his hand you bond glad to have you aboard sir bond was expecting the bonecrushing grip and parried it with stiffened muscles freediving or aqualung free and i dont go deep its only a hobby whadya do the rest of the time civil servant mr krest gave a short barking laugh civility and servitude you english make the best goddam butlers and valets in the world civil servant you say i reckon were likely to get along fine civil servants are just what i like to have around me the click of the deck hatch sliding back saved bonds temper mr krest was swept from his mind as a naked sunburned girl came down the steps into the saloon no she wasnt quite naked after all but the pale brown satin scraps of bikini were designed to make one think she was lo treasure where have you been hiding long time no see meet mr barbey and mr bond the fellers who are coming along mr krest raised a hand in the direction of the girl fellers this is mrs krest the fifth mrs krest and just in case anybody should get any ideas she loves mr krest dont you treasure oh dont be silly milt you know i do mrs krest smiled prettily how do you do mr barbey and mr bond its nice to have you with us what about a drink now just a minute treas suppose you let me fix things aboard my own ship hein mr krests voice was soft and pleasant the woman blushed oh yes milt of course okay then just so we know whos skipper aboard the good ship wawekrest the amused smile embraced them all now then mr barbey whats your first name by the way fidele eh thats quite a name old faithful mr krest chuckled bonhomously well now fido hows about you and me go upon the bridge and get this little old skiff moving hein mebbe you better take her out into the open sea and then you can set a course and hand over to fritz im the captain hes the mate and there are two for the engineroom and pantry all three germans only darned sailors left in europe and mr bond first name james eh well jim what say you practise a bit of that civility and servitude on mrs krest call her liz by the way help her fix the canapйs and so on for drinks before lunch she was once a limey too you can swap yarns about piccadilly circus and the dooks you both know okay move fido he sprang boyishly up the steps lets get the hell outa here when the hatch closed bond let out a deep breath mrs krest said apologetically please dont mind his jokes its just his sense of humour and hes a bit contrary he likes to see if he can rile people its very naughty of him but its really all in fun bond smiled reassuringly how often did she have to make this speech to people try and calm the tempers of the people mr krest had practised his sense of humour on he said i expect your husband needs a bit of knowing does he go on the same way back in america she said without bitterness only with me he loves americans its when hes abroad you see his father was a german a prussian really hes got that silly german thing of thinking europeans and so on are decadent that they arent any good any more its no use arguing with him its just a thing hes got so that was it the old hun again always at your feet or at your throat sense of humour indeed and what must this woman have to put up with this beautiful girl he had got hold of to be his slave his english slave bond said how long have you been married two years i was working as a receptionist in one of his hotels he owns the krest group you know it was wonderful like a fairy story i still have to pinch my self sometimes to make sure im not dreaming this for instance she waved a hand at the luxurious room and hes terribly good to me always giving me presents hes a very important man in america you know its fun being treated like royalty wherever you go it must be he likes that sort of thing i suppose oh yes there was resignation in the laugh theres a lot of the sultan in him he gets quite impatient if he doesnt get proper service he says that when ones worked very hard to get to the top of the tree one has a right to the best fruit that grows there mrs krest found she was talking too freely she said quickly but really what am i saying anyone would think we had known each other for years she smiled shyly i suppose its meeting someone from england but i really must go and get some more clothes on i was sunbathing on deck there came a deep rumble from belowdeck amidships there were off why dont you watch us leave harbour from the afterdeck and ill come and join you in a minute theres so much i want to hear about london this way she moved past him and slid open a door as a matter of fact if youre sensible youll stake a claim to this for the nights there are plenty of cushions and the cabins are apt to get a bit stuffy in spite of the airconditioning bond thanked her and walked out and shut the door behind him it was a big welldeck with hemp flooring and a creamcoloured semicircular foam rubber settee in the stern rattan chairs were scattered about and there was a servingbar in one corner it crossed bonds mind that mr krest might be a heavy drinker was it his imagination or was mrs krest terrified of him there was something painfully slavish in her attitude towards him no doubt she had to pay heavily for her fairy story bond watched the green flanks of mahe slowly slip away astern he guessed that their speed was about ten knots they would soon be at north point and heading for the open sea bond listened to the glutinous bubble of the exhaust and idly thought about the beautiful mrs elizabeth krest she could have been a model probably had been before she became a hotel receptionist that respectable female calling that yet has a whiff of the high demimonde about it and she still moved her beautiful body with the unselfconsciousness of someone who is used to going about with nothing or practically nothing on but there was none of the chill of the model about her it was a warm body and a friendly confiding face she might be thirty certainly not more and her prettiness for it was not more than that was still immature her best feature was the ashblonde hair that hung heavily to the base of her neck but she seemed pleasantly lacking in vanity about it she didnt toss it about or fiddle with it and it occurred to bond that she didnt in fact show any signs of coquetry she had stood quietly almost docilely with her large dear blue eyes fixed almost the whole time on her husband there was no lipstick on her mouth and no lacquer on her fingernails or toenails and her eyebrows were natural did mr krest perhaps order that it should be so that she should be a germanic child of nature probably bond shrugged his shoulders they were certainly a curiously assorted couple the middleaged hemingway with the bogart voice and the pretty artless girl and there was tension in the air in the way she had cringed as he brought her to heel when she had offered them drinks in the forced maleness of the man bond toyed idly with the notion that the man was impotent and that all the tough rude act was nothing more than exaggerated virilityplay it certainly wasnt going to be easy to live with for four or five days bond watched the beautiful silhouette island slip away to starboard and made a vow not to lose his temper what was that american expression eating crow it would be an interesting mental exercise for him he would eat crow for five days and not let this damnable man interfere with what should be a good trip well feller taking it easy mr krest was standing on the boatdeck looking down into the well what have you done with that woman i live with left her to do all the work i guess well and why not thats what theyre for aint it care to look over the ship fidos doin a spell at the wheel and ive got time on my hands without waiting for an answer mr krest bent and lowered himself down into the welldeck dropping the last four feet mrs krests putting on some clothes yes id like to see over the ship mr krest fixed bond with his hard disdainful stare kay well now facts first its built by the bronson shipbuilding corporation i happen to own ninety per cent of the stock so i got what i wanted designed by rosenblatts the top naval architects hundred feet long twentyone broad and draws six two fivehundredhorsepower superior diesels top speed fourteen knots cruises two thousand five hundred miles at eight airconditioned throughout carrier corporation designed two special fiveton units carries enough frozen food and liquor for a month all we need is fresh water for the baths and showers right now lets go up front and you can see the crews quarters and well work back and one thing jim mr krest stamped on the deck this is the floor see and the heads the can and if i want someone to stop doing whatever theyre doing i dont shout belay i shout hold it get me jim bond nodded amiably ive got no objection shes your ship its my ship corrected mr krest thats another bit of damned nonsense making a hunk of steel and wood a female anyway lets go you dont need to mind your head everythings a sixfoottwo clearance bond followed mr krest down the narrow passage that ran the length of the ship and for half an hour made appropriate comments on what was certainly the finest and most luxuriously designed yacht he had ever seen in every detail the margin was for extra comfort even the crews bath and shower was full size and the stainless steel galley or kitchen as mr krest called it was as big as the krest stateroom mr krest opened the door of the latter without knocking liz krest was at the dressingtable why treasure said mr krest in his soft voice i reckoned youd be out there fixing the drink tray youve sure been one heck of a time dressing up puttin on a little extra ritz for jim eh im sorry milt i was just coming a zip got stuck the girl hurriedly picked up a compact and made for the door she gave them both a nervous halfsmile and went out vermont birch panelling corning glass lamps mexican tuft rugs that sailingship pictures a genuine montague dawson by the way mr krests catalogue ran smoothly on but bond was looking at some thing that hung down almost out of sight by the bedside table on what was obviously mr krests side of the huge double bed it was a thin whip about three feet long with a leatherthonged handle it was the tail of a stingray casually bond walked over to the side of the bed and picked it up he ran a finger down its spiny gristle it hurt his finger even to do that he said where did you pick that up i was hunting one of these animals this morning bahrein the arabs use them on their wives mr krest chuckled easily havent had to use more than one stroke at a time on liz so far wonderful results we call it my corrector bond put the thing back he looked hard at mr krest and said is that so in the seychelles where the creoles are pretty tough its illegal even to own one of those let alone use it mr krest moved towards the door he said indifferently feller this ship happens to be united states territory lets go get ourselves something to drink mr krest drank three double bullshots vodka in iced consommй before luncheon and beer with the meal the pale eyes darkened a little and acquired a watery glitter but the sibilant voice remained soft and unemphatic as with a complete monopoly of the conversation he explained the object of the voyage ya see fellers its like this in the states we have this foundation system for the lucky guys that got plenty dough and dont happen to want to pay it into uncle sams treasury you make a foundation like this one the krest foundation for charitable purposes charitable to anyone to kids sick folk the cause of science you just give the money away to anyone or anything except yourself or your dependants and you escape tax on it so i put a matter of ten million dollars into the krest foundation and since i happen to like yachting and seeing the world i built this yacht with two million of the money and told the smithsonian thats our big natural history institution that i would go to any part of the world and collect specimens for them so that makes me a scientific expedition see for three months of every year i have a fine holiday that costs me just sweet fatty arbuckle mr krest looked to his guests for applause get me fidele barbey shook his head doubtfully that sounds fine mr krest but these rare specimens they are easy to find the smithsonian it wants a giant panda a seashell you can get hold of these things where they have failed mr krest slowly shook his head he said sorrowfully feller you sure were born yesterday money thats all it takes you want a panda you buy it from some goddam zoo that cant afford central heating for its reptile house or wants to build a new block for its tigers or something the seashell you find a man thats got one and you offer him so much goddam money that even if he cries for a week he sells it to you sometimes you have a little trouble with governments some goddam animal is protected or something all right give you an example i arrive at your island yesterday i want a black parrot from praslin island i want a giant tortoise from aldabra i want the complete range of your local cowries and i want this fish were after the first two are protected by law last evening i pay a call on your governor after making certain inquiries in the town excellency i says i understand you want to build a public swimmingpool to teach the local kids to swim okay the krest foundation will put up money how much five thousand ten thousand okay so its ten thousand heres my cheque and i write it out there and then just one little thing excellency i says holding on to the cheque it happens i want a specimen of this black parrot you have here and one of these aldabra tortoises i understand theyre protected by law mind if i take one of each back to america for the smithsonian well there s a bit of a palaver but seeing its the smithsonian and seeing ive still got hold of the cheque in the end we shake hands on the deal and everyones happy right well on the way back i stop in the town to arrange with your nice mr abendana the merchant feller to have the parrot and tortoise collected and held for me and i get talking about the cowries well it so happens that this mr abendana has been collecting the dam things since he was a child he shows them to me beautifully kept each one in its bit of cotton wool fine condition and several of those isabella and mappa ones i was asked particularly to watch out for sorry he couldnt think of selling they meant so much to him and so on crap i just look at mr abendana and i say how much no no he couldnt think of it crap again i take out my chequebook and write a cheque for five thousand dollars and push it under his nose he looks at it five thousand dollars he cant stand it he folds the cheque and puts it in his pocket and then the dam sissy breaks down and weeps would you believe it mr krest opened his palms in disbelief over a few goddam seashells so i just tell him to take it easy and i pick up the trays of seashells and get the hell out of there before the crazy soandso shoots himself from remorse mr krest sat back well pleased with himself well whatd you say to that fellers twentyfour hours in the island and ive already knocked off threequarters of my list pretty smart eh jim bond said youll probably get a medal when you get home what about this fish mr krest got up from the table and rummaged in a drawer of his desk he brought back a typewritten sheet here you are he read out hildebrand rarity caught by professor hildebrand of the university of the witwatersrand in a net off chagrin island in the seychelles group april mr krest looked up and then theres a lot of scientific crap i got them to put it into plain english and heres the translation he turned back to the paper this appears to be a unique member of the squirrelfish family the only specimen known named the hildebrand rarity after its discoverer is six inches long the colour is a bright pink with black transverse stripes the anal ventral and dorsal fins are pink the tail fin is black eyes large and dark blue if found care should be taken in handling this fish because all fins are even more sharply spiked than is usual with the rest of this family professor hildebrand records that he found the specimen in three feet of water on the edge of the southwestern reef mr krest threw the paper down on the table well there you are fellers were travelling about a thousand miles at a cost of several thousand dollars to try and find a goddam sixinch fish and two years ago the revenue people had the gall to suggest that my foundation was a phoney liz krest broke in eagerly but thats just it milt isnt it its really rather important to bring back plenty of specimens and things this time werent those horrible tax people talking about disallowing the yacht and the expenses and so on for the last five years if we didnt show an outstanding scientific achievement wasnt that the way they put it treasure mr krests voice was soft as velvet just supposin you keep that flippin trap shut about my personal affairs yes the voice was amiable nonchalant you know what you just done treas you just earned yourself a little meeting with the corrector this evening thats what youve gone and done the girls hand flew to her mouth her eyes were wide she said in a whisper oh no milt oh no please on the second day out at dawn they came up with chagrin island it was first picked up by the radar a small bump in the dead level line on the scanner and then a minute blur on the great curved horizon grew with infinite slowness into half a mile of green fringed with white it was extraordinary to come upon land after two days in which the yacht had seemed to be the only moving the only living thing in an empty world bond had never seen or even clearly imagined the doldrums before now he realized what a terrible hazard they must have been in the days of sail the sea of glass under a brazen sun the foul heavy air the trail of small clouds along the rim of the world that never came closer never brought wind or blessed rain how must centuries of mariners have blessed this tiny dot in the indian ocean as they bent to the oars that moved the heavy ship perhaps a mile a day bond stood in the bows and watched the flyingfish squirt from beneath the hull as the blueblack of the sea slowly mottled into the brown and white and green of deep shoal how wonderful that he would soon be walking and swimming again instead of just sitting and lying down how wonderful to have a few hours solitude a few hours away from mr milton krest they anchored outside the reef in ten fathoms and fidele barbey took them through the opening in the speedboat in every detail chagrin was the prototype coral island it was about twenty acres of sand and dead coral and low scrub surrounded after fifty yards of shallow lagoon by a necklace of reef on which the quiet long swell broke with a soft hiss clouds of birds rose when they landed terns boobies menofwar frigates but quickly settled again there was a strong ammoniac smell of guano and the scrub was white with it the only other living things were the land crabs that scuttled and scraped among the liane sans fin and the fiddlercrabs that lived in the sand the glare from the white sand was dazzling and there was no shade mr krest ordered a tent to be erected and sat in it smoking a cigar while gear of various kinds was ferried ashore mrs krest swam and picked up sea shells while bond and fidele barbey put on masks and swimming in opposite directions began systematically to comb the reef all the way round the island when you are looking for one particular species underwater shell or fish or seaweed or coral formation you have to keep your brain and your eyes focused for that one individual pattern the riot of colour and movement and the endless variety of light and shadow fight your concentration all the time bond trudged slowly along through the wonderland with only one picture in his mind a sixinch pink fish with black stripes and big eyes the second such fish man had ever seen if you see it mr krest had enjoined just you let out a yell and stay with it ill do the rest i got a little something in the tent thats just the dandiest thing for catching fish you ever saw bond paused to rest his eyes the water was so buoyant that he could lie face downwards on the surface without moving idly he broke up a seaegg with the tip of his spear and watched the horde of glittering reeffish darting for the shreds of yellow flesh among the needlesharp black spine how infernal that if he did find the rarity it would benefit only mr krest should he say nothing if be found it rather childish and anyway he was under contract so to speak bond moved slowly on his eyes automatically taking up the search again while his mind turned to considering the girl she had spent the previous day in bed mr krest had said it was a headache would she one day turn on him would she get herself a knife or a gun and one night when he reached for that damnable whip would she kill him no she was too soft too malleable mr krest had chosen well she was the stuff of slaves and the trappings of her fairytale were too precious didnt she realize that a jury would certainly acquit her if the stingray whip was produced in court she could have the trappings without this dreadful damnable man should bond tell her that dont be ridiculous how could he put it oh liz if you want to murder your husband itll be quite all right bond smiled inside his mask to hell with it dont interfere with other peoples lives she probably likes it masochist but bond knew that that was too easy an answer this was a girl who lived in fear perhaps she also lived in loathing one couldnt read much in those soft blue eyes but the windows had opened once or twice and a flash of something like a childish hate had shown through had it been hate it had probably been indigestion bond put the krests out of his mind and looked up to see how far round the island he had got fidele barbeys schnorkel was only a hundred yards away they had nearly completed the circuit they came up with each other and swam to the shore and lay on the hot sand fidele barbey said nothing on my side of the property except every fish in the world bar one but ive had a stroke of luck ran into a big colony of green snail thats the pearl shell as big is a small football worth quite a lot of money ill send one of my boats after them one of these days saw a blue parrotfish that must have been a good thirty pounds tame as a dog like all the fish round here hadnt got the heart to kill it and if i had there might have been trouble saw two or three leopard sharks cruising around over the reef blood in the water might have brought them through now im ready for a drink and something to eat after that we can swap sides and have another go they got up and walked along the beach to the tent mr krest heard their voices and came out to meet them no dice eh he scratched angrily at an arm pit goddam sandfly bit me this is one hell of a godawful island liz couldnt stand the smell gone back to the ship guess wed better give it one more goingover and then get the hell out of here help yourselves to some chow and youll find cold beer in the icepack here gimme one of those masks how do you use the dam things i guess i might as well take a peek at the seas bottom while im about it they sat in the hot tent and ate the chicken salad and drank beer and moodily watched mr krest poking and peering about in the shallows fidele barbey said hes right of course these little islands are bloody awful places nothing but crabs and bird dung surrounded by too dam much sea its only the poor bloody frozen europeans that dream of coral islands east of suez you wont find any sane man who gives a damn for them my family owns about ten of them decentsized ones too with small villages on them and a good income from copra and turtle well you can have the whole bloody lot in exchange for a flat in paris or london bond laughed he began put an advertisement in the times and youd get sackloads when fifty yards away mr krest began to make frantic signals bond said either the bastards found it or hes trodden on a guitarfish and picked up his mask and ran down to the sea mr krest was standing up to his waist among the shallow beginnings of the reef he jabbed his finger excitedly at the surface bond swam softly forward a carpet of seagrass ended in broken coral and an occasional niggerhead a dozen varieties of butterfly and other reeffish flirted among the rocks and a small langouste quested towards bond with its feelers the head of a large green moray protruded from a hole its halfopen jaws showing the rows of needle teeth its golden eyes watched bond carefully bond was amused to note that mr krests hairy legs magnified into pale treetrunks by the glass were not more than a foot away from the morays jaws he gave an encouraging poke at the moray with his spear but the eel only snapped at the metal points and slid back out of sight bond stopped and floated his eyes scanning the brilliant jungle a red blur materialized through the far mist and came towards him it circled closely beneath him as if showing itself off the dark blue eyes examined him without fear the small fish busied itself rather selfconsciously with some algae on the underside of a niggerhead made a dart at a speck of something suspended in the water and then as if leaving the stage after showing its paces swam languidly off back into the mist bond backed away from the morays hole and put his feet to the ground he took off his mask he said to mr krest who was standing gazing impatiently at him through his goggles yes thats it all right better move quietly away from here he wont go away unless hes frightened these reeffish stick pretty well to the same pastures mr krest pulled off his mask goddam i found it he said reverently well goddam i did he slowly followed bond to the shore fidele barbey was waiting for them mr krest said boisterously fido i found that goddam fish me milton krest whadya know about that after you two goddam experts had been at it all morning i just took that mask of yours first time i ever put one on mark you and i walked out and found the goddam fish in fifteen minutes flat whadya say to that eh fido thats good mr krest thats fine now how do we catch it aha mr krest winked slowly i got just the ticket for that got it from a chemist friend of mine stuff called rotenone made from derris root what the natives fish with in brazil just pour it in the water where itll float over what youre after and itll get him as sure as eggs is eggs sort of poison constricts the blood vessels in their gills suffocates them no effect on humans because no gills see mr krest turned to bond here jim you go on out and keep watch see the darned fish dont vamoose fido and ill bring the stuff out there he pointed upcurrent from the vital area ill let go the rotenone when you say the word itll drift down towards you right but for lands sakes get the timing right ive only got a fivegallon tin of this stuff kay bond said all right and walked slowly down and into the water he swam lazily out to where he had stood before yes everyone was still there going about his business the morays pointed head was back again at the edge of its hole the langouste again queried him in a minute as if it had a rendezvous with bond the hildebrand rarity appeared this time it swam up quite close to his face it looked through the glass at his eyes and then as if disturbed by what it had seen there darted out of range it played around among the rocks for a while and then went off into a mist slowly the little underwater world within bonds vision began to take him for granted a small octopus that had been camouflaged as a piece of coral revealed its presence and groped carefully down towards the sand the blue and yellow langouste came a few steps out from under the rock wondering about him some very small fish like minnows nibbled at his legs and toes tickling bond broke a seaegg for them and they darted to the better meal bond lifted his head mr krest holding the flat can was twenty yards away to bonds right he would soon begin pouring when bond gave the sign so that the liquid would get a good wide spread over the surface okay called mr krest bond shook his head ill raise my thumb when hes back here then youll have to pour fast okay jim youre at the bombsight bond put his head down there was the little community everyone busied with his affairs soon to get one fish that someone vaguely wanted in a museum five thousand miles away a hundred perhaps a thousand small people were going to die when bond gave the signal the shadow of death would come down on the stream how long would the poison last how far would it travel on down the reef perhaps it would not be thousands but tens of thousands that would die a small trunkfish appeared its tiny fins whirring like propellers a rock beauty gorgeous in gold and red and black pecked at the sand and a pair of the inevitable black and yellow striped sergeantmajors materialized from nowhere attracted by the scent of the broken seaegg inside the reef who was the predator in the world of small fishes who did they fear small barracuda an occasional billfish now a big a fully grown predator a man called krest was standing in the wings waiting and this one wasnt even hungry he was just going to kill almost for fun two brown legs appeared in bonds vision he looked up it was fidele barbey with a big creel strapped to his chest and longhandled landingnet bond lifted his mask i feel like the bombaimer at nagasaki fish are coldblooded they dont feel anything how do you know ive heard them scream when theyre hurt barbey said indifferently they wont be able to scream with this stuff it strangles them whats eating you theyre only fish i know i know fidele barbey had spent his life killing animals and fish while he bond had some times not hesitated to kill men what was he fussing about he hadnt minded killing the stingray yes but that was an enemy fish these down here were friendly people people the pathetic fallacy hey came the voice of mr krest whats goin on over there this aint no time for chewing the fat get that head down jim bond pulled down his mask and lay again on the surface at once he saw the beautiful red shadow coming out of the far mists the fish swam fast up to him as if it now took him for granted it lay below him looking up bond said into his mask get away from here damn you he gave a sharp jab at the fish with his harpoon the fish fled back into the mist bond lifted his head and angrily raised his thumb it was a ridiculous and petty act of sabotage of which he was already ashamed the dark brown oily liquid was pouring out on to the surface of the lagoon there was time to stop mr krest before it was all gone time to give him another chance at the hildebrand rarity bond stood and watched until the last drop was tilted out to hell with mr krest now the stuff was creeping slowly down on the current a shiny spreading stain which reflected the blue sky with a metallic glint mr krest the giant reaper was wading down with it get set fellers he called cheerfully its right up with you now bond put his head back under the surface every thing was as before in the little community and then with stupefying suddenness everyone went mad it was as if they had all been seized with st vituss dance several fish looped the loop crazily and then fell like heavy leaves to the sand the moray eel came slowly out of the hole in the coral its jaws wide it stood carefully upright on its tail and gently toppled side ways the small langouste gave three kicks of its tail and turned over on its back and the octopus let go its hold of the coral and drifted to the bottom upside down and then into the arena drifted the corpses from upstream whitebellied fish shrimps worms hermit crabs spotted and green morays langoustes of all sizes as if blown by some light breeze of death the clumsy bodies their colours already fading swept slowly past a fivepound billfish struggled by with snapping beak fighting death downreef there were splashes on the surface as still bigger fish tried to make for safety one by one before bonds eyes the seaurchins dropped off the rocks to make black inkblots on the sand bond felt a touch on his shoulder mr krests eyes were bloodshot with the sun and glare he had put white sunburn paste on his lips he shouted impatiently at bonds mask where in hells our goddam fish bond lifted his mask looks as if it managed to get away just before the stuff came down im still watching for it he didnt wait to hear mr krests reply but got his head quickly under water again still more carnage still more dead bodies but surely the stuff had passed by now surely the area was safe just in case the fish his fish because he had saved it came back again he stiffened in the far mists there was a pink flash it had gone now it was back again idly the hildebrand rarity swam towards him through the maze of channels between the broken outposts of the reef not caring about mr krest bond raised his free hand out of the water and brought it down with a sharp slap still the fish came bond shifted the safe on his harpoongun and fired it in the direction of the fish no effect bond put his feet down and began to walk towards the fish through the scattering of corpses the beautiful red and black fish seemed to pause and quiver then it shot straight through the water towards bond and dived down to the sand at his feet and lay still bond only had to bend to pick it up there was not even a last flap from the tail it just filled bonds hand lightly pricking the palm with the spiny black dorsal fin bond carried it back underwater so as to preserve its colours when he got to mr krest he said here and handed him the small fish then he swam away towards the shore that evening with the wawekrest heading for home down the path of a huge yellow moon mr krest gave orders for what he called a wingding gotta celebrate liz this is terrific a terrific day cleaned up the last target and we can get the hell out of these goddam seychelles and get on back to civilization what say we make it to mombasa when weve taken on board the tortoise and that goddam parrot fly to nairobi and pick up a big plane for rome venice paris anywheres you care for what say treasure he squeezed her chin and cheeks in his big hand and made the pale lips pout he kissed them drily bond watched the girls eyes they had shut tight mr krest let go the girl massaged her face it was still white with his fingermarks gee milt she said half laughing you nearly squashed me you dont know your strength but do lets celebrate i think that would be lots of fun and that paris idea sounds grand lets do that shall we what shall i order for dinner hell caviar of course mr krest held his hands apart one of those twopound tins from hammacher schlemmer the grade ten shot size and all the trimmings and that pink champagne he turned to bond that suit you feller sounds like a square meal bond changed the subject what have you done with the prize formalin up on the boatdeck with some other jars of stuff weve picked up here and there fish shells all safe in our home morgue thats how we were told to keep the specimens well airmail that damned fish when we get back to civilization give a press conference first should make a big play in the papers back home ive already radioed the smithsonian and the news agencies my accountantsll sure be glad of some press cuttings to show those darned revenue boys mr krest got very drunk that night it did not show greatly the soft bogart voice became softer and slower the round hard head turned more deliberately on the shoulders the lighters flame took increasingly long to relight the cigar and one glass was swept off the table but it showed in the things mr krest said there was a violent cruelty a pathological desire to wound quite near the surface in the man that night after dinner the first target was james bond he was treated to a softspoken explanation as to why europe with england and france in the van was a rapidly diminishing asset to the world nowadays said mr krest there were only three powers america russia and china that was the big poker game and no other country had either the chips or the cards to come into it occasionally some pleasant little country and he admitted theyd been pretty big league in the past like england would be lent some money so that they could take a hand with the grownups but that was just being polite like one sometimes had to be to a chum in ones club whod gone broke no england nice people mind you good sports was a place to see the old buildings and the queen and so on france they only counted for good food and easy women italy sunshine and spaghetti sanatorium sort of germany well they still had some spunk but two lost wars had knocked the heart out of them mr krest dismissed the rest of the world with a few similar tags and then asked bond for his comments bond was thoroughly tired of mr krest he said he found mr krests point of view oversimplified he might even say naive he said your argument reminds me of a rather sharp aphorism i once heard about america care to hear it sure sure its to the effect that america has progressed from infancy to senility without having passed through a period of maturity mr krest looked thoughtfully at bond finally he said why say jim thats pretty neat his eyes hooded slightly as they turned towards his wife guess youd kinda go along with that remark of jims eh treasure i recall you saying once you reckoned there was something pretty childish about the americans remember oh milt liz krests eyes were anxious she had read the signs how can you bring that up you know it was only something casual i said about the comic sections of the papers of course i dont agree with what james says anyway it was only a joke wasnt it james thats right said bond like when mr krest said england had nothing but ruins and a queen mr krests eyes were still on the girl he said softly shucks treasure why are you looking so nervous course it was a joke he paused and one ill remember treasure one ill sure remember bond estimated that by now mr krest had just about one whole bottle of various alcohols mostly whisky inside him it looked to bond as if unless mr krest passed out the time was not far off when bond would have to hit mr krest just once very hard on the jaw fidele barbey was now being given the treatment these islands of yours fido when i first looked them up on the map i thought it was just some specks of flydirt on the page mr krest chuckled even tried to brush them off with the back of my hand then i read a bit about them and it seemed to me my first thoughts had just about hit the nail on the head not much good for anything are they fido i wonder an intelligent guy like you doesnt get the hell out of there beachcombing aint any kind of a life though i did hear one of your family had logged over a hundred illegitimate children mebbe thats the attraction eh feller mr krest grinned knowingly fidele barbey said equably thats my uncle gaston the rest of the family doesnt approve its made quite a hole in the family fortune family fortune eh mr krest winked at bond whats it in cowrieshells not exactly fidele barbey was not used to mr krests brand of rudeness he looked mildly embarrassed though we made quite a lot out of tortoiseshell and motherofpearl about a hundred years ago when there was a rage for these things copras always been our main business using the family bastards as labour i guess good idea wish i could fix something like that in my home circle he looked across at his wife the rubber lips turned still further down before the next gibe could be uttered bond had pushed his chair back and had gone out into the welldeck and pulled the door shut behind him ten minutes later bond heard feet coming softly down the ladder from the boatdeck he turned it was liz krest she came over to where he was standing in the stern she said in a strained voice i said id go to bed but then i thought id come back here and see if youd got everything you want im not a very good hostess im afraid are you sure you dont mind sleeping out here i like it i like this kind of air better than the canned stuff inside and its rather wonderful to have all those stars to look at ive never seen so many before she said eagerly grasping at a friendly topic i like orions belt and the southern cross the best you know when i was young i used to think the stars were really holes in the sky i thought the world was surrounded by a great big black sort of envelope and that outside it the universe was full of bright light the stars were just holes in the envelope that let little sparks of light through one gets terribly silly ideas when ones young she looked up at him wanting him not to snub her bond said youre probably quite right one shouldnt believe all the scientists say they want to make everything dull where did you live then at ringwood in the new forest it was a good place to be brought up a good place for children id like to go there again one day bond said youve certainly come a long way since then youd probably find it pretty dull she reached out and touched his sleeve please dont say that you dont understand there was an edge of desperation in the soft voice i cant bear to go on missing what other people have ordinary people i mean she laughed nervously you wont believe me but just to talk like this for a few minutes to have someone like you to talk to is something id almost forgotten she suddenly reached for his hand and held it hard im sorry i just wanted to do that now ill go to bed the soft voice came from behind them the speech had slurred but each word was carefully separated from the next well well whadya know necking with the underwater help mr krest stood framed in the hatch to the saloon he stood with his legs apart and his arms upstretched to the lintel above his head with the light behind him he had the silhouette of a baboon the cold imprisoned breath of the saloon rushed out past him and for a moment chilled the warm night air in the welldeck mr krest stepped out and softly pulled the door to behind him bond took a step towards him his hands held loosely at his sides he measured the distance to mr krests solar plexus he said dont jump to conclusions mr krest and watch your tongue youre lucky not to have got hurt so far tonight dont press your luck youre drunk go to bed oho listen to the cheeky feller mr krests moonburned face turned slowly from bond to his wife he made a contemptuous hapsburglip grimace he took a silver whistle out of his pocket and whirled it round on its string he sure dont get the picture does he treasure you aint told him that those heinies up front aint just for ornament he turned back to bond feller you move any closer and i blow this just once and you know what itll be the old heaveho for mr goddam bond he made a gesture towards the sea over the side man overboard too bad we back up to make a search and you know what feller just by chance we back up into you with those twin screws would you believe it what lousy bad luck for that nice feller jim we were all getting so fond of mr krest swayed on his feet dya get the photo jim okay so lets all be friends again and get some shut eye he reached for the lintel of the hatch and turned to his wife he lifted his free hand and slowly crooked a finger move treasure time for bed yes milt the wide frightened eyes turned side ways goodnight james without waiting for an answer she ducked under mr krests arm and almost ran through the saloon mr krest lifted a hand take it easy feller no hard feelings eh bond said nothing he went on looking hard at mr krest mr krest laughed uncertainly he said okay then he stepped into the saloon and slid the door shut through the window bond watched him walk unsteadily across the saloon and turn out the lights he went into the corridor and there was a momentary gleam from the stateroom door and then that too went dark bond shrugged his shoulders god what a man he leant against the stern rail and watched the stars and the flashes of phosphorescence in the creaming wake and set about washing his mind clear and relaxing the coiled tensions in his body half an hour later after taking a shower in the crews bathroom forrard bond was making a bed for himself among the piled dunlopillo cushions when he heard a single heartrending scream it tore briefly into the night and was smothered it was the girl bond ran through the saloon and down the passage with his hand on the stateroom door he stopped he could hear her sobs and above them the soft even drone of mr krests voice he took his hand away from the latch hell what was it to do with him they were man and wife if she was prepared to stand this sort of thing and not kill her husband or leave him it was no good bond playing sir galahad bond walked slowly back down the passage as he was crossing the saloon the scream this time less piercing rang out again bond cursed fluently and went out and lay down on his bed and tried to focus his mind on the soft thud of the diesels how could a girl have so little guts or was it that women could take almost anything from a man anything except indifference bonds mind refused to unwind sleep got further and further away an hour later bond had reached the edge of unconsciousness when up above him on the boatdeck mr krest began to snore on the second night out from port victoria mr krest had left his cabin in the middle of the night and had gone up to the hammock that was kept slung for him between the speedboat and the dinghy but that night he had not snored now he was snoring with those deep rattling utterly lost snores that come from big blue sleepingpills on top of too much alcohol this was too damned much bond looked at his watch onethirty if the snoring didnt stop in ten minutes bond would go down to fidele barbeys cabin and sleep on the floor even if he did wake up stiff and frozen in the morning bond watched the gleaming minutehand slowly creep round the dial now he had got to his feet and was gathering up his shirt and shorts when from up on the boatdeck there came a heavy crash the crash was immediately followed by scrabbling sounds and a dreadful choking and gurgling had mr krest fallen out of his hammock reluctantly bond dropped his things back on the deck and walked over and climbed the ladder as his eyes came level with the boatdeck the choking stopped instead there was another a more dreadful sound the quick drumming of heels bond knew that sound he leapt up the last steps and ran towards the figure lying spreadeagled on its back in the bright moonlight he stopped and knelt slowly down aghast the horror of the strangled face was bad enough but it was not mr krests tongue that protruded from his gaping mouth it was the tail of a fish the colours were pink and black it was the hildebrand rarity the man was dead horribly dead when the fish had been crammed into his mouth he must have reached up and desperately tried to tug it out but the spines of the dorsal and anal fins had caught inside the cheeks and some of the spiny tips now protruded through the bloodflecked skin round the obscene mouth bond shuddered death must have come inside a minute but what a minute bond slowly got to his feet he walked over to the racks of glass specimen jars and peered under the protective awning the plastic cover of the end jar lay on the deck beside it bond wiped it carefully on the tarpaulin and then holding it by the tips of his fingernails laid it loosely back over the mouth of the jar he went back and stood over the corpse which of the two had done this there was a touch of fiendish spite in using the treasured prize as a weapon that suggested the woman she certainly had her reasons but fidele barbey with his creole blood would have had the cruelty and at the same time the macabre humour je lui ai foutu son sacrй poisson dans la geule bond could hear him say the words if after bond had left the saloon mr krest had needled the seychellois just a little bit further particularly about his family or his beloved islands fidele barbey would not have hit him then and there or used a knife he would have waited and plotted bond looked round the deck the snoring of the man could have been a signal for either of them there were ladders to the boatdeck from both sides of the cabindeck amidships the man at the wheel in the pilothouse forrard would have heard nothing above the noise from the engineroom to pick the small fish out of its formalin bath and slip it into mr krests gaping mouth would have only needed seconds bond shrugged whichever had done it had not thought of the consequences of the inevitable inquest perhaps of a trial in which he bond would be an additional suspect they were certainly all going to be in one hell of a mess unless he could tidy things up bond glanced over the edge of the boatdeck below was the threefootwide strip of deck that ran the length of the ship between this and the sea there was a twofoothigh rail supposing the hammock had broken and mr krest had fallen and rolled under the speedboat and over the edge of the upper deck could he have reached the sea hardly in this dead calm but that was what he was going to have done bond got moving with a tableknife from the saloon he carefully frayed and then broke one of the main cords of the hammock so that the hammock trailed realistically on the deck next with a damp cloth he cleaned up the specks of blood on the woodwork and the drops of formalin that led from the specimen jar then came the hardest part handling the corpse carefully bond pulled it to the very edge of the deck and himself went down the ladder and bracing himself reached up the corpse came down on top of him in a heavy drunken embrace bond staggered under it to the low rail and eased it over there was a last hideous glimpse of the obscenely bulging face a sickening fume of stale whisky a heavy splash and it was gone and rolling sluggishly away in the small waves of the wake bond flattened himself back against the saloon hatchway ready to slip through if the helmsman came aft to investigate but there was no movement forrard and the iron tramp of the diesels held steady bond sighed deeply it would be a very troublesome coroner who brought in anything but misadventure he went back to the boatdeck gave it a final look over disposed of the knife and the wet cloth and went down the ladder to his bed in the well it was twofifteen bond was asleep inside ten minutes by pushing the speed up to twelve knots they made north point by six oclock that evening behind them the sky was ablaze with red and gold streaked across aquamarine the two men with the woman between them stood at the rail of the welldeck and watched the brilliant shore slip by across the motherofpearl mirror of the sea liz krest was wearing a white linen frock with a black belt and a black and white handkerchief round her neck the mourning colours went well with the golden skin the three people stood stiffly and rather selfconsciously each one nursing his own piece of secret knowledge each one anxious to convey to the other two that their particular secrets were safe with him that morning there had seemed to be a conspiracy among the three to sleep late even bond had not been awakened by the sun until ten oclock he showered in the crews quarters and chatted with the helmsman before going below to see what had happened to fidele barbey he was still in bed he said he had a hangover had he been very rude to mr krest he couldnt remember much about it except that he seemed to recall mr krest being very rude to him you remember what i said about him from the beginning james a grand slam redoubled in bastards now do you agree with me one of these days someones going to shut that soft ugly mouth of his for ever inconclusive bond had fixed himself some breakfast in the galley and was eating it there when liz krest had come in to do the same she was dressed in a pale blue shantung kimono to her knees there were dark rings under her eyes and she ate her breakfast standing but she seemed perfectly calm and at ease she whispered conspiratorially i do apologize about last night i suppose id had a bit too much to drink too but do forgive milt hes really awfully nice its only when hes had a bit too much that he gets sort of difficult hes always sorry the next morning youll see when eleven oclock came and neither of the other two showed any signs of so to speak blowing the gaff bond decided to force the pace he looked very hard at liz krest who was lying on her stomach in the welldeck reading a magazine he said by the way wheres your husband still sleeping it off she frowned i suppose so he went up to his hammock on the boatdeck ive no idea what time i took a sleepingpill and went straight off fidele barbey had a line out for amberjack without looking round he said hes probably in the pilothouse bond said if hes still asleep on the boatdeck hell be getting the hell of a sunburn liz krest said oh poor milt i hadnt thought of that ill go and see she climbed the ladder when her head was above the level of the boatdeck she stopped she called down anxiously jim hes not here and the hammocks broken bond said fideles probably right ill have a look forrard he went to the pilothouse fritz the mate and the engineer were there bond said anyone seen mr krest fritz looked puzzled no sir why is anything wrong bond flooded his face with anxiety hes not aft here come on look round everywhere he was sleeping on the boatdeck hes not there and his hammocks broken he was rather the worse for wear last night come on get cracking when the inevitable conclusion had been reached liz krest had a short but credible fit of hysteria bond took her to her cabin and left her there in tears its all right liz he said you stay out of this ill look after everything well have to radio port victoria and so on ill tell fritz to put on speed im afraid its hopeless turning back to look thereve been six hours of daylight when he couldnt have fallen overboard without being heard or seen it must have been in the night im afraid anything like six hours in these seas is just not on she stared at him her eyes wide you mean you mean sharks and things bond nodded oh milt poor darling milt oh why did this have to happen bond went out and softly shut the door the yacht rounded cannon point and reduced speed keeping well away from the broken reef it slid quietly across the broad bay now lemon and gunmetal in the last light towards the anchorage the small township beneath the mountains was already dark with indigo shadow in which a sprinkling of yellow lights showed bond saw the customs and immigration launch move off from long pier to meet them the little community would already be buzzing with the news that would have quickly leaked from the radio station to the seychelles club and then through the members chauffeurs and staffs into the town liz krest turned to him im beginning to get nervous will you help me through the rest of this these awful formalities and things of course fidele barbey said dont worry too much all these people are my friends and the chief justice is my uncle we shall all have to make a statement theyll probably have the inquest tomorrow youll be able to leave the day after you really think so a dew of sweat had sprung below her eyes the trouble is i dont really know where to leave for or what to do next i suppose she hesitated not looking at bond i suppose james you wouldnt like to come on to mombasa i mean youre going there anyway and id be able to get you there a day earlier than this ship of yours this camp something kampala bond lit a cigarette to cover his hesitation four days in a beautiful yacht with this girl but the tail of that fish sticking out of the mouth had she done it or had fidele who would know that his uncles and cousins on mahe would somehow see that he came to no harm if only one of them would make a slip bond said easily thats terribly nice of you liz of course id love to come fidele barbey chuckled bravo my friend and i would love to be in your shoes but for one thing that damned fish it is a great responsibility i like to think of you both being deluged with cables from the smithsonian about it dont forget that you are now both trustees of a scientific kohinoor and you know what these americans are theyll worry the life out of you until theyve got their hands on it bonds eyes were hard as flint as he watched the girl surely that put the finger on her now he would make some excuse get out of the trip there had been some thing about that particular way of killing a man but the beautiful candid eyes did not flicker she looked up into fidele barbeys face and said easily charmingly that wont be a problem ive decided to give it to the british museum james bond noticed that the sweat dew had now gathered at her temples but after all it was a desperately hot evening the thud of the engines stopped and the anchor chain roared down into the quiet bay
