 prologue t here were pictures in the fire dragons and demons and warriors the children would see them as he did the old man knew the very young and the very old often saw what others could not or would not he had told them much already his tale had begun with the sorcerer who was called by the goddess morrigan hoyt of the mac cionaoith was charged by the gods to travel to other worlds to other times and gather an army to stand strong against the vampire queen the great battle between human and demon would take place on the sabbot of samhain in the valley of silence in the land of geall he had told them of hoyt the sorcerers brother killed and changed by the wily lilith who had existed near a thousand years as a vampire before making cian one of her kind nearly another thousand years would pass for cian before he would join hoyt and the witch glenna to make those first links in the circle of six the next links were forged by two geallians the shifter of shapes and the scholar who traveled between worlds to gather in those first days and the last of the circle was joined by the warrior a demon hunter of the mac cionaoith blood the tales he had told them were of battles and courage of death and friendship and of love the love that had bloomed between sorcerer and witch and between the shifter and the warrior had strengthened the circle as true magic must but there was more to tell triumphs and loss fear and valor love and sacrifice and all that came with the dark and the light as the children waited for more he wondered how best to begin the end of the tale there were six he said still watching the fire while the childrens whispers silenced and their squirming stilled in anticipation and each had the choice to accept or refuse for even when worlds are held in your hands you must choose to face what would destroy them or to turn away and with this choice he continued there are many other choices to be made they were brave and true one of the children called out they chose to fight the old man smiled a little and so they did but still every day every night of the time they were given that choice remained and had to be made anew one among them you remember was no longer human but vampire every day every night of the time they were given he was reminded he was no longer human he was but a shadow in the worlds he had chosen to protect and so the old man said the vampire dreamed chapter h e dreamed and dreaming he was still a man young perhaps foolish undoubtedly rash but then what he believed was a woman had such beauty such allure she wore a fine gown in a deep shade of red more elegant than the country pub deserved with its long sweeping sleeves like a good claret it poured over her form to set her pure white skin glowing her hair was gold the curls of it glinting against her headdress the gown her bearing the jewels that were sparkling at her throat on her fingers told him she was a lady of some means and fashion he thought in the dim light of the public house she was like a flame that burned at shadows two servants had arranged for a private room for her to sup before she swept in and simply by being had silenced the talk and the music but her eyes blue as a summer sky had met his only his when one of the servants had come out again walked to him and announced that the lady requested he dine with her he hadnt hesitated why would he he might have grinned at the goodnatured comments of the men he was drinking with but he left them without a thought she stood in firelight and candlelight already pouring wine into cups im so glad she said you would agree to join me i hate to dine alone dont you she came toward him her movements so graceful she almost seemed to float im called lilith and she handed him wine in her speech there was something exotic some cadence of speech that hinted of hot sand and riotous blooming vines so he was already half seduced and completely enchanted they shared the simple meal though he had no appetite for food it was her words he devoured she spoke of the lands to which she had traveled those which hed only read of she had walked among the pyramids she told him in the moonlight had ridden the hills of rome and stood in the ruined temples of greece he had never traveled beyond ireland and her words the images they invoked were nearly as exciting as she herself he thought she was young to have done so much but when he said as much she only smiled over the rim of her cup what good are worlds she asked if you dont make use of them ill make use of much more wine to be drunk food to be tasted lands to be explored youre young she said with a slow and knowing smile to settle for so little have you no wish to see beyond what youve seen i thought perhaps to take a year when im able to see more of the world a year with a light laugh she snapped her fingers that is a year nothing a blink of time what would you do if you had an eternity of time her eyes seemed like depthless blue seas as she leaned toward him what would you do with it without waiting for his answer she rose leaving the trail of her scent behind as she walked to the small window ah the night its so soft like silk against the skin she turned back with a gleam in those bold blue eyes i am a night creature and so i think are you we such as we are at our best in the dark he had risen when she did and now as she came back to him her scent and the wine swam through his senses and something more something thick and smoky that hazed over his mind like a drug she tipped her head up and back then laid her mouth over his and why when were best in the dark would we spend the dark hours alone and in the dream it was like a dream misty and muddled he was in her carriage with her full white breasts in his hands her mouth hot and avid on his she laughed when he fumbled with her kirtle and spread her legs in seductive invitation strong hands she murmured a pleasing face its what i need and need and take will you do my bidding with another light laugh she nipped at his ear will you will you young handsome cian with the strong hands aye of course aye he could think of nothing but burying himself in her when he did with the carriage swaying madly her head fell back in abandon yes yes yes so hard so hot give me more and more and ill take you beyond all that you know as he plunged his breath coming short as he neared climax her head reared up again her eyes were no longer blue and bold but red and feral the shock that rushed into him had him trying to pull back but her arms suddenly wrapped around him implacable as iron chains her legs hooked around his waist keeping him inside her trapped while he struggled against her impossible strength she smiled with fangs gleaming in the dark what are you there were no prayers in his head fear left no room for them what are you her hips continued to rise and fall riding him so he was helplessly driven closer to peak she fisted a hand in his hair yanking back his head to expose his throat magnificent she said i am magnificent and so will you be she struck the fangs piercing his flesh he heard his own scream somewhere in the madness and pain he heard it the burn was unspeakable searing through skin into blood beyond the bone and mixed with it sliding through it was a terrible terrible pleasure he came in the whirling singing dark betrayed by his body even as it dipped toward death he struggled still some part of him clawing for the light for survival but the pain the pleasure dragged him deeper into the abyss you and i my handsome boy you and i she dipped back cradling him in her arms now with her own fingernail she sliced a shallow slice across her breast so that blood dripped from it as it did horribly from her lips now drink drink me and you are forever no his lips wouldnt form the word but it screamed through his mind feeling his life slipping away he struggled weakly for that last hold on it even when she pulled his head to her breast he fought her with what was left of him then he tasted it the rich and heady flavor that flowed from her the bulging life of it and like a babe at its mothers breast he drank his own death t he vampire woke in absolute dark in absolute silence such was the way for him since the change so long ago that he roused each sunset with not even the sound of his own heartbeat to stir the air though he had dreamed the dream countless times over countless years it disturbed him to fall from that edge yet again to see himself as hed been to see his own face one hed not seen while awake since that night made him edgy and annoyed he didnt brood over his fate that was a useless occupation he accepted and used what he was and had through his personal eternity accumulated wealth women comfort freedom what else could a man want having no heartbeat was a small price to pay in the larger scheme of things a heart that beat aged and weakened and eventually stopped like a broken clock in any case how many bodies had he seen decay and die over his nine hundred years he couldnt count them and while he couldnt see the reflection of his own face he knew it was the same as the night lilith had taken him the bones were still strong the skin over them firm supple and unlined his eyes were sharp of sight and unfaded there was not and would never be any gray in his hair any sagging in his jowls perhaps there were times in the dark in private when he used his fingers to see his own face there the high prominent cheekbones the shallow cleft in the chin the deepset eyes he knew were a strong blue the blade of his nose the firm curve of his lips the same always the same but still a small indulgence to spend a moment reminding himself he rose in the dark his leanly muscled body naked shook back the black hair that framed his face hed been born cian mac cionaoith and had gone by many names since he was back to cian his brothers doing hoyt would call him nothing else and since this war hed agreed to fight might end him cian decided it was only right he should wear the name of his birth hed prefer not to be ended in his opinion only the mad or the very young considered dying an adventure but if that was his fate at this time and place at least hed go out with style and if there were any justice in any world he would take lilith with him to dust his eyes were as keen as his other senses so he moved easily in the dark going to a chest for one of the packets of blood that had been transported from ireland apparently the gods had deemed to allow the blood as well as the vampire who required it to travel through worlds from their circle of stones then again it was pigs blood cian hadnt fed on humans in centuries a personal choice he mused as he broke open the packet poured its contents into a cup a matter of will he thought and well manners come to that he lived among them did business with them slept with them when he was in the mood it seemed rude to feed off them in any case hed found it simpler to live as he liked to stay off the radar if he didnt kill some hapless soul on a nightly basis live feeding added both thrill and flavor nothing else matched but it was by nature a messy business hed grown accustomed to the more banal flavor of pigs blood and the simple convenience of having it at his fingertips rather than having to go out and hunt something up every time hunger stirred in him he drank the blood as a man might his morning coffee out of habit and the need for a kick on waking it cleared his mind jumpstarted his system he troubled neither with candles nor fire as he washed he couldnt say he was overly pleased with the accommodations of geall castle or not he imagined he was as out of place in this medieval atmosphere as both glenna and blair hed lived through this sort of era once and once was enough for anyone he preferred much preferred the daily conveniences of indoor plumbing electricity chinese bloody takeout come to that he missed his car his bed the damn microwave he missed the life and sounds of city life and all it offered fate would have given him a solid kick in the ass if it ended him here in the era if not the world of his beginnings dressed he left his room to make his way to the stables and his horse there were people about servants guards courtiers those who lived and worked within the castle geall most avoided him averting their eyes quickening their pace some made the sign against evil behind their backs it didnt trouble him they knew what he was and had seen what creatures like him were capable of since moira the scholarly gladiator had battled one in the playing field it had been good strategy he thought now for moira to ask him along with blair and larkin to hunt down the two vampires whod killed her mother the queen moira had understood the importance the value of having vampires brought back alive so the people could see them for what they were and see moira herself fight and end one proving herself a warrior she would in a matter of weeks lead her people to war when a land had been at peace as long as geall was reputed to have been it would take a strong leader a forceful one to whip farmers and merchants ladiesinwaiting and creaky advisors into soldiers he wasnt sure she was up to the task brave enough he mused as he slipped out of the castle crossed a courtyard toward the stables more than bright enough and it was true shed honed considerable fighting skills over the past two months no doubt shed been trained since birth in matters of state and protocol and her mind was clever and open in peace he imagined shed rule her pretty little world quite well but in wartime a ruler was general as well as figurehead if it had been up to him he would have left riddock her uncle in charge but little of this business was up to him he heard her before he saw her and scented her before that cian very nearly turned around to go back the way hed come it was just another annoyance to come across the woman when hed been thinking of her the problem was he thought of her entirely too often avoiding her wasnt an option as they were inexorably bound together in this war slipping away now unseen was easily done and cowardly pride as always refused to let him take the easy way theyd housed his stallion at the far end of the stables two stalls away from any of the other horses he understood and tolerated the fact that the grooms and farriers were wary of tending to the horse of a demon just as he was aware either larkin or hoyt groomed and fed his temperamental vlad in the mornings now it seemed moira had taken it upon herself to spoil the animal she had carrots cian saw and was balancing one on her shoulder cajoling vlad to nip it off you know you want it she murmured its so tasty all you have to do is take it hed thought the same about the woman cian mused she was gowned her dress draped over a plain linen kirtle so he assumed whatever training shed done that day was complete still she dressed simply for a princess in quiet blue with only a hint of lace at the bodice she wore the silver cross one of nine hoyt and glenna had conjured her hair was loose all that glossy brown falling down her back to her waist and crowned with the thin circlet of her office she wasnt beautiful he reminded himself of that often nearly as often as he thought of her she was at best a pretty thing slender and smallframed small of feature as well but for the eyes they were long and dominant in that face of hers dove gray when she was quiet pensive listening hell smoke when she was roused hed had his choice of great beauties in his time as a man with any sense and skill would given a few centuries she wasnt beautiful but he couldnt for all the effort lock her out of his mind he knew he could have her if he put any of that effort into a seduction she was young and innocent and curious and therefore very susceptible which was why above all else he knew hed be better off seducing one of her ladies if he wanted the entertainment the companionship the release hed had his fill of innocence long ago just as hed had his fill of human blood his horse however appeared to have less willpower it took only moments before vlad dipped his head and nipped the carrot from moiras shoulder she laughed stroked the stallions ears as he chomped there now that wasnt so hard was it were friends you and i and i know you get lonely from time to time dont we all she was lifting another carrot when cian stepped out of the shadows youll make a puppy out of him then what sort of war horse will he be come samhain her body jerked then stiffened but when she turned toward cian her face was composed sure you dont really mind do you he so enjoys a bit of a treat now and then dont we all he murmured only the faintest flush of heat along her cheekbones betrayed any embarrassment at being overheard the training went well today people are coming in from all over geall so many willing to fight weve decided well be setting up a second training area on my uncles land well have tynan and niall working there lodging aye thats becoming a bit of a thing well house as many here as we can manage and at my uncles as well theres the inn and many of the farmers and crofters nearby are sheltering family and friends already no one will be turned off well find a way she fiddled with her cross as she spoke not cian thought out of fear of him but out of nervous habit theres food as well to think of so many had to leave their crops and cattle behind to come here but well manage have you eaten she flushed a little deeper as soon as the words were out what i meant is thered be supper in the parlor if i know what you meant no i thought to see to the horse first but he appears well groomed and fed on the heels of the words vlad bumped his head against moiras shoulder and spoiled cian added her brows drew together as they did he knew when she was annoyed or thoughtful its only carrots and theyre good for him speaking of food ill need blood in another week you might make certain the next pigs that are slaughtered their blood isnt wasted of course arent you the cool one now the faintest sign of irritation crossed her face you take what you need from the pig im not after turning my nose up at a slab of bacon am i she shoved the last carrot into cians hand and started to sweep out she stopped herself i dont know why you fire me up so easily if you mean to or not and no she held up a hand i dont think i want to know the answer to that but i would like to speak to you for a moment or two about another matter no avoiding her wasnt possible he reminded himself i have a moment or two she glanced around the stables it wasnt only horses that had ears in such places i wonder if you could take that moment or two to walk with me id be private on this he shrugged and giving vlad the last carrot joined moira to walk out of the stables state secrets your highness why must you mock me actually i wasnt irritable tonight are you it might be i am she shoved back the hair that spilled over her shoulder what with war and end of days and the practical matters of washing linens and providing food for an army meanwhile it might be i am a bit irritable delegate i am i do but it still takes time and thought to push chores into other hands finding the right ones explaining how it must be done and this isnt what i wanted to speak to you about sit what sit he took her arm ignoring the way the muscles tensed against his hand and pulled her down onto a bench sit give your feet a rest if you wont turn off that busy brain of yours for five minutes i cant remember the last time i had an hour all to myself and a book well i can actually back in ireland in your house i miss it the books the quiet of them you need to take it that hour now and again youll burn out otherwise and wont be any good to yourself or anyone else my hands feel so full they make my arms ache she looked down at them where they lay in her lap and sighed and there im off again what is it blair says bitch bitch bitch she surprised a laugh out of him and turned her head to smile into his face i suspect geall has never had a queen such as you and her smile faded away no youve the right of that and well soon see we go tomorrow at first light to the stone i see if i lift the sword from it as my mother did in her time and her father in his and back to the first geall will have a queen such as me she looked off over the shrubberies toward the gates geall will have no choice in it nor will i do you wish it otherwise i dont know what i wish so i dont wish at all except that it was done and over then i could do well whatever needs to be done next i wanted to tell you she shifted her gaze from whatever she saw in her mind and met his eyes again id hoped wed find a way to do this thing at night soft eyes he thought and so serious its too dangerous to have any sort of ceremony outside after sunset beyond the castle walls i know it all who wish to witness this rite may attend you cant i know im sorry for it it feels wrong i feel the six of us our circle should be together at such a time her hand reached up for her cross again geall isnt yours i know that as well but the moment of this its important for what comes after more than i knew before more than i could have known she took a shaky breath they killed my father what are you saying i have to walk again i cant sit she got up quickly rubbing her arms to warm them from the sudden chill in the air and in her blood she moved through the courtyard into one of the gardens i havent told anyone i didnt mean to tell you what purpose does it serve and ive no proof just a knowing what do you know easier than shed believed it would be to talk to him to tell him she realized because he was also so to the point one of the two that killed my mother that you brought here the one i fought she held a hand up and he watched her draw in her composure again before i killed it he said something of my father and how he died likely trying to get a rise out of you break your concentration it did that well enough but was more you see i know it inside me looking at him she pressed a hand to her heart i knew it when i looked at the one i killed not just my mother but my father as well i think lilith sent them here this time because shed had success with it before when i was a child she continued to walk her head bowed with the weight of her thoughts her circlet glinting in the light of the torches they thought it was a bear gone mad he was in the mountains hunting he was killed he and my mothers young brother my uncle riddock didnt go as my aunt was close to her time with child i she broke off again as footsteps echoed keeping her silence until the sound of them drifted away they thought those who found them and brought them home they thought it was animals and so it was she continued with steel in her tone now but these walk like a man she sent them to kill him so there would be no child but me she turned to him then the torchlight washing red over her pale face perhaps at that time she knew only the ruler of geall would be one of the circle or perhaps it was easier to kill him than me at that time as i was hardly more than a baby and kept close watch on plenty of time for her to send assassins back for me but instead they killed my mother those that did are dead is that comfort she wondered and thought from him it likely was an offer of it i dont know what to feel but i know she took my parents from me she took them to stop what cant be stopped well meet her on the battlefield come samhain because its meant whether i fight as queen or not i fight she killed them for nothing and nothing you could have done would have stopped it yes comfort she thought again oddly his pithy statement gave her just that i pray thats true but i know because of what was done what was not done what had to be what comes tomorrow is more important than rite and ritual whoever holds that sword tomorrow leads this war and wields it with the blood of my murdered parents she couldnt stop it she cannot stop it she stepped back gestured up do you see the flags the dragon and the claddaugh the symbols of geall since its beginning before this is done i will ask that one more be hoisted he thought of all she might choose a sword a stake an arrow then he knew not a weapon not an instrument of war and death but a symbol of hope and endurance a sun to shed its light on the world surprise with pleasure running just behind it lit her face aye you understand my thinking and the need a gold sun on the white flag to stand for the light the tomorrows we fight for this sun gold as glory will be the third symbol of geall one i bring to it and damned to her damned to her and what she brought here flushed now moira drew a deep breath you listen well and i talk too much you must come inside the others will be gathering for supper he touched a hand to her arm to stop her earlier i thought youd make a poor wartime queen i believe it might have been one of the rare times i was wrong if the sword is mine she said you will be wrong it occurred to him as they started inside that theyd just shared their longest conversation in the two months they had known each other you need to tell the others you need to tell them what you believe about your father if this is a circle there should be no secrets to weaken in youre right aye youve the right of it her head was lifted now her eyes clear as she led the way chapter s he didnt sleep how could a woman sleep on what was in moiras mind essentially the last night of her life if in the morning it was her destiny to free the sword from its stone scabbard she would be queen of geall as queen she would rule and govern and reign and those were duties shed been trained for since birth but as queen on this coming dawn and the ones to follow she would lead her people to war if it wasnt her destiny to raise the sword she would follow another willingly into battle could weeks of training prepare anyone for such an action such a weight of responsibility so this night was the last she could be the woman shed believed she would be even the queen shed hoped she might be whatever dawn brought her she knew nothing would ever be quite the same again before her mothers death shed believed this coming dawn was years away shed assumed she would have years of her mothers company and comfort and counsel years of peace and study so that when her time came shed be not only ready for the crown but worthy of it a part of her had assumed her mother would reign for decades longer and she herself would marry in the dim and distant future one of the children she bore would take the crown in her stead all of that had changed on the night of her mothers death no moira corrected it had changed before years before when her father had been murdered perhaps it had not changed at all but was simply unfolding as the pages of the book of fate were written now she could only wish for her mothers wisdom and look inside herself for the courage to bear both crown and sword she stood now on the high reaches of the castle under a thumbnail moon when it waxed full again she would be far from here on the cold ground of a battlefield shed come to the battlement because she could see the torches lighting the playing field here the sights and sounds of night training could reach her cian she thought used hours of his night to teach men and women how to fight something stronger and faster than humans he would push them she knew until they were ready to drop as he had pushed her and the others of the circle night after night during their weeks in ireland not all of them trusted him she knew that as well some actively feared him but that might be to the good she understood he wasnt after making friends here but warriors in truth hed had a strong part of making one of her she thought she understood why he fought with them or at least had a glimmer of understanding why he would risk so much for humankind part of it was pride of which she knew he had abundance he would not bow to lilith part whether he admitted it or not was loyalty to his brother and the rest well it dealt with courage and his own conflicted emotions for he had emotions she knew she couldnt imagine how they struggled and whirled inside him after a thousand years of existence her own were so conflicted and torn after only two months of blood and death she hardly recognized herself what must it be like for him after all hed seen and done all hed gained and lost he knew more than any of them of the world of its pleasures its pains its potentials no she couldnt imagine what it was like to know all he knew and still risk his own survival that he did risk it that he was even now lending his time and skill to train troops earned her respect while the mystery of him the hows and whys of him continued to fascinate she couldnt be sure what he thought of her even when hed kissed her that single hot and desperate moment she couldnt be sure and getting to the inside of matters had always been irresistible to her she heard footsteps and turning saw larkin coming toward her you should be in your bed he said id only stare at the ceiling the views better here she reached for his hand her cousin her friend and was instantly comforted and why arent you in yours i saw you blair and i went out to help cian for a bit like hers his gaze scanned the field below i saw you standing up here alone im poor company even for myself tonight i only wish it were done then there would be what happens next so i came up here to brood over it she tipped her head toward his shoulder it passes the time we could go down to the family parlor ill let you beat me at chess let me oh will you listen to him she looked up at him his eyes were golden brown longlidded like her own the smile in them didnt quite mask his concern and i suppose youve let me win the hundreds of matches weve had over the years i thought it good for your sense of confidence she laughed even as she poked him its confident i am i can beat you at chess nine times out of every ten well just put that to the test then we will not now she kissed him brushing his tawny hair away from his face youll go to your bed and to your lady and not spend these hours distracting me from my sorry mood come well go in it may be the limited view of my ceiling will bore me to sleep after all youve only to tap on the door if youre wanting company i know it just as she knew she would keep her own counsel until the first light of dawn but she did not sleep i n the way of tradition she would be dressed and tended to by her ladies in the last hour before dawn though it was urged on her she refused the red gown moira knew well enough it wasnt a color that flattered her however royal it might be in its stead she wore the hues of the forest a deep green over a paler green kirtle she agreed to jewels they had been her mothers after all so she allowed the heavy stones of citrine to be fastened around her neck but she would not remove the silver cross she would wear her hair down and uncovered and sat letting the female chatter chirp around her as dervil brushed it tirelessly will you not eat just a little highness ceara one of her women once again urged a plate of honey cakes on her after moira told her ill feel more settled after moira got to her feet her relief profound when glenna stepped into the room how wonderful you look moira held out her hands shed chosen the gowns herself for both glenna and blair and saw now shed chosen well then again she thought glenna was so striking there was nothing that wouldnt flatter her still the choice of deep blue velvet highlighted her creamy skin and the fire of her hair i feel a bit like a princess myself glenna told her thank you so much and you moira look every inch the queen do i she turned to her glass but saw only herself but she smiled when she saw blair come in shed chosen russet for blair with a kirtle of dull gold ive never seen you in a dress hell of a dress blair studied her friends then herself weve got that whole fairy tale thing going she threaded her fingers through her short dark hair to settle it into place you dont mind then tradition requires the more formal attire i like being a girl i dont mind dressing like one even one whos not in my own fashion era blair spotted the honey cakes and helped herself to one nervous well beyond it id like a moment with the ladies glenna and blair moira told her women when they scurried out moira dropped into the chair in front of the fire theyve been fussing around me for an hour its tiring you look beat blair sat on the arm of the chair you didnt sleep my mind wouldnt rest you didnt take the potion i gave you glenna let out a sigh you should be rested for this moira i needed to think its not the usual way of it but i want both of you and hoyt and larkin to walk with me to the stone wasnt that the plan blair asked with her mouth full you would be part of the procession yes but in the usual way i would walk ahead alone this must be as it always has been but behind me would be only my family my uncle and my aunt larkin my other cousins after them according to rank and position would walk others i want you to walk with my family as you are my family i do this for myself but also for the people of geall i want them to see what you are cian isnt able to be part of this as i wish he could it cant be done at night moira blair touched a hand to moiras shoulder its too much of a risk i know but while the circle wont be complete at the place of the stone hell be in my thoughts she rose now to go to the window dawns coming she murmured and the day follows she turned back as the last stars died im ready for what comes with it her family and her women were already gathered below she accepted the cloak from dervil and fastened the dragon brooch herself when she looked up from the task she saw cian she assumed he might have stopped for a moment on his way to retire until she saw he carried the cloak glenna and hoyt had charmed to block the killing rays of the sun she stepped away from her uncles side and up to cian you would do this she said quietly i rarely have the opportunity for a morning walk however light his words she heard what was under them im grateful youve chosen this morning to take one dawns broke riddock said the people wait she only nodded then drew up her hood as was the custom before stepping out into the early light the air was cool and misty with barely a breeze to stir the fingers of vapor through the rising curtain of it moira crossed the courtyard to the gates alone while her party fell in behind her in the muffled quiet she heard the morning birds singing and the faint whisper of the damp air she thought of her mother who had once walked this way on a cool misty morning and all the others whod walked before her out of the castle gates across the brown road over the green grass so thick with dew it was like wading through a river she knew others trailed behind her merchants and craftsmen harpers and bards mothers and daughters soldiers and sons the sky was streaked with pink in the east and the ground fog sparkled silver she smelled the river and the earth and continued up over the gentle rise with the dew dampening the hem of her gown the place of the stone stood on a faerie hill where a little glade of trees offered shelter gorse and moss grew pale yellow quiet green over the rocks near the holy well in the spring there would be the cheery orange of lilies dancing heads of columbine and later the sweet spires of foxglove all growing where they would but for now the flowers slept and the leaves of the trees had taken on that first blush of color that portended their death the sword stone itself was wide and white altarlike on an ancient dolmen of flat gray through the leaves and the mists beams of sun lanced crossing that white stone and glinting on the silver hilt of the sword buried in it her hands felt cold so very cold all of her life she had known the story how the gods had forged the sword from lightning from the sea and the earth and the wind how morrigan had brought it and the altar stone herself to this place and there she had buried it to the hilt carved the words on the stone with her fiery finger sheathed by the hand of gods freed by the hand of a mortal and so with this sword shall that hand rule geall moira paused at the base of the stones to read the words again if the gods deemed it that hand would be hers with her cloak sweeping over the dewdrenched grass she walked through sun and mist to the top of the faerie hill and took her place behind the stone for the first time she looked and she saw hundreds of people her people with their eyes on hers spread over the field down toward that brown ribbon of road every one of them if the sword came to her would be her responsibility her cold hands wanted to shake she calmed herself as she scanned the faces and waited for the trio of holy men to take their places behind her some were still coming over that last rise hurrying lest they miss the moment she wanted her breath steady when she spoke so waited a little longer and let herself meet the eyes of those she loved best my lady one of the holy men murmured yes a moment slowly she unpinned the brooch passed her cloak behind her the wide sweep of her sleeves flowed back as she lifted her arms but she didnt feel the chill against her skin she felt heat i am a servant of geall she called out i am a child of the gods i come here to this place to bow to the will of both by my blood by my heart by my spirit she took the last step toward the stone there was no sound now it seemed even the air held its breath moira reached out curled her fingers around the silver hilt and oh she thought as she felt the heat of it as she heard somewhere in her mind the murmur of its music of course aye of course its mine and always was with a whisper of steel against rock she drew it free and raised its point to the sky she knew they cheered and some of them wept she knew that to a man they lowered to one knee but her eyes were on that point and the flash of light that streaked from the sky to strike it she felt it inside her that light a burst of heat and color and strength there was a sudden burn on her arm and as if the gods etched it the symbol of the claddaugh formed there to brand her queen of geall rocked by it thrilled and humbled she looked down at her people and her eyes met cians all else seemed to melt away in that moment for a moment there was only him his face shadowed by the hood of his cloak and his eyes so brilliant and blue how could it be she wondered that she should hold her destiny in her hand and see only him how meeting his eyes like this could it be like looking deeper deeper yet into her own destiny i am a servant of geall she said unable to look away from him i am a child of the gods this sword and all it protects is mine i am moira warrior queen of geall rise and know i love you she stood as she was the sword still pointing skyward as the hands of the holy man placed the crown on her head he was no stranger to magic the black or the white but cian thought hed never seen anything more powerful her face so pale when shed removed her cloak had bloomed when her hand had taken the sword her eyes so heavy so somber had gone as brilliant as the blade and had simply sliced through him keen as a sword when theyd met his there she stood he thought slender and slight and as magnificent as any amazon suddenly regal suddenly fierce suddenly beautiful what moved inside him had no place there he stepped back turned to go hoyt laid a hand on his arm you must wait for her for the queen cian lifted a brow you forget i have no queen and ive been under this bloody cloak long enough he moved quickly he wanted to get away from the light from the smell of humanity away from the power of those gray eyes he needed the cool and the dark and the silence he was barely a league away when larkin trotted up to him moira asked me to see if you wanted a ride back im fine but thanks it was amazing wasnt it and she was well brilliant as the sun i always knew shed be the one but seeing it happen is a different matter she was queen the moment she touched the sword you could see it if she wants to stay queen have anyone to rule she better make use of that sword so she will come now cian this isnt the day for gloom and doom were entitled to a few hours of joy and celebration and feasting with another grin larkin gave cian an elbow poke she might be queen but i can promise the rest of us will eat like kings this day well an army travels on its belly do they so it was said by someone or another have your feasting and celebration tomorrow queens kings and peasants alike best be preparing for war feels like weve been doing nothing else not complaining mind he continued before cian could speak i guess the matter is im tired of preparing for it and want to get to it havent had enough fighting the last little while ive payment to make for what was nearly done to blair shes still tender along the ribs and wears down quicker than shed admit his face was hard and grim as he remembered it healing fast as she does but i wont forget how they hurt her its dangerous to go into battle with a personal agenda ah bollocks weve all of us something personal to settle or whats the point and you wont tell me that a part of you wont be going into it with what that bitch did to king in your mind and in your heart because cian couldnt deny it he left it alone are you escorting me back larkin as it happens there was some mention of me throwing myself bodily over you to shield you from the sunlight should the magic in that cloak fade out that would be fine wed both go up like torches cian said it casually but he had to admit he felt easier when he stepped into the shadow cast by castle geall im also asked to request you come to the family parlor if youre not too weary were to have a private breakfast there moira would be grateful if you could spare a few minutes at least s he would have liked a few minutes herself alone but moira was surrounded the walk back to the castle was a blur of movement and voices wrapped in mists she felt the weight of the sword in her hand the crown on her head even as she was swept along by her family and friends cheers echoed over the hills and fields a celebration of gealls new queen youll need to show yourself riddock told her from the royal terrace its expected aye but not alone i know its the way its been done she continued before her uncle could object but these are different times my circle will stand with me she looked at glenna now then hoyt and blair the people wont just see their queen but those who have been chosen to lead this war its for you to say you to do riddick said with a slight bow but on such a day geall should be free of the shadow of war until samhain has passed geall remains always in the shadow of war every geallian must know that until that day i rule with a sword and that im part of six the gods have chosen she laid a hand on his as they passed through the gates we will have feasting and celebration i value your advice as always and i will show myself and i will speak but on this day the gods have chosen both queen and warrior in me and this is what i will be this is what ill give to geall to my last breath i wont shame you he took her hand from his arm brought it to his lips my sweet girl you have and always will bring me nothing but pride and from this day to my last breath i am the queens man the servants were gathered and knelt when the royal party entered the castle she knew their names their faces some of them had served her mother before moira herself was born but it was no longer the same she wasnt the daughter of the house now but its mistress and theirs rise she said and know i am grateful for your loyalty and service know too that you and all of geall have my loyalty and service as long as i am queen later she told herself as she started up the stairs she would speak with each of them individually it was important to do so but for now there were other duties in the family parlor the fire roared flowers cut fresh from garden and hothouse spilled from vases and bowls the table was set with the finest silver and crystal with wine waiting for moiras inner circle to toast the new queen she took a breath then two trying to find the words she would say her first to those she loved best then glenna simply wrapped arms around her you were magnificent she kissed both moiras cheeks luminous the tension shed held tight in her shoulders eased i feel the same but not do you know i can only imagine nice job blair stepped up gave her a quick hug can i see it warrior to warrior moira thought and offered blair the sword excellent blair said softly good weight for you you expect it to be crusted with jewels or whatever its good that its not its good and right that its a fighting sword not just a symbol it felt as though the hilt was made for my hand as soon as i touched it it felt mine it is blair handed it back its yours for the moment moira set the sword on the table to accept hoyts embrace the power in you is warm and steady he said close to her ear geall is fortunate in its queen thank you then she let out a laugh as larkin swept her off her feet and in three dizzying circles look at you majesty you mock my dignity always but never you a stór when larkin set her back on her feet she turned to cian thank you for coming it meant a great deal to me he neither embraced nor touched her but only inclined his head it was a moment not to be missed a moment more important to me that you would come all of you she continued and started to turn when her young cousin tugged on her skirts aideen she lifted the child accepted the damp kiss and dont you look pretty today pretty aideen repeated reaching up to touch moiras jeweled crown then she turned her head with a smile both shy and sly for cian pretty she said again an astute female cian observed he saw the little girls gaze drop to the pendant he wore and in an absent gesture lifted it so that she could touch even as aideen reached out her mother all but flew across the room aideen dont sinann pulled the girl from moira gripped her tight against her belly burgeoning with her third child in the shocked silence moira could do no more than breathe her cousins name i never had a taste for children cian said coolly youll excuse me cian with one damning look toward sinann moira hurried after him please a moment ive had enough moments for the morning i want my bed i would apologize she took his arm holding firm until he stopped and turned his eyes were hard blue stone my cousin sinann shes a simple woman ill speak with her dont trouble on my account sir pale as wax sinann walked toward them i beg your pardon most sincerely i have insulted you and my queen her honored guests i ask your forgiveness for a mothers foolishness she regretted the insult cian thought but not the act the child was on the far side of the room now in her fathers arms accepted he dismissed her with barely a glance now if youll release my arm majesty a favor moira began youre racking them up and im in your debt she said evenly i need to go out onto the terrace the people need to see their queen and i feel those who are her circle if youd give me a few minutes more of your time id be grateful in the buggering sun she managed a smile and relaxed as she recognized the frustration in his tone meant hed do as she asked a few moments then you can go find some solitude with the satisfaction of knowing ill be envying you for it then make it quick id enjoy some solitude and satisfaction m oira arranged it deliberately with larkin on one side of her a figure geall loved and respected and cian on the other the stranger some of them feared having them flank her would she hoped show her people she considered them equals and that both had her trust the crowd cheered and called her name with the cheers rising to a roar when she lifted the sword it was also a deliberate gesture for her to pass that sword to blair to hold for her while she spoke the people should see that the woman larkin was betrothed to was worthy to hold it people of geall she shouted it but the cheering continued it came in waves that didnt ebb until she stepped closer to the stone rail and raised her hands people of geall i come to you as queen as citizen as protector i stand before you as did my mother as did her sire and as did all those back to the first days and i stand as part of a circle chosen by the gods not just a circle of geallian rulers but a circle of warriors now she spread her arms to encompass the five who stood with her with these who stand with me that circle is formed these are my most trusted and beloved as a citizen i ask you give them your loyalty your trust your respect as you do me as your queen i command it she had to pause every few moments until the shouts and cheers abated again today the sun shines on geall but it will not always be so what is coming seeks the dark and we will meet it we will defeat it today we celebrate we feast we give thanks come the morrow we continue our preparations for war every geallian who can bear arms will do so and we will march to ciunas we will march to the valley of silence we will flood that ground with our strength and our will and we will drown those who would destroy us in the light she held her hand out for the sword then held it high again this sword will not as it has since the first days hang cool and quiet during my reign it will flame and sing in my hand as i fight for you for geall and for all humankind the roars of approval rose like a torrent then there were screams as an arrow streaked the air before she could react cian shoved her down under the shouting and chaos she heard his low steady cursing and felt his blood warm on her hand oh god my god youre shot missed the heart he spoke through gritted teeth she saw the pain on his face as he pushed away from her to sit when he reached up to grip the arrow out of his side glenna dropped to a crouch pushed his hand aside let me see missed the heart he repeated and once again gripped the arrow he yanked it out bugger it bloody fucking hell inside glenna began briskly get him inside wait though her hand trembled a little moira gripped cians shoulder can you stand of course i can bloody stand what do you take me for please let them see you her free hand fluttered over his cheek for just an instant like a brush of wings let them see us please when she linked her fingers with his she thought she saw something stir in his eyes and felt its twin shift inside her heart then it was gone and his voice was rough with impatience give me some damn room then she got to her feet again below was chaos the man she assumed was the assassin was being kicked and pummeled by every hand or foot that could reach him hold she shouted it with all her strength i command you hold guards bring that man to the great hall people of geall you see that even on this day even when the sun shines on us this darkness seeks to destroy us and it fails she gripped cians hand lifted it high with her own it fails because there are champions in this world who would risk their lives for another she laid a hand on cians side felt his wince then held up her bloody hand he bleeds for us and by this blood he shed for me for all of you i raise him to be sir cian lord of oiche oh for christs sake cian muttered be quiet moira said it softly with steel and her eyes on the crowd chapter h alfvamp blair announced as she strode back into the parlor multiple bite scars crowd did a number on him she added a regular human would be toast after the beating he took and hes not feeling so well himself he can be treated after ive spoken to him cian requires care first blair looked over moiras shoulder to where glenna was bandaging cians side hows he doing hes angry and uncooperative so i would say hes doing well enough we can all be grateful for his reflexes you handled it blair added looking back at moira kept your cool kept control tough first day on the job nearly getting assassinated and all that but you did good not good enough to have anticipated a daylight attack to remember that not all liliths dogs require an invitation to come within these walls she thought of how cians blood had run against her hand warm and red i wont make that mistake again none of us will what we need is to get information out of this asshole lilith sent but theres a problem he either cant or wont speak english or gaelic hes mute no no he talks its just none of us can understand him sounds eastern european maybe czech i see moira glanced back at cian he was stripped to the waist with only the bandage against his skin annoyance more than pain darkened his face as he sipped from a goblet she assumed held blood though he didnt look to be in the best of moods she knew she was about to ask another favor give me a moment she murmured to blair she approached cian ordering herself not to shrink under his hot blue stare is there something more that can be done for you to make you more comfortable peace quiet privacy though each of his words had the lash of a whip she kept her own calm and pleasant im sorry but those items are in short supply right at the moment ill order them up for you as soon as i can smartass he mumbled indeed the man whose arrow you intercepted speaks in a foreign tongue your brother told me once that you knew many languages he took a long deep drink with his eyes deliberately on hers its not enough that i intercepted the arrow now you want me to interrogate your assassin i would be grateful if you would try or at least interpret if indeed his tongue is one you know there are likely a few things in the world you dont know so you may be of no use to me at all amusement flickered briefly in his eyes now youre being nasty tit for tat all right all right glenna my beauty stop hovering you lost considerable blood she began but he only lifted the goblet replacing even as we speak with a slight grimace he got to his feet i need a goddamn shirt blair moira said in even tones would you fetch cian a goddamn shirt on that youve made a habit of saving my life moira said to cian apparently im thinking of giving that up i could hardly blame you here you go champ blair offered cian a fresh white shirt i think the guys czech or possibly bulgarian can you handle either of those as it happens they went into the great hall where the assassin sat bruised bleeding and chained under heavy guard that guard included both larkin and hoyt when cian entered hoyt stepped away from his post well enough he asked cian ill do and it cheers me considerably that he looks a hell of a lot worse than i do pull your guards back he said to moira he wont be going anywhere stand down sir cian will be in charge here sir cian my ass but he only muttered it as he approached the prisoner cian circled him gauging ground the man was slight of build and dressed in what would be the rough clothes of a farmer or shepherd one eye was swollen shut the other going black and blue hed lost a couple of teeth cian snapped out a command in czech the man jolted his single working eye rolling up in surprise but he didnt speak you understood that cian continued in the same language i asked if there are others with you i wont ask again when he was met with silence cian struck out with enough force to have the prisoner slamming back against the wall along with the chair he was chained to for every thirty seconds of silence ill give you pain im not afraid of pain oh you will be cian jerked the chair and the man upright kept his face close do you know what i am i know what you are the man used his bloodied mouth to sneer traitor thats one viewpoint but the important thing to remember is that i can give you pain beyond what even such as you can stand i can keep you alive for days weeks come to that and in constant agony he lowered his voice to a hiss id enjoy it so lets begin again he didnt bother to ask the question as hed warned he wouldnt repeat it could use a spoon he said conversationally that left eye looks painful if i had a spoon handy i could scoop it right out of its socket for you of course i could use my fingers he continued when that eye wheeled wildly but then id have a mess on my hands wouldnt i do your worst the man spat out but hed begun to tremble a little ill never betray my queen bollocks the shudders and sweat told him this one would be easily and quickly broken youll not only betray her before im done with you youll do it dancing the hornpipe if i tell you to but lets just be quick and direct as weve all better things to do the mans head jerked back as cian moved but instead of going for the face as his quarry anticipated cian reached down gripped the mans cock and squeezed until there was nothing but screams theres no one else im alone im alone be sure cian only increased the pressure if you lie ill find out and then ill begin to cut this piece of you off one inch at a time she sent only me he was weeping now tears and snot running down his face only me cian eased the pressure a few fractions why the only answer was raw rough gasps and cian tightened the vise of his fingers again why one could slip through easily unnoticed un unremarked the logic of that has spared you at least for the moment from becoming a eunuch cian strolled over got himself a chair after placing it in front of the prisoner he straddled it and spoke in conversational tones even as the man whimpered now this is better isnt it civilized when were done here well see to those injuries i want water im sure you do well get you some after so for now lets talk a bit about lilith it took thirty minutes and two more sessions of pain before he was satisfied he knew all the man could tell him cian got to his feet again the wouldbe assassin was weeping uncontrollably now perhaps from the pain cian thought perhaps from the belief it was ended what were you before she took you a teacher did you have a wife a family they were no use but food i was poor and weak but the queen saw more in me she gave me strength and purpose and when she slaughters you and these ants who crawl with you ill be rewarded ill have a fine house and women of my choosing wealth and power promised you all that did she that and more you said i could have water yes i did let me explain something to you about lilith he moved behind the man whose name hed never asked and spoke quietly in his ear she lies and so do i he clamped his hands on the mans head and in one fast move broke his neck what have you done shocked to the pit of her belly moira rushed forward what have you done what needed doing she sent only one this time if it upsets your sensibilities you might want to have your guards take that out of here before i brief you you had no right no right her belly wanted to revolt as it had constantly since hed begun the torturous interrogation you murdered him what makes you any different from him that you would kill him without trial without sentence the difference coolly cian lifted his brows he was still mostly human is it so little to you life is it so little on the contrary moira hes right blair moved between them he did what had to be done how can you say that because id have done the same he was liliths dog and if hed escaped hed have tried again if he couldnt get to you hed kill whoever he could a prisoner of war moira began there are no prisoners in this blair interrupted on either side if youd locked him up youd take men out of training off patrol to guard him he was an assassin a spy sent behind lines during wartime and mostly human is generous she added with a glance at cian hed never be human again if it had been a vampire in that chair youd have staked him without thought or hesitation this isnt any different a vampire didnt leave its body broken on the floor moira thought still chained to a chair moira turned to one of the guards tynan remove the prisoners body see that its buried majesty she saw tynans quick glance at cian and recognized the steely approval in the look well go back to the parlor she continued no one has eaten you can brief us while we do l one gunman cian said and wished almost wistfully for coffee makes sense blair helped herself to eggs and a thick slice of fried ham why moira addressed the question to blair okay theyve got some halfvamps trained for combat she nodded at larkin like the ones larkin and i dealt with that day at the caves but it takes time and effort and it takes a lot of work and will to keep one in thrall and if the thrall is broken insanity blair said briefly total breakdown ive heard stories of halfvamps gnawing off their own hand to get free and back to their maker he was doomed before he came here moira murmured from the minute lilith got her hands on him yeah my take on this was it was supposed to be a quick hit suicide mission why waste more than one things go right you only need one yes one man one arrow moira considered it if hes skilled enough and fortunate enough the circle is broken geall is without a ruler only moments really after it regains one it would have been a good and efficient strike there you go but why did he wait until we were back why not try for me at the stone he didnt get there in time cian said simply he misjudged the distance he had to travel and arrived after it was done you were closed in by people on your way back and he wasnt able to get a clear shot so he joined the parade so to speak and bided his time eat something hoyt dished food onto moiras plate himself so lilith knew that moira would go to the stone today she has her ear to the ground cian confirmed whether or not shed planned to send someone to try to disrupt the ritual and the result before blair tangled with lora is debatable she was pissed he said wild according to our late unlamented archer as ive said before her relationship with lora is strange and complicated but very deep very sincere she ordered an archer chosen for this while she was still halfcrazed sent him on horseback for speed and they have only a limited number of horses and how is the little french pastry blair wondered scarred and screaming when the man left and being tended to by lilith personally more important hoyt broke in where is lora and where are the rest of them our informant while handy with a bow wasnt particularly observant or astute the best i could get puts liliths main base a few miles from the battlefield he described what seems to be a small settlement overlooked by a goodsized farm with several cottages and a large stone manor house where id say the gentry who owned the land lived shes in the manor house ballycloon larkin looked at moira saw her face was very pale her eyes very dark it must be ballycloon and the o neillss land the family we helped the day blair and i were checking the traps the day lora ambushed her they were coming from near drombeg and thats just a bit west of ballycloon we would have gone farther east to check the last trap but i was hurt blair finished we went as far as we could and lucky for us if shed already made her base when we dropped in wed have been seriously outnumbered and seriously dead cian added they moved in the night before your altercation with lora there would have been people there still or on the road it knotted larkins stomach to think of it and the o neills themselves i dont know if theyve reached safety how can we know how many we cant blair said flatly you you and cian you thought we should move everyone out force them out if necessary from all the villages and farms around the battleground burn the houses and cottages behind them so lilith and her army would have no shelter i thought it was cold and cruel of her heartless and now it cant be changed and i couldnt wouldnt moira corrected have ordered homes burned perhaps it would have been wiser and stronger to do just that but those whose homes we destroyed would have lost the heart they need to fight so its done this way she had no appetite for the food on her plate but she picked up her tea to warm her hands blair and cian know strategy as hoyt and glenna know magic but you and i larkin we know geall and its people we would have broken their hearts and their spirits theyll burn what they dont need or want cian told her aye but it wont be our hands that light the torch that will matter so we believe we know where they are do we know how many he started out with multitudes but he was lying he didnt know cian said however much lilith may use mortals she wouldnt count them in her inner circle or trust any with salient information theyre food theyre servants theyre entertainment we can look glenna spoke for the first time hoyt and i now that we have a general area can do a locator spell we should be able to get harder data some idea of the numbers we know from larkins trip to the caves and his look at their arsenal they were armed for a thousand or more well look hoyt laid his hand over glennas but what i think cian isnt saying is whatever the numbers they have whatever we have in the end theyll have more whatever weapons they have will be more lilith has had decades perhaps centuries to plan this moment weve had months and still well win cian lifted a brow at moiras statement because youre good and theyre evil no and theres nothing so simple as that you yourself are proof of that for youre neither like her nor like us but something else altogether well win because well be smarter and well be stronger and because she has no one like the six of us standing with her she turned from him to his brother hoyt you are the first of us you brought us together morrigan chose us she or fate selected us moira agreed but it was you who began the work its you who believed who had the power and the strength to forge this circle so do i believe it i rule geall but i dont rule this company nor do i no none of us do we must be as one for all our differences so we look to each other for what we need im far from the strongest warrior here and my magic is but a shadow i dont have larkins skills nor the steeliness of mind to kill in cold blood what i have is knowledge and authority so i offer those you have more glenna told her a great deal more i will have more before its done there are things i must do she got to her feet ill return to work on whatever is necessary as soon as im able pretty royal blair commented after moira left the room carrying a lot of weight with it glenna turned to hoyt agenda best to see what we can of the enemy then im thinking fire its still one of our most formidable weapons so we should charm more swords risky enough to put swords in some of the hands were training blair put in much less flaming ones youd be right hoyt considered nodded it will be up to us then wont it to decide wholl be what is it issued that sort of weapon good men should be placed in positions as close to liliths base as we can manage theyd need shelter thats safe after sunset its barracks youre meaning there are cottages and cabins of course larkin narrowed his eyes in thought other shelters can be built in the daylight hours if need be theres an inn as well between her base and the next settlement why dont we go take a look blair shoved her plate aside you and glenna can look your way and larkin and i can do a flyby you up for the dragon i am he smiled at her especially when youre doing the riding sex sex sex the guys a machine on that note cian said dryly im going to bed with a quick squeeze of glennas hand hoyt murmured a moment then followed his brother i need a word with you cian flicked him a glance ive had my quota of words this morning youll have to swallow a few more my rooms are closer if you would id prefer this private since youd just dog me to my room and pester me until i want to rip your tongue out your rooms will do servants bustled on the route between the parlor and bedchambers preparations for the feasting cian thought and wondered if it was hoyts talk of fire that put him in mind of nero and his fiddle hoyt stepped into a chamber then immediately threw out an arm to block cian from entering the sun was all he said then moved quickly to pull the coverings over the windows the room plunged into gloom without thinking hoyt gestured toward a brace of candles they flared into light handy bit of business that cian commented im out of practice lighting tinderboxes its a basic skill and one youd have yourself if youd ever put your mind and time into honing your power too tedious is that whiskey cian moved straight to a decanter and poured oh such sobriety and disapproval he read his brothers expression clearly as he took the first warm sip ill remind you that its the end of my day well past it come to that he glanced around began to wander smells female women like glenna always leave something of themselves behind to remind a man then he dropped down into a chair slouching stretching out his legs now what is it youre bound and determined to bore me with there was a time you enjoyed even sought my company cians shoulders moved in something too lazy to be called a shrug i suppose that means nine hundred years of absence doesnt make the heart grow fonder regret showed on hoyts face before he turned away to add turf to the fire are you and i to be at odds again you tell me i wanted to speak with you alone about what you did with the prisoner more humanity heard from yes yes i should have patted his head so he could stand trial or before the tribunal whatever goes for the name of justice in this place i shouldve invoked the sodding geneva convention well bollocks i dont know this convention but there could be no trial no tribunal on such a matter at such a time thats what im saying you great irritating idiot you executed an assassin as i would have done but with more tact and well stealth ah so youd have slithered down to whatever cage they put him in and put a knife between his ribs cian raised his eyebrows thats all right then its not none of its all right its a bloody nightmare is what it is and were all having it im saying you did the necessary and that for his trying to kill moira whom i love as i did my own sisters and for putting an arrow in you id have done for him ive never killed a man for these things weve ended these past weeks havent been men but demon but id have killed this one if you hadnt been there ahead of me hoyt paused caught his breath if not his composure i wanted to say as much to you so youd know my feelings on it but it seems i waste both our time as you couldnt give a damn in hell what my feelings are cian didnt move his only change was to shift his gaze from his brothers furious face down to the whiskey in his hand i do as it happens give several damns in hell what your feelings are i wish i didnt youve stirred things in me id calmed too long ago to remember youve slapped family in my face hoyt when id buried it crossing over hoyt took the chair that faced his brothers youre mine now when cian lifted his eyes to his brothers they were empty im no ones maybe you werent from the time you died until the time i found you but its no longer true so if you give those damns im saying to you im proud of what youre doing im saying i know its harder for you to do this thing than any of us obviously as demonstrated killing vampires or humans isnt difficult for me do you think i dont see how some of the servants melt away when youre near that i didnt see sinann rush to take her child as if you might have snapped its neck as you did the assassins these insults to you dont go unnoticed some arent insulted to be feared it doesnt matter it doesnt he insisted when hoyts face closed up this is a fingersnap of time for me less when its done unless i get a lucky stake through the heart ill go my way i hope your way will bring you from time to time to see me and glenna it may i like to look at her cians grin spread slow and easy and who knows she may eventually come to her senses and realize she chose the wrong brother ive nothing but time shes mad for me his tone easy again hoyt reached over took cians glass of whiskey and had a sip himself mad is what shed have to be to put her lot in with you but women are odd creatures youre fortunate in her hoyt if ive failed to mention it before shes the magic now he passed the glass back id have none that mattered without her my world turned when she came into it i wish you had that isnt written in the book of fate for me the poets may say loves eternal but i can tell you its a different matter when youve got eternity and the woman doesnt have you ever loved a woman cian studied his whiskey again and thought of the centuries not in the way you mean not in the way you have with glenna but ive cared enough to know its not a choice i can make love is a choice everything is cian tossed back the last of the whiskey then set the empty glass aside now i choose to go to bed you chose to take that arrow for moira today hoyt said as cian started for the door cian stopped and when he turned his eyes were wary i did i find that a very human sort of choice do you and the words were a shrug i find it merely an impulsive and painful one he slipped out to make his way to his own room on the northern side of the castle impulse he thought again and he could admit to himself an instant of raw fear if hed seen the arrow fly a second later or moved with a fraction less speed shed be dead and in that instant of impulse and fear hed seen her dead the arrow still quivering as it pierced her flesh the blood spilling the life out of her onto her dark green gown and the hard gray stones he feared that feared the end of her where she would be beyond him where she would go to a place he couldnt see or touch lilith would have taken one last thing from him with that arrow one last thing he could never regain for hed lied to his brother he had loved a woman despite his best or worst intentions he loved the newcrowned queen of geall which was ridiculous and impossible and in time something hed get over a decade or two and hed no longer remember the exact shade of those long gray eyes that quiet scent she carried would no longer tease his senses hed forget the sound of her voice the look of that slow serious smile such things faded he reminded himself you had only to allow it he stepped into his own room closed and bolted the door the windows were covered and no light was lit moira he knew had given very specific orders on how his housekeeping should be done just as shed specifically chosen that room a distance from the others as it faced north less sunlight he mused a considerate hostess he undressed in the dark thought fleetingly of the music he liked to play before sleep or on wakening music he thought that filled the silence but this time and place didnt run to cd players or cable radio or any damn thing of the sort naked he stretched out in bed and in the absolute dark the absolute silence willed himself to sleep chapter m oira stole the time she escaped from her women from her uncle from her duties she was already guilty already worried shed be a failure as a queen because she so craved her solitude she would have bartered two days food or two nights sleep for a single hour alone with her books selfish she told herself as she hurried away from the noise the people the questions selfish to wish for her own comfort when so much was at stake but while she wouldnt indulge herself with books in some sunny corner she would take the time to make this visit on this day she was made queen she wanted and she needed her mother so hiking up her skirts she went as fast as she was able down the hill then through the little gap in the stone wall that bordered the graveyard almost instantly she felt quieter of heart she went first to the stone shed ordered carved and set when shed returned to geall shed set one herself for king in ireland in the graveyard of cian and hoyts ancestors but shed vowed to have one done here in honor of a friend after laying a handful of flowers on the ground she stood and read the words shed ordered carved in the polished stone king this brave warrior lies not here but in a faraway land he gave his life for geall and all humankind i hope you would like it the stone and the words it seems so long ago since i saw you it all seems so long and still hardly more than a hand clap im sorry to tell you cian was hurt today for my sake but hes doing well enough last night we spoke almost as friends cian and i and today well not altogether friendly its hard to know she laid a hand on the stone im queen now thats hard to know as well i hope you dont mind i put this monument here where my family lies for to me thats what you were for the short time we had you were family i hope youre resting now she stepped away then hurriedly back again oh i meant to say im keeping my left up as you taught me by his grave she lifted her arms in a boxing stance so for all the times i dont get a fist in my face thank you with the rest of the flowers in the crook of her arm she picked her way through the long grass the stones to the graves of her parents she laid flowers at the base of her fathers stone sir i hardly remember you and i think the memories most of them that i have are ones mother passed to me she loved you so and would speak of you often i know you were a good man for she wouldnt have loved you otherwise and all who speak of you say you were strong and kind and quick to laugh i wish i could remember the sound of that of your laugh she looked over the stones now to the hills the distant mountains ive learned you didnt die as we always thought but were murdered you and your young brother murdered by the demons who are even now in geall preparing for war im all thats left of you and i hope its enough she knelt now between the graves to lay the rest of the flowers over her mother i miss you every day i had to go far away as you know to come back stronger mathair she closed her eyes on the word and on the image it brought to her clear as life i didnt stop what was done to you and still i see that night as if behind a mist those that killed you have been punished one by my own hand it was all i could do for you all i can do is fight and lead my people to fight some of them to their death i wear the sword and the crown of geall i will not diminish it she sat awhile with just the sound of the breeze through the tall grass and the shifting lights of the sun when she rose turned toward the castle she saw the goddess morrigan standing at the stone wall the god wore blue today soft and pale and trimmed in deeper tones the fire of her hair was unbound to lay flaming over her shoulders her hands empty of flowers her heart heavy moira walked through the grass to meet her my lady majesty puzzled by morrigans bow moira clasped her hands together to keep them still do gods acknowledge queens of course we made this place and deemed those of your blood would rule and serve it were pleased with you daughter laying her hands lightly on moiras shoulders she kissed both her cheeks our blessings on you i would rather you bless my people and keep them safe that is for you the sword is out of its scabbard even when it was forged it was known that one day it would sing in battle that too is for you shes already spilled geallian blood morrigans eyes were as deep and calm as a lake my child the blood lilith has spilled would make an ocean and my parents are only drops in that sea every drop is precious and every drop serves a purpose do you lift the sword only for your own blood no shifting moira gestured theres another stone here standing for a friend i lift the sword for him and his world and for all the worlds were all a part of each other knowing this is important knowledge is a great gift and the thirst to seek it even greater use what you know and she will never defeat you head and heart moira you are not made to give greater weight to one than the other your sword will flame i promise you and your crown will shine but what you hold inside your head and your heart is the true power it seems theyre full of fear theres no courage without fear trust and know and keep your sword at your side its your death she wants most mine why she doesnt know knowledge is your power my lady moira began but the god was gone t he feast required yet another gown and another hour of being fussed over with so much on her hands shed left the matter of wardrobe to her aunt and was pleased to find the gown beautiful and the watery blue color flattering she enjoyed pretty gowns and taking a bit of time to look her best but it seemed she was being laced into a new one every time she turned around and subjected to the chirping and buzzing of her women half the day she could admit she missed the freedom of the jeans and roomy shirts shed worn in ireland beginning the next day however it shocked the women she would dress as best suited a warrior preparing for battle but for tonight shed wear the velvets and silks and jewels ceara how are your children well my lady and thank you standing behind moira ceara continued to work moiras thick hair into silky braids your duties and your training keep you from them more than i would wish their eyes met in the mirror moira knew ceara to be a sensible woman the most centered in her opinion of the three that waited on her my mother tends them and is happy to do so the time i take now is well spent id rather lose these hours with them than see them harmed glenna tells me youre very fierce in handtohand i am cearas face tightened with a grim smile im not skilled with a sword but theres time yet glennas a good teacher strict dervil piped in not as strict as the lady blair but demanding all the same we run every day and fight and tumble and carve stakes and end each day with weary legs bruises and splinters better to be weary and bruised than dead at moiras flat comment dervil flushed i meant no disrespect majesty ive learned a great deal and are im told becoming a demon with a sword im proud and you isleen are said to have a good hand with a bow i do isleen the youngest of the three flushed with the compliment i like it better than the fighting with fists and feet ceara always knocks me down when you squeal like a mouse and flutter your hands anyone could knock you down ceara pointed out cearas taller and her arms longer than yours isleen so moira said you have to learn to be faster and sneakier im proud of all of you for every bruise tomorrow and every day after for no less than an hour each day ill be training with you but majesty dervil began you cant i can moira interrupted and i will ill expect each of you and the other women to do their best to knock me down it wont be easy she stood when ceara stepped back ive learned a great deal as well she lifted her crown placed it on her head believe me when i tell you i can knock the three of you and any else who comes on your arse she turned resplendent in shimmering blue velvet any who puts me on mine or bests me with bare hands or any weapon will be given one of the silver crosses glenna and hoyt has charmed this is my best gift tell the others i t was cian thought like walking into a play the great hall was the stage and festooned with banners enlivened with flowers blazing with candles and firelight knights and lords and ladies were decked in their very best doublets and gowns jewels and gold he spotted several men and women sporting footwear with the long and pointed upturned toes that he recalled were fashionable when hed been alive so he thought even regrettable styles spanned worlds food and drink were so plentiful he imagined the long tables groaned under the platters and pitchers there was music bright and lively from a harper the talk he overheard ran the gamut fashion politics sexual gossip flirtations and finance not so different altogether he mused from his own nightclub back in new york the women wore less there of course and the music was louder but the core of it hadnt changed overmuch through the centuries people still liked to gather together over food and drink and music he thought of his club again and asked himself if he missed it the nightly surge the sounds the press of people and realized he didnt not in the least very likely he decided hed been growing bored and restless and would have moved on shortly in any case it had only taken his brothers sweep through time and space having hoyt land more or less on his doorstep to up the timetable but without hoyt and his mission from the gods moving out would have meant a change of name and location a shifting of funds complicated timeconsuming and interesting cian had had more than a hundred names and a hundred homes and still found the forming of them interesting where might he have gone he wondered sydney perhaps or rio it might have been rome or helsinki it was only a matter essentially of sticking a pin in a map there were few places he hadnt been already and none he couldnt have made his base if he chose in his world in any case geall was a different matter hed lived through this sort of fashion and culture once and had no desire to repeat himself his family had been gentry and so hed attended his share of highflown feasts all in all hed have preferred a snifter of brandy and a good book he didnt intend to stay long and had come only because he knew someone would come looking for him while he was confident he could have avoided whoever had come hunting him he would never avoid the haranguing hoyt would subject him to the next day easier altogether to put in an appearance toast the new queen then slip away he had drawn the line at wearing the formal doublet and accessories that had been delivered to his room he might have been stuck in a medieval timeline but hed be damned if hed dress for it so he wore black pants and sweater he hadnt packed a suit and tie for this particular journey still he smiled with some warmth at glenna who drifted up to him in emerald green in what he thought had been termed a robe deguisee at one time very formal very elegant and showcasing her very lovely breasts with its low and rounded neckline now heres a vision i prefer to any goddess i almost feel like one she spread her arms so the full bell sleeves swayed heavy though it must be ten pounds of material i see you went for a less weighty ensemble i believe id stake myself before i squeezed into one of those getups again she had to laugh cant blame you but im getting a kick out of seeing hoyt all done up for me maybe for you after all this time its like a costume ball moira chose regal black and gold for the house sorcerer it suits him as your more contemporary choice does you still this whole day has been like a very strange dream i was thinking a very strange play yeah that works whatever tonights feasting is a short and colorful respite we managed to do some scouting today hoyt and i magically larkin and blair with the flyover well fill you in when she broke off at the sound of trumpets moira made her entrance the train of her gown flowing behind her her crown flaming in the light of a hundred candles she glowed as queens should as women could as his unbeating heart tightened in his chest cian thought bloody buggering hell he had no choice but to join the others at the high table for the feast leaving beforehand would have been an overt insult not that he minded that overmuch but it would have drawn attention so he was stuck again moira sat at the center of the table flanked by larkin and her uncle cian at least had blair beside him who was both an informative and entertaining companion lilith hasnt burned anything yet which was a surprise she began probably too busy nursing fifi oh question the french bitch has been around about four hundred years right and you more than double that how come both of you still have accents and why is it americans believe everyone should speak as they do good point is this venison i think its venison she took a bite its not too bad she wore siren red which left a portion of her strong shoulders bared her short cap of hair was unadorned but there were ornate gold medallions nearly big as a babys fist dangling from her ears how do you hold your head up with those earrings suffering for fashion she said easily so theyve got horses she continued a couple of dozen in various paddocks might be more stabled i figure why not have larkin put down and we could run the horses off just make a nuisance of ourselves maybe if i can talk him into it light a few fires vamps stay inside they burn come out they burn good thinking unless of course she had guards posted inside with bows well yeah like i didnt think of that i figure ill wing a few flaming arrows down get their attention i pick my target cottage nearest the biggest paddock gotta be some troops in there stands to reason imagine my surprise and chagrin when the arrows bump off the air like it was a wall his eyes narrowed as he shifted to face her are you talking force field what is this bloody star trek thats what i said in tune with him blair punched his shoulder shes got that wizard of hers that midir working overtime by my guess and their base camps in a protective bubble larkin flew down to get a closer look and we both got a jolt like an electric shock pisser yes it would be then the man himself comes out from the big house the manor house creepylooking guy let me say flying black robes lots of silver hair he just stands there so were looking down at him hes looking up at us finally i get it mexican standoff we cant get anything through but neither can they when the shields up theyre locked down were locked out good as a freaking fortress better she knows how to make the best use of the people she brings in cian mused looks that way so i was lowered to making rude gestures just so it wasnt a waste of time shed lower the shield at night wouldnt she possibly even if they brought enough food with them the nature of the beast is to hunt she wouldnt want her troops to get stale or too edgy so maybe we can make a night run at it i dont know something to think about thats haggis isnt it she wrinkled her nose im skipping that she leaned a little closer to him lowered her voice larkin says the words gone out on how you dealt with the guy who tried to kill moira youve got the castle guards and the knights behind you on that one it hardly matters you know better than that you get whats essentially going to be this armys first line not just accepting you but respecting you it matters sir cian he winced visibly just dont kind of rings for me this jello sort of thing is a little gritty do you know what it is cian waited deliberately until shed taken a second bite jellied internal organs likely pig when she choked the laugh just rolled out of him it was such a strange sound moira thought to hear him laugh strange a little wicked and very appealing shed made a misstep with the clothes shed sent for him he was too much a creature of his own time or what had come to be his own time to put on garb from hers but hed come and she hadnt been sure he would not that hed spoken a word to her not a single word hed killed for her she thought but didnt speak to her so she would put him out of her mind as hed so obviously put her out of his she only wished the evening would end she wanted her bed she wanted sleep she wanted to peel off the heavy velvet and slide blissfully for one night into the dark but she had to make a show of eating despite her lack of appetite she had to make a pretense at least of paying attention to conversations even though her eyes wanted to close shed had too much wine felt too warm and there were hours yet before she could lay down her head of course she had to stop to smile and to drink every time one of the knights was moved to toast her at the rate they were moving her head would likely spin right off the pillow it was with huge relief that she was finally able to announce the dancing could begin she had to stand for the first set as it was expected of her and found she felt better for moving for the music he didnt dance of course but only sat like a dyspeptic king she thought foolishly irritated because shed wanted to dance with him his hands on her hands his eyes on her eyes but there he sat gazing down on the masses and sipping his wine she spun with larkin bowed to her uncle clasped hands with hoyt and when she looked back again cian was gone h e wanted air and more he wanted the night the night was still his time what lived inside the mask of a man would always crave it and always seek it he went up and out where the dark was thick and the music from the hall only a silvery echo clouds had rolled over the moon and the stars were smothered by them rain would come before morning he could already smell it below there were torches to light the courtyards and guards stood at post at the gates on the walls he heard one of them cough and spit and the quick flap of the flags overhead in a sudden kick of wind he could hear if he tuned himself to it the rustle of mice in their nest tucked in a gap of the stones or the papery swish of the wings of a bat that circled overhead he could hear what others didnt he scented human that salt on the flesh and the rich run of blood beneath it there was a part of him always that burned a little with the need to hunt to kill to feed that burst of blood in the mouth in the throat the sheer life of it that could never be tasted in what came in cool packs of plastic hot he remembered always hot that first taste it heated all the places that were cold and dead and for that moment life or its shadow stirred inside that cold and that dead it was good to remember now and then the unspeakable pleasure of it good to remember what he pit his will against vital to remember what it was those they fought craved the humans did not could not not even blair who understood more than most still they would fight and they would die more would come behind them to fight and to die some would run of course some always did some would break with fear and simply stand and be slaughtered like rabbits caught in a jacklight but most wouldnt run wouldnt hide wouldnt freeze in terror in all the years hed watched humans live and die he knew when their backs were pressed hardest to the wall they fought like demons if they won they would end up romanticizing the whole business songs and stories old men would sit by fires years from now and speak of the glory days while they showed their scars and others of them would wake in cold sweats from reliving the horror of war in their dreams if he lived what would it be for him he wondered glory days or nightmares neither he thought for he wasnt human enough to spend his time on what was over and done if lilith managed to end him well true death was an experience hed yet to have it might be interesting and because he heard what others didnt he caught the footsteps on the stone stairs moiras footsteps as he knew her gait as well as her scent he nearly melted back into the shadows then cursed himself for being a coward she was only a woman only a human she could and would be nothing more to him when she stepped out he heard her sigh once long and deep as if shed just shed some enormous weight she moved to the stone rail tipped her head back closed her eyes and breathed her face was flushed from the heat of the fire the exertion of the dance but there were shadows of fatigue haunting her eyes someone had worked slender braids through her long hair so the weaving of them with their thin ropes of gold rippled through the rain of glossy brown he saw the minute she sensed she wasnt alone the sudden stiffening in her shoulders and the slide of her hand into the folds of her gown if youve a stake tucked in there he said id as soon you didnt point it in my direction though her shoulders didnt relax her hand dropped to her side as she turned i didnt see you i wanted some air its so warm inside and ive drunk too much more that you didnt eat enough ill leave you to your air oh stay im only taking a moment then you can have the damned air to yourself again she pushed at her hair then cocked her head he got a good look at her face now her eyes and thought yes indeed the little queen was on the way to being plowed do you come out here to think deep thoughts i cant decide if deep thoughts require space like this or are better turned over in confines i imagine you have many thoughts with all that youve seen she stumbled a little laughed a little when he caught her arm and immediately released it youre so careful not to touch me she commented unless youre saving me from death or injury or bashing at me in training i find that interesting youre a man of interests how do you find it i dont except for that one time she continued as if he hadnt spoken and moved a step closer that one time you touched me good and proper you put your hands on me then and your mouth ive wondered about that he very nearly took a step in retreat and the realization of it mortified him it was meant to teach you a lesson im a scholar and i do love my lessons give me another then the wines made you foolish he was annoyed with the stiff and pompous sound of his own voice you should go in have your ladies take you to your bed it has made me foolish ill be sorry for it tomorrow but well thats tomorrow isnt it oh what a day this has been for me she did a slow turn that had her skirts swaying over the stones was it only this morning i walked to the stone how could it be only this morning i feel ive carried that sword and the stone with it through this day now im setting them down until tomorrow im setting them down im the worse for drink and what of it she stepped closer yet and pride wouldnt let him back away id hoped youd dance with me tonight i hoped and i wondered what it would be like to have you touch me when it wasnt in a fight or out of manners or mistake i wasnt in the mood for dancing oh and youre full of moods you are she watched his face carefully studying him he thought as she might the pages of a book and sure so am i i was in an angry mood when you kissed me before and a little frightened around it im not angry or frightened now but i think you are now youre adding ridiculous to foolish prove it then she closed that last bit of distance tipped up her face to his teach me a lesson he could hardly be damned for it hed been damned long before he wasnt gentle he wasnt tender but yanked her against him and nearly off her feet before his mouth swooped down to plunder hers he tasted the wine and the warmth and a recklessness he hadnt anticipated that he knew was his mistake she was ready for him this time her hands were in his hair her mouth open and avid she didnt melt against him in surrender or shudder from the onslaught she strained for more need clawed at him one more demon sent to torture him she wondered the air between them didnt smoke wondered how it was both of them didnt simply erupt into flame this was fire in the blood in the bone how had she lived all of her life without it even when he released her pushed her back it stayed inside her like a fever did you feel that her whisper was full of wonder did you feel that the taste of her was inside him now and everything in him craved more of her so he didnt answer didnt speak at all he slipped into the dark and was gone before she could take another breath chapter s he awoke early and energized all through the day before shed dragged such weight with her as if it had been shackled to her leg now that chain was broken it didnt matter that rain poured out of moody gray skies that smothered even a hint of sun she had the light inside her again she dressed in what she thought of as her irish clothes jeans and a sweatshirt the time for ceremony and decorum was past and sensibilities be damned until she could spend time soothing them again she might be a queen she thought as she twisted her hair into a long single braid but she would be a working one she would be a warrior she laced on her boots strapped on her sword this woman moira saw in the looking glass she recognized and approved of she was a woman with purpose and power and knowledge turning she studied the room the queens chamber she thought once her mothers sanctuary and now hers the bed was wide and beautifully draped in deep blue velvet and frothy snowwhite lace for her mother had loved the soft and the pretty the posts were thick polished geallian oak and deeply carved with gealls symbols paintings that graced the walls were also of geall its fields and hills and forests on a table near the bed stood a small portrait in a silver frame moiras father had watched over her mother every night now he would watch over his daughter she glanced over toward the doors that led to her mothers balcony the drapes were still pulled tight there and she would leave them that way at least for now she wasnt ready to open those doors to step out on the stones where her mother had been slaughtered instead she would remember the happy hours shed spent with her mother in this chamber she went out making her way to the door of hoyt and glennas chamber where she knocked because it took several moments she remembered the hour shed nearly stepped away again hoping they hadnt heard her knock when the door opened hoyt was still pulling on his robes his long dark hair was tousled and his eyes heavy with sleep oh i beg your pardon she began i didnt think has something happened is something wrong no no nothing i didnt think how early it was please go back to your bed what is it glenna moved into view behind him moira is there a problem only with my manners i was up and about early and wasnt considering others would still be abed especially after last nights festivities its all right glenna laid a hand on hoyts arm signaling him to step aside what did you need only a private word with you the truth of the matter is i was going to ask if youd have breakfast with me in my mothers in my sitting room so i could speak with you about something give me ten minutes are you certain i dont mind waiting until later in the day ten minutes glenna repeated thank you ill see foods prepared she looks ready for something hoyt commented when glenna went to the bowl and basin to wash or other glenna dipped her fingers into the water focused she might not be able to take a shower but shed be damned if shed wash in cold water she did the best she could with what she had as hoyt beefed up the fire then giving into vanity she did a subtle glamour it might be she just wants to talk about todays training schedule glenna fixed on earrings shed have to remember to take off for training i told you shes offered a prize one of our crosses to any of the women who takes her down in a match today it was clever of her to offer a prize but i wonder if it would be the best use of the cross there were nine of them glenna reminded him as she dressed five for us and kings of course making six the two we agreed to give to larkins mother and pregnant sister theres a purpose for the ninth this may be it well see what the day brings he smiled as she pulled a gray sweater over her head how is it a ghrá that you look lovelier every morning youve got love in your eyes she turned into his arms when he moved to her and looked wistfully at the bed rainy morning itd be nice to snuggle in for an hour and have my way with you she tipped her head up for a kiss but it looks like im having breakfast with the queen moira was as was her habit sitting by the fire with a book when glenna entered moira looked up smiled sheepishly shame on me taking you from your husband and your warm bed at such an hour queens privilege with a laugh moira gestured to a chair the food will be along one day if the seeds i brought and potted thrive ill be able to have the orange juice in the mornings i miss the taste of it id kill for coffee glenna admitted then again in a way i am for coffee apple pie tivo and all things human she sat and studied moira you look good she decided rested and as hoyt said ready i am yesterday there was so much inside my head and my heart so it was all so very heavy the sword and the crown were my mothers and only mine now because shes dead and youve had no time to grieve not really i havent no still i know she would want me to do as i have for geall for all and not close myself off somewhere to mourn for her and i had fear as well what manner of queen would i be and at such a time with some satisfaction moira looked down at her rough pants and boots well i know what manner of queen ill try to be strong even fierce theres no time to sit on a throne and debate matters politics and protocol theyll have to wait wont they weve had our ceremony and our celebration and they were needed but now its time for the dirt and the sweat of it she got to her feet when the food was brought in she spoke to the young boy still sleepy around the edges and the serving girl who was with him spoke easily glenna noted called them both by name as the food and dishes were laid out and while they both looked puzzled by their queens choice of dress moira ignored it dismissing them with thanks and orders she and her guest not be disturbed when they sat together glenna noticed that moira whod picked at her food for days ate with an appetite to rival larkins itll be muddy and miserable for training today moira began and thats good im thinking good discipline i wanted to say that while ill be participating and likely every day now you and blair are still in charge of the thing i want everyone to see that im training just like the rest that ill get dirty and bruised sounds like youre looking forward to it by the gods i am moira scooped up eggs shed coached the cooks to prepare as glenna often had scrambled up with chunks of ham and onion right in them do you remember when larkin and i first came through the dance to ireland i could plant an arrow anywhere i liked nine of ten but any one of you could plant me on my arse without half trying you always got up aye i always got up but im not so easy to plant these days thats something i want everyone to see as well you showed them a warrior when you fought and killed the vampire i did now ill show them a soldier who takes her lumps and theres more i want of you i thought there was glenna poured them both more tea spill it ive never explored the magic i have it isnt much of a thing as youve seen yourself a bit of a healing gift and a kind of power that can be opened and reached by others with more as you and hoyt have done dreams ive studied dreams read books on their meanings and books on magic itself of course but it seemed to me there was no real purpose for what i had other than to offer some ease to someone in pain or a way of knowing which direction to take to find a buck when hunting little things small matters and now and now moira said with a nod i think theres a purpose and theres a need i think i need all i have all i am the more i know whats in me the better i use it when i touched the sword when i put my hand on its hilt it poured into me the knowing that it was mine had always been mine and a power with it like a strong wind just blowing into me more through me i think do you know exactly nodding again moira continued to eat ive neglected this because it wasnt a particular interest i wanted to read and to study to hunt with larkin to ride to do the things a young woman enjoys glenna interrupted why shouldnt you have done what you liked to do you didnt know what was coming i didnt no i wonder if id looked deeper if i might have you couldnt have saved your mother moira glenna said gently moira looked up her eyes very clear you see my thoughts so easily i think because in your place id have the same ones you couldnt have saved her more werent meant to moira finished im coming around to that inside my heart but if id explored what i have i might have seen something of what was coming for whatever difference it would have made like blair ive seen the battleground in dreams but unlike her i didnt face it i turned away thats done too im not wait she searched for the phrase beating myself up right yeah thats right im not beating myself up over it im after changing it so im asking if you can make the time to help me hone whatever i might have the way ive honed my fighting skills i can id love to im grateful dont be grateful yet itll be work magics an art and a craft and a gift but comparing it to your physical training isnt far off its also well like a muscle glenna tapped a hand on her biceps you have to exercise it and build it like medicine its said we practice magic so its never done every weapon i take into battle is another strike against the enemy brows lifted moira flexed her arm so ill build that muscle as i have this one strong as i can i want to crush her glenna more than defeat her to crush her for so many reasons my parents king cian she added after a pause hed dislike that wouldnt he knowing i think of him as a victim he doesnt see himself that way he doesnt refuses to its why he thrives in his way hes made his i cant say peace as hes not a peaceful sort is he but hes accepted his lot i suppose in some sort of way hes embraced it id say you have his number as much as any could moira hesitated now making a business of rearranging the food left on her plate he kissed me again oh oh and after a pause oh i made him not to belittle your charm or powers i dont think anyone can make cian do much of anything he doesnt want to do could be he wanted to but he wasnt going to until i pushed him into it id had a bit to drink hmm i wasnt the worse for it moira said with a laugh that had some nerves at the edges not really just a little looser in my manners so to speak and more determined in my mind i wanted air and some quiet so i went up out on one of the battlements there he was she pictured it again he might have gone anywhere and sure i could have gone somewhere else but neither of us did so we both ended up in the same place at the same time in the night she said quietly with the music and the lights barely reaching us romantic i suppose it was with the rain that would come before dawn just beginning to scent the air and the thin slice of moon very white against the sky theres a mystery to him i keep wanting to pick at until i find the pieces of it you wouldnt be human if you didnt find him fascinating glenna said they both knew what she hadnt said he wasnt he wasnt human he was being all stiff the way he can be with me and it was irritating and well ill admit challenging at the same time it comes in me sometimes when im with him the way knowledge does or magic something rising she pressed a hand to her belly then drew it upward toward her heart just pulling up from the center of me i never had strong feelings in this way for a man little flutters of them you know comfortable and interesting but not strong and hot theres something about him that compels me hes so sexy glenna finished at the outrageous level i wanted to know if it would be like it had been the other time the only time when wed both been so angry and hed taken hold of me i told him to do it again and wouldnt take no for an answer she cocked her head now as if puzzling it out do you know i think i made him nervous seeing him flustered a bit and trying not to be that was as intoxicating to me as the wine had been god yes on a long breath glenna picked up her tea it would be and when he kissed me it was like the other time only more because i was waiting for it for that moment he was as much caught as i was i knew it what are you looking for from him moira i dont know perhaps just that heat just that power that pleasure is it wrong i cant say but it worried her hed never be able to give you more you have to understand that he wouldnt stay here and even if he did for a time you could never have a life with him youre stepping onto dangerous ground every day from now till samhain is dangerous ground i know what youre saying is good solid sense but still in my mind and heart i want i need to let them both settle a bit before i know what should be done about it next but i do know that i dont want to go into battle stepping back from this only because im afraid of what it could be or what it couldnt after a moments debate glenna sighed it may be good solid sense but i very much doubt id take my own advice if i were in your place reaching over moira took glennas hand it helps being able to talk to another woman just to be able to say whats in my mind and heart to another woman i n another part of geall in a house shrouded against even the weak and watery light two other females sat and talked it was the end of their day not the beginning but they shared a quiet meal quiet because the man they were draining was beyond protest or struggle you were right lora leaned back delicately dabbing blood from her lips with a linen cloth the man had been chained to the table between them as lilith wanted her injured companion to sit to eat rather than lie in bed and sip from cups getting up having a civilized kill was what i needed there you see pleased lilith smiled loras face was still badly burned the holy water that bitch of a demon hunter had hurled at her had wreaked terrible damage but lora was healing and the good fresh meal would help her get her strength back i wish youd eat a little more though i will youve been so good to me lilith and i failed you you didnt it was a good plan and nearly worked its you who paid such a high price for it i cant stand to think of the pain you were in i would have died without you they had been lovers and friends competitors and adversaries they had been everything to each other for four centuries but loras injuries the near end of her had brought them closer than theyd ever been until you were hurt i didnt know how much i loved and needed you here now sweetheart just a little more lora obeyed taking the mans limp arm sinking her fangs into the wrist before the burns shed been pretty a youthful blonde with a swaggering style now her face was raw and red riddled with halfhealed wounds but the glassy glaze of pain had faded from her blue eyes and her voice was coming back strong again it was wonderful lilith she sat back again but i just cant drink another drop then ill have it taken away and well sit by the fire for a bit before bed lilith rang a little gold bell signaling one of the servants to clear the leftovers she knew would hardly go to waste she rose to help lora across the room where shed already had pillows and a throw placed on the sofa more comfortable than the caves lilith commented but still ill be glad to be out of this place and into proper accommodations she settled lora before she sat regal in her red gown her hair piled high and gold as shed wanted to add a touch of glamour to the evening her beauty hadnt diminished in the two thousand years since her death do you have pain she asked lora no i feel almost myself im sorry i behaved so childishly yesterday morning when that bitch flew over on her ridiculous dragonman seeing her again just brought it all flooding back all the fear the agony we gave her a surprise though didnt we soothing lilith smoothed the throw tucking it around lora imagine her shock when her arrows met midirs shield you were right to talk me out of killing him the next time i see her i wont weep and hide under the covers like a frightened child the next time i see her she dies by my hand i swear it do you still have a yearning to change her for a playmate id never give that whore such a gift loras mouth tightened on a snarl shell get only death from me then with a sigh lora laid her head on liliths shoulder she would never have been what you are to me i thought to have a bit of fun with her and i thought shed be entertaining for both of us in bed all that energy and violence inside her was so appealing but i could never have loved her as i love you she tilted her head up now so their lips met in a long soft kiss im yours lilith eternally my sweet girl lilith pressed another kiss to loras temple do you know when i first saw you sitting alone on the dark damp streets of paris weeping i knew youd belong to me i thought i loved a man lora murmured and he loved me but he used me spurned me tossed me aside for another i thought my heart was broken then you were there do you remember what i said to you i will never forget you said my sweet sad girl are you all alone i told you my life was over that i would be dead of grief by morning lilith laughed stroked loras hair so dramatic how could i resist you or i you you were so beautiful like the queen you are you wore red as you do tonight and your hair so bright all curls you took me to your house and fed me bread and wine and listened to my sad tale and dried my tears so young and charming you were so sure this man who had cast you aside was all you could ever want i dont remember his name now or his face you came so willingly into my arms lilith murmured i asked if you would wish to stay young and lovely forever if you would wish to have power over men like the one who hurt you you said yes and yes again even when i tasted you you held tight to me and said again yes and yes hints of red stained the whites of loras eyes as she remembered that magnificent moment id never known such a thrill when you drank from me i loved you as i had no other and when i lived again you brought him to me so i could have the one who scorned me for my first kill we shared him as weve shared so much when samhain comes we will share all there is w hile the vampires slept moira stood on the playing field she was filthy and drenched her hip throbbed from a blow that had slipped past her guard and her breath was still wheezing out of her lungs from the last bout she felt wonderful she held out a hand to help dervil to her feet you did very well moira told her you nearly had me wincing dervil rubbed her ample rump i think not hands on hips her head covered with a widebrimmed and now sodden leather hat glenna surveyed both of them you stayed on your feet longer this time and got back on them quicker she nodded approval at dervil improvement from what im told there are several men on the other side of this field that you could take there are several men on the other side of the field she has taken isleen called out and got a number of bawdy laughs and i know what to do with them when i take them dervil retorted put some of that energy into your next match glenna suggested and you might win it instead of ending up in the mud lets finish up with some archery practice and call this a day even as the women responded with relief that the session was nearly done moira waved a hand i havent yet met ceara in handtohand ive been saving what im told is the best for last so i can retire full champion from the field cocky i like it blair spoke as she moved through the rain and the mud weapon details moving along she added weve kicked production up a notch she tipped back her head let me tell you this rain feels great after a couple hours with an anvil and forge so whats the score here moiras taken all comers with sword and handtohand shes challenged ceara here to a bout before we finish up with bows good enough i can take a group to the targets while you finish up here there was immediate and vocal protest from the women who were eager to watch the last match bloodthirsty blair nodded approval i like that too all right ladies give them room whos your money on she murmured to glenna as the two women squared off moiras hot and motivated shes just plowed through the field today id have to put my money on her ill take ceara shes tricky and shes not afraid to take a hit see she added when ceara went sprawling facedown in the mud and sprang up again to charge she feinted pivoting at the last minute then swept up a foot to catch moira midbody the queen shot back from the hit managed to catch her balance and duck the next blow she came up hard flipped ceara over her shoulder but when she spun around ceara wasnt flat on her back but had pumped off her own hands and striking out with her feet kicked moira into the mud moira was up quickly and with a light in her eyes well now your reputation hasnt been exaggerated i see im after the prize ceara crouched circled be warned come get it then good fight blair commented as fists and feet and bodies flew ceara keep your elbows up glenna jabbed blair with her own no coaching from the peanut gallery but she was smiling not just because it was a good strong fight but because the rest of the women were shouting and calling out advice theyd made themselves a unit moira fell back scissored out her legs and swept cearas from under her but when she rolled up again to pin her opponent ceara thrust up and flipped moira over her head there were several sounds of sympathy as moira landed with a bonerattling thud before she could shove up again ceara was straddling her an elbow to moiras throat and a fist to her heart youre staked damn me i am get off me gods pity youre crushing my lungs she sucked in breath as she struggled to push her still vibrating body into a sitting position ceara simply dropped down to sit in the mud beside her and the two of them panted and eyed each other youre a great bitch in battle moira said at length the same to you with all respect my lady ive bruises on top of my bruises now and knots on top of those moira swiped some of the mud from her face with her forearm i wasnt fresh thats true but i could take you fresh as well i think youre right you won the prize ceara and won it fair im proud to have been bested by you she offered her hand and after shaking it raised it high heres the champion of the handtohand there were cheers and in the way of women hugs but when ceara offered a hand to help moira to her feet moira waved her off im just going to sit here another minute catch my breath go on get your bow and with that you nor any will best me it couldnt be done if we had a thousand years your majesty aye oh god i wont sit easy for a week she added rubbing her sore hip ive never been prouder of my queen moira smiled to herself then simply sat quiet taking stock of her aches and pains then her gaze was drawn up to the spot where shed stood with cian the night before and there he was standing in the gloom and the rain looking down at her she could feel the force of him through the distance the allure he exuded she thought as other men never could so what are you looking at she said to herself is it amusing to you to see me on my arse in the mud probably she decided and who could blame him she imagined she made quite the picture well have a match of our own im thinking sooner or later then well see who bests who she pushed herself to her feet gritted her teeth against the need to limp so she could walk away steady and without a backward glance chapter a fter scraping off an acre of mud moira joined the others for a strategy session she walked in at that tenuous point between discussion and argument im not saying you cant handle yourself larkins tone as he addressed blair had taken on that last ragged edge of patience im saying hoyt and i can manage this and im saying three would get it done faster than two what would that be moira asked the answer came from several sources with steadily rising voices i cant make much of that out she held up a hand for peace as she took her seat at the table am i understanding that were after sending a party out to set up a base near the battlefield scouting as they go with the first troops moving out behind them in the morning hoyt finished we have locations marked where shelter can be found here he said tapping the map spread out on the table a days march east then another a days march from that but the fact is with lilith dug in here blair laid her fist on the map shes taken the advantage of primo location and facilities we can crisscross our bases establish a kind of jagged front line but we need to start moving troops and we need to secure bases for them before we send them out not only along the route but at the best points near the valley true enough considering moira studied the map she saw how it was meant to work with daylight jumps from position to position larkin can cover the distance faster than any wed agree on that the way things are but if we recruited other dragons blair ive said that cant be dragons moira held up a hand again to silence larkins interruption what do you mean when larkin shapeshifts he can communicate at least on a rudimentary level with what he becomes blair began aye and so if he calls other dragons when hes in that form why couldnt he convince some of them to follow him with riders theyre peaceful gentle creatures larkin interrupted they shouldnt be drawn into something like this where they could be harmed wait wait rolling it over in her mind moira sat back could it be done ive seen some take a baby in as a kind of pet from time to time but ive never heard of anyone riding a fullgrown dragon except in stories if it could be done it would allow us to travel swiftly and even by night and in battle she broke off when she saw larkins expression im sorry truly but we cant be sentimental about it the dragon is a symbol of geall and geall needs its symbols we ask our people our women the young ones the old ones to fight and to sacrifice if such a thing could be done it should be done i dont know if it can be moira knew when larkin was being muleheaded youll need to try we love our horses too larkin moira reminded him but well ride them into this now hoyt would you tell me plain is it best for you and larkin to go on your own or for the three of you to do this he looked pained well youve put me between the wolf and the tiger havent you larkins concerned that blairs not fully recovered from the attack im good to go she insisted then punched larkin not so lightly in the arm want to go oneonone with me cowboy and find out her ribs still pain her by end of day and the shoulder that was hurt is weak yet ill show you weak now now children glenna managed to sound light and sarcastic im going to stick my neck into this blairs fit for duty sorry honey she said to larkin but we really cant keep her on the disabled list it would be best if she went hoyt sent a look of sympathy toward larkin with three we shouldnt need to be gone more than a day the first troops could be sent out at first light and make their way to the first post that leaves three of us here to continue to work and train and prepare moira nodded this would be best would you think tynan should lead those first troops larkin do you ask as a sop to my wounded pride or because you want my opinion of it both she charmed a reluctant laugh out of him then aye hed be the one for it we should get started blair glanced around the table with the time larkin can make in the air wed be able to set up the first base maybe the first two before nightfall take whatever you need moira told them ill speak to tynan and have him lead the first troops out at dawn shell be expecting you cian spoke for the first time since moira had entered if lilith hasnt thought of this move one of her advisors would have shell have troops posted to intercept and ambush blair nodded figured that its why were better with three and coming from the air they wont take us by surprise but we might just take them better chance of that if you come from this direction he got up to come around to the map and illustrate circle around come at the first location from the east or the north more time of course but theyd likely be watching for you from this direction good point blair acknowledged then gave larkin a considering frown hoyt and i could put down out of sight and send our boy here to get the lay maybe as a bird or some animal they wouldnt think twice about seeing in the area have to take extra provisions she added the way he burns up the fuel with the changes but better safe than otherwise keep it small cian warned larkin if you go as a deer or any sort of game they might shoot you for sport or an extra meal theyll be bored by this time id imagine if the weather theres as its been here today theyll likely be inside or under shelter we dont care to be drenched any more than humans do okay well work it out blair got to her feet any magic tricks up your sleeve she said to hoyt dont forget to pack them b e careful glenna fussed with hoyts cloak as they stood at the gates dont worry goes with the territory she held both hands on his cloak as she looked up into his eyes weve stuck pretty tight together since this started you and i i wish i were going with you youre needed here he touched her cross then his own youll know where i am and how i am two days at most ill come back to you make damn sure of it she pulled him to her kissed him hard and long while her heart trembled i love you be safe i love you be strong now go inside out of the rain but she waited while larkin shimmered into the dragon then hoyt and blair loaded on the packs and weapons she waited while they vaulted on the dragons back and rose up flying through the gray curtain of rain its hard moira said from behind her to be the one who waits horrible she reached back took a strong grip on moiras hand so keep me busy well go in have our first lesson they turned walked away from the gates do you remember when you first knew you had power no it wasnt definite as it was with larkin it was more that i sometimes knew things where to find something that was lost or where someone was hiding if we were playing a game but it always seemed it could have been as much luck or just good sense as anything else was your mother gifted she was but softly if you understand me a kind of empathy you could say a gift for growing things idly she tossed her braid behind her shoulder youve seen the gardens here and those were her doing if she was able to attend a birth or help at a sick bed she could bring comfort and ease i thought of what she had and what i have as a kind of womans magic empathy intuition healing they stepped through the archway moved to the stairs but since i began to work with you and hoyt i felt more like a stirring it seemed to me it was a kind of echo or reflection of the stronger power both of you have then i took hold of the sword a talisman or conduit glenna speculated or more simply a key that opened a door to what was already in you she led the way into the room where she and hoyt worked it wasnt so different from the tower room in ireland bigger moira thought and with an arched doorway that led to one of the castles many balconies but the scents were the same herbs and ash and something that was a mix of floral and metallic a number of glennas crystals were set around on tables and chests as much moira supposed for aesthetics as for magical purposes there were bowls and vials and books and crosses silver wood stone copper hung at every opening to the outside damp and chilly in here glenna commented why dont you light the fire oh of course but when moira started across to the wide stone hearth glenna laughed and grabbed her hand no not like that fire its elemental one of the basic skills to practice magic we utilize the elements nature we respect them light the fire from here with me i wouldnt know how to begin with yourself mind heart belly bone and blood see the fire its colors and shapes feel the heat of it smell the smoke and burning turf take that from your mind from inside you and put it in the hearth moira did as she was told and though she felt something ripple along her skin the turf remained quiet and cold im sorry no it takes time energy and focus and it takes faith you dont remember taking your first steps pulling yourself up with your mothers skirts or on a table or how many times you fell before you stood take your first step moira hold out your right hand imagine the fire lighting inside you hot bright it flows out up from your belly through your heart down your arm to your fingertips see it feel it send it where you will it was almost a trance glennas quiet voice and that building of heat a stronger ripple now under her skin over it and a weak tongue of flame spurted along a brick of turf oh it was a flash inside my head but you did most of it a little of it glenna corrected just a little push moira blew out a long breath i feel ive run up a mountain itll get easier watching the fire catch hold moira nodded teach me b y the end of two hours moira felt as though shed not only climbed a mountain but had fallen off one on her head but shed learned to call and somewhat control two of the four elements glenna had given her a list of simple spells and charms to practice on her own homework glenna had called it and the scholar in moira was eager to apply herself to it but there were other matters to be seen to she changed to more formal attire fixed the mitre of her office on her head and went to meet with her uncle regarding finance wars cost coin many had to leave their crops unharvested riddock told her their flocks and herds untended some will surely lose their homes well help them rebuild there will be no tax or levy imposed for two years moira the treasury will stand it uncle i cant sit on gold and jewels no matter what their history while our people sacrifice i would melt the royal crown of geall first when this is done i will plant crops fifty acres another fifty for grazing what comes from it will be given back to those who fought the families of any who perished or were injured serving geall he rubbed his own aching head and how will you know who has served and who has hidden themselves away well believe you think im naive and softhearted perhaps i am some of that will be needed from a queen when this is done i cant be naive and softhearted now and i must push and prod and ask my people to give and give i ask a great deal of you youre here while strangers turn your home into a barracks its nothing its very much and wont be the last i ask of you oran marches tomorrow hes spoken to me there was pride in riddocks voice though his eyes were heavy with sorrow my younger son is a man and must be a man being yours he could be no less for now even as troops begin to march work has to continued here weapons must be forged people must be fed and housed trained whatever is required you have leave to spend but she smiled now thinly if any merchant or craftsman seeks too heavy a profit he will have an audience with the queen riddock returned her smile very well your mother would be proud of you i hope she would i think of her every day she rose and the gesture brought him to his feet i must go to my aunt shes so good to stand as chantelain these weeks she enjoys it i wonder that she could the kitchens the laundry the sewing the cleaning its beyond my ken with so many to tend id be lost without her shell be pleased to hear it but she tells me you come every day to speak with her and to tour those kitchen the laundry just as im told you go speak to the smithies the young ones you have carving stakes and today you trained with the other women i never thought my office would be an idle one no but you need rest moira your eyes are shadowed she told herself to ask glenna to teach her to do a glamour theres time enough to rest when this is done s he spent an hour with her aunt going over household accounts and duties then another speaking with some of those who performed those duties when she started toward the parlor with the idea of a light meal and a vat of tea she heard cians laugh it relieved her to know he was keeping glenna company but she wondered if she herself had the energy to deal with him after such a long day she caught herself turning away felt a quick flare of anger did she need a headful of wine just to sit comfortably in the same room with him what sort of coward was she straightening her spine she strode in to see glenna and cian sitting by the fire with fruit and tea they looked so easy with each other moira thought did glenna find it comforting or strange that cian looked so like his brother little differences of course that cleft in cians chin his brother lacked and his face was leaner than hoyts his hair shorter there was his posture and his movements cian always seemed at his ease and walked with a near animal fluidity she liked watching him move moira admitted he always put her in mind of something exotic beautiful in its way and just as lethal he knew she was there she was sure shed yet to see anything or anyone come up on him with him unaware but he continued to slouch in the chair where most men would rise when a woman much less a queen entered the room it was like his shrug she thought a deliberate carelessness she wished she didnt find that so appealing as well am i interrupting she asked as she crossed the room no glenna shifted to smile at her i asked for enough for three hoping youd have time cians just been entertaining me with stories of hoyts exploits as a child ill leave you ladies to your tea please dont go before he could rise glenna took his arm youve been working hard to keep me from worrying if you knew it i wasnt working hard enough you gave me a breather and its appreciated now if everythings gone as planned they should be at the projected base i need to look her hand was steady as she poured tea for moira i think it would be better if we all looked can you help them if moira let it trail off hoyts not the only one with magic up his sleeve but ill be able to see more clearly and help if necessary if the two of you work with me i know youve had a long one moira theyre my family as well with a nod glenna rose i brought what i thought id need she retrieved her crystal globe some smaller crystals some herbs these she arranged on the table between them then she took off her cross circled the ball with its chain so she kept her voice light placed her hands over the ball lets see what theyre up to i t had rained across geall making the trip a small misery theyd circled wide coming down nearly a quarter mile east of the farm they intended to use for a base its location was prime nearly equidistant from the land lilith now occupied and the field of battle because it was cians assumption that it would be laid for ambush rang true the two riders dismounted from the dragons back then offloaded packs and supplies there was some cover the low stone wall separating the fields and the scatter of trees that ran with it nothing stirred in the rain dragon turned to man and larkin scooped both hands through his dripping hair filthy day all in all you saw the goal right enough twostory cottage blair answered three outbuildings two paddocks sheep no smoke or sign of life no horses if theyre there theyd have guards posted a couple in each building most likely taking shifts while the others sleep theyd need food so they may have prisoners or if theyre traveling light theyd have what they need in canteens water bags i could risk a look hoyt said if she sent along any with power though they could sense it and us simpler if i take a run at it larkin paused to crunch into an apple the long trip had hunger gnawing at his belly they wouldnt put up the shield as they have around their main base not if theyre hoping to snatch some of us if and when we come along go in small blair reminded him cian had a good point about that aye well he stuffed some bread in his mouth a mouse is small enough and worked before itll take longer than it would as wolf or deer he slipped off his cross youll need to keep this for me i hate this part blair took the cross i hate you going in without a weapon or shield have a little faith he cupped her chin kissed her then stepping back changed into a small field mouse cant believe i just kissed that blair muttered then closed her hand tight over his cross as the mouse streaked across the grass now we wait best if we take precautions ill cast a circle l arkin was nearly to the first outbuilding when he spotted the wolf it was large and black crouched in a thicket of berries it paid no mind to him while its red eyes scanned the field and the road to the west still he gave it a wide berth before squirming under the doorway it was a rough stable and there were two horses in the stalls and two vampires seated on the floor having a game of dice the mouse cocked its head in some surprise larkin hadnt considered vampires would game the wolf he deduced was their outlook a signal from it and theyd come to action but for now they were too involved in the dice to notice a small mouse there were swords and two full quivers with bows inspired he dashed over to where the bows rested against a stall and busily gnawed at the strings one vampire was cursing his fellows luck when larkin scrambled out again he found similar setups in each building with the main body of the troop in the cottage though he smelled blood he saw no human in the cottage four vampires slept in the loft while five others kept watch he did what could be done by a mouse to sabotage then hurried away again he found hoyt and blair where hed left them sitting now on a damp blanket in a circle that simmered low fifteen by my count he told them and a wolf wed need to get past that one for any chance at taking the others by surprise have to be quiet then blair picked up a bow and from downwind hoyt if larkin can give me the exact position is there a way you can help me see it i can give you the exact position larkin said before hoyt spoke because well be going together now you won the round to come but you wont go into that nest of demons alone she wont no of the three of us youve the best hand with a bow so youll take the shot hoyt told blair but well be covering your flank while youre at it ill do what i can to help you get a clear shot no point in arguing that one moves faster and quieter than three didnt think so blair said when she met stony silence lets move out then they had to circle widely to keep out of sight and prevent their scent from carrying but when they came up behind the wolf blair shook her head i dont think i can get the heart from here moira maybe but im not that good gonna take more than one shot she thought it over saw how it could best be done you take the first one she whispered to larkin get as close as you can if it rears or rolls shifts around i can take it one two she added using her fingers has to be fast has to be quiet he nodded pulled an arrow from the quiver notched it in his bow it was a long shot for him and the angle poor but he took aim breathed out breathed in and let the arrow fly it took the wolf between the shoulder blades and its body jerked up blairs arrow struck home nice work she said as black smoke and ash flew hoyt started to speak then glennas voice sounded in his head as clearly as if shed been standing beside him behind you he spun pivoted a second wolf leaped its body slamming hoyt aside knocking him to the ground as it fell on larkin man and wolf grappled an instant only even as blair drew her sword and hoyt his the wolf was rolled beneath a bear the bears claws swiped slicing deep across the throat there was a gush of blood the bear collapsed on the black ash and became a man again blair dropped to her knees running her hands frantically over larkin are you bit are you bit no scratched up here and there no bites ah the stench of that one out of breath he pushed to his elbows looked down in disgust at his bloody shirt ruined a good hunting tunic he looked over at hoyt all right then i might not have been glenna they must be watching i heard her in my head hoyt held out a hand to help larkin to his feet if you wear that theyll smell us a half league away youll need to wait wait and his smile came slow and grim ive an idea the black wolf crouched over the bloody figure and from outside the rear of the stables sent out a low howl in moments a vampire armed with a battleax opened the door what do we have here he glanced over his shoulder one of the wolves brought us a present facedown hoyt let out a quiet moan its still alive lets get it inside no need to share it with the others right i could use something fresh for a change as they stepped out the second spared the wolf a brief grin yeah good dog lets just have a he exploded into ash as blair rammed the stake through his back and into his heart the second didnt have time to lift his ax before hoyt sprang off the ground and sliced his sword through its neck yeah good dog blair mimicked the vampire and added a quick ruffle of larkins fur i say we stick with a winner use the same gambit on the next outbuilding they had nearly identical results with the second building but on the third only one came out it was obvious by the way he glanced surreptitiously back at his post that he intended to keep the unexpected meal for himself when he rolled hoyt over the unexpected meal put a stake through his heart using hand signals now blair indicated she would go in first with hoyt covering her quick and quiet she thought as she slipped inside she saw the other guard had made himself a cozy nest with blankets and was taking an afternoon nap in what she thought was a dovecote he was actually snoring she had to bite back the half a dozen smart remarks that trembled on her tongue and simply staked him while he slept she blew out a long breath i dont mean to complain but this is almost embarrassing and a little bit boring youre disappointed were not fighting for our lives hoyt asked well yeah some take heart larkin stepped in surveyed the area there are nine in the cottage where well be severely outnumbered ah thanks honey you always know just what to say to perk me up she hefted the battleax shed taken from the first kill lets go kick some ass bellied down behind a water trough blair and hoyt studied the cottage the wounded man wolf gambit wasnt going to work here and the alternate theyd agreed on was risky hes already gone through a lot of changes blair murmured it starts taking a toll he ate four honey cakes she nodded hoping it was fuel enough as the dragon landed lightly on the thatched roof larkin shimmered free of it then picked up the scabbard and the sheath for his stake he signaled down to them before swinging down to peer in one of the secondstory windows apparently blair thought he didnt have to change into a monkey to climb like one larkin held up four fingers four up five down she moved into a crouch ready keeping low they rushed to either side of the doorway as agreed she counted to ten then kicked in the door with the battleax she decapitated the one on her right then used the staff of it to block the hack of a sword out of the corner of her eye she saw a ball of fire flash into hoyts hand something screamed from overhead larkin and a vampire flew off the loft to land hard on the floor she tried to hack her way to him took a hard kick in her healing ribs the pain and the force knocked her back into a table that broke beneath her weight she used the splintered leg to dust the one that leaped on her then she threw the makeshift stake striking one that rushed hoyt from behind she missed the heart swore and shoved herself breathlessly to her feet hoyt thrust out with a back kick that made her warriors heart sing when the vampire fell larkin finished it with a sword clean through the throat how many blair shouted how many i took two hoyt said four by the gods even as he grinned he was grabbing blairs arm how bad off my game caught my ribs i only got two theres another left gone out the window above here sit sit your arms bleeding as well shit she looked down saw the gash she hadnt felt shit your nose is bleeding mouth too hoyt a few nicks he limped toward them i dont think wed need worry overmuch about the one that escaped but ill be doing a spell to revoke any invitation let me see what i can do for your arm spell first breathing through her teeth she looked at larkin four huh it seems two of them were mating and distracted with it when i came through the window so i had them both with one blow maybe we should only count that as one oh no we wont he finished tying a field dressing on her wounded arm swiped blood from under his own nose jesus im starving it made her laugh and despite her aching ribs she wrapped her arms around him to hug t heyre fine glenna let out a shuddering breath a little battered a little bloody but fine and safe sorry sorry but watching it like this not being able to help im just going to have a short breakdown as promised she buried her face in her hands and wept chapter e scaping cian left glenna to moira in his experience women dealt best with womens tears his own reaction to what theyd seen in the crystal hadnt been fear or relief but sheer and simple frustration hed been delegated to do no more than watch while others fought cozied in the bloody parlor with women and teacups like someones aged grandfather while the training sessions were some level of entertainment he hadnt had a good fight since theyd left ireland hadnt had a woman in longer than that two very satisfying ways of releasing tension and energy had been denied to him or he was denying them to himself hardly a wonder he thought he was tied up in nasty knots over a pair of steady gray eyes he could seduce a serving girl but that was fraught with complications and probably not worth the time or effort he could hardly pick a fight with one of the very handy humans which was too damn bad if he went out on a hunt he could likely scare up at least one or two of liliths troops but he couldnt rev himself up to go out into the endless rain on the chance of a lucky kill at least back in his own time his own world hed had work to occupy him women if he wanted one of course but work to pass the time the endless time with none of those options available to him he closed himself in his room he fed and he slept and he dreamed as he hadnt dreamed in decades and more of hunting human the strong and salty scent of them stung the air rising as even their puny and smothered instincts warned them they were prey it was a seductive and primitive perfume to stir needs in the belly and in the blood she was only a whore working the alleyways of london young though and fair enough despite her trade which told him it was unlikely shed been at it very long as the aroma of sex clung to her he knew shed made a few coppers that night he could hear tinny music and the raucous drunken laughter from some gin parlor and the clopping of a carriage horse moving away all distant too distant for her human ears to catch and too distant for her human legs to run if she tried she hurried through the thick yellow fog quickening her pace with nervous glances over her shoulder as he deliberately allowed her to hear his footsteps behind her the smell of her fear was intoxicating so fresh so alive it was so easy to catch her to cover the squeak of her mouth with his hand to cover the rabbitrapid jump of her heart with the other so amusing to see her eyes take in his face young and handsome the expensive clothing and go sly go coy as he eased his hand from her mouth sir you frighten a poor girl i thought you be a brigand nothing of the sort the cultured accent he used was in direct opposition to squawking cockney simply in need of a little comfort and willing to pay your price with a flutter and a giggle she named one he knew would be double her usual rate for that i think you should make me very comfortable im sorry to ask for pay from such a fine and handsome gentleman but i have to earn my keep i do i have a room nearby we wont need it oh she laughed when he pulled up her skirts here is it with his free hand he yanked down her bodice covered her breast he needed to feel her heart beating beating beating he drove into her pumping hard so that her bare buttocks slapped against the damp stone wall of the alley and he saw the shock and surprise in her eyes that he could give her pleasure that beat beneath his hand quickened and her breath went short and expelled on gasps and moans he let her come a small gesture and let her dazed and sleepy eyes meet his before he showed his fangs she screamed just a quick high sound he cut off when he sank his fangs into her throat her body convulsed bringing him to a very satisfactory orgasm as he fed as he killed that beating under his hand slowed stilled stopped replete and sated he left her in the alley with the rats the price shed named tossed carelessly beside her and he strolled away to be swallowed by the thick yellow fog he woke in the here and now on an oath the dream memory had awakened appetites and passions long suppressed he almost almost tasted her blood in his throat almost smelled the richness of it in the dark he trembled a little an addict in withdrawal so forced himself to get up and drink what he allowed himself as substitute for human it will never satisfy you it will never fill you why do you struggle against what you are lilith he said it softly he recognized the voice in his head understood now who and what had put that dream into his mind had it even been his memory it seemed false now that he was steadier like a stage play hed stumbled into but then hed killed his share of whores in alleys hed killed so many who could remember the details lilith shimmered into the dark diamonds glittered at her throat her ears her wrists even in her luxurious hair she wore a gown of regal blue trimmed in sable cut low to highlight the generous mounds of her breasts shed gone to some trouble with her dress and appearance cian thought for this illusionary visit theres my handsome boy she murmured but you look tense and tired hardly a wonder with what youve been up to she wagged her finger playfully naughty of you but i blame myself i wasnt able to spend those formative years with you and as the twig is bent you deserted me he pointed out though he didnt need them he lighted candles then poured himself a cup of whiskey killed me changed me set me on my brother then left me broken at the bottom of the cliffs where you let him toss you but you were young and rash what could i do she tugged her bodice lower to show him the scar of the pentagram he burned me branded me i was no good to you and after the days and months and years after odd he thought odd to realize he had this resentment even this hurt buried inside him like a child tossed aside by its mother you made me lilith birthed me then left me with less sentiment than an alley cat leaves a deformed kitten youre right youre right i cant argue she wandered the room lazy sweeps that had the skirts of her gown brushing through a table i was careless with you darling boy and what did i do but take out my temper for your brother on you shame on me those pretty blue eyes twinkled with merriment and the curve of her lips was charmingly female but you did so well for yourself initially imagine my shock when lora told me the rumors id heard were true and youd stopped hunting oh she sends her regards by the way does she i imagine shes a pretty sight at the moment liliths smile faded and a hint of red showed in her eyes careful there or when the time comes it wont just be that fucking demon hunter i rip to pieces think you can he slouched into a chair with his whiskey id wager you on that but you wouldnt be able to pay up being a pile of ash at the end of it ive seen the end of it in the smoke she came to him leaning over the chair so real he could almost smell her this world will burn ill have no need of it every human on this foolish island will be slaughtered screaming and drowning in their own blood your brother and his circle will die most horribly i have seen it your wizard would hardly show you otherwise cian said with a shrug were you always so gullible he shows me truth she shoved away her gown sweeping in a furious arch why do you persist in this doomed adventure why do you oppose the one who gave you the greatest gift i came here to offer you a truce a private and personal agreement just between you and me step away from this my darling and you have my pardon step away and come to me and you have not only my pardon but a place at my side come the day everything you hunger for and have denied yourself ill lay at your feet in repentance for abandoning you when you needed me so i just go back to my time my world and alls forgiven i give you my word on it but ill give you much much more if you come to me to me she purred it molding her breasts with her hands remember what we shared that night the spark the heat of it he watched her run her hands over her body white against red i remember very well we can have that again and more youll be a prince in my court and a general leading armies instead of slogging through the muck with humans youll have your pick of worlds and all their pleasures an eternity of desires met i remember you promising something along those lines before then i was alone broken and lost with the graveyard dirt barely washed off me and so this is my penance come now come you have no place here cian you belong with your own kind interesting he tapped his fingers on the side of his cup so all i need do is take your word that youll reward me rather than torturing and ending me why would i destroy my own creation she replied in reasonable tones and one whos proven himself to be a strong warrior for spite of course and because your word is as much an illusion as your appearance here but ill give you mine on one vital matter lilith and my word is as hard and as bright as those diamonds youre wearing it will be i who comes for you it will be i who does for you he picked up a knife and slashed it over his own palm i swear it to you in blood mine will be the last face you see fury tightened her face youve damned yourself no he murmured when her image vanished you damned me it was deep night and he was done with sleep at least at such an hour he could wander where he liked without bumping into servants or courtiers or guards hed had enough of company human and vampire still he needed distraction movement something to clear away the bitter dregs of the dream and the visitation that followed it he admired the architecture of the castle something a few steps up and over into fantasy than what would have been usual when he was alive it was storybook inside and out he mused with the shifting lights of torches rising from their dragon sconces the tapestries of faeries and festivals the polished jeweltoned marble of course it hadnt been built as a fortress but more as a lavish home fit most certainly for a queen until lilith geall had existed in peace and so could focus its energies and intellects on art and culture he could in the quiet and dark take time to study and admire the art the paintings and tapestries the murals and carvings he could drift through the dark with the perfume of hothouse flowers sweetening the air or wander to the library to peruse the tall shelves since its creation geall had been a land for art and books and music rather than warfare and weaponry how apt how cold that both gods and demons should select such a place for bloody war the library as moira had indicated when falling in love with his own was a quiet cathedral of books hed passed some of his time with a few of them already and had been both interested and entertained that the stories hed found there werent so different from ones written in his own lifetime would geall if it survived produce its own shakespeare yeats austen would its art go through revivals and renaissance and offer its version of monet or degas a fascinating thought for now he was too restless too edgy to settle himself down with a book and instead moved on there were rooms hed yet to explore and by night he could go wherever he wanted as he walked through shadows the rain drummed steadily he moved through what he supposed had been a kind of formal drawing room and was now serving as an armory he lifted a sword testing its weight its balance its edge gealls craftsmen might have devoted their time previously to arts but they knew how to forge a sword time would tell if it would be enough without aim he turned and stepped into what he saw was a music room a gilded harp stood elegantly in one corner a smaller cousin shaped just as a traditional irish harp graced a stand nearby there was a monochord an early forefather of the piano enhanced with lovely carving on its soundbox he plucked its string idly pleased its sound was true and clear there was a hurdygurdy and when he turned its shaft slid the bow over its strings it sang with the mournful music of bagpipes there were lutes and pipes all beautifully crafted there was comfortable seating and a pretty hearth from the local marble a fine room he mused for musicians and those who appreciated the art then he saw the vielle he lifted it its body was longer than the violin that would come from it and it held five strings when the instruments had been popular hed had no interest in such matters no hed been for killing whores in alleyways but when a man has eternity he needs hobbies and pursuits and years to study them he sat with the vielle over his lap and began to play it came back to him the notes the sounds and calmed him as it was said music could do with the rain as his accompaniment he let himself fall into the music drifted away on the tears of it she would never have come upon him without him being aware otherwise shed heard it the quiet sobbing of music as shed made her own wanderings shed followed it like a child follows a piper then stood just inside the doorway stunned and enchanted so moira thought this is how he looks when hes peaceful and not just pretending to be this is how he might have looked before lilith had taken him a little dreamy a little sad a little lost all that had stirred and risen inside her for him seemed to come together inside her heart as she saw him unmasked sitting alone she thought seeking the comfort of music she wished she had glennas skill with paints or chalk for she would have drawn him like this as few she was sure had ever seen him his eyes were closed his expression she would have said caught somewhere in the misty place between melancholy and contentment whatever his thoughts his fingers were skilled on the strings long and lean seducing the instrument into wistful music then it stopped so abruptly she let out a little cry of protest as she stepped forward with her candle oh please continue wont you sure it was lovely he had preferred she come at him with a knife than that innocent eager smile she wore only nightrobes white and pure with her hair unbound to fall like the rain over her shoulders the candlelight shifted over her face full of mystery and romance the floors are cold for bare feet was all he said and rose to set the instrument down the dreamy look was gone from his eyes so they were cool again frustrated she set the candle down theyre my feet after all you never said you played there are a lot of things i never said i have no skill at all to the despair of my mother and every teacher she hired to school me in music any instrument i picked up would end by making a sound like a cat being trod on she reached over ran her hand over the strings it seemed like magic in your hands ive had more years to learn what interests me than youve been alive many times more years she looked up now met his eyes true enough but the time doesnt diminish the art does it you have a gift so why not accept a compliment on it with some grace your majesty he bowed deeply from the waist you honor my poor efforts oh bugger that she snapped and surprised a choked laugh out of him i dont know why you look for ways to insult me a man must have a hobby ill say good night why this is your time isnt it and you wont seek your bed i cant sleep something cold she hugged her elbows shivered once something cold in the air woke me because she was watching him she caught the slight change in his eyes what what do you know has something happened larkin its nothing to do with that he and the others are well enough as far as i know what then he debated for a moment his personal desire to be away from her couldnt outweigh what she should know its too cold in here for nighttime confessions then ill light the fire she walked to the hearth picked up the tinderbox that rested there there was always whiskey in that painted cabinet there id have some she didnt have to see to know hed lifted a brow a gesture of sarcasm before he crossed to the cabinet did your mother always fail to teach you that it would be considered improper for you to be sharing a fire and whiskey alone with a man much less one who is not a man in the middle of the night propriety isnt an immediate concern of mine she sat back on her haunches watching for a moment to be sure the turf caught then she rose to go to a chair and held out her hand for the whiskey thanks for that she took the first swallow something happened tonight if it concerns geall i need to know it concerns me it was something to do with lilith i thought it was just my own fears creeping in while i slept but it was more than that i dreamed of her once more than a dream you woke me from it and had been kind to her after she remembered reluctant but kind it was something like that she continued but i didnt dream i only felt she broke off her eyes widening no not just felt i heard you i heard you speaking i heard your voice in my head and it was cold it will be i who does for you i heard you say that so clearly as i was waking i thought i would freeze to death if you spoke so cold to me and had felt compelled to get out of bed she thought had followed his music to him who was it later he decided he might try to puzzle out how she could hear or feel him speak in her dreams lilith aye her eyes on the fire moira rubbed a hand up and down her arms i knew there was something dark with the cold it wasnt you you could be sure you have a different hue she decided lilith is black thick as pitch you well youre not bright its gray and blue its twilight in you what is this an aura thing the chilly amusement in his tone had a flush creeping up her neck its how i see sometimes glenna told me to pursue it shes red and gold like her hair if you have an interest in it was it a dream lilith no though she sent me one that may have been a memory a whore i fucked and killed in the filth of a london alley the way he lifted his glass and drank was a callous punctuation to the words if it wasnt that particular one i fucked and killed others so it hardly matters her gaze never wavered from his you think that shocks me you say it and in that way to put something cruel between us theres a great deal of cruelty between us what you did before that night in the clearing in ireland when you first saved my life isnt between us its behind you do you think im so green i dont know youve had all manner of women and killed all manner of them as well you only insult me and your own choices since by pushing them into the now i dont understand you what he didnt understand he usually pursued understanding was another kind of survival sure its not my fault is it i make myself plain in most matters if she sent you the dream true or not it was to disturb you disturb he repeated and moved away toward the fire you are the strangest creature it excited me and it unnerved me for lack of a better term that was her purpose and she succeeded very well and having served her purpose dug into some vulnerability in you she came to you the apparition of her as lora did with blair he turned back holding the whiskey loosely in one hand i got an apology centuries overdue for her abandonment of me when i was only days into the change and near dead from hoyt tossing me off a cliff perhaps tardiness is relative given the length of your existence now he did laugh couldnt stop himself it was quick and rich and full of appreciation aye the strangest creature with a sharp wit buried in there she offered me a deal are you interested to hear it i am very interested i have only to walk away from this you and the others and what comes on samhain i do that and shell call it quits between her and me better if i walk away from you and into her camp ill be rewarded handsomely all and anything i can want and a place at her side her bed as well and any others i can to take to mine moira pursed her lips then sipped more whiskey if you believe that youre greener than you think me i was never so green as you no well which of the two of us was green enough to sport with a vampire and let her sink fangs into him hah youve got a point but then youve never been a randy young man and women of course have no interest in carnal matters we much prefer to sit and do our needlework with prayers running through our heads his lips twitched before he shook his head another point in any case no longer being a randy young man or with any sprig of green left in me im fully aware lilith would imprison and torture me she could keep me alive as it were for well ever and in unspeakable pain he considered it now his thoughts sparked by the brief debate with moira or more likely shed keep her word on sex and other rewards for as long as it suited her she would know id be useful to her at least until samhain in agreement moira nodded she would bed you lavish gifts on you give you position and rank then when it was done shed imprison and torture you exactly but i have no intention of being tortured for eternity or being of use to her she killed a good man i had affection for if for nothing else i owe her for king she would have been displeased by your refusal he sent moira a bland look youre the queen of understatement tonight then let me also be the mistress of intuition and say you told her you would make it your mission to destroy her i swore it in my own blood dramatic he said glancing at the nearly healed wound on his hand but i was feeling theatrical you make light of it i find it telling you need her death by your own hands more than youll say she doesnt understand that or you you need it not just for retribution but to close a door when he said nothing she cocked her head do you think it odd i understand you better than she know you better than she could i think your mind is always working he replied i can all but hear the wheels its hardly a surprise youre not sleeping well these past days with all the bloody noise that must go on inside that head of yours im frightened his eyes narrowed on her face but she wouldnt meet them now frightened to die before ive really lived frightened to fail my people my family you and the others when i feel that cold and dark as i did tonight i know what would become of geall if she wins this like a void burned out hulled empty and black and the thought of it frightens me beyond sleep then the answer must be she cant win aye that must be the answer she set the whiskey aside youll need to tell glenna what you told me i think it would be harder to get the answer if there are secrets among us if i dont tell her you will of course but it should come from you youre welcome to play any of the instruments you like whenever youre moved to or if youd rather be private you could take any you like to your room thank you she smiled a little as she got to her feet i think i could sleep for a bit now good night he stayed as he was as she retrieved her candle and left him and stayed hours longer in the firelit dark i n the raw rainy dawn moira stood with tynan as he and the handpicked troops prepared to set out itll be a wet march tynan smiled at her rains good for the soul then our souls must be very healthy after these last days they can move about in the rain tynan she touched her fingers lightly to the cross painted on his breastplate i wonder if we should wait until this clears before you start this journey with a shake of his head he looked beyond her to the others my lady the men are ready ready to the point that delay would cut into morale and scrape at the nerves they need action even if its only a long days march in the rain weve trained to fight he continued before she could speak again if any come to meet us well be ready i trust you will had to trust if not with tynan whom shed known all of her life where would she begin larkin and the others will be waiting for you ill expect their return shortly after sunset with word that you arrived safe and have taken up the post you can depend on it and on me my lady he took both her hands because they were friends because he was the first she would send out she leaned up to kiss him i do depend she squeezed his fingers keep my cousins out of trouble that my lady may be beyond my skills his gaze shifted from her face my lord lady with her hands still caught in tynans moira turned to cian and glenna a wet day for traveling cian commented theyll likely have a few troops posted along the way to give you some exercise so the men hope tynan glanced over to where nearly a hundred men were saying goodbye to their families and sweethearts then turned back so his eyes met cians are we ready youre adequate before moira could snap at the insult tynan roared out a laugh high praise from you he said and clasped hands with cian thank you for the hours and the bruises make good use of them slán leat slán agat he shot glenna a cocky grin as he mounted ill send your man back to you my lady see that you do blessed be tynan in your name majesty he said to moira then wheeled his mount fall in moira watched as the scattered men formed lines and watched in the rain as her cousin oran and two other officers rode out leading her foot soldiers to the first league toward war it begins she murmured may the gods watch over them better cian said if they watch over themselves still he stood as she did until the first battalion of gealls army was out of sight chapter g lenna frowned over her tea as with moiras prodding cian related his interlude with lilith the three of them took the morning meal together in private similar to what happened with blair then and with me back in new york id hoped hoyt and i had blocked that sort of thing possibly you have on humans he added vampire to vampire is likely a different matter particularly when the one intruding is the sire glenna finished yes i see still there should be a way to shut her out its hardly worth your time and energies its not a problem for me you say that now but it upset you he glanced at moira upset is a strong word in any case she left in what well call a huff something good came out of it glenna continued for her to come to you try to deal she cant be as confident as shed like to be on the contrary she believes absolutely that shell win her wizards shown her midir you said nothing of this last night it didnt come up cian said easily in truth hed thought long and hard before deciding it should be told she claims hes shown her victory and in my opinion she believes any losses weve dealt her thus far are of little importance to her momentary annoyances slaps to the pride nothing more we make destiny with every turn every choice moira kept her eyes level with cians this war isnt won until its won by her by us her wizard tells her shows her what she wants to hear wants to see i agree glenna said how else would he keep his skin intact i wont say youre wrong either of you with a careless shrug cian picked up a pear but that kind of absolute belief can be a dangerous weapon weapons can be turned against the one who holds them the deeper we prick under her skin the more reckless she might be just what do we use for the needle moira demanded im working on that ive something that may work glenna narrowed her eyes as she stirred her tea if her midir can open the door for her to come into your head cian i can open it too i wonder how lilith would like a visit biting into the pear cian sat back well now arent you the clever girl yes i am ill need you both of you why dont we finish off breakfast with a nice little spell i t wasnt little and it wasnt nice it took glenna more than an hour to prepare her tools and ingredients she ground flourite turquoise set them aside she gathered cornflower and holly sprigs of thyme she scribed candles of purple of yellow then set the fire under her cauldron these come from the earth and now will mix in water she began to sprinkle her ingredients into the cauldron for dreaming words for sight for memory moira would you set the candles in a circle around the cauldron she continued to work as moira set the candles ive actually been thinking about trying this since what happened with blair ive been working it out in my head how it might be done shes hit you hard every time youve used magic to look into her bases cian reminded her so be sure i wouldnt enjoy having hoyt try to toss me off a cliff again because i let something happen to you it wont be me at least not front line she brushed her hair back as she looked over at him itll be you well then thats perfect its risky so youre the one who has to be sure well its the guts and glory business isnt it he moved forward to peer into the cauldron and what will i be doing observing initially if you choose to make contact itll be up to you and ill need your word that youll break it off if things get dicey otherwise well yank you back and that wont be pleasant youll probably have the mother of all headaches and a raging case of nausea what fun funs just beginning she walked over unlocked a small box then held up a small figure carved in wax cians brows shot up a strong likeness you are clever sculptings not my strongest skill but i can handle a poppet glenna turned the figure of lilith around so moira could see i dont generally make them its intrusive and dangerous to the party youve captured but the harmnone rule doesnt apply to undead present company excepted appreciated theres just one little thing i need from you which is blood cian did nothing more than look resigned naturally just a few drops after i bind the poppet i have nothing of hers hair nail clippings but you mixed blood once upon a time i think itll do the job she hesitated twisting the chain of her pendant around her fingers and maybe this is a bad idea its not moira set the last candle its time we push into her mind as shes pushed into all of ours its a good hot needle under the skin if youre asking me and cian deserves to give her a taste of her own she straightened will we be able to watch thirsty for some vengeance yourself cian questioned moiras eyes were cold smoke parched will we if all goes as it should glenna took a breath ready for some astral projection she asked cian as ill ever be step inside the circle of candles both of you youll need to achieve a meditative state cian moira and i will be your watchers and the observers well hold your body to this plane while your mind and image travel is it true moira asked her that it helps hold a traveling spirit to the safety of its world if it carries something from someone of it glenna pushed at her hair again its a theory then take this she tugged off the band of beads and leather that bound her braid in case the theorys true after giving it a dubious frown cian shoved it in his pocket im armed with hair trinkets glenna picked up a small bowl of balm focus open the chakras she said as she rubbed the balm on his skin relax your body open your mind she looked at moira well cast the circle imagine light soft blue light this is protection while they cast cian focused on a white door it was his habitual symbol when he chose to meditate when he was ready the door would open and he would go through it he has a strong mind glenna told moira and a great deal of practice he told me he studied in tibet never mind she said with a wave of her hand im stalling im a little nervous her wizard isnt any stronger than you what he can do you can do damn right gotta say though i hope to hell lilith is sleeping should be really should be glenna glanced at the window at the thinning rain were about to find out shed left an opening in the poppet and prepared to fill it with grains of graveyard dirt rosemary and sage ground amethyst and quartz you have to control your emotions for the binding moira set aside your hatred your fear we desire justice and sight lilith can be harmed and we can use magic to do so but cian will be a conduit i wouldnt want any negativity to backwash on him justice then its enough glenna closed the poppet with a plug of wax we call on maat goddess of justice and balance to guide our hand with this image we send magic across air across land she placed a white feather against the doll wrapped it in black ribbon give the creature whose image i hold dream and memory ancient and old she handed the ritual knife to moira nodded sealed by blood she shed bound now with these drops of red cian showed no reaction when moira lifted his hand to draw the knife over his palm mind and image of the life she took joins her now so he may look and while we watch we hold him safe in hand and heart until he chooses to depart through us into her this magic streams take our messenger into her dream open doors so we may see as we will so mote it be glenna held the poppet over the cauldron and releasing it left it suspended on will and air take his hand she said to moira and hold on when moiras hand clasped his cian didnt go through the door he exploded through it flying through a dark even his eyes couldnt conquer he felt moiras hand tighten strong on his in his mind he heard her voice cool and calm were with you we wont let go there was moonlight sprinkling through the dark to bring blurry smears of shape and shadow there were scents flowers and earth water and woman humans there was heat temperature meant little to him but he could feel the shift of it from the damp chill hed left behind a baking heat eased only a little by a breeze off the water sea he corrected it was an ocean with waves lapping at the sugar of sand and there were hills rising up from the beach olive trees spread over the terraces of those hills and on one of the rises the highest stood a temple white as the moonlight with its marble columns overlooking that ocean the trees gardens and pools overlooking too the man and woman who lay together on a white blanket edged in gold on the sparkling sand near the play of white foam he heard the womans laugh the husky sound of a roused woman and knew it was lilith knew it was liliths memory or her dream hed fallen into so he stood apart and watched as the man slid the white robe from her shoulders and bent his head to her breasts s weet so sweet his mouth on her everything inside her ebbed and flowed as the tide how could it be forbidden the beauty of this her body was meant for his her spirit her mind her soul had been created by the gods as the mate for his she arched offering with her fingers combing gently through his sunkissed hair he smelled of the olive trees and the sunlight that ripened their fruit her love her only she murmured it to him as their lips met again and again with a hunger that built beyond bearing her eyes were full of him when at last his body joined with hers the pleasure of it brought tears glimmering turned her sighs to helpless gasps love swarmed through her pounded in her heart a thousand silken fists she held him closer closer crying out her joy with an abandon that dared even the gods to hear cirio cirio she cradled his head on her breast my heart my love he lifted his head brushing at her gilded hair even the moon pales against your beauty lilia my queen of the night the nights are ours but i want the sun with you the sun that gilds your hair and skin that touches you when i cannot i want to walk beside you proud and free he only rolled onto his back look at the stars theyre our torches tonight we should swim under them bathe this heat away in the sea instantly pique hardened the sleepy joy from her face why wont you speak of it its too hot a night for talk and trouble he spoke carelessly as he sifted sand through his fingers come well be dolphins and play but when he took her hands to pull her up she drew them away with a sharp sulky jerk but we must talk we must plan my sweet we have so little time left tonight we could have forever every night we have only to leave to run away together i could be your wife give you children leave run away he threw back his head with a laugh what foolishness is this come now come i have only an hour left lets swim awhile and ill ride you on the waves its not foolishness this time she slapped his hand away we could sail from here to anywhere we wished be together openly in the sunlight i want more than a few hours in the dark with you cirio you promised me more sail away like thieves my home is here my family my duty your coffers she said viciously or your fathers and what of it do you think i would smear my family name by running away with a temple priestess living like paupers in some strange land you said you could live on my love alone words are easy in the heat be sensible his tone cajoling he skimmed a finger down her bare breast we give each other pleasure why does there need to be more i want more i love you i broke my vows for you willingly he reminded her for love love doesnt feed the belly lilia or spend in the marketplace dont be sad now ill buy you a gift something gold like your hair i want nothing you can buy only freedom i would be your wife you cannot if we attempted such madness and were caught wed be put to death i would rather die with you than live without you i value my life more it seems than you value either of ours he nearly yawned so lazy was his voice i can give you pleasure and the freedom of that but as for a wife you know one has already been chosen for me you chose me you said enough enough he threw up his hands but seemed more bored by the conversation than angry i chose you for this as you chose me you were hungry to be touched i saw it in your eyes if youve spun a web of fantasy where we sail off its your own doing you pledged yourself to me my body and youve had good use of it he belted on his robes as he rose i would have kept you as mistress happily but i have no time or patience for ridiculous demands from a temple harlot harlot the angry flush drained leaving her face white as the marble columns on the hillside you took my innocence you gave it you cant mean these things she knelt clasping her hands like a woman at prayer youre angry because i pushed you well speak no more of it tonight well swim as you said and forget all these hard words its too late for that do you think i cant read whats in your mind now youll nag me to death over what can never be just as well weve challenged the gods long enough you cant mean to leave me i love you if you leave me ill go to your family ill tell speak of this and ill swear you lie youll burn for it lilia he bent down ran a finger over the curve of her shoulder and your skin is too soft too sweet for the fire dont dont turn from me it will all be as you say as you like ill never speak of leaving again dont leave me begging only spoils your beauty she called out to him in shock in terrible grief but he strode away as if he couldnt hear her she threw herself down on the blanket wildly weeping pounding her fists the pain of it was like the fire hed spoken of burning through her so that her bones seemed to turn to ash how could she live with the pain love had betrayed her and used her and cast her aside love had made her a fool and still her heart was full of it she would cast herself into the sea and drown she would climb to the top of the temple and fling herself off she would simply die here from the shame and the pain kill him first she choked out as she raged ill kill him first then myself blood his and mine together that is the price of love and betrayal she heard a movement just a whisper on the sand and flung herself up with the joy hed come back to her my love yes i will be his hair was black flowing past his shoulders he wore long robes the color of the night his eyes were the same so black they seemed to shine she grabbed up her toga held it to her breasts i am a priestess of this temple you have no leave to walk here i walk where i will so young he murmured as those black eyes traveled over her so fresh you will leave here in my time ive watched you these past three nights lilia you and the boy you waste yourself on how dare you you gave him love he gave you lies both are precious tell me how would you like to repay him for his gift to you she felt something stir in her the first juices of vengeance he deserves nothing from me neither he nor any man how true so youll give to me what no man deserves fear rushed in and she ran with it but somehow he was standing in front of her smiling that cold smile what are you ah insight i knew id chosen well i am what was before your weak and rutting gods were belched out of the heavens she ran again a scream locked in her throat but he was there blocking her way her fear had jumped to terror its death to touch a temple priestess and death is such a fascinating beginning i seek a companion a lover a woman a student you are she i have a gift for you lilia this time when she ran he laughed laughed still when he plucked her off her feet tossed her sobbing to the ground she fought scratching biting begging but he was too strong now it was his mouth on her breast and she wept with the shame of it even as she raked her nails down his cheek yes yes its better when they fight youll learn their fear is perfume their screams music he caught her face in his hand forced her to look at him now into my eyes into them he drove himself into her her body shuddered quaked bucked from the shock and the unspeakable thrill did he take you so high no no the tears began to dry on her cheeks instead of clawing beating her hands dug into the sand searching for purchase trapped in his eyes her body began to move with his take more you want more he said pain is so arousing he plunged harder so deep she feared she might rend in two but still her body matched his pace still her eyes were trapped by his when his went red her heart leaped with fresh fear and yet that fear was squeezed in a fist of terrible excitement he was so beautiful her human lover pale beside this dark damning beauty i give you the instrument of your revenge i give you your beginning you have only to ask me for it ask me for my gift yes give me your gift give me revenge give me her body convulsed when his fangs struck and every pleasure she had known or imagined diminished beside what rushed into her here here was the glory shed never found in the temple the burgeoning black power shed always known stretched just beyond her fingertips here was the forbidden shed longed for it was she writhing in that pleasure and power that brought him to climax and she without being told reared up to drink the blood shed scored from his cheek smiling through bloody lips she died and woke in her bed two thousand years after the dream her body felt bruised tender her mind muddled where was the sea where was the temple cirio a romantic who would have guessed cian stepped out of the shadows to call out for the lover who spurned and betrayed you jarl it was the name shed called her maker but as dream separated from reality she saw it was cian so youve come after all my offer but it wasnt quite clear what became of the boy as if settling in for a cozy chat cian sat on the side of the bed what boy davey no no not the whelp you made your lover the one you had in life her lips trembled as she understood so you toy with my dreams what does that matter to me but she was shaken down to the pit of her he was called cirio what do you think became of him i think your master arranged for him to be your first kill she smiled with one of her sweetest memories he pissed himself as jarl held him out to me and he sniveled like a child as he begged for his life i was new and still had the control to keep him alive for hours long after he begged for his death ill do better with you ill give you years of pain she swiped out cursed when her raking nails passed through him entertaining isnt it and jarl how long before you did for him she sat back sulking a little then shrugged nearly three hundred years i had a lot to learn from him he began to fear me because my power grew and grew i could smell his fear of me he would have ended me if i hadnt ended him first you were called lilia lily the pitiful human i was yes he named me lilith when i woke she twirled a lock of her hair around her finger as she studied cian do you have some foolish hope that by learning my beginning youll find my end she tossed the covers aside rose to walk naked to a silver pitcher when she poured the blood into a cup her hands trembled again lets speak frankly here cian suggested its only you and i which is odd you dont sleep with lora or the boy or some other choice today even i occasionally seek solitude all right so to be frank its strange isnt it disorienting to go back even in dreams to human to see your own end own beginning as if it just happened to feel human again or as best we can remember it feels to be human almost as an afterthought she shrugged into a robe i would go back to being human his brows lifted you now you surprise me to have that moment of death and rebirth the wonderful staggering thrill of it id go back to being weak and blind just to experience the gift again of course you remain predictable he got to his feet know this if you and your wizard steer my dreams again ill return the favor threefold youll have no rest from me or from yourself he faded away but he didnt go back though he could feel the tugs from moiras mind from glennas will he lingered he wanted to see what lilith would do next she heaved the cup and what was left of the blood in it against the wall she smashed a trinket box pounded holes into the wall with her fists until they bled then she screamed for a guard bring that worthless wizard to me bring him in chains bring him no wait wait she turned away in an obvious fight for control ill kill him if he crosses paths with me now then what good will he be to me bring me someone to eat she whirled back a male young twenty or so blond if we have one go alone she rubbed her temple ill kill him again she murmured ill feel better then ill call him cirio and kill him again she snatched her precious mirror from the bureau and seeing her own face reminded her why she would keep midir alive hed given her this gift there i am she said softly so beautiful the moon pales yes yes it does im right here ill always be here the rest is ghosts and here i am picking up a brush she began to groom her hair and to sing with tears in her eyes d rink this glenna pushed a cup to cians lips and immediately had it pushed aside im fine im not after drinking whiskey or swooning on you without it youre pale his lips quirked part of the whole undead package well that was quite a ride since he refused it glenna took a sip of the whiskey herself then passed it off to moira eticket she didnt sense us she said to moira id like to think my blocks and binding were enough but i think in large part she was just too caught up to feel us she was so young moira sat now so young and in love with that worthless prick of a man i dont know what language they were speaking i could understand her strangely enough but i didnt know the tongue greek she started out a priestess for some goddess virginitys part of the job description cian wished for blood settled for water and save your pity she was ripe for what happened as you were moira shot back and dont pretend you felt nothing for her we were linked i felt your pity her heart was broken and moments later shes raped and taken by a demon i can despise what lilith is and feel pity for lilia lilia was already half mad he said flatly maybe the change is what kept her relatively sane all this time i agree im sorry glenna said to moira and i got no pleasure out of seeing what happened to her but there was something in her eyes in her tone and god in the way she ultimately responded to jarl she wasnt quite right moira even then then she might have died by her own hand or been executed for killing the man who used her but shed have died clean she sighed and we might not be here discussing the matter it all gives you a headache if you think about it hard enough i have a delicate question which is more for my own curiosity than anything else she cleared her throat before asking cian how she responded as glenna said is that not usual most fight or freeze with fear she on the other hand participated after the delicacy escapes me cian admitted after she began to feel pleasure from the rape it was rape no mistake and no sane woman gains pleasure from being brutalized and forced she was already his before the bite moira murmured he knew she would be recognized that in her she knew what to do to change to drink from him everything ive read has claimed the victim must be forced or told it must be offered she took she understood and she wanted we know more than we did which is always useful cian commented and the episode unnerved her an added benefit ill sleep better having accomplished that now its past my bedtime ladies moira watched him go he feels why do you think he goes to such lengths to pretend he doesnt feelings cause pain a great deal of the time i think when youve seen and done so much feelings could be like a constant ache glenna laid a hand on moiras shoulder denial is just another form of survival feelings loosed can be either balm or weapon what would his be she wondered if fully freed chapter t he rain slid into a soggy twilight that curled a smoky fog low over the ground as night crept in no moon no stars could break through the gloom moira waded through the river of fog over the courtyard to stand beside glenna theyre nearly home glenna murmured later than wed hoped but nearly home ive had the fires lit in your room and larkins and baths are being prepared theyll be cold and wet thanks i didnt think of it when we were in ireland you thought of all the comfort details now its for me like glenna moira watched the skies ive ordered food for the family parlor unless youd rather be private with hoyt no no theyll want to report everything at once then well be private she lifted her hand to grip her cross and the amulet she wore with it i didnt know id be so worried weve been in the middle of a fight outnumbered and i havent obsessed like this because you were with him to love and to wait is worse than a wound one of the lessons ive learned there have been so many of them youd be worried about larkin i know and about tynan now he has feelings for you moira understood glenna didnt mean larkin i know our mothers hoped we might make a match of it but whatever needs to be there isnt there for me and hes too much a friend maybe having no lover to wait for no lover to lose makes it easier for me to bear all of this glenna waited a beat but but moira said with a half laugh i envy you the torture of waiting for yours from where she stood moira saw cian the shape of him coming through the gloom from the stables she noted rather than the cloak the men of geall would wear against the chill and rain he wore a coat similar to blairs long and black and leather it billowed in the mists as he crossed to them with barely a sound of his boots against the wet stones they wont come any sooner for you standing in the damp he commented theyre nearly home glenna stared up at the sky as if she could will it to open and send hoyt down to her hell know im waiting if you were waiting for me red i wouldnt have left in the first place with a smile she tipped her head so it leaned against his shoulder when he put his arm around glenna moira saw in the gesture the same affection she herself had with larkin the kind that came from the heart through family there cian said softly dead east you see them glenna strained forward you can see them give it a minute and so will you the moment she did her hand squeezed moiras thank god oh thank god the dragon soared through the thick air a glimmer of gold with riders on its back even as it touched down glenna was sprinting over the stones when he dismounted hoyts arms opened to catch her thats lovely to see moira spoke quietly as hoyt and glenna embraced so many said goodbye today and will tomorrow its lovely to see someone come home to waiting arms before her hed most often prefer coming back to solitude women change things she glanced up at him only women people then but women they alter universes just by being women for better or worse depends on the woman doesnt it and the prize or the man shes set her sights on with this she left his side to rush toward larkin despite the fact that he was dripping she hugged him hard i have food drink hot water all you could wish im so glad to see you all of you but when she would have turned from larkin to welcome the others he gripped her hard moira felt her relief spin on its head to fear what what happened we should go in hoyts voice was quiet and tight we should go in out of the wet tell me what happened moira drew away from larkin tynans troop was set upon at the near halfway point she felt everything inside her freeze oran tynan alive tynan was injured but not seriously six others she took larkins arm digging her fingers in dead or captured five dead one taken several others wounded two badly we did what we could for them the cold remained like ice over her heart you have the names the dead the wounded and the other we have them yes moira it was young sean taken the smithys son her belly twisted with the knowledge that what the boy faced would be worse than death ill speak to their families say nothing to anyone until ive spoken to their families ill go with you no no this is for me you need to get dry and warm and fed its for me to do larkin its my place we wrote down the names blair took a scrap of paper out of her pocket im sorry moira we knew this would come she slipped the paper inside her cloak out of the wet ill come to the parlor as soon as im able so you can tell me the details of it for now the families need to hear this from me lot of weight blair declared when moira walked away shell bear it cian looked after her its what queens do s he thought it would crush her but she did bear it while mothers and wives wept in her arms she took the weight she knew nothing of the attack but told each and every one their son or husband or brother had died bravely died a hero it was what needed to be said it was worse with seans parents worse to see the hope in the blacksmiths eyes the tears of that hope blurring his wifes she couldnt bring herself to snuff it out so left them with it with the prayers that their son would somehow escape and return home when it was done she went to her rooms to put the names into a painted box she would keep now beside her bed there would be other lists she knew this was only the first and every name of every one who gave his or her life would be written down and kept in that box with it she put a sprig of rosemary for remembrance and a coin for tribute after closing the box she buried her need for solitude for grieving and went to the parlor to hear how it had been done conversation stopped when she entered and larkin rose quickly my father has just left us ill go bring him back if you like no no let him be with your mother your sister moira knew her pregnant cousins husband was to lead tomorrows troop ill warm you some food no you will eat glenna said even as moira opened her mouth consider it medicine but youll eat while glenna put food on a plate cian poured a stiff dose of apple brandy into a cup he took it to her drink this first youre white as wax with this ill have color and a swimming head but she shrugged tossed it back like water have to admire a woman who can take a slug like that impressed he took the empty glass then went back to sit it was horrible at least i can admit that here to all of you it was horrible moira sat down at the table then pressed her hands to her temples to look into their faces and see the change and know theyll forever be changed because of what youve brought to them to whats been taken from them you didnt bring it anger lashed in glennas voice as she slapped a plate down in front of moira you didnt take it i didnt mean the war or the death but the news of it the hardest was the one who was taken prisoner the smithys boy sean his parents still have hope how could i tell them hes worse than dead i couldnt cut that last thread of hope and wonder if it would be kinder if i had she let out a breath then straightened glenna was right she would eat tell me what you know they were in the ground hoyt began as they were when they set upon blair tynan said no more than fifty but the men were taken by surprise he told us it seemed they didnt care if they were cut down but charged and fought like mad animals two of our men fell in the first instant and they gained three horses from us in the confusion of the battle nearly a third of the horses that went with them four maybe five of them took the smithys son alive from what those who tried to save him said they took him off heading east while the rest held their line and battled back they killed more than twenty and the others scattered and ran as the tide turned it was a victory you have to look at it that way blair insisted you have to your men took out over twenty vamps on their first engagement your casualties were light in comparison dont say every death is one too many she added quickly i know that but this is the reality of it their training held up i know youre right and ive already told myself the same but it was their victory too they wanted a prisoner no reason else to take one their mission must have been to take one alive whatever the cost of it youre right no argument but i dont see that as a victory in their column it was stupid and it was a waste say five for the prisoner those vamps had stayed and fought theyd have taken more of ours alive or dead my take is that lilith ordered this because she was feeling pissy or it was impulse but it was also bad strategy moira ate food she couldnt taste while she considered it the way she sent king back to us it was petty and vicious but playful in her way she thinks these things will undermine us crush our spirits how can she know us so little youve lived half her time she said to cian you know better i find humans interesting she finds them tasty at best you dont have to know the mind of a cow to herd them up for steaks especially if youve got a whole gang to handle the roping and riding blair put in just following your metaphor she said to cian i hurt her girl so she needs some payback for that we took three of her bases should add we cleared out the second two locations this morning they were empty larkin stated she hadnt bothered to set traps there or base any of her troops added to that glenna told us how you played with her while we were gone sum of it is this was tit for tat but she loses more than we do doesnt make it any easier on the families of the dead blair added and tomorrow i send more out phelan moira reached out for larkin i cant hold him back ill speak to sinann but no thats for me i expect our father has already talked to her but ill see her myself she nodded and tynan his wounds a gash along the hip hoyt treated the wounded he was doing well when we left them theyre secured for the night well then well pray for sun in the morning s he had another duty to see to her women had a sitting room near her own chambers where they could sit and read or do needlework or gossip moiras mother had made it a cheerful intensely female space with soft fabrics many cushions pots filled with flowering plants the fire here was habitually of apple wood for the scent and there were wall sconces of pretty winged faeries when she was crowned moira had given her own women leave to make any changes they liked but the room remained as it had in all her memory her women were there now waiting for her to retire for the night or simply dismiss them they rose when she entered and curtseyed were all women here now for now in this place were all only women she opened her arms to ceara oh my lady cearas eyes already red and swollen from weeping overflowed as she rushed into moiras embrace dwyn is dead my brother is dead im sorry im so sorry here now here she led ceara to a seat holding her close and she wept with her as shed wept with cearas mother and all the others they buried him there in a field by the road they couldnt even bring him home he had no wake well have a holy man consecrate the ground and well build a monument to those who fell today he was eager to go to fight he turned and waved at me before he marched off youll have some tea now her own eyes red from weeping isleen set the pot down youll have some tea ceara and you my lady thank you ceara mopped at her damp face i dont know what id have done these past hours without isleen and dervil its good that you have your friends but youll have your tea then youll go to your family youll need your family now you have my leave for as long as you want it theres something more i want your majesty something i ask you to give me in my brothers name moira waited but ceara said nothing more would you ask me to give you my word on something without knowing what i promise my husband marches tomorrow moira felt her stomach sink ceara she reached over smoothed a hand on cearas hair sinanns husband marches with the sunrise as well she carries her third child and still i cant spare her from his leaving i dont ask you to spare me i ask you allow me to march with him to stunned moira sat back ceara your children will be with my mother and as safe and well as they can be here with her but my man goes to war and ive trained as he has why am i to sit and wait ceara held out her hands peck at needlework walk in the garden when he goes to fight you said we would all need to be ready to defend geall and worlds beyond it ive made myself ready your majesty my lady i beg your leave to go with my husband on the morrow saying nothing moira got to her feet she moved to the window to look out at the dark the rain at last had stopped but the mists from it swarmed like clouds have you spoken with him on this moira asked at length i have and his first thought was for my safety but he understands my mind is set and why why is it hes my heart ceara stood laid a hand on her breast i wouldnt leave my children unprotected but trust my mother to do all she can for them my lady have we we women trained and slogged in the mud all this time only to sit by the fire no no you havent im not the only woman who wants this moira turned now youve spoken to others she looked at dervil and isleen both of you want this as well she nodded i see i was wrong to hold you back arrangements will be made then im proud to be a woman of geall f or love moira thought as she sat to make another list of names for love as much as duty the women would go and fight for geall but it was the husbands and lovers the families inside of geall that made them reach for the sword who did she fight for who was there for her to turn to the night before a battle to reach for that warmth for that reason to fight the days ticked away and samhain loomed like a bloodied ax over her head and here she sat alone as she sat alone every night would she reach for a book again or another map another list or would she wander the room again the gardens and courtyards wishing for him she thought wishing he would put his hands on her again and make her feel so full so alive so bright wishing hed share with her what shed seen in him the night hed played music and had stirred her heart as truly as hed stirred her blood shed fought and shed bled would fight and bleed again she would ride into battle as queen with the sword of gods in her hand but here she sat in her quiet room wishing like a blushing maid for the touch and the heat of the only one whod ever made her pulse quicken surely that was foolish and wasteful and it was an insult to women everywhere she rose to pace as she considered it aye it was insulting and smallminded she sat and wished for the same reasons shed held back sending the women on the march because it was traditional for the man to come to the woman it was traditional for the man to protect and defend things had changed hadnt they hadnt she spent weeks in a world and time where women like glenna and blair held their own and more at every turn so if she wanted cians hands on her shed see that he put them there and that would be that she started to sweep out of the room remembered her appearance she could do better if she was about to embark on seducing a vampire shed have to go well armed she stripped off her dress she might have wished for a bath or oh the wonderfully hot shower of ireland but she made do washing from the basin of scented water she creamed her skin imagined cians long fingers skimming over it heat was already balling in her belly and throbbing along nerves as she chose her best nightrobe brushing her hair she had a moment to wish shed asked glenna to teach her how to do a simple glamour though it seemed to her that her cheeks were becomingly flushed her eyes held a glint she bit her lips until they hurt but thought theyd pinked and plumped nicely she stood back from the long glass studied herself carefully from every angle she hoped she looked desirable taking a candle she left the room with the sheer determination she wouldnt return to it a virgin i n his room cian pored over maps he was the only one of the circle whod been denied a look at the battlefield either in reality or dreams he was going to correct that time was a problem five days march well he could ride it in two perhaps less but that meant hed need a safe place to camp during the daylight one of the bases the others had secured would do once hed taken his survey he could simply relocate in one of those bases until samhain get out of the bloody castle and away from its alltootempting queen thered be objections that was annoying but they could hardly lock him in a dungeon and make him stay put theyd be leaving themselves in another week or so hed just ride point he could ride out with the troops in the morning if the sun stayed back or simply wait for sundown sitting back he sipped blood hed laced with whiskey his own version of a sleepinducing cocktail he could just go now couldnt he no arguments from his brother or the others if he just rode off hed have to leave a note he supposed odd to have people whod actually be concerned for his welfare and somewhat pleasant though it added certain responsibilities hed just pack and go he decided pushing the drink aside no muss no fuss and he wouldnt have to see her again until they caught up to him he picked up the band of beaded leather hed failed to give back toyed with it if he left tonight he wouldnt have to see her or smell her or imagine what it would be like to have her under him in the dark he had a bloody good imagination he got to his feet to decide what gear would be most useful for the journey and frowned at the knock on his door likely hoyt he decided well he just wouldnt mention his plans and thereby avoid a long irritating debate on the matter he considered not answering at all but silence and a locked door wouldnt stop his brother the sorcerer he knew it was moira the moment his hand touched the latch and he cursed he opened the door intending to send her on her way quickly so he could be on his she wore white thin flowing white with something filmy over it that was nearly the same gray as her eyes she smelled like spring young and full of promise need coiled inside him like snakes do you never sleep he demanded do you she swept by him the move surprising him enough that he didnt block it well come right in make yourself at home thank you she said it politely as if his words hadnt dripped with sarcasm then she set down her candle and turned to the the fire he hadnt bothered to light lets see if i can do this i practiced until my ears all but bled dont speak youll distract me she held out a hand toward the fire focused imagined pushed a single weak flame flickered so she narrowed her eyes and pushed harder there there was absolute delight in her voice when the turf caught now im surrounded by bloody magicians both her hair and her robes fanned out as she turned its a good skill and i intend to learn more you wont find a tutor in sorcery here no she brushed back her hair but i think in other things walking back to the door she locked it then turned to him i want you to take me to bed he blinked as otherwise he might have goggled what theres not a thing wrong with your hearing so you heard me well enough i want to lie with you i thought i might try being coy or seductive but then it seemed to me youd have more respect for plain speaking the snakes coiled inside him began to writhe and bite heres plain speaking get out i see ive surprised you she wandered running a finger over a stack of books thats not easy to do so as blair would say points for me she turned again smiled again im green at this so tell me why would a man be angry to have a woman want to lie with him im not a man ah she lifted a finger to acknowledge his point but still you have needs desires youve desired me a man will put his hand on nearly any female youre not a man she shot back then grinned more points for me youre not keeping up if youve been drinking again i havent you know i havent but ive been thinking im going to war into battle i may not live through it none of us may good men died today in mud and blood and left broken hearts behind them and sex reaffirms life i know the psychology of it that aye that true enough and on a more personal level im damned i swear it if ill die a virgin i want to know what it is i want to feel it then order up a subject for stud majesty im not interested i dont want anyone else i never wanted anyone before you and havent wanted any but you since i first saw you it shocked me that i could have any such feelings for you knowing what you are but theyre inside me and they wont leave i have needs like anyone and wiles enough i think to overcome your resistance if need be though you may no longer be a randy young man found your feet havent you he muttered oh ive always had them im just careful where i step watching him measuring him she trailed a hand down one of the bedposts tell me what difference would it make to you an hour or two you havent had a woman in some time im thinking he felt like an idiot stiff and foolish and needy that wouldnt be your concern it might be ive read that when a mans been denied well say for a while it can affect his performance but you shouldnt worry about that as ive nothing to compare it to isnt that lucky for me or would be if i wanted you her head cocked and all he could see on her face was curiosity and confidence you think you can insult me away i wager any price you name that youre hard as stone right now she moved toward him i want so much cian for you to touch me im tired of dreaming of it and want to feel it the ground was crumbling under his feet had been he knew since the moment shed walked in you dont know what youre asking what youre risking the consequences are beyond you a vampire can lie with a human you wont hurt me she reached up drew the cross over her head set it aside on the table trusting soul he tried for sarcasm but the gesture had moved him confident i dont need or want a shield against you why do you never say my name what of course i do no you dont you refer to me but you never look at me and say my name her eyes were smoke now and full of knowledge names have power taken or given are you afraid of what i might take from you theres nothing for you to take then say my name moira again please she took his hand laid it on her heart dont do this cian theres your name from me cian i think if you dont touch me if you dont take me a part of me will die before i ever go to battle please she framed his face in her hands and saw at last what she needed to see in his eyes say my name moira lost he took her wrist turned his lips into her palm moira if i wasnt damned already this would send me to hell ill try to take you to heaven first if you teach me she rose to her toes drawing him down her sigh trembled out when his lips met hers chapter h ed believed his will would prevent this a thousand years he thought and sank into her and the male still deluded itself it could control the female she was leading him and had in her way been leading him to this from the first instant now he would take what she offered him what she demanded from him however selfish the act but he would use the skill of a dozen lifetimes to give her what she wanted in return youre foolish reckless to give up your innocence to such as me he skimmed a fingertip across her collarbone but you wont leave now until you have virginity and innocence arent always the same i lost my innocence before i met you the night her mother had been murdered she thought but memories of that werent for tonight tonight was for knowing him should i disrobe for you or is that for you to do he gave a short almost pained laugh before resting his brow to hers in a gesture she found surprisingly tender in such a hurry he murmured some things especially the first time theyre tasted are better savored than gulped there you see ive learned something already when you kiss me things wake up inside my body things i didnt know were sleeping there until you i dont know what you feel more than id like he combed his fingers through her hair as hed longed to for weeks more than could be good for either of us this he kissed her softly is a mistake and again deeper like her scent her taste was of springtime of sunlight and youth he craved the flavor of it filled himself on it and the quick catch of her breath as he skimmed his teeth lightly very light over her bottom lip he let his hands plunge into her hair the long sleek fall of it then under it to tease and waken the nerves along her spine when she trembled he brought his hands to her shoulders to slide the robes down and bare that soft flesh for his lips he could feel the yielding in her as well as the tremors and when his mouth brushed along her throat that seductive pulsing of blood under the skin she didnt jolt when his teeth grazed there but stiffened when he brushed his hand over her breast no one had ever touched her so intimately the flash of heat his hands brought her was a shock as was the knowledge only a thin layer of material was between his hand and her flesh then even that was gone and her nightrobes pooled around her feet her hand came up instinctively to cover herself but he only took it nipped his teeth lightly at her wrist while his eyes watched hers are you afraid a little i wont bite you no no not of that she turned the hand he held so her palm cupped his cheek theres so much happening inside of me so much new no ones ever touched me like this gathering her courage she took his other hand brought it to her breast show me more he brushed his thumb over her nipple watched the shock of pleasure flicker over her face turn that busy mind off moira it was already as if mists clouded it how could she think when her body was swimming in sensation he lifted her off her feet so that her face was suddenly on level with his then his mouth took hers into the heat again the bed was beneath her had he crossed the room how had but her mind misted over again as his hands his mouth slid like flaming velvet over her body she was a feast and hed fasted far too long but still he sampled slowly lingering over tastes and textures and with each shiver each sigh or gasp she fed his own arousal when her curious hands came too close to breaking his control he caught them in his own trapping them as he slowly mercilessly ravished her breasts she was building beneath him he could feel the power filling her harder fuller and when he pushed her to peak she bowed up riding it with a strangled cry she melted down her hands going limp under his oh the word was a long expulsion of breath oh i see you think you do his tongue traced over the thick beat of the pulse in her throat as she sighed he glided his hand between her legs and sliding into the wet heat showed her more everything went bright it blinded her the brilliance of it all but seared her eyes her skin her heart she was nothing but feelings now a mass of pleasures beyond any possibility she was the arrow from the bow and hed shot her high on an endless flight his hands simply ruled her until she was a hostage to this neverending need halfmad she struggled with his shirt i need i want i know he pulled off his shirt so she could touch and taste him in turn and let himself glide on the pleasure of her eager explorations her breath against his skin warm and quick her fingers tracing then digging when her hands gripped his hips he let her help him strip the rest of his clothes away and wasnt sure whether to be amused or flattered when her eyes went huge i i didnt realize ive seen a cock before but now he laughed oh have you now of course men bathe in the river and well and being curious youve spied on them a mans pride isnt at its ah fullest after a bath in a cold river i wont hurt you hed have to wouldnt he she thought shed read of such things and certainly shed heard the women speak of it but she wasnt afraid of the pain she feared nothing now so she laid back again braced for him but he only began to touch her again rouse her again undo her again as if she were a knot of string he wanted her drenched drowning beyond thought and nerves that tight and slender body shed stiffened in anticipation went loose again warm and soft again with that erotic flush of blood spreading under the skin look at me moira mo chroi look at me look into me this he could do with will and control he could ease that moment that flash of pain and give her only the pleasure when those heavy gray eyes blurred he pierced her he filled her her lips trembled and the moan they formed was low and deep he kept her trapped in his eyes as he began to move long slow thrusts that had the thrill of it rippling over her face over her body even when he released her from the thrall when she began to move with him her eyes stayed locked on his her heart was raging a wild drum against his chest so vital it seemed for a moment as if it beat inside him she came with a cry of wonder and abandonment at last at last he let his own need take him with her s he curled up against him a cat whod lapped up every drop of cream he would he was sure berate himself later for what hed done but for now he was content to wallow a bit i didnt know it could be like that she murmured so enormous being so wellendowed ive likely ruined you for anyone else i didnt mean the size of your pride as you called it laughing she looked up at him and saw from his lazy smile hed understood her meaning perfectly ive read of the act of course medical books storybooks but the personal experience of it is much more satisfying im happy to have assisted you in your research she rolled over so she could splay herself on him ill need to do considerably more research im thinking before i know all there is to know im greedy for knowledge damn you moira he said it with a sigh as he played with her hair youre perfect am i her already glowing cheeks went pinker with pleasure i wont argue because i feel so perfect right now thirsty though is there any water about he nudged her aside then rose to fetch the jug she sat up as he poured and her hair spilled over her shoulders and breasts he thought if he had a heartbeat the sight of her like this might stop it he handed her the cup then sat across from her on the bed this is madness you know it the worlds gone mad she replied why shouldnt we have a piece of it im not being foolish or careless she said quickly laying a hand over his i have to do so many things cian so many things where theres no choice for me this was my choice my own she drank handed him the cup so he could share will you regret something that gave us pleasure and harmed no one you havent thought about what others will think of you for sharing a bed with me listen to you worrying about my reputation of all things im my own woman and i dont need to explain to anyone whose bed i share being queen doesnt make me less a woman she interrupted a geallian woman and were known for making up our own minds i was reminded of that earlier tonight now she rose picking up her outer robe to wrap it around her he thought it was like she wrapped herself in mist one of my ladies ceara do you know who i mean ah tall dark blond hair she took you down in handtohand that she did her brother was killed today on the march he was young not yet eighteen it pierced her heart again i went to the sitting room where my ladies gather and found her there when i would have given her leave to be with her family shes loyal and thinks of her duty to you not just to me she asked if i would give her one thing in her brothers name one thing emotion quivered in her voice before she conquered it and that was to march in the morning with her husband to go from here from her children from safety and face whatever might be on the road shes not the only woman who asks to go were not weak we dont sit and wait or no longer will i was reminded of that tonight youll let her go her and any who wish it in the end some who may not wish it will be sent i didnt come to you because im weak because i needed comfort or protection i came because i wanted you i wanted this she cocked her head and with a little smile let the robe fall now it seems im wanting you again do i need to seduce you too late for that her smile widened as she moved toward the bed ive heard and ive read that a man needs a bit of time between rounds you force me to repeat myself im not a man he grabbed her hand flipped her onto the bed and under him she laughed tugged playfully at his hair isnt that handy under the circumstances later for the first time in too long to remember cian didnt slip into sleep in silence but to the quiet rhythm of moiras heart it was that heart that woke him he heard the sudden and rapid beat of it even before she thrashed in sleep he cursed remembering only then she wasnt wearing her cross nor had he taken any of glennas precautions against liliths intrusion moira he took her shoulders lifting her wake up he was on the point of shaking her out of it when her eyes flew open instead of the fear hed expected he saw grief it was a dream he said carefully only a dream lilith cant touch you in dreams it wasnt lilith im sorry i woke you youre shaking here he pulled up a blanket tossed it over her shoulders ill get the fire going again no need dont trouble she said even as he got up i should go it must be nearing dawn he simply crouched down placed the turf in the hearth you wont trust me with this its not that its not she should have gotten up quickly she realized left straight on waking for now she couldnt seem to move it wasnt lilith it was just a bad dream just but her breath began to hitch and heave rather than go to her he lit the turf then moved around the room to light candles i cant speak of it i cant of course you can maybe not to me but to glenna ill go wake her no no no she covered her face with her hands so since he was up and unlikely to sleep again for now he poured himself a cup of blood geallian women arent weak she dropped her hands and the eyes shed hidden with them went hot with insult you bloody bastard exactly so run back to your room if you cant handle it but if you stay youll pull out whatevers knotted up your guts your choice he took a chair youre big on choices so make one you want to hear my pain my grief why not to you then who it would mean so little to i dreamed as i do over and over of my mothers murder every time its clearer than it was before at first it was so muddled and pale like i saw it through a smear of mud it was easier then and now i could see it what did you see i was sleeping her eyes were huge on his face and full of pain wed had supper and my uncle larkin the family had come a little family party my mother enjoyed having them every few months we had music after and dancing she loved to dance my mother it was late when we went to bed and i fell asleep so quickly i heard her scream no one else heard moira shook her head no she didnt scream you see not out loud i dont think she screamed out loud in her head she did and i heard it in mine just once only once i thought i imagined it must have imagined it but i got up and went down to her room just to ease my mind she could see it even now she hadnt bothered with a candle because her heart was beating so fast and hard shed simply run from her room and down to her mothers door i didnt knock i was saying to myself no youll wake her just ease inside and see for yourself that shes sleeping but when i opened the door she wasnt in her bed she wasnt sleeping i heard such sounds such horrible sounds like animals like wolves but worse oh worse she paused tried to swallow through her dry throat the doors to her balcony were open and the curtains moving with the breeze i called out for her i wanted to run to the doors but i couldnt my legs felt as if theyd turned to lead i could barely make one step in front of the other i cant say it you can you walked to the door to the balcony door i saw oh god oh god oh god i saw her on the stones and the blood so much blood those things were ill be sick you wont he got up now crossed to her you wont be sick they were ripping at her and the words tore out of her now ripping at her body demons things of nightmares tearing at my mother i wanted to scream but i couldnt scream i wanted to run out and beat them off one one looked at me his eyes red my mothers blood all over his face my mothers blood he charged at the door and i stumbled back back away from her when i should have gone to her she was dead moira you knew it youd be dead if youd stepped out that door i should have gone to her it leaped at me and then i screamed and screamed and screamed even when it fell back as if it had struck a wall i screamed then it all went to black i did nothing but scream while my mother lay bleeding youre not stupid he said flatly you know you were in shock you know that what you saw was the same as being struck a stunning physical blow nothing you could have done would have saved your mother how could i leave her there cian just leave her there tears spilled from her eyes to slide down her cheeks i loved her more than anything in this world because your mind couldnt cope with what you saw with what was to you impossible she was already dead before you came into the room she was dead moira the moment you heard her scream how can you be sure if they were assassins they would have killed her instantly what came after was indulgence but death was the goal now he took her cold hands in his to warm them she would have had only a moment to feel afraid to feel the pain the rest she was beyond the rest of it she went very still stared hard into his eyes will you swear to me you believe that its not a matter of believing but knowing i can swear that to you if theyd wanted to torture her theyd have taken her somewhere where they could have taken their time what you saw was a coverup wild animals it would have been said the way it was with your father she let out a long breath then another as she saw the horrible logic of it ive been sick at the thought that she might have been alive when i got there still alive while they tore at her its somehow easier to know she wasnt she knuckled a tear away im sorry i called you a bastard i pissed you off with cool deliberation i havent spoken of that night to anyone before this i couldnt pull it out of me and look at it speak of it now you have maybe now that i have i wont see her the way she was that night maybe ill see her as she was when she was alive and happy all those paintings i have inside my head of her instead of that last one would you hold on to me for a bit he sat put his arm around her stroked her hair when she rested her head on his shoulder i feel better that ive told you it was kind of you to piss me off so i would anytime i wish i could stay just stay here in the dark and quiet stay with you but i need to go and dress i need to see the troops off at first light she tipped her head up will you kiss me good morning he met her lips with his drew the kiss out until it brought a pang to his belly she opened sleepy eyes i could feel that one right down to the soles of my feet i hope that means ill walk lighter today rising she reached for her robes you could miss me a little these next hours she told him or just lie when i see you again and say you did if i tell you i missed you it wont be a lie dressed she caught his face in her hands for one more kiss then ill settle for whatever happens to be the truth she picked up her candle went to the door after shooting him a last quick grin over her shoulder she unlatched it and opened it an instant before larkin could knock moira his smile was quick and baffled it faded instantly when he saw the rumpled bed and cian lazily wrapping a blanket around his waist it was wild rage now that had him shoving moira aside and charging cian didnt bother to block the blow but took it full on the face the second fist he caught in his hand an inch before it struck youre entitled to one but thats enough hes entitled to nothing of the sort moira had the presence of mind to shut and latch the door strike out again larkin ill kick your arse myself you fucking bastard youll answer for this undoubtedly but not to you it will be me i promise you stop it i mean it when larkins fists bunched again moira had to fight the urge to bean him with a candlestick lord larkin as your queen i command you to step back oh dont start bringing rank into it cian said easily let the boy try to defend his cousins honor ill beat you bloody unconscious out of patience moira shoved between them look at me damn your thick skull larkin look at me what room are we in here the bloody buggering bastards and do you think he dragged me in here by the hair forced himself on me youre a numbskull is what you are i walked here and i knocked on cians door i pushed myself into this room into this bed because its what i wanted you dont know what if you dare if you dare to say to me that i dont know what i want ill beat you bloody unconscious she drilled a finger into his chest to emphasize the point ive a right to this private matter and youve no say in it at all but he you its not proper bollocks to that its hardly a surprise your cousin objects to you sleeping with a vampire cian moved away from them picked up his cup deliberately he dipped a finger in licked the blood from it nasty habit i wont have you wait larkin interrupted moiras furious spate a moment id like to speak with cian in private talk only he said before moira could object my word on it she pushed a hand through her hair i dont have time for either of you and this foolishness be men then and discuss what is none of your business or concern as if im addlebrained i have to dress and speak to the troops who march today she strode to the door ill trust you not to kill each other over my private relationships she went out slammed the door make it quick cian snapped im suddenly weary of humans the worst of the temper had faded out of larkins face you think i hit you that im angry because of what you are i would have had the same reaction done the same to any man id found her with like this shes my girl after all it wasnt part of what i was thinking as i wasnt thinking in any case he shifted his feet blew out a hard breath and now that i do well it adds a complicated layer to it all but i dont want you thinking i planted one on you because youre a vampire the fact is i dont think of you that way unless well unless i think about it youre a friend to me youre one of the six of us even as he spoke the flush of temper came back and im saying clear me demanding here and now what the sodding hell you were thinking of taking advantage of my cousin has nothing to do with whether or not you have a fucking heartbeat cian waited a moment are you done with that part of the speech i am until i have an answer with a nod cian sat picked up his cup again you put me in a position dont you calling me a friend and one of you i may be the first but ill never be the second bollocks thats a kind of way out of things i trust you as i trust few others and now youve seduced my cousin cian let out a snorting laugh youre not giving her enough credit neither did i idly cian traced a finger over the beaded leather she unraveled me like a ball of yarn it doesnt excuse not making her leave but shes persuasive and stubborn i couldnt i didnt resist her he glanced over at the maps hed neglected since shed knocked on the door it wont be a problem as im leaving tonight earlier if the weather cooperates i want a firsthand look at the battlefield so shes safe from me and me from her until this is over you cant you cant larkin repeated when cian merely lifted a brow if you go like this shell think its because of her itll hurt her if im responsible for you planning to leave id decided it before she came here last night partially because id hoped to keep my hands off her obviously frustrated larkin dragged his hands through his hair as you didnt make it away quick enough for that itll just have to wait ill take you there myself by air in a few days or whenever it can be done but we six need to be together calmer larkin studied cians face we need to be one circle this is bigger than lying with or not lying with each other and that now that my bloods cooler i can say is between the two of you its not my place to interfere but damn it he continued im going to ask you one thing im going to ask you as a friend and as her blood kin standing for her father have you feelings for her true feelings you play the friendship card handily dont you you are my friend i care for you as i would a brother thats the truth from me damn it cian slammed down the cup then scowled at the blood that splattered on the maps you humans crowd me with these feelings you push them at me and into me without a single thought for how i can survive them how can you survive without them larkin wondered comfortably what difference does it make to you what i feel she needed someone not someone you her mistake cian said quietly my damnation i love her or i would have taken her before this for the sport of it i love her or id have sent her away from me last night how im not sure but i love her otherwise i wouldnt feel so goddamn desperate and you repeat that to anyone ill snap your head from your shoulders friend or not all right with a nod larkin got to his feet offered his hand i hope youll make each other as happy as youre able for as long as youre able hell cian accepted the hand what the hell are you doing here at this hour anyway oh i forgot completely i thought youd not yet be in bed i wanted to ask if youd be willing to let us my family mate your stallion with one of our mares shes in season and your vlad would be a fine sire you want to use my horse as stud i would yes if its no problem for you id have her brought to him this morning go ahead im sure hell enjoy it thanks for that well pay you the standard fee no no fee well consider this a gesture between friends between friends then thanks ill just go and find moira and let her break her temper over my head as i deserve larkin paused at the door oh the mare ive in mind for your stallion shes fetching the quick grin the quick wink as larkin went out had cian laughing despite the mess of the morning chapter a t moiras orders the flags flew at halfstaff and pipers played a requiem in the dawn light she would do more if the gods were willing for those who gave their lives in this war but for now this was all that could be done to acknowledge the dead standing in the courtyard she was torn between grief and pride as she watched the men and women the warriors prepare for the long march east shed already bid her farewells to her women and to phelan her cousins husband majesty niall the big guard who was now one of her trusted captains stepped before her should i order the gates opened in a moment you wish you were going today i serve at your pleasure my lady your wishes are your own niall and i understand them but i need you here a bit longer youll have your time soon enough they would all have their time she thought your brother and his family how are they safe thanks to lord larkin and the lady blair though my brothers leg is healing he wont be able to fight on his feet there will be more to this than swinging a sword on the battlefield aye his hand closed over the hilt of the blade at his side but in truth im ready to swing mine she nodded you will she drew a breath open the gates for the second time she watched her people march away from the safety of the castle it would be a scene repeated she knew until she herself rode through the gates leaving behind the very old the very young the ill and infirm its a clear day larkin said from beside her they should reach the first base safely saying nothing moira looked over to where sinann stood a child in her arms another in her belly one more at her skirts she never wept she wouldnt send phelan off with tears they must be like a flood inside her yet even now she wont let her children see them if courage of heart is a weapon larkin well sweep the enemy out of existence when she turned to go he fell into step with her there wasnt time he began to speak with you before or after before the ceremony her voice was cool as the morning now after you invaded my private life i didnt invade it i was just there at what was an awkward time for everyone involved cian and i resolved matters between us oh did you her eyebrows winged up as she spared him a glance hardly surprising as men will resolve matters between them one way or another dont take that royal tone with me he took her arm drew her toward one of the gardens and more privacy how im asking you would you expect me to react when ive seen youve been with him i suppose expecting you to be wellmannered enough to excuse yourself is too much to ask thats damn right when i think a man of damn near eternal experiences seduces you it was the other way around entirely he flushed scratched his head turned a frustrated circle i dont want to know the details of it if you dont mind ive apologized to him and to me what do you want from me moira i love you i expect you to understand im a woman grown and one capable of making her own decisions about taking a lover dont wince at the term she snapped impatiently i can rule i can fight i can die if need be but your sensibilities are bruised at the thought i can have a lover he thought it over aye but theyll get over it i only want more than anything never to see you hurt not in battle not in the heart is that enough her feathers smoothed out and her heart softened as it always did with him it must be as i want the same for you larkin would you say that i have a good strong mind almost too much of both at times in my mind i know that i cant have a life with cian in my head i understand that what ive done will one day cause me grief and pain and sorrow but in my heart i need what i can have with him now she brushed her fingers over the leaves of a flowering shrub the leaves would fall she thought with the first frost many things would fall when i put my head and heart together i know in both that he and i are better for what we gave to each other how can you love and turn away i don t know she looked back toward the courtyard where people were once again going about their business their routines life went on she mused whatever fell they would see that life went on your sister watched her man ride away from her and knows she might never see him alive again but she didnt weep in front of him or in front of their children when she weeps shell weep alone theyre her tears to shed so will mine be when this ends will you do something for me if i can he touched her cheek when you have tears will you remember i have a shoulder for you she smiled now i will when they parted she went to the parlor where she found blair and glenna already discussing the days schedule hoyt moira asked as she poured herself tea hard at work we had a slew of new weapons finished yesterday glenna rubbed tired eyes well be charming them twentyfour seven im going to work with some of those wholl be staying here when the rest of us leave basic precautions defensive offensive tutorials ill help you with that and you blair as soon as larkins finished playing pimp were im sorry what hes got a horny mare and cleared it with cian to have vlad give her a bang she doesnt even get dinner and drinks first i thought he told you no we had other matters and it must have slipped his mind so hes having cians stallion stand as stud her smile came slowly yes life went on thats a fine thing strong and hopeful and damn clever too as he may be starting a brilliant line there so thats what he was about knocking on cians door before sunrise he figured if cian gave the goahead he could wait blair held up a hand replay how do you know he knocked on cians door before sunrise because i was just leaving the room when larkin arrived moira sipped her tea calmly while blair slanted a look at glenna then puffed out her cheeks okay arent you going to berate and damn cian for seducing an innocent blair ran her tongue over her teeth you were in his room i dont think luring you in there to look at his etchings is his style moira slapped a hand to the table with satisfaction there i knew a woman would have more sense and a bit more respect for my own wiles and you she lifted her eyebrows at glenna have you nothing to say about it youre both going to be hurt and you both know it already so ill say i hope youre both able to give and take whatever happiness you can while you can thanks are you all right glenna asked the first time is often difficult or a little disappointing now moira smiled fully it was beautiful and thrilling and more than i imagined nothing id played through my mind was near the truth of it a guy isnt good at it after a few hundred years practice blair speculated hed be hopeless and larkin walked in when he mustve flipped he punched cian in the face but theyve made it up now as men do when they pound each other weve agreed that my choice of bedmate is mine and moved on there was a moment of unified silence as all three women rolled their eyes theres little time left before we leave the safety of this place and we can hope plenty of time after samhain to debate my choices then ill move on too blair told her larkin and i after considerable browbeating by yours truly are heading out in a couple of hours to see if we can wrangle ourselves some dragons hes still not sold on the idea but hes agreed well give it a shot if its possible it would be a great advantage for us propping her chin on her fist moira turned it over in her mind i think we could cull out those we feel may not be as strong on the field if they could ride archers in the air flaming arrows blair said with a nod their aim doesnt have to be on the money as long as they dont shoot the home team glenna finished there isnt much time left to train but its worth the try fire aye moira agreed its a strong weapon stronger yet coming from the air a pity you cant charm the sun onto the tip of an arrow glenna then this would be done im going to see if i can move larkin along blair got to her feet hesitated you know my first time i was seventeen the guy he was in a hurry and left me thinking at the end so this is it bfd something to be said for being initiated by someone who knows what hes doing and has a sense of style there is moiras smile was slow and satisfied there certainly is she sensed blair and glenna exchange another look over her head so continued to drink her tea as blair left the room do you love him moira i think theres a part of me inside me thats waited all my life to feel what i feel for him what my mother felt for my father in the short time they had what i know you feel for hoyt do you think i only imagine its love because of what he is no no i dont i have strong genuine feelings for him myself they have everything to do with who he is but moira you know you wont be able to have a life with him that is because of what he is what neither of you can change any more than the sun can fly on an arrow i listened to everything he and blair have told us about well say his species and read moira thought countless volumes of fact and lore i know hell never age hell be forever as he was in that moment before he was changed young and strong and vital i will change grow old frailer gray and lined ill have sickness and he never will she rose now to walk to a window and the slant of sunlight even if he loved as i love its no life for either of us he cant stand here as i am now and feel the sun warm on my face all wed have is the dark he cant have children so i wont be able to take away from this even that much of him i might think just a year together or five or ten just that much i might think and wish for that she murmured but however selfish my own needs might be i have a duty she turned back he could never stay here and i can never go when i fell in love with hoyt and believed that wed never be able to be together it broke my heart every day but still you loved him but still i loved him moira stood with the sun slanting at her back glinting on her crown morrigan said this is the time of knowing i know my life would be less if i didnt love him the more life the longer and harder well fight to keep it so i have another weapon inside me and ill use it m oira discovered a long day of teaching children and the old how to defend themselves and each other from monsters was more tiring than hours of sweaty physical training she hadnt known how hard it would be to tell a child that monsters were real after all her head ached from the questions and her heart was bruised from the fear shed seen she stepped out into the garden for some air and to check the sky again for larkin and blairs return theyll be back before sunset she whirled at the sound of cians voice what are you doing its still day shades deep here this time of day still he leaned back against the stones well out of direct light its a pretty spot a quiet one and sooner or later you end up here for a few minutes so youve studied my habits it passes the time glenna and i have been with the children and the old ones teaching them how to defend themselves if theres an attack here after we leave we cant spare many of the ablebodied to hold the castle the gates stay locked hoyt and glenna will add a layer of protection theyll be safe enough and if we lose therell be nothing they can do i think theres always something if you put choice and a weapon in someones hands she walked toward him did you come here to wait for me yes now that im here what do you choose to do he stayed where he was but she could see the war inside him though the air suddenly seemed to lash and swirl with that battle she stood calmly her eyes grave and patient he took her with both hands a quick and violent jerk that slammed her body to his his mouth was ravenous a fine choice she managed when she could speak again then his lips were assaulting hers again stealing both breath and will do you know what youve let loose here he demanded before she could speak he turned gripped her hands to drag her up onto his back cian what youd better hold on he ordered interrupting her baffled laugh he leaped up her arms tightened around his neck as she gasped hed simply soared up more than ten feet in the air from a stand and was scaling the walls what are you doing she risked a look down felt her stomach shudder at the drop you could have warned me youd lost your bloody mind i lost it when you walked into my room last night now he swung through the window flicked the drapes shut behind him and plunged them into the dark this is the price you pay for it if youd wanted to come back inside there are doors she let out a quick cry of alarm when he swooped her up it felt as though she was flying through the air blind in the dark her next cry was of stunned excitement as she found herself under him on the bed and his hands tugged aside clothes to take flesh wait wait i cant think i cant see too late for both his mouth silenced her and his hands drove her to a hard violent crest her body strained beneath his and he knew she was reaching reaching for the burning tip of that crest her breath sobbed against his lips as she reached it and her body went limp he gripped her wrists in his hand pulling her arms over her head she was one long line of surrender now and he sheathed himself in her she would have cried out again but she had no voice no sight and with her hands captured no hold she could do nothing but feel as he plunged himself into her battering her body with dark desperate pleasure until she was writhing then rising then recklessly matching him beat for violent beat this time the hot tip of the crest shattered her she lay scorched skin over melted bones unable to move even when he left her to light the fire and candles choice isnt always an issue he said and she thought she heard liquid being poured into a cup nor is it a weapon she felt the cup bump against her hand and managed to open her heavy eyes she made some sound took the cup but wasnt at all sure she could swallow any water then she saw the raw red burn on his hand she pushed up quickly nearly sloshing water over the rim youve burned yourself let me see i and she did see that the mark was the shape of a cross i would have taken it off hurriedly she pushed the cross and chain under her bodice small price to pay he lifted her wrist noted the faint bruising i have less control with you than id like i like that you have less give me your hand i have a little skill with healing its nothing then give me your hand its good practice for me she held hers out expectantly after a moment he sat beside her laid his hand in hers i like that you have less she said again drawing his eyes to hers i like knowing i can be wanted that much that theres something in me that pulls something in you enough that something strains nearly snaps dangerous enough when youre dealing with a human when a vampires control snaps things die youd never hurt me you love me his face went carefully blank sex rarely has anything to do with being inexperienced doesnt make me stupid or gullible is it better what she smiled at him your hand the redness has eased its fine he drew it away in fact there was no longer any burning you learn quickly i do learning is a passion for me ill tell you what ive learned of you when it comes to me you love me her lips were softly curved as she brushed at his hair you might have taken me last night in fact you would have with less resistance if it had been just for sex if it had been only need only sex you wouldnt have taken me with such care or trusted me enough to sleep awhile with me she held up a finger before he could speak theres more with you there tends to be she rose straightening her clothes when larkin came in you did nothing to stop him from striking you you love me so you were guilty about taking what you saw as my innocence you love me so youve watched me enough to know one of my favorite places you waited for me there then you brought me here because you needed me i pull at you cian as you pull at me she watched him as she sipped water you love me as i love you to your peril and yours she said with a nod we live in perilous times moira this can never dont tell me never passion vibrated in her voice and turned her eyes to hellsmoke i know i know all about never tell me today between you and me let it be today i have to fight for tomorrow and the day after and into always but with this with you its just today every today we can have dont cry id rather have the burn than the tears i wont she shut her eyes for a moment and willed herself to keep her word i want you to tell me what youve shown me i want you to tell me what i see when you look at me i love you he came to her gently touched her face with his fingertips this face those eyes all thats inside them i love you in a thousand years ive never loved another she took his hand pressed her lips to it oh look theres no burn now love healed you the strongest magic moira he kept her hand in his then laid hers against his chest if it beat it would beat for you tears stung her eyes again your heart may be still but it isnt empty it isnt silent because it speaks to me and thats enough nothing will ever be enough but it will do come well she broke off when she heard shouting from outside turning she rushed to the window drew back one of the drapes her hand went to her throat cian come look the suns low enough come look the sky was full of dragons emerald and ruby and gold their sleek bodies soared above the castle like flashing jewels in the softening light and their trumpeting calls were like a song have you ever seen anything so beautiful when his hand laid on her shoulder moira reached up clasped it listen how the people cheer them look at the children running and laughing its the sound of hope cian the sound the sight getting them here and getting them to be ridden and to respond in battle like warhorses two different matters moira but yes its a beautiful sight and a hopeful sound she watched as they began to land in all your years i imagine theres little you havent done little he agreed then had to smile but no ive never ridden a dragon and yeah damn right i want to lets go down there was still enough sunlight that he needed the bloody cloak in open spaces but despite it cian discovered he could still be enchanted and surprised when he looked into a young dragons golden eye their sinuous bodies were covered in large jeweltoned scales that were smooth as glass to the touch their wings were like gossamer and kept close into the body when they grazed along the ground but it was the eyes that captivated him they seemed to be alive with interest and intelligence even humor figured the younger ones would be easier to train blair said to him as they stood watching larkins best at communicating with them even in his regular form they trust him which is making it harder on him to use them in battle yeah my guys a softie and we went around and around about it he was hoping to convince everyone we could use them for transportation only but they could make a hell of a difference on the field or above it still i have to admit i get a little twinge at the idea myself theyre beautiful and unspoiled were going to change the second part blair let out a sigh everythings a weapon she murmured anyway want to go up bet your ass first flights with me yeah yeah she said when she saw the objection on his face you pilot your own plane ride horses leap tall buildings in a single bound but youve never ridden a dragon so youre not going solo yet she walked slowly toward one of ruby and silver shed ridden it back and still held out her hand so it would test her scent go ahead let her get acquainted her yeah i checked out the plumbing blair grinned couldnt help it cian laid his hand on the dragons side worked his way slowly to the head well now arent you a gorgeous one he began to murmur to her in irish she responded with what could only be termed a flirtatious swish of her tail hoyts got the same way with them you do blair nodded toward where hoyt was stroking sapphire scales must be a family trait hmm now why is it that her majesty there is mounting one by herself shes ridden a dragon before that is shes ridden larkin in dragon form so she knows the ropes not all shes riding lately beg your pardon just saying you two look a lot more relaxed than either of you did yesterday she gave him a wide toothy grin then swung onto the dragon alleyoop he mounted the same way hed scaled the walls with an easy and fluid leap sturdy cian commented more comfortable than they look not so very different from horseback all in all yeah if youre talking pegasus anyway you dont give them a little kick like a horse or cluck you just blair demonstrated by leaning down on the dragons neck gliding a hand over its throat with a sound like silk billowing it spread its wings and it rose up into the sky live long enough cian said behind blair you do every damn thing this has got to be one of the best there are still logistics the care and feeding dragon poop i bet itll make the roses bloom she threw back her head and laughed could be weve got to train them and their riders but these beauties catch on fast watch she leaned to the right and the dragon swerved gently to follow her direction a bit like riding a motorcycle some of that principle lean into the turns look at larkin that showoff he was riding a huge gold and doing fancy loops and turns suns nearly set cian commented give it a few minutes so i wont fry and well give him a run for his money blair shot a look over her shoulder you got it going to say something when did you not shes carrying the weight of the fricking world if what you two have going lightens that a little im for it being with larkin shifted some of mine so i hope its working for the two of you you surprise me demon hunter i surprise myself vampire but there it is suns down you ready to rock with enormous relief he shoved back the hood of the cloak lets show your cowboy some real moves chapter d avey had been liliths for nearly five years shed slaughtered his parents and younger sister one balmy summer night in jamaica the offseason vacation package airfare hotel and continental breakfast included had been a surprise thirtieth birthday gift from daveys father to his wife their first night there giddy with holiday spirit and the complimentary glasses of rum punch they had conceived a third child they were of course unaware of this and had things gone differently the prospect of a new baby would have put the skids on tropical vacations for some time to come as it was it was their last family holiday it had been during one of liliths brief and passionate estrangements from lora shed chosen jamaica on a whim and entertained herself picking off locals and the occasional tourist but shed grown tired of the taste of the men who trolled the bars she wanted some variety something a little fresher and sweeter she found just what she was looking for with the young family shed ended the mothers and little girls giggling moonlight walk along the beach swiftly and viciously still shed been impressed with the womans panicked and ineffectual struggle and her instinctive move to protect the child as theyd satisfied her hunger she might have left the man and boy splashing unaware in the surf down the beach but shed wanted to see if the father would fight for the son or beg as the mother had begged he had and had screamed at the boy to run run davey run hed shouted and his terror for his son enriched his blood to make the kill all the sweeter but the boy hadnt run hed fought too and that had impressed her more hed kicked and hed bitten and had even tried to leap on her back to save his father it was the wildness of his attack combined with his angelic face that had decided her on changing him rather than draining him and moving on when she had pressed his mouth to her bleeding breast she had felt something stirring inside her that had never stirred for another the almost maternal sensation had fascinated and delighted her so davey became her pet her toy her son her lover it pleased her how quickly how naturally hed taken to the change when she and lora had reconciled as they always did lilith had told her davey was their vampiric peter pan the little boy eternally six still like any boy of six he needed to be tended to entertained taught only more so in liliths opinion as her davey was a prince as such he had both great privilege and great duty she considered this specific hunt to be both he quivered with excitement as she dressed him in the rough clothes of a peasant boy it made her laugh to see his eyes so bright as she added to the game by smearing some dirt and blood on his face can i see can i look in your magic mirror and see myself please please of course lilith sent a quick and amused look toward lora adult to adult picking up the game lora shuddered as she picked up the treasured mirror you look terrifying lora told davey so small and weak and human carefully taking the mirror davey stared at his reflection and bared his fangs its like a costume he said and giggled i get to kill one all by myself right mama all by myself well see lilith took the mirror and bent down to kiss his filthy cheek you have a very important part to play my darling the most important part of all i know just what to do he bounced up and down on his toes i practiced and practiced i know youve worked very hard youre going to make me so proud she put the mirror aside facedown forcing herself not to take a peek at herself loras burns were still raw and pink and her reflection so distressing that lilith only looked into the charmed mirror when lora was out of the room at the knock at the door she turned that will be midir let him in davey then go out and wait with lucian were going soon yes in just a few minutes he raced to the door then stood shoulders straight while the sorcerer bowed to him davey marched out her little soldier leaving midir to shut the door behind him your majesty my lady rise lilith gave a careless wave of the hand as you see the prince is prepared are you he stood his habitual black robes whispering with the movement his face was hard and handsome framed by his flowing mane of silver hair eyes rich and black met liliths cool blue he will be protected midir glanced toward the large chest at the foot of the bed and the silver pot that stood opened on it you used the potion as i instructed i did and its your life midir if it fails it will not fail it and the chant i will use will shield him from wood and steel for three hours he will be as safe as he would be in your arms majesty if not ill kill you myself as unpleasantly as possible and to make certain of it youll go with us on this hunt she saw for just a moment both surprise and annoyance on his face then he bowed his head and spoke meekly at your command yes report to lucius hell see you mounted she turned away in dismissal you shouldnt worry lora crossed to lilith slipped her arms around her midir knows its his life if any harm comes to our sweet boy davey needs this lilith he needs the exercise the entertainment and he needs to show off a bit i know i know hes restless and bored i cant blame him itll be fine just fine she said as much to assure herself ill be right there with him let me go change your mind and let me go with you lilith shook her head brushed a kiss over loras abused cheek youre not ready for a hunt youre still weak sweetheart and i wont risk you she took loras arms gripped tight i need you on samhain fighting killing gorging on that night when weve flooded that valley with blood taken whats ours by right i want you and davey at my side i hate the wait almost as much as davey lilith smiled ill bring you back a present from tonights little game d avey rode pinion with lilith through the moonstruck night hed wanted to ride his own pony but his mama had explained that it wasnt fast enough he liked going fast feeling the wind flying toward the hunt and the kill it was the most exciting night he could remember it was even better than the present shed given him on his third birthday when shed taken him through the summer night to a boy scout camping ground and that had been such fun the screaming and the running and the crying the chomp chomp chomping it was better than hunting the humans in the caves or burning a vampire whod been bad it was better than anything he could remember his memories of his human family were vague there were times he woke from a dream and for a moment was in a bedroom with pictures of race cars on the walls and blue curtains at the windows there were monsters in the closet of the bedroom and he cried until she came she had brown hair and brown eyes sometimes he would come in too the tall man with the scratchy face hed chase the monsters away and she would sit and stroke his hair until he fell asleep again if he tried very hard he could remember splashing in the water and the feel of the wet sand going gooshy under his feet and the man laughing as the waves splashed them then he wasnt laughing he was screaming and he was shouting run run davey run but he didnt try very hard very often it was more fun to think about hunting and playing his mother let him have one of the humans for a toy if he was very very good he liked best the way they smelled when they were afraid and the sounds they made when he started to feed he was a prince and could do anything he wanted almost he would show his mother tonight that he was a big boy now then there would be no more almost when they stopped the horses he was almost sick with the thrill of what was to come they would go on foot from here and then it would be his turn his mother held tight to his hand and he wished she wouldnt he wanted to march like lucius and the other soldiers he wanted to carry a sword instead of the little dagger hidden under his tunic still it was fun to go so fast faster than any human across the fields toward the farm they stopped again and his mother crouched down to him to take his face in her hands do just the way we practiced my sweet boy youll be wonderful ill be very close every minute he puffed out his chest im not afraid of them theyre just food behind him lucius chuckled he may be small your majesty but hes a warrior to the bone she rose and her hand stayed on daveys shoulder as she turned to midir your life she said quietly begin spreading his arms in the black robes midir began his chant lilith gestured so that the men spread out then she lucius and davey moved closer to the farm one of the windows showed the flickering glow of a fire banked for the night there was the smell of horses closed inside the stable and the first hints of human it stirred hunger and excitement in daveys belly be ready she told lucius my lady i would give my life for the prince yes i know she laid a hand briefly on luciuss arm thats why youre here all right davey make me proud inside the farmhouse tynan and two others stood guard it was nearly time to wake their relief and he was more than ready for a few hours sleep his hip ached from the wound hed suffered during the attack on their first days march he hoped when he was able to close his gritty eyes he wouldnt see the attack again good men lost he thought slaughtered the time was coming when he would avenge those men on the battlefield he only hoped that if he died there he fought strong and brave first and destroyed a like number of the enemy he shifted his stance preparing to order the relief watch when a sound brought his hand to the hilt of his sword his eyes sharpened his ears pricked it might have been a night bird but it had sounded so human tynan yes i hear it he said to one of the others on guard it sounds like weeping stay alert no one is to he trailed off as he spotted a movement there near the northmost paddock do you see ah in the name of all the gods its a child a boy he thought though he couldnt be sure the clothes covering him were torn and bloody and he staggered weeping with his thumb plugged into his mouth he must have escaped some raid near here wake the relief and stay alert with them ill go get the child we were warned not to step outside after sundown we cant leave a child out there and hurt by the look of him wake the relief tynan repeated i want an archer by this window if anything out there moves but me and that child aim for its heart he waited until the men were set and watched the child fall to the ground a boy he was nearly sure now and the poor thing wailed and whimpered pitifully as it curled into a ball we could keep an eye on him until morning one of the others on duty suggested are geallian men so frightened of the dark theyd huddle inside while a child bleeds and cries he shoved the door open he wanted to move quickly get the child inside to safety but he forced himself to stop his forward rush when the boys head came up and the round little face froze in fear i wont hurt you im one of the queens men ill take you inside he said gently its warm and theres food the boy scrambled to his feet and screamed as if tynan had hacked him with a sword monsters monsters he began to run limping heavily on his left leg tynan dashed after him better to scare the boy than to let him get away and very likely be a snack for some demon tynan caught him just before the boy managed to scramble over the stone wall bordering the near field easy easy youre safe the boy kicked and slapped and screamed shooting fresh pain into tynans hip you need to be inside no ones going to hurt you now no one he thought he heard something chanting and tightened his grip on the child he turned ready to sprint back for the house when he heard something else something that came from what he held in his arms it was a low feral growl the boy grinned horribly and went for his throat there was something beyond agony and it took tynan to his knees not a child not a child at all he thought as he fought to free himself but the thing ripped at him like a wolf dimly he heard shouts screams the thud of arrows the clash of swords and the last he heard was the hideous sound of his own blood being greedily drunk they used fire tipping arrows with flame and still nearly a quarter of their number were killed or wounded before the demons fell back take that one alive lilith delicately wiped blood from her lips i promised lora a gift she smiled down at davey who stood over the body of the soldier hed killed it swelled pride in her that her boy had continued to feed even when troops had dragged the body with the prince clinging to it away from the battle daveys eyes were red and gleaming and his freckles stood out like gold against the rosy flush the blood had given his cheeks she picked him up held him high over her head behold your prince the troops who hadnt been destroyed in the brief battle knelt she lowered him to kiss him long and deep on his mouth i want more he said yes my love and youll have more very soon toss that thing on a horse she ordered with a careless gesture toward tynans body i have a use for it she mounted then held out her arms so that davey could leap into them with her cheek rubbing against his hair she looked down at midir you did well she said to him you can have your choice of the humans for whatever purposes you like the moonlight shone on his silver hair as he bowed thank you m oira stood in the brisk wind and watched dragons and riders circle overhead it was a stunning sight she thought and would have sent her heart soaring under any other circumstances but these were military maneuvers not spectacle still she could hear children calling out and clapping and more than a few of them pretending they were dragon or rider she smiled a greeting when her uncle strode over to watch beside her youre not tempted to fly she asked him i leave it for the young and the agile its a brilliant sight moira and a hopeful one the dragons have lifted the spirits and in battle theyll give us an advantage do you see blair she rides as if she was born on the back of one shes hard to miss riddock murmured as blair drove her mount toward the ground at a dizzying speed then swept up again are you pleased she and larkin will marry he loves her and i can think of no other who suits him so well so aye his mother and i are pleased and will miss him every day he must go with her riddock said before moira could speak its his choice and i feel in my heart its the right choice for him but well miss him moira leaned her head against her uncles arm aye we will she would be the only one to remain she thought as she went inside again the only one of the first circle who would remain in geall after samhain she wondered how she would be able to bear it already the castle felt empty so many had already gone ahead and others were busy with duties shed assigned soon very soon she would leave herself so it was time she determined to write down her wishes in the event she didnt return she closed herself in her sitting room and sat to sharpen her quill then changed her mind and took out one of the treasures shed brought back with her from ireland she would write this document moira determined with the instrument of another world shed use a pen what did she have of value she wondered that wouldnt by rights belong to the next who ruled geall some of her mothers jewelry certainly and this she began to disburse in her mind between blair and glenna her aunt and cousin and lastly her ladies her fathers sword should be larkins she decided and the dagger hed once carried would go to hoyt the miniature of her father would be her uncles if she died before him as her father and uncle had been fast friends there were trinkets of course bits of this and that which she gave thought to bequesting to cian she left her bow and quiver and the arrows shed made with her own hand she hoped hed understand that these were more than weapons to her they were her pride and a kind of love she wrote it all carefully sealed it she would give the document to her aunt for safekeeping she felt better having done it lighter and clearer in her mind somehow setting the paper aside she rose to face the next task moving back into the bedroom she crossed to the balcony doors the drapes still hung there blocking the light the view and now she drew them back let the soft light spill through in her minds eye she saw it again the dark the blood the torn body of her mother and the things that mutilated her but now she opened the door and made herself walk through them the air was cool and moist and overhead the sky was full of dragons streaks and whirls of color riding the pale blue how her mother would have loved the sight of them loved the sound of the wings the laughter of the children in the courtyard below moira walked to the rail laid her hands on it and felt the sturdy stone and standing as her mother had often done she looked out over geall and swore to do her best s he might have been surprised to know that cian spent a large portion of his restless day doing what she had done his lists of bequests and instructions were considerably longer than hers and minutely more detailed but then hed lived considerably longer and had accumulated a great deal he saw no reason for any of it to go to waste a dozen times during the writing of it he cursed the quill and wished violently for the ease and convenience of a computer but he kept at it until he believed hed spread his holdings out satisfactorily he wasnt certain it could all be done as some of it would be up to hoyt theyd speak about it cian thought if he could count on anything he could count on hoyt doing everything in his considerable power to fulfill the obligation cian meant to give him all in all he hoped it wouldnt be necessary a thousand years of existence didnt mean he was ready to give it up and he damn well didnt intend to go to hell until hed sent lilith there before him you were always one for business he pushed to his feet drawing his dagger in one fluid motion as he turned toward the sound of the voice then the dagger simply fell out of his limp fingers even after a millennium there can be shocks beyond imagining nola his voice sounded rusty on the name she was a child his sister just as shed been when hed last seen her her long dark hair falling straight her eyes deep and blue and smiling nola he said again my god i thought you would say you have no god none that would claim me how can you be here are you here you can see for yourself she spread her arms then did a little turn you lived and you died an old woman you didnt know the woman so im as you remember me i missed you cian i looked for you even knowing better for years i looked and i hoped for you and for hoyt you never came how could i you know what i was am you understand that now would you have hurt me or any of us i dont know i hope not but i didnt see any reason to risk it why are you here he reached out but she held up her hand and she shook her head im not flesh only an apparition here to remind you that you may not be what you were when you were mine but youre not what she would have made you because he needed a moment he bent to pick up the dagger hed dropped then sheathed it again what does it matter it does it will and apparition or not her eyes swam as they locked on his i had children cian i know strong skilled gifted your blood too were you happy oh aye i loved a man and he loved me we had those children and lived a good life and still my brothers left a place in my heart i could never fill a little ache inside i would see you and hoyt sometimes in the water or the mist or the fire there are things ive done i wouldnt have you see i saw you kill and feed i saw you hunt humans as youd once hunted deer and i saw you stand by my grave in the moonlight and lay flowers on it i saw you fight beside the brother we both love i saw my cian do you remember how youd pull me up on your horse and ride and ride nola he rubbed his fingers over his brow he hurt too much to think of it were both dead and we both lived she came to my window one night she who inside him he went cold as winter lilith were both dead nola reminded him but your hands go to fists and your eyes go sharp as your dagger would you still protect me he walked to the fire kicked idly at the simmering turf what happened it was more than two years after hoyt left us father had died and mother was ill i knew she would never be strong again that she would die i was so sad so afraid i woke from sleep in the dark and there was a face at my window so beautiful golden hair and a sweet smile she whispered to me called me by name ask me in she said and promised me a treat nola tossed back her hair and her face was full of disdain she thought since i was only a girl the youngest of us id be foolish id be easy to trick i went to the window and i looked in her eyes theres power in her eyes hoyt must have told you not to take such risks he must have he wasnt there and neither were you there was power in me as well have you forgotten no but you were a child i was a seer and the blood of demon hunters was in my veins i looked in her eyes and i told her it was my blood who would end her my blood who would rid the worlds of her and for her there would be no eternity in hell or anywhere her damnation would be an end of all she would be dust and no spirit would survive she wouldnt have been pleased her beauty remains even when she shows her true self thats another power i held up morrigans cross that i wore always around my neck the light flashed from it like a sunbeam she was screaming when she ran you were always fearless he murmured she never came back while i lived and never came again until you and hoyt went home together youre stronger than you were without him and he with you she fears that hates that envies that will he live through this i cant know but if he falls it will be as he lived with honor honors cold comfort when youre in the ground then why do you hold your own she demanded with a whip of impatience in her voice its honor that brings you here honor that youll carry into battle along with your sword she couldnt drain it out of you and just the little she left was enough for you to draw on again you made this choice youve still more to make remember me dont dont leave remember me she repeated until we see each other again alone he sat lowering his head into his hands and remembered far too much chapter f or the most part cian avoided the tower room where hoyt and glenna worked their magicks such things often involved considerable light flashes fire and other elements unfavorable to vampires but in a way he hadnt or hadnt admitted to in centuries he needed his brother he noted before he knocked that one or both of his magically inclined relations had taken the precaution of drawing protection symbols on the tower door to keep the curious out hed have preferred to stay out himself but he knocked when glenna answered there was a dew of sweat on her skin her hair was bundled up and shed stripped down to a tank and cotton pants cian lifted a brow am i interrupting nothing physical unfortunately its just viciously hot in here were working on a lot of heat and fire magicks sorry im not bothered much by temperature extremes oh right she closed the door behind him weve got the windows blocked off keeping everything contained so you wont have to worry about the light its nearly sundown he looked over to where hoyt stood over an enormous copper trough hoyt had his hands spread above it and there was a sensation even across the room of more heat of power and energy hes firecharging weapons glenna explained and ive been working on well its a kind of bomb really something we may be able to drop from the air the nso would love to have you on staff i could be their version of q she swiped at her damp brow with the back of her hand you want a tour actually i wanted to ill just speak with hoyt when hes not so involved wait it was the first time glenna could remember seeing cian flustered no not flustered she thought upset he needs a break so do i if you can stand the heat just hang out a few more minutes hes nearly done im going to go get some air cian caught her hand before she turned to go thank you for not asking no problem and if it is a problem ill be around when she went out cian leaned against the door hoyt remained just as hed been hands spread over the silver smoke that rose from the trough his eyes were darkened as they were when he held his power strong and steady it had always been so cian thought since they were children like glenna hoyt had stripped down for work and wore a white tshirt and faded jeans it was odd even after the past months to see his brother in twentyfirstcentury clothing hoyt had never been one for fashion cian recalled but for dignity and purpose however much they looked alike theyd approached life from different poles hoyt for solitude and study and he himself for society and business and the pleasure both brought him still theyd been close had understood each other on a level few others could had loved each other cian thought now in a way that was as strong and as steady as hoyts power then the world and everything in it had changed so what was he doing here looking for answers for comfort when he knew there could be neither none of it could be taken back not a single act a single thought a single moment it was a foolish waste of time and energy on all counts the man who stood like a statue in the smoke wasnt the man hed known any more than he was the same man hed been or a man at all for that matter too much time spent with these people these feelings these needs made him forget what could never be altered he pushed away from the door wait a moment more hoyts voice stopped him and it irritated him to understand hoyt had known he wasnt simply shifting position but leaving hoyt lowered his hands and the smoke whisked away sure well go into this wellarmed hoyt reached into the trough and lifted a sword by the hilt spinning he pointed it toward the hearth and shot a beam of fire will you be using one of these hoyt turned the sword in his hand eying its edge youve skill enough not to burn yourself ill use whatever comes best to hand and do my best to stay away from those you arm who are considerably less skilled its not worry over poor swordsmanship that brings you here no since he was here hed do what hed come to do but he wandered the room first while hoyt removed the other weapons from the trough the room smelled of herbs and smoke of sweat and effort ive chased your woman away ill find her again since shes not here ill ask you are you afraid youll lose her in this hoyt laid the last sword on the worktable its my last thought before sleep my first on waking the rest of the time i try not to think of it or let out the part of myself that wants to lock her away safe until this is over she isnt a woman you could lock away even with your skill no but knowing that doesnt stop the fear are you afraid for moira what do you think i dont know youre with her that your heart is with her a temporary madness itll pass at his brothers quiet steady look cian shook his head ive no choice in it and neither does she what i am doesnt run to white picket fences and golden retrievers he waved it away when hoyts look turned puzzled to home and hearth brother i cant give her a life if i wanted to and what passes for mine will go on long after hers is ended and thats not what ive come to tell you tell me this first do you love her it came into him the truth of it swirling through his heart and into his eyes she is she is like a light for me when ive lived eternally in the dark but the dark is mine hoyt i know how to survive there to be content and productive and entertained there you dont say happy frustration snapped into his voice i was happy enough before you came before you changed everything again as surely as lilith had done to me what would you have me do wish for what you have and will have with glenna if you live what good will it do me will it start my heart again can your magic do that no ive found nothing that can take you back but let it be i am what i am and ive done more than well enough im not whining about it shes an experience love is an experience and ive always sought them out he dragged his hands through his hair christ is there anything to drink in this place theres whiskey hoyt lifted his chin toward a cabinet ill have one as well cian poured whiskey generously into cups then crossed to where hoyt drew two threelegged stools together so cian sat and they drank for a few moments in silence ive written out a document a kind of will should my luck run out on samhain hoyt lifted his eyes from his whiskey and met cians i see ive accumulated considerable property and holdings assets personal items i expect youll see to them as ive instructed i will of course itll be no small task as theyre spread out over the world i dont keep a great many eggs in one basket there are passports and other identification papers in the new york apartment and in safety deposit boxes here and there if any are useful to you youre welcome to them thanks for that cian swirled the whiskey in his glass kept his eyes on it there are some things id like moira to have if you can get them here ill get them here i thought to leave the club and the apartment in new york to blair and to larkin i think theyd suit them better than you they would theyll be grateful im sure annoyance rose up at his brothers easy and practical tone well dont let sentiment choke you as its more likely ill be holding a wake for you than you for me hoyt angled his head do you think so i damn well do you havent had three decades and ive had near a hundred and you never were as good in a fight as me when we were both alive however many tricks you have up your sleeve but then again as you said we arent what we were are we hoyt smiled pleasantly im determined well both come through this but if you fall well ill lift a glass to you cian let out a half laugh as hoyt did just that and would you be wanting pipes and drums as well oh bugger it now a wicked gleam came into cians eyes ill toss in some fifes for yours then console your grieving widow at least i wont have to dig a hole for you seeing as youll just be dust but ill show you the honor of having a stone carved here doesnt lie cian for hes blown off with the wind he lived and he died then stayed on like the last annoying guest to leave the ball does that suit you im thinking ill go back and change some of those bequests for principle only seeing as ill be singing danny boy over your grave whats danny boy a cliche cian picked up the bottle hed set on the floor and poured more whiskey into the cups i saw nola what hoyt lowered the cup hed just lifted what did you say in my room i saw nola spoke with her you dreamed of nola is that what i said cian snapped i said i saw her spoke with her as awake then as i am now looking and speaking to you she was still a child jesus there isnt enough whiskey in the world for this she came to you hoyt murmured our nola what did she say she loved me and you she missed us shed waited for us to come home damn it goddamn it he pushed up to pace she was a child exactly as shed been the last i saw her it was a lie of course shed grown up grown old shed died and gone to dust and why would she come to you as a grown woman or an old one hoyt demanded she came to you as you remembered her as you think of her she gave you a gift why are you angry it was fury in him now fury to wrap tight around the pain how can you know what it is to feel this to have it ripping inside you she looked the same and im not she talked of how id swing her up on my horse and take her riding and it was like it was yesterday i cant have those yesterdays in my head and stay sane he turned back at the end of this youll know you did what you could what was asked of you for her for all of them if you live whatever pang you feel at leaving them behind will be balanced out by that knowing and by the life you make with glenna i have to go back where i was i have to i cant take this with me and survive it hoyt was quiet a moment was she in pain afraid grieving no and you cant take that with you and survive it i dont know thats the plain truth but i know that one feeling leads to another until you drown in them im half drowned now with whats in me for moira he calmed himself sat again she wore the cross you gave her nola did she said she wore it always just as you told her i thought you should know and i thought you should know she told me lilith had come back and tried to lure her into an invitation as cians had done hoyts hand fisted that hellbitch went for our nola she did and got a boot up the ass for the trouble metaphorically he told hoyt what nola had said watched hoyts grim face soften a little with pride and satisfaction then she flashed that cross of yours and sent her packing according to nola she never came back again until we did well now well isnt that interesting the cross didnt just shield the wearer it frightened lilith enough to send her haring off that and the prediction wed end her which may be why shes so determined to end us aye nolas threat could have added weight to that imagine how it must have been for lilith being frightened off by a child she wants her own back no doubt of it she wants to win this of course to set herself up as a kind of god but under that its us the six of us and the connection between us she wants us destroyed hasnt had much luck with that has she and what do you think of that the gods depose dont they weve all of us had our close calls and bled for it but were all of us lilith included being driven toward one time and place the fact of the matter is i dont care for being led by the nose by gods any more than demons hoyt lifted his brows what choice is there they all talk of choice but which of us would turn away from this now its not just humans who have pride after all so the time clicks away he rose and well see what we see on that reckoning day the suns well down im going out for air he walked to the door paused to glance back she couldnt tell me if you survived it hoyt lifted a shoulder finished off his whiskey then he smiled danny boy is it c ian went to see to his horse then though he knew it was risky saddled vlad and rode out through the gates he needed the speed and the night maybe he needed the risk as well the moon was past half full now when that circle was complete blood human and demon would soak the ground he hadnt fought in other wars hadnt seen the point of them wars for land for riches and resources wars waged in the name of faith but this one had come to be his no it wasnt only humans who had pride or even honor or love so for all of that this was his if his luck was in hed ride one day again in ireland or wherever he chose and hed think of geall with its lovely hills and thick forests hed think of the green and the tumbling water the standing stones and the fanciful castle on the rise near the river hed think of its queen moira with the long gray eyes and the quiet smile that masked a clever flexible brain and a deep rich heart who would have believed that after all these lifetimes he would be seduced bewitched drowned in such a woman he took vlad leaping over stone walls galloping over fields where the air was sweet and cool with the night the moonlight rained down on the stones of her castle and the windows glowed with candles and lamps shed kept her word he thought and had hoisted that third flag so there was claddaugh dragon and now the bright gold sun he wished with all that was in him that she would give geall and all the worlds the sun after the blood spilled maybe he couldnt take all these feelings these needs and wants with him and survive but he wanted to take this when he went back to the dark he wanted to take this much of her and have that single glimmer of light through all his nights he rode back and found her waiting with her bow in her hands and the sword of geall strapped to her side i saw you ride out he dismounted covering my back were you wed agreed none of us would go out alone particularly after dark i needed it was all he said and led the stallion to the stables so it seemed from the way you were riding i didnt see any hounds of hell but it appeared you did would you trust one of the stable boys to cool him and settle him for the night it helps them to have the work as much as it might help you to have a wild ride theres a scolding under that accommodating tone majesty you do it very well learned at my mothers knee she took the reins herself then passed them with instructions to the boy who came hurrying out from the stables when shed finished she looked up at cian are you in a mood always i should have said a difficult mood but the answer might be always to that as well if youre not more than usual id hoped youd have a meal with me in private id hoped youd stay with me tonight and if i am in a difficult mood then a meal and some wine might sweeten it enough for you to lie with me and stay with me or we can argue over the food then go to bed id have to have taken a spill from the horse and damaged my brain to turn down that offer good im hungry and furious he thought with some amusement why dont you get the lecture out of your system its liable to give you indigestion i dont have a lecture and if i did its not what would suit me she walked regally he thought across the courtyard what id like is to give you a good strong kick in the ass for taking a chance like that but she drew a long breath then a second as they entered the castle i know what it is to need to get away to just go for a bit how it feels youll rip apart from the pressure inside if you dont i can go into a book and be quiet in my mind again you needed the ride the speed of it and i think there are times you just need the dark he said nothing until theyd come to the door of her room i dont know how you can understand me that way ive made a study of you now she smiled a little looking up and into his eyes im a good study and added to it youre inside my heart now youre inside me so i know i havent earned you he said quietly that occurs to me now i havent earned you im not a wage or a prize i wouldnt care to be earned she opened the door to her sitting room shed had the fire lit and the candles the cold supper and the good wine were already laid out with flowers from one of the hothouses youve gone to some trouble he shut the door behind them thank you it was for me but im glad you like it i wanted a night just one where it would be only the two of us as if none of this was happening where we could sit and talk and eat and where i might drink just a little too much wine she laid down her bow and quiver unhooked her sword one night when we dont talk of battles and weapons and strategy youd tell me you love me you wouldnt even have to say it because id see it when you looked at me i do love you i looked back at the castle and saw the glow in the windows from these candles thats how i think of you a steady glow she stepped toward him took his face in her hands and if i think of you as the night its the mystery of it and the thrill ill never be afraid of the dark again because ive seen into it he kissed her brow her temples then her lips let me pour you the first glass of too much wine she sat at the little table and watched him this was her lover she thought this strange and compelling man who carried wars inside him and shed have this night with him the whole of it and a few hours of peace for them both she chose food for his plate knowing it was a wifely gesture shed have that as well this one night when he sat across from her she lifted her glass to his sláinte sláinte will you tell me the places youve seen where youve traveled i want to go there in my mind i studied the maps in your library in ireland your world is so big tell me the wonderful things youve seen he took her to italy during the renaissance and japan in the time of samurai to alaska during the gold rush to amazon jungles and to african plains he tried to paint quick snapshots with words so she could see the variety the contrasts the changes he could all but see her mind opening to take it in she asked dozens of questions particularly when something he related expanded or contradicted what shed read when in his library ive wondered what lies beyond the sea she propped her chin on her fist as he poured more wine other lands other cultures it seems that if we were once a part of ireland that there may be parts of italy and america russia all those wondrous places here in this world too one day id like to see an elephant an elephant she laughed aye an elephant and a zebra and a kangaroo id like to see the paintings from the artists youve seen and the ones i found in your books michelangelo and davinci van gogh monet beethoven beethoven was a composer i dont believe he could paint thats right sure thats right the moonlight sonata and all those symphonies with numbers its the wine muddling it up a bit id like to see a violin and a piano and an electric guitar do you play any of those actually its a little known fact that there were six original beatles never mind i know john paul george and ringo youve got a memory like that elephant youd like to see as long as you remember it it belongs to you ill likely never see an elephant but ill have orange trees one day the seeds in the hothouse pots are sprouting she held her thumb and forefinger up close together that bit of green coming out of the dirt glenna tells me the blossoms will be very fragrant yes they will be and i took other things it amused him to hear the confessional tone in her voice so youve sticky fingers have you i thought if im not meant to take them to geall they wont go i took a cutting of your roses all right well three cuttings i was greedy and a photograph glenna took of larkin and me and a book i confess it i took a book right out of your library its a thief i am which book it was poems by yeats i wanted it particularly because he was irish it said and it seemed important i bring something that was written down by an irishman because you were irish she thought because the book was yours and the poems were so beautiful and strong she continued i told myself i was going to give it back to you once id copied more down but thats a lie im keeping it he laughed shook his head consider it a gift thank you but ill happily pay you for it she rose stepped over to where he sat and you may name the price she sat on his lap linked her arms around his neck he wrote something your yeats that made me think of you and especially what we have between us tonight he wrote i spread my dreams at your feet tread softly because you tread on my dreams she combed her fingers through his hair you can give me your dreams cian ill tread softly impossibly moved he rested his cheek against hers youre unlike any other with you im more than i ever was will you come out stand for a while on the balcony with me id like to look at the moon and the stars he rose with her but when he turned she drew him back no the bedroom balcony he thought of her mother of what shed seen are you sure i am i stood out there today alone i want to stand there with you in the night i want you to kiss me there so ill remember it all of my life youll want a cloak its cold geallian woman are made of sterner stuff and when she led the way when her hand gripped his tight as she opened the balcony doors he thought yes yes she was chapter h e kissed her on the balcony and she would remember it all of it she wouldnt forget the quiet music of the night the chill in the air the easy skill of his mouth tonight she wouldnt think of sunrise and the obligations that came with it the night was his time and while she was with him it would be hers youve kissed many women he smiled a little brushed his lips over hers again i have hundreds at least her eyes narrowed thousands very likely hmm she wandered away from him then turned leaning back on the stone rail i think ill make a decree that every man must come and kiss their queen so i can catch up at the same time it would be a kind of study a comparison i could see how you rate in this particular skill interesting im afraid youd find your countrymen sadly lacking oh how can you be sure have you ever kissed a man of geall he laughed clever arent you so im told she stayed as she was when he moved to her when he caged her in by laying his hands on the rail on either side of her does your taste run to clever women currently when their eyes are like night fog and their hair the color of polished oak gray and brown i always thought they were such dull colors but nothing about me feels dull when im with you she laid a hand on his heart though it didnt beat she saw the pulse of it in his eyes i dont feel shy with you or nervous i did until you kissed me she pressed her lips to where her hand had laid then i thought well of course i should have known a curtain lifted inside me i dont think it will ever close again you bring the light inside me moira he didnt say not to her not to himself that when he left her it would go out again the moons clear tonight and the stars shine she laid her hands on his well leave the drapes open until its time for sleep she went inside with him into a room shimmering with moonlight and candlelight she knew what it would be now the warmth that went to heat and the heat that went to fire and all the thrills and sensations that came between from somewhere outside an owl called for its mate she thought she knew what it was now to pine for her mate she lifted off her circlet set it aside then reached up to take off her earrings when she saw him watching her she realized these small acts this prelude to disrobing could arouse so she took them off slowly watching him as he watched her she took the cross shed tucked under her bodice drawing it over her head this she knew was an act of trust i have no ladies would you see to my laces she turned her back lifted her hair i think ill try to make a zipper its a simple thing really and makes dressing easier a lot of charm is lost to convenience she sent him a smile over her shoulder easy for you to say but then again feeling him loosen those laces brought a flutter to her belly what invention pleased you the most over your time indoor plumbing the quickness of his answer made her laugh larkin and i were spoiled and miss it sorely i studied the pipes and the tanks i think i could fashion something like your shower a queen and a plumber he laid his lips on her shoulder as he eased the material away theres no end to your talents i wonder how ill be as a gentlemans valet she turned to him i like buttons she said as she began to undo his shirt theyre sensible and pretty so was she he thought as she worked her way down efficiently then she shoved at her hair i think i should cut this off like blairs thats sensible too no dont his belly quivered as her fingers paused on the button of his jeans his combed down through the length of her hair from crown to waist its beautiful the way it falls over your shoulders spills down your back it all but glows against your skin charmed she glanced over toward the long looking glass and was jolted to see herself standing half dressed and alone she looked away quickly sent him an easy smile still its a great deal of trouble and does it frighten you there was no point pretending she didnt understand him no its a bit of a shock is all is it hard for you not being able to see your reflection it just is you adjust just another irony here youve got eternal youth but you wont be able to admire yourself still he turned her around so they both faced the mirror then he lifted her hair let it fall when she let out a laugh at watching her hair seem to fly around on its own he laid his hands on her shoulders there are always ways to amuse yourself he told her he lifted her hair again and this time brushed his lips and just a hint of teeth along the nape of her neck he heard the quick intake of her breath saw her eyes widen no no he murmured when she started to turn just watch and trailed his fingers along her skin bare shoulders and down to where her loosened bodice clung tenuously to her breasts just feel cian did you ever dream of a lover coming to you in the night in the dark he nudged the dress down to her waist then glided his fingertips over her breasts overtaking you hands and lips heating your skin she lifted her hands to his needing to feel them then flushed and dropped them again as the reflection showed her cupping her own breasts behind her invisible he smiled you said i didnt take your innocence you might have been right but i think i will now its succulent and what i am craves it im not innocent she said but trembled more than you know he circled her breasts with his thumbs moving in slowly until they rubbed stiffened peaks are you afraid no and shuddered yes a little fear can add to excitement he pushed the dress to the floor leaned close to her ear step out he whispered now watch watch your body fear twisted with arousal so it was impossible for her to tell them apart her body was helpless her mind transfixed hands and lips she couldnt see roamed over her erotically intimate lazily possessive she could see herself quivering and the startled pleasure on her own face the clouds of surrender in her own eyes her phantom lover ran his hands down her fingers toying tracing leaving a trail of shivering flesh this time when they took her breasts she covered his hands with hers shameless she moaned for him and still her eyes stayed on the glass his scholar would never shut her eyes to new experience to new knowledge he could feel her trembles and the instinctive movement of her hips as pleasure took her over candlelight played over her skin and sensation warmed it so it bloomed like a rose she moaned again as he trailed his fingers over her belly and melting into him hooked her arm back around his neck he only teased skimming his fingers along her thighs over the most sensitive flesh hinting only hinting at what was to come until her breath was sobbing out take he murmured take what you want he gripped her hand pressed it to his between her thighs trapped it there she felt her body buck against him against herself as he stroked her toward a new towering pleasure his body was solid behind hers and his voice murmured words she no longer understood but in the glass there was only her own form lost now to its own rising needs release left her breathless limp and amazed he spun her around so quickly she couldnt find her balance and knew shed have lost it again in any case when his mouth took hers with a wild urgency she could only cling could only give while her heart slammed an anvil beat against his chest of all hed had and taken and tasted hed never known such hunger a kind of madness of need that could only be met with her for all his skill all his experience he was helpless when she held him against her as ready and wrecked as she he pulled her to the floor and plunged inside her to forge that first desperate link he turned her face to the mirror once again as he ravished her as her body went wild under his strong thrusting hips and when she came quaking he chained need with will until her heavy eyes opened met his until she saw who had her he took her again building and building until her need paced his own then burying his face in her hair emptied himself into her she might have lain there spent for the rest of her life but he lifted her simply scooped her up she realized and stood with her in his arms all in one effortless motion and her heart did a little jig in her chest its foolish she said as she nuzzled his neck and im thinking its female but i love it that youre so strong and that for a moment when we love each other i make you weak theres a part of me mo chroi thats always weak when it comes to you my heart hed called her and it made her own dance again oh dont she said after hed laid her on the bed and turned to close the drapes not yet theres so much night left she rolled off the bed again and grabbed her night robe im going to get the wine and the cheese she decided im half starving again as she ran out he went to the fire tossed on another brick of turf he closed his mind to the part of him that asked what he was doing every time he was with her there was another scar to his heart for the day that would come when hed never be with her again shed survive it he reminded himself and so would he survival was something humans and demons had in common nothing really died of a broken heart she came back carrying a tray we can eat and drink in bed full of decadence she set the tray on the bed and climbed up after it ive certainly given you enough of that oh she brushed back her hair and gave him a slow smile and here i was hoping thered be more to come but if youve shown me all you know i suppose we can just begin repeating ourselves ive done things you cant imagine things i wouldnt have you imagine now youre bragging she made herself say it lightly moira dont be sorry for whats between us or for what you believe cant be or shouldnt her gaze was clear direct dont be sorry when you look at me for whatever you might have done in the past whatever it was each time it was a step to bringing you here youre needed here i need you here he crossed to the bed do you understand i cant stay yes yes yes i dont want to speak of it not tonight cant we have an illusion for just one night he touched her hair i cant be sorry for whats between us thats enough then had to be enough she reminded herself though with every minute that passed there was something inside her going wild and wilder still with grief she lifted one of the goblets offered it with a steady hand when he saw it was blood he lifted a brow at her i thought you might need it for energy he shook his head and sat on the bed with her so should we talk about plumbing she hadnt been sure what hed say but that was the last on any list she might have made plumbing youre not the only one whos made studies added to the fact that i was around when that kind of thing was being incorporated into daily life i have some ideas how you could install some basics she smiled and sipped her wine educate me they spent considerable time at it with moira going off for paper and ink so they could draw basic diagrams the fact that he took such an interest in something she imagined people of his time took for granted opened another facet of him for her but she realized she shouldnt have been surprised by it not when she considered the extent of his library in ireland and in a house she remembered he didnt visit more than once or twice a year she understood too that he could have been anything hed wanted he had a quick curious mind clever hands and from the way hed played music the soul of a poet and a way with business as well she reminded herself in geall in her time he would have been prosperous she was certain respected even renowned other men would have come to him for advice and counsel women would have flirted with him at every opportunity but she and he would have met and courted and loved she was sure of it and he would have ruled by her side over a rich and peaceful land there would be children with his beautiful blue eyes and a boy at least one boy with that little cleft in the chin like his father and on nights like this late and quiet theyd talk of other plans for their family for their people for their land she blinked herself back when his fingers brushed her cheek you need sleep no she shook her head tried to refocus on the diagrams again to hold off those minutes that drained away her time with him my mind was wandering off youdve been snoring in a minute well what a lie i dont snore but she didnt argue when he gathered up the papers she could barely keep her eyes open perhaps well rest a little while she rose to snuff candles as he moved to close the drapes but when she moved back toward the bed he was opening the doors and stepping out for heavens sake cian youre next to naked plucking up his shirt she hurried out after him at least put this on you may not mind the cold but i mind having one of the guards see you standing here in your altogether its not proper theres a rider coming what where due east she looked east but saw nothing still she didnt doubt him a single rider two but the seconds being led by the first theyre coming at a gallop with a nod she strode back into the bedchamber and began to dress the guards are instructed not to pass anyone in ill have a look it may be stragglers if so we cant leave them outside the gates and unprotected invite no one cian ordered as he yanked on his jeans even if theyre known to you i wont and neither will any of the guards with a small pang of regret she put on her circlet and became queen again and as queen she lifted her sword itll be stragglers she said in need of food and shelter and if not then theyve ridden a long way to die w hen she stood at the post on top of the wall she could see the riders or the shape of them two as cian had said with the first leading the second horse they wore no cloaks though there was a chill in the air and a hint of the first frost she glanced at niall whod been awakened when the guards had spotted the riders ill want a bow niall gestured to one of the men took a bow and quiver from him seems fruitless for the enemy to ride straight at us two of them against us and unable to pass through the gates unless we welcome them likely they arent the enemy but the gates arent to be raised until we know two men she murmured as they rode close enough for her to be sure the one being led looks to be injured no cian said after a moment dead how can you niall cut himself off youre certain moira murmured hes tied to the horse and hes dead sos the lead rider but hes been changed all right then moira let out a sigh niall tell the men to keep a sharp eye for others theyre to do nothing without a command well see what this one wants a deserter she said to cian then dismissed the idea before he answered no a deserter would have gone as far east or north as possible and kept hidden could be he thinks he has something to trade niall suggested make us think the one hes bringing is still alive so wed let them in or hes got information he feels wed value no harm in listening moira began then gripped cians hand the rider its sean its sean the smithys son oh god are you sure hes i know my own kind and with eyes keener than moiras he recognized the dead lilith sent him she can afford to lose one so newly changed she sent him because youd know him and feel for him dont he was little more than a boy now hes a demon the other was spared that look at me moira he took her shoulders turned her to face him im sorry its tynan no no tynans at the base we had word he reached it safely injured but alive and safe it cant be tynan she pushed away from cian leaning on the wall straining her eyes she could hear the murmurs now then the shouts as the men began to recognize sean there was hope in the shouts and welcome its no longer sean she lifted her voice cut through the calls of the men they killed the one you knew and sent a demon with his face the gates stay locked and not a man here will pass what rides here through them i command it she turned back every bone in her body went brittle as she saw cian had been right it was tynan or tynans mauled body tied to the second horse she wanted to weep wanted to burrow herself into cian and scream and sob she wanted to sink to the stones and cry out her grief and her rage she stood straight no longer feeling the wind that blew at her cloak at her hair she notched the arrow and she waited for the vampire to bring its vile gift no one is to speak to it she said coldly what had been sean lifted its face raised a hand to wave to those gathered on the wall open the gates it shouted open the gates its sean the blacksmiths son they may be after me still ive tynan here hes badly hurt you will not pass moira called out she killed you only to send you here to die again majesty it managed an awkward bow as it pulled the horses to a halt you know me aye i do how did tynan die hes hurt hes lost blood i escaped the demons and made my way to the farm to the base but i was weak and hurt myself and tynan bless him came out to help me they set upon us we barely escaped with our lives you lie did you kill him did what she made you turn you so youd kill a friend my lady it broke off when she lifted the bow and aimed the arrow at its heart i didnt kill him it held up its hands to show them empty of weapons it was the prince the boy it giggled then pressed a hand to its mouth to muffle it in a gesture so like seans it ripped her heart the prince lured him outside and had the kill ive only brought him back to you as the true queen commanded she sends a message and what would it be if you surrender and accept her as ruler of this world and all others if you place the sword of geall in her hand and set the crown on her head youll be spared you may live out your lives here as you like for geall is a small world and of little interest to her and if we dont he took out a dagger and leaning over cut the ropes securing tynan to the horse a careless kick sent the body tumbling to the ground then your fate is as his as will be the fate of every man every woman every child who stands against her youll be tortured it ripped off its tunic and the moonlight fell on the burns and gashes yet to heal on its torso any who survive samhain will be hunted down well rape your women well mutilate your children when its done not a single human heart will beat on geall we are forever youll never stop the flood of us give your answer and ill take it to the queen this is the answer of the true queen of geall when the sun rises after samhain you and all like you will be dust that blows out to sea on the wind nothing will be left of you in geall she passed her bow back to niall you have your answer shell come for you it shouted and for the traitor to his kind who stands beside you it wheeled the horse kicked it to a gallop on the wall moira lifted her sword and flinging it out shot a stream of fire the vampire screamed once as the flames struck then the ball of fire that was left of it fell to the ground and went to ash he was of geall moira murmured and deserved to end with its sword tynan her throat simply locked ill bring him in cian touched her shoulder and looked over her head into nialls eyes he was a good man and a friend to me without waiting cian vaulted over the wall he seemed almost to float to the ground niall slapped the back of his hand on the arm of the guard beside him when he saw the man made the sign against evil no man stands with me who insults sir cian below cian picked tynan up in his arms and bearing his weight looked up and met moiras eyes open the gates she ordered so sir cian can bring tynan home again s he tended the body herself removing the torn and filthy clothes let me do this moira she shook her head and began to wash tynans face this is for me we were friends since childhood i need to do this for him i dont want larkin to see him until hes clean her hands trembled as she brushed the cloth gently over the tears and bites but she never faltered they were playmates you see larkin and tynan was it the truth do you think that the child did this to him when cian said nothing she looked over hes her child cian said at length he would be vicious let me wake glenna at least she was fond of tynan everyone was no theres no need for her to come now so late they tore my mother like this worse even worse and i turned away from that i cant turn away from this do you want me to go you think because i see these wounds these bites and tears as if an animal had been at him i could think youre the same as what did this do you think me so weak of mind and heart cian no i think the woman i saw tonight the woman i heard has the strongest mind and heart ive ever known i never ripped at a human that way he steadied himself as she turned those ravaged eyes on his again i need you to know that at least of all the things ive done and some were unimaginably cruel i never did what was done to him you killed more cleanly more efficiently he felt the words slice into him yes moira nodded lilith didnt train you but abandoned you so you have little of her in you not like this boy must and i think some manner of your upbringing remained just as i heard seans tone saw his mannerisms in that thing tonight so some of yours stayed as they were i know youre not human cian just as i know youre not a monster and i know theres some of both in you that has you constantly struggling to keep them balanced she washed tynans body as gently as she would have washed a child when she was done she began to dress him in the clothes shed had sent over from his quarters let me do that moira for gods sake i know you mean well i know youre thinking of me but i need to do this one thing for him he was the first to kiss me her voice wavered a bit before she clamped down and finished when i was fourteen and he two years older it was very sweet very gentle shy for both of us as a first kiss in the springtime should be i loved him i think in a way like you loved king shes taken that from us cian taken them from us but not the love i swear before any gods you wish ill end her for you one of us will she bent brushed her lips over tynans cold cheek then she stepped back from him now she sank to the floor on a keening wail when cian knelt beside her she curled into him and wept out her shattered heart chapter t hey buried tynan on a brilliant morning with cloud shadows dancing over the hills and a lark singing joyfully in a rowan tree the holy man blessed the ground before they lowered him into it with a fife and drum sounding the dirge all who knew him and many who didnt were there so that mourners stretched across the sundrenched graveyard and up the rise toward the castle the three flags of geall flew at half staff moira stood beside larkin dryeyed though she heard tynans mother weeping she knew her time for tears had passed the others of her circle stood behind her and she could feel them took some comfort from that now two stones would stand for friends here along with the markers for her parents all of them victims of a war that had raged long before shed known of it and would end with her one way or another at last she moved away to give the last moments to the family and their privacy when larkin took her hand she gripped it firmly she looked at cian could just see his eyes under the shadow of his hood then she looked at the others we have work to do larkin and i need to speak with tynans family again then well meet in the parlor well head in now blair stepped forward laid her cheek against larkins moira couldnt hear the words blair murmured to him but larkin released her hand and pulled blair into a hard embrace well be in shortly larkin eased back then took moiras hand again she would have sworn she could feel his grief coming through his skin before moira could move back toward the family tynans mother broke away from her husband and pushed her way to cian her eyes were still spilling tears its your kind did this your kind killed my boy hoyt made a move forward but cian shifted to block his path yes you should be in hell instead of my boy being in the ground yes cian repeated moira stepped up to put an arm around her but the woman shook it off you all of you she whirled jabbing out an accusing finger you care more about this thing than my boy now hes dead hes dead and you have no right to stand here by his grave she spat at cians feet as she wept into her hands her husband and daughters carried her off im sorry moira murmured ill speak with her leave her be she wasnt wrong saying nothing more cian walked away from the fresh grave and the lines of stones that marked the dead niall caught up with him as he reached the gates sir cian a word with you you can have as many words as you want once im out of this shagging sun he didnt know why hed gone to the graveyard hed seen more than enough dead in his time heard more than enough weeping for them tynans mother wasnt the only one who looked at him with fear and hate and here he was out in the daylight with the only things between him and the killing sun some rough cloth and a charm his blood cooled the moment he was inside out of the light say what you need to say cian shoved back the detested hood of the cloak so i will a big man with his usually cheerful face tight and grim niall nodded sharply his wide hand rested on the hilt of his sword as he looked hard into cians eyes tynan was a friend and one of the best men ive known youre saying nothing i havent heard before well you havent heard me say it have you i saw what had become of sean what had been a harmless and often foolish lad i saw him kick tynans body from the horse as if it were no more than offal to be tossed in a ditch to him it wasnt any more than that again niall nodded and his fingers tightened on the swords hilt aye thats what was made of him and of you but i watched you lift tynans body off the ground i watched you carry it in as a man would carry a fallen friend i saw none of what was sean in you tynans mothers grieving he was her firstborn and shes mad with grief and she was wrong in what she said to you by his grave hed not have wanted you insulted by his blood so as his friend im telling you that and im telling you any man who fights with me fights with you thats my word on it he lifted his hand from the hilt of his sword and held it out to cian humans never failed to surprise him irritate annoy amuse occasionally educate but most of all they continued to surprise him with the twists and turns of their minds and hearts he supposed that was one reason hed been able to live among them so long and still be interested ill thank you for it but before you take my hand you need to know that what was in sean is in me theres a thin difference not thin by my measure and im thinking youll use whats in you to fight ill put my back to yours sir cian and my hands still out cian shook it im grateful he said but when he went up the stairs he went alone h eartsick moira walked back to the castle there was little time for grieving she knew little time for comfort what lilith had done to sean to tynan shed done to cut at their hearts and shed aimed well so they would heal them now with action with movement can the dragons be used are they trained enough to carry men theyre smart and accommodating larkin told her easily ridden by any who have a good seat and arent afraid of the height but so far its been like a game for them i cant say how theyll do in battle for now its more a matter of transportation youd know the best of them you and blair well need she broke off as her aunt crossed the courtyard to her deirdre she kissed her aunts cheek held an extra moment she knew larkins and tynans mothers were close how is she shes prostrate inconsolable deirdres eyes swollen from her own tears locked on larkins face as any mother would be he embraced her dont fret for me or for oran now you ask the impossible still she smiled a little but the smile faded as she turned to moira again i know this is a difficult time and youve much on your mind on your heart but i would speak with you privately of course ill join you shortly she said to the others then laid her arm around deirdres shoulders well go to my sitting room youll have tea you neednt trouble itll do us both good she caught the eye of a servant as they passed into the hall and asked that tea be brought up and sinann moira continued as they climbed the stairs fatigued and full of grief for tynan of worry for her husband her brothers i couldnt allow her to go to the grave today and made her rest i worry for her and the babe she carries her other children shes strong and has you to tend her will it be enough if phelan falls as tynan has if oran has already it must be we have no choice in this none of us no choice but for war deirdre entered the sitting room took a chair her face framed by her wimple was older than it had been weeks before if we dont fight theyll slaughter us as they did tynan or do what they did to poor sean moira went to the hearth to add bricks to the fire despite the bright autumn sun she was cold to the bone and fighting them how many will die how many will be slaughtered moira straightened and turned her aunt wasnt the only one who would question who would look to their queen for the impossible answer how can i say what would you have me do you who were confidant to my mother before she was queen and all during her reign what would you have had her do the gods have charged you who am i to say my blood deirdre sighed looked down at her hands lying empty in her lap im weary to the bottom of my soul my daughter fears for her husband as i do for mine and for my sons my friend buried her child today and i know there is no choice in this moira this blight has come to us and must be cut out a servant hurried in with the tea leave it please moira said ill pour is food being sent to the parlor the young girl curtseyed aye your majesty the cook was seeing to it when i left with the tea thank you thats all then moira sat poured out the tea theres biscuits as well its good to have small pleasures in hard times its pleasures in hard times i need to speak with you about moira passed the cup is there something i can do to ease your heart sinanns and the childrens there is deirdre took a small sip of the tea before setting the cup aside moira your mother was my dearest friend in this world and so i sit here in her stead and i speak to you as i would my own daughter id have it no other way when you spoke of this war thats upon us you spoke of no choice but there are other choices youve made a womans choices understanding moira sat back i have as queen one whos claimed herself a warrior one whos proven herself as one you have the right even the duty to use any and all weapons that come to your hand to protect your people i do and i will this cian who comes here from another time and place you believe the gods sent him i know it he fought by your own son he saved my life would you sit here and look at me and damn him as tynans mother damned him no deirdre took a careful breath in this matter of war he is a weapon by using him you may save yourself my sons all of us youre mistaken moira said evenly hes not to be used like a sword what hes done and what he will do to cut out this blight he does of his own will a demons will moiras eyes chilled as you like and youve taken this demon to your bed ive taken cian to my bed how can you do this thing moira moira she reached out her hands hes not human yet you gave yourself to him what good can come of it much has already for me deirdre sat back a moment pressed her fingers to her eyes do you think the gods sent him to you for this i cant say did you ask yourself that question when you took my uncle how can you compare deirdre snapped have you no shame no pride no shame and considerable pride i love him and he loves me how can a demon love how can a demon risk his life time and again to save humanity its not his bravery i question but your judgment do you think ive forgotten what it is to be young to be stirred to be foolish but youre queen and you have responsibility to your crown your people i live and breathe that responsibility every moment every day and at night you bed a vampire unable to sit any longer moira rose moved to the window the sun still shone she thought bright and gold it sparkled on the grass on the river on the gossamer wings of dragons who flew lazy loops around castle geall i dont ask you to understand i demand your respect do you speak to me as my niece or as the queen she turned back framed by the window and the sunlight the gods have deemed me both you come to me out of concern and that i accept but you also come with condemnation and that i dont i trust cian with my life its my right my choice to trust him with my body and what of your people what of those who question how their queen could take one of these creatures of darkness as lover are all men good aunt are they all kind and good and strong are we as were made or how we choose to make ourselves thereafter ill say this about my people about those ill give my life fighting to defend they have more important things to worry about to think about to talk about than what their queen does in the privacy of her bedchamber deirdre got to her feet and when this war is over will you continue this will you put this thing you love on the throne at your side the sun still shone moira thought again even when the heart goes bleak when this is over if we live hell go back to his time and his place ill never see him again if we lose ill give my life if we win ill forfeit my heart dont speak to me of choices of responsibilities youll forget him when this is done youll forget him and this momentary madness look at me moira said quietly you know i wont no deirdres eyes swam with tears you wont id spare you from this i wouldnt not a moment of it ive been more alive with him than i ever was before or will be again so no not a moment of it t hey were all gathered in the parlor around the table and food when moira came in glenna reached over to remove a cover from the plate at the head of the table it should still be warm she told moira dont waste it i wont we need to eat to stay strong but she stared at the food on her plate as if it were bitter medicine so blair gave her a bright smile hows your day been so far the laugh however quick and humorless eased some of the knots in moiras stomach crappy that would be the word wouldnt it right down to the ground well she made herself eat shes struck at us as is her habit to incite fear and carve away at morale and confidence some will believe what she had sean tell us that if we surrender shell leave us in peace lies are often more attractive than the truth glenna commented times running out either way aye we we six will have to make preparation to leave the castle head toward the battleground agreed hoyt nodded before we do well need to be certain the bases weve set up are still in our hands if tynan was killed they may have taken that stronghold weve only the word of a demon it was the child who killed him and him alone it was the child cian drank tea that was nearly half whiskey the wounds on the body he explained they werent made by a fullgrown vampire still it doesnt answer if the strongholds are still secured hoyt and i can look glenna said ill want you to but looking isnt enough moira continued to eat we need to gather reports from those who survived if they did she looked at larkin and felt what he felt the constant thrum of fear for oran if they did she repeated if shed wiped out the base cian put in the messenger she sent would have bragged about it and likely shed have sent more bodies aye i can see that but to keep what she accomplished from happening again well want to add reinforcements you want us to go by dragon larkin nodded thats why you asked if they were ready to be ridden as many as can be used for this those who must go on foot or horseback from here will from today on be watched over by riders in the air if you larkin and blair could go this morning take a small number with you on dragonback you can travel to all the bases transport more weapons more men see to the reports and what you think must be done when you see for yourself where we stand you could be back before nightfall or failing that stay at one of the bases until the morning youre cutting too many of us out by sending two cian interrupted and i should be the one to go hey blair wagged a piece of soda bread how come you get to have all the fun practicalities first all but glenna and i have seen some of the ground of or near the battlefield firsthand its time i got the lay of it second with that bloody cloak i can start the journey during the day but i can travel more quickly and more safely than any of you at night and being a vampire myself ill recognize signs of them quicker than even our resident demon hunter he makes a good argument for it larkin pointed out ive been planning to go nose around a bit in any case so this will kill all the birds with one stone and the last of it i think we can all agree the mood here would settle if i wasnt around she was out of line blair muttered cian shrugged knowing she spoke of tynans mother all a matter of perspective and where you draw that line times getting short and one of us should be on the battleground particularly at night when lilith might be scouting around herself you dont mean to come back moira said slowly theres no point in it their eyes met held and said a great deal more than words one of the men can come back with your reports and so on and id fill in the rest of it when all of you arrive youve already decided this moira watched his face carefully i see were a circle here equal links for such a decision i think we should all have a say hoyt i dont like any of us going off without the others truth be told but it needs to be done and cian makes the most sense of it we can watch as we watched when larkin went to the caves back in ireland if need be we can intervene he looked at his wife glenna yes agreed larkin the same with one change in it i think youre wrong cian to say wed be cutting it too thin to send two out i think no one goes on their own i can get you there in dragon form and he continued before there were objections im more experienced with the dragons than you should there be any trouble with them or the enemy so im saying we go together you and i blair damn it dragonboys right you may move faster alone cian but youre going to need a dragon wrangler to get there especially if youre leading men yes its smarter glenna considered all around smarter it gets my vote and mine as well hoyt said moira then thats what well do she got to her feet knowing she was sending the two men she loved most away from her the rest of us will finish the weapons secure the castle and follow in two days big push blair considered nodded we can do it then we will larkin ill leave it to you to pick the dragons for this and to you and cian to pick the men moira laid it out in her mind the overview the details ill want niall left back if you will to go at the end of it with the rest of us ill go now see to the supplies youll need w hen shed done all she could and hoping she was calm moira went to cians bedchamber she knocked then opened the door without waiting for his response with the curtains drawn there was barely enough light to see so she flicked her hand her power toward a candle the way the flame spurted warned her she wasnt as calm as shed hoped he continued to pack what he wanted to take in a duffle you said nothing of these plans to me no were you going to leave in the night with no word i dont know he stopped looked at her there were a great many things he couldnt give her or ask of her he reflected at least honesty was a quality they could share yes at least initially then you came to my door one night and my plans changed or they were postponed postponed she nodded slowly and when samhains come and gone will you leave without a word words would be useless wouldnt they not to me there was panic rising up in her at the knowledge they were moving toward the end how could she not have known that was waiting in her to push its way out and choke her words would be precious to me you want to leave i can see it you want to go i should have gone before if id been quicker id have been out the door and gone before you came to me youd be better off for it this with me its no good for you how dare you how dare you speak to me like a child who wants too many sweets im sick to death of being lectured on what i should think feel have do if you want to go youll go but dont insult me my going has nothing to do with whats between us its just something that has to be done you agreed and so did the rest if i hadnt they hadnt youd have gone anyway he watched her as he strapped on his sword pain was already slicing thin wounds in both of them as hed known it would from the moment hed touched her yes but its less complicated this way are you done with me then and if i am youll be fighting on two fronts you right bastard he laughed couldnt help himself it wasnt only pain between them he realized hed do well to remember that then its lucky for me im not done with you moira last night you knew you had to be the one to end what had once been a boy youd known youd been fond of i knew it so i stopped myself from doing it from sparing you from that i know i have to go and go without you for now you know that too it doesnt make it easier we may never be alone again never be able to be with each other as we were again i want more time there hasnt been enough time and i need more she moved to him held him hard and tight we didnt have our night it didnt last till morning but the hours mattered every minute of them im greedy and already fretting that youll go while i stay not just today he thought both of them knew she didnt speak only of today do women of geall follow the tradition of sending their men off with a favor what would you have from me a lock of your hair the sentiment of it surprised him and embarrassed a little but when she drew back he could see his request had pleased her youll keep it with you that part of me i would if youll spare it she touched her hair then held up a hand wait wait i have something ill have to get it she heard the trumpet call of dragons oh theyre ready for you ill bring it to you outside dont leave promise me youll wait until i come to say goodbye ill be there this time he thought as she rushed out o utside in the shelter of shade cian studied the dragons larkin had chosen and the men theyd decided on together then he frowned down at the ball of hardened mud glenna held out to him thanks but i had quite enough at breakfast very funny its a bomb red its a ball of mud yes a ball of earth charmed earth holding a ball of fire inside if you drop it from the air she used her hands waving them down as she made a whistling noise then a puff of breath to simulate an explosion in theory she added in theory ive tested it but not from a dragon perch at some point you could try it out for me frowning he turned it over in his hands just drop it right somewhere safe and its not likely to explode in my hands and turn me into a fireball it needs velocity and force but it wouldnt hurt to be sure you had good altitude when its bombs away she rose on her toes kissed him on both cheeks be safe well see you in a couple of days still frowning he secured the ball into one of the pockets of the weapon harness blair had fashioned for larkin well be watching hoyt laid a hand on cians shoulder try to stay out of trouble until im with you again and you as well he said to larkin ive already told him ill kick his ass if he gets himself killed blair gripped larkins hair pulled his head down for a hard kiss she turned to cian were not doing a group hug she grinned im with you on that stay away from pointy wooden objects thats the plan he looked over her head as moira ran toward the stables id hoped to be quicker she said breathlessly youre ready then larkin be safe she hugged him and you he gave her a last squeeze mount your dragons he called out and with a last flashing grin for blair changed i have what you asked me for moira held out a silver locket while blair harnessed larkin my father gave it to my mother when i was born so she could keep a lock of my hair in it i left that one and put in another and had added what magic she could rising on her toes she put the chain over his head to make a point to him to any who watched she took his face in her hands and kissed him long and warm and tender ill have another of those waiting for you she told him so dont do anything foolish he put on the cloak lifting the hood and securing it he mounted larkin looked into moiras eyes in two days he said he rose up into the sky on the golden dragon others soared behind him trumpeting as she watched as those glints of color grew smaller with distance moira was struck with a sudden knowledge a certainty that the six of them would not come back from the valley to castle geall as a circle behind her glenna gestured to hoyt sending him away she hooked an arm around blairs waist around moiras all right ladies lets get busy packing and stacking so we can get you back together with your men chapter h e wished for rain or at the very least a thick layer of cooling clouds to smother the sun the damn cloak was hot as the hell he was eventually bound for he just wasnt used to feeling extremes in temperatures being undead cian mused tended to spoil a man soaring on a dragon was a thrilling experience no question for the first thirty minutes or so and another thirty could be spent admiring the green and pastoral countryside below but after an hour in a fucking wool sauna it was just misery if he had hoyts patience and dignity he supposed he would ride steelyeyed and straightbacked until doomsday even with the intolerable heat melting the flesh from his bones but then he and his twin had had some basic differences even before hed become a vampire he could meditate he supposed but it seemed unwise to risk a selfinduced trance he had the sun beating overhead just waiting to fry him like bacon and a magic bomb strapped on larkin that for all he knew could burst into flame just for the fun of it why exactly had he thought he had to do this idiotic thing ah yes duty honor love pride all those emotional weights that dragged a man down into the drowning pool however hard he struggled to keep his head above the surface well there was no going back now not on the flight not on the feelings crowding inside him my god he loved her moira the studious moira the queen the shy and the valiant the canny and the quiet it was stupid destructive hopeless to love her and it was more real than anything hed known in a thousand years he could feel the locket shed put around his neck another weight shed called him a bastard one minute then had given him one of what he was certain was her most valued treasures the next then again shed once aimed an arrow at his heart then apologized with a simple sincerity and flushed mortification it was probably at that moment when hed fallen for her or at least tripped he continued to study the land as his mind wandered good farmland he mused with rich loamy soil and gentle rises streams and rivers thick with fish running through forests that teemed with game the mountains in the distance rich with minerals and marbles deep bogs for cutting turf for fuel shed brought orange seeds through the dance who would think of such a thing shed need to plant them in the south did she know that foolish thought the woman knew everything or had a way of finding out orange seeds and yeats and because hed seen it on the writing table in her sitting room a roller ball pen so shed grow her orange saplings in the hothouse then plant them in the south of geall if they pollinated and how could they refuse her shed have an orange grove one day hed like to see it he realized hed like to see her orange blossoms bloom from the seeds shed taken from his kitchen in ireland hed like to see her lovely eyes light with humor and appreciation as she poured a glass of the orange juice shed become addicted to if lilith had her day thered be no grove no blossoms no life here at all already he could see some of the death some of the destruction what had been tidy cottages and little cabins were rubble of scorched rock and wood cattle and sheep continued to graze in the fields but there were carcasses rotting in the sun under a black cloud of flies cattle killed by deserters he decided scavenging where and when they could theyd have to be hunted down and destroyed every last one if even one survived it would feed and it would breed the people of geall and their queen would have to be cautious and vigilant long after samhain he began to put his mind to that particular problem until at last larkin began to circle thank all your gods cian murmured on the descent it was a neat and pretty farm as farms went soldiers were spread out training posted at points for guards women were among them working alongside the men and the smoke that rose from the chimney carried a scent that told him there was stew in a pot likely simmering throughout the day on the ground hands were shading eyes as faces looked up or were being raised in waves and salutes of welcome they were surrounded the minute larkin landed cian dismounted began to unload the supplies hed leave it to larkin and the other men to answer questions and ask them now he needed shadow and shade w e havent had any trouble at all isleen spooned up stew cian didnt want but he thought it best to wait to dip into his supply of blood until he had privacy larkin dove into his bowl the instant they were set down thanks he said with his mouth full its fine stew youre very welcome im doing the cooking by and large so im thinking our troop here is eating better than the others she dimpled into a smile weve been keeping up with our training every day and locking up tight before sunset we havent seen hide nor hair of anyone since we arrived and sent the other troop on its way its good to know that larkin picked up the tankard shed set beside his bowl could you do me a favor then isleen darling would you fetch eogan cearas eogan weve some talking to do sure ill do that right away oh and you can bed down here or upstairs if youd rather well be moving on to the next base after a bit and leaving three of the men we brought behind here with you oh i noticed you brought redhaired malvin along she said it casually with just the hint of a laugh i wonder if hed be one youd leave behind with us larkin grinned and spooned up more stew that wouldnt be a problem not at all fetch eogan now wont you sweetheart youve had a bit of that have you cian murmured had no then his tawny eyes glinted with humor well a bit but nothing substantial you could say how do you want to handle this business eogans a sensible man a solid one hed have heard of tynan by now from those we brought with us so ill answer the questions hell have on that id like it best if youd go over the precautions and orders again with him then if hes nothing more to report than weve just heard from isleen well leave malvin and two others here and go on to the next arent you hungry then as a matter of fact but ill wait ah larkin nodded his understanding you have what you need in that area i do the horses and cows are safe i saw the carcasses along the way not like an army had fed but a few scavengers deserters would you say its exactly what id say an advantage now larkin murmured with her losing troops here and there a problem for later it will be yes well think of something larkin looked over as the door opened eogan weve much to talk about and little time t here was little more at the next stronghold but at the third lilith had left her mark two of the outbuildings had been burned to rubble and in the fields the crops had been torched the men talked of a night of fire and smoke and the screams of the cattle as they were slaughtered with larkin cian stood and studied the scorched earth its as you said you and blair she would lay waste to the farms and the homes stone and wood larkin shook his head livestock and crops sweat and blood hearth and home all of which can be bred and grown shed and built again your men withstood the siege with no casualties they fought and held the ground and took some of liliths forces to hell your glass is miraculously half full larkin youd be right i know it and i hope if she tries to drink whats left in it it burns her guts black well move on then there were fresh graves at the next base burned earth and wounded men the sick dread in larkins belly eased finally when he saw his younger brother oran limp out of the farmhouse he strode to oran quickly and in the way of men gave him a hard punch in the arm then a bear hug our mother will be pleased youre among the living how bad are your wounds scratches how is it at home busy ive seen phelan at one of the other camps and hes safe and well its good to hear good to hear but i have hard news larkin we know of it he laid a hand on orans shoulder his brother had been little more than a boy when hed marched away from home larkin thought now he was a man with all the weight that went with it how many besides tynan three more and another i fear wont make the night two others taken dead or alive i cant say it was a child larkin a demon child who killed tynan well go inside and talk of it t hey used the kitchen with cian sitting back from the window he understood why larkin listened to the whole account though they knew or could imagine most of it oran had to speak it all see it all again id had the watch before his and was still sleeping when i heard the alarm it was already too late for tynan larkin already too late hed gone out alone thinking there was a child hurt and lost and afraid it lured him you see some distance from the house and though there were men posted bows ready when it turned and ripped at him it was too late he wet his throat with ale men rushed out i think back i think i was second in command and should have ordered them to hold it was too late to save him but how could we not try and because we did more were lost he would have done the same for you for anyone they took his body orans young face was alive with grief and his eyes very old we searched the next morning we searched for him and the two others but found only blood we fear theyve been changed not tynan cian spoke now waited for orans weary gaze to meet his we cant say about the other two but tynan wasnt changed his body was brought back to castle geal he was given a full burial early this morning ill thank the gods for that at least but who brought the body as larkin gave the account orans face hardened again young sean we couldnt save him in the ambush along the road they came out of the ground like hellhounds we lost good men that day and sean was lost as well is he at peace now he looked to cian now that what took him over is gone is he at peace i dont have the answer well ill believe he is just as tynan is and the others weve buried he cant be held accountable by men or gods for what was done to him t hey double posted guards for the night and at cians instructions small bladders were filled with blessed water these would be hooked to arrows with this even a miss of the heart would cause considerable damage and possible death in addition more traps had been set men who couldnt sleep whiled away the time carving stakes do you think shell send out a raiding party tonight larkin asked cian they sat in what had been a small parlor and was now in use for weapon storage to one of the other points she may here little point in it unless shes bored or wants to exercise some of her troops shes done what she had in mind to do at this base since they were alone cian drank blood from a pottery cup and if you were her id send out small parties to distract and harass chipping away at enemy troops and morale at every base the trouble with that is your men tend to stand firm while we know some of hers desert but your individual losses echo with you where hers mean less than nothing he drank again but then im not her being me id find satisfaction in seeking out a raiding party taking it by surprise before it reached its objective and killing the hell out of it isnt that peculiar larkin said with a grin not being her and not being you the exact same thought had planted itself in my mind well then what are we waiting for they left oran in charge of the base though there was considerable argument discussion debate larkin and cian set out alone one dragon and one vampire cian had reasoned could travel swiftly and undetected if they found a party and opted to land for handtohand larkins weapon harness was wellloaded cian swung a quiver over his back loaded extra stakes in his sword belt itll be interesting to see how the idea of aerial warfare flies as it were ready then larkin changed stood gold and sinuous as cian strapped on the harness theyd agreed to keep it short and simple they would fly in widening circles looking for any sign of a party or a camp if they spotted one theyd strike quick and clean the flight up toward a moon approaching its third quarter was exhilarating the freedom of the night swept over cian he flew without cloak or coat reveling in the cool and the dark beneath him larkin soared his dragons wings barely a whisper on the air and so thin cian could see the glimmer of stars through them when they swept the air clouds drifted thin wisps that slid like gauze over stars sailed like ghost ships over the waxing moon far below the first fingers of fog began their crawl over the ground if nothing else the pleasure of the flight balanced out the smothering discomfort of the days journey as if he sensed it larkin aimed higher rising in lazy loops for one indulgent moment cian closed his eyes and just enjoyed then he felt it a stroke along the skin cold seeking fingers that seemed to slide into him and swirl through his blood and a whisper inside his head a quiet sirens song that called to what he was beneath the form of a man and when he looked down the savage ground of the battlefield spread below its utter silence was a scream of violence it burned into him like molten steel brilliant and dark deep and primal the grass was wild sharp blades the rocks rough death then even they would give way to black pits of chasms and caves where nothing dared to crawl guarded by the mountains the damned ground waited for blood he had only to lean forward such a short distance and sink his teeth in the neck of the dragon to find the blood of a man human and rich that gush of life and a taste no other living thing could match a flavor hed denied himself for centuries and why to live among them to survive wearing the mask of one of them they were beneath him so much less fleas on a dog they were nothing but flesh and blood created for him to hunt the hunger gnawed in him and the desire the feral thrill of it pumped through him like a heartbeat the memory of the kill of that first hot spurt of life gushing into his mouth riding down his throat was glorious shaking like an addict in the throes of withdrawal he fought it he would not end it this way he would not go back to being a prisoner of his own blood he was stronger than that had made himself more than that his belly cramped with need and nausea as he leaned toward larkin put down here stay in this form be ready to fly again to leave me if you need youll know it dragged at him that cursed ground as they lowered toward it it murmured and sang and promised it lied the heat was in him like a fever as he leaped down he would not he swore he would not turn himself and kill a friend as hed once tried to kill his brother its this place its evil i told you not to change forms dont touch me i feel it inside me larkins voice was calm and even it must burn in you cian turned his eyes red his skin slicked with sweat from his inner war are you stupid no but larkin hadnt and didnt now draw a weapon youre fighting it and youll beat it back whatever it is this place calls to in you theres more theres what moira loves you dont know the hunger of it deep in his throat a groan waited it hummed in cians ears and with it he could hear the beat of larkins pulse i can smell you the human do you smell fear shudders ran through him hard enough he thought his bones might crack to pieces his head was screaming screaming and still he couldnt block out the sound the vicious temptation of that beating heart no but there could be i could bring it into you fear sweetens it god god what sick hand forged this place his legs wouldnt hold him so he lowered to the ground and struggled to tighten his slippery grip on his will as he did he closed his fingers around the locket shed put around his neck the sickness ebbed just a little as if a cool hand had stroked a fevered brow she brings me light thats what she brings to me and i take it and feel like a man but im not this is a hard reminder that im not i see a man when i look at you well youre wrong but i wont drink tonight not from you not from a human it wont swallow me tonight and it wont take me like this again now that i know the red was fading from his eyes as he looked up at larkin you were a fool not to draw a weapon in answer larkin lifted the cross from its chain it might have been enough cian considered he scrubbed his sweaty palms dry on the knees of his jeans fortunately for us both we dont have to test it ill take you back cian looked at the hand larkin offered humans he thought trusting and optimistic he took it pulled himself to his feet no well go on i need to hunt something hed won the battle cian thought as they rose into the air again but he wouldnt deny he was relieved to be heading away from that ground and he was darkly thrilled when he spotted the movements below a dozen troops he noted on foot and moving with that fluid swiftness of his kind for all the speed there was a precision to it an order in the ranks that told him they were trained and seasoned soldiers he felt the shift of the dragons body when larkin saw them and once again cian leaned down why dont we try out glennas newest weapon when they cross the next field fly directly over the center of the squad theyve got archers so once the shit hits youll have to go into evasive maneuvers as larkin flew into position cian reached into the harness pocket and took out the ball how is a dragon like a plane he considered and put his centuries of experience as a pilot to use gauging airspeed distance velocity bombs away he murmured and let the ball drop it smashed into the ground causing the baffled squad to stop draw weapons cian was about to chalk glennas experiment up to a loss when there was a towering burst of flame those closest to it were simply obliterated while a few others caught fire watching the panic hearing the screams cian notched an arrow ducks in a barrel he mused and picked off what was left once again larkin touched down and changed well he kicked carelessly at a pile of ash that was quick i feel better for having killed something but it was detached impersonal human style doesnt have the same kick as a true hunt same reason we dont use guns or modern weaponry cian added theres just no thrill in it im sorry for that but the results of it suit me well enough and glennas fireball worked a treat didnt it now larkin began to gather the weapons scattered over the ground as he bent down an arrow whizzed over his back and planted itself in cians hip oh well bugger it i must have missed one take the harness larkin tossed it at cian and get on he flashed to dragon and since he considered the arrow might slow him down a little on foot cian vaulted up he caught the next arrow in the air before it could strike then larkin was rising and diving and swerving there i see them second party entirely likely a hunting party looking for stray humans or whatever comes to hand he used the bow again taking out a few as they scattered and took cover its just no fun this way he decided drawing his sword he leaped off larkin and dropped thirty feet to the ground if dragons could curse larkin would have turned the air blue they came at cian like the points of a triangle two male three female he sliced the arrow coming at him in two with his sword then spun the blade back to block the oncoming attack the dregs of what hed felt on the battleground were in him and he used them that need for blood if not to drink then to shed it he fought at first to wound so he could smell it the rich copper of it and ride on it as he hacked and sliced the dragons tail whipped down slapped one of the females back as she lifted her bow again then its claws raked at the throat to amuse himself cian flipped back shot a vicious kick into the face of an opponent when it stumbled he took its head even as he yanked the arrow from its hip and plunged it into the heart of the one coming from his left he spun around saw that larkin had changed and was ramming a spent arrow in the heart of the last one is that it then larkin said breathlessly is that the last of them by my count and you counted so well the last time he rose brushed himself off bloody dust are you feeling more yourself now top of the world ma cian rubbed absently at his wounded hip since it was pouring blood he ripped off the sleeve of his shirt give me a hand will you quick field dressing you want me to bandage your arse it not my ass you git close enough but larkin walked over to see to it drop your drawers then sweetheart cian spared him a single dark look but obliged and what do you think liliths mood will be when not a one of her raiding or hunting parties comes back shell be pissed cian craned his head to watch larkins work royally makes a body feel good doesnt it youll have a fine hole in your bum for a bit hip looks like your ass to me and im hungry enough to eat a donkey hide and all time we went back had ourselves a meal and a tankard there youll do it was a good nights work he added when cian pulled his pants up again turned out that way it could have gone otherwise back there at the valley larkin philosophically larkin pulled up some clumps of grass to wipe most of cians blood from his hands i dont think thats the truth of it i dont think it could have gone any way but what it did now if your ass isnt too sore youll help me gather up all these nice weapons to add to our supply leave my ass out of it together they began to gather swords bows arrows im sure that portion of you will be fine again shortly if not moirall kiss it well for you when they arrive cian looked over as larkin whistled a tune and loaded swords in the harness youre a funny guy larkin a damn funny guy i n geall moira walked away from the crystal to stand at the window with her arms folded am i mistaken in it or were they not told to go check the bases take no risks they disobeyed blair agreed but youve got to admit it was a good fight and that fire ball was excellent the delays a little concern glenna continued to watch as they flew back toward base ill work on that im a little more worried about the effect the battlefield had on cian he fought it off hoyt replied whatever tried to take hold of him he fought it off he did to his credit glenna agreed but it was hard won hoyt its something we have to think about maybe we can work a charm or spell that will help him block it no moira spoke without turning hell do it himself hell need to isnt it his will that makes him what he is i suppose youre right glenna studied moiras rigid back just as i suppose the two of them had to go out tonight and do what they did that may be are they back safe yet coming in for touchdown blair told her and alls quiet on the western front well eastern front but that doesnt have the same literary ring quiet for the moment moira turned back i think its safe to say theyll be tucked up for the night now and its unlikely therell be another raid on the base we should all get some sleep good idea glenna gathered up the crystal they said good night went their separate ways but none of them went to bed hoyt and glenna went to the tower to work blair headed to the empty ballroom to train moira went to the library and pulled out every book she could find on the lore and legend and history of the valley of silence she read and studied until the first light of dawn when she slept curled in the window seat as shed often done as a child she dreamed of a great war between gods and demons a battle that had raged for a century and more a war that had spilled the blood of both until it ran like an ocean and the ocean became a valley and the valley became silence chapter s inann you should be in bed still with her hand resting on her belly sinann shook her head at moira i couldnt let my father leave without seeing him off or you sinann looked around the courtyard where horses and dragons and men were preparing for the journey it will seem so empty now with so few of us left inside the walls she managed a smile as she watched her father hoist her son high in the air well come back and the noise will be deafening bring them back to me moira the strain began to leak through now through her eyes her voice my husband my father my brothers bring them back to me she took sinanns arms ill do everything in my power sinann pressed moiras hand to her belly theres life feel it tell phelan you felt his child move i will ill tend your seedlings and keep a candle lit until you all come home again moira how will we know how will we know if you youll know moira promised if the gods dont send a sign of our victory then we will i promise now go kiss your father and ill kiss all your other men for you when i see them moira moved to her aunt touched a hand to deirdres arm ive spoken with the men i can leave with you my orders are clear simple and to be followed exactly the gate stays locked and no one leaves the castle day or night until word comes that the battle is done i count on you as the head of my family who remains here to see these orders are followed you are my regent until my return or in the event of my death oh moira in the event of my death you will serve until the next rightful ruler is chosen she pulled off a ring that had been her mothers and pushed it into deirdres hand this is a sign of your authority in my name ill honor your wishes your orders and that name i swear it to you moira she gripped her nieces hands im sorry we quarreled so am i though her eyes were wet deirdre managed a tremulous smile though we both part here believing we had the right of it we do i dont love you less because of it my child deirdre held her close my sweet girl every prayer i know goes with you come back to us tell my sons they have my heart and my pride sorry blair touched moiras shoulder everythings ready ill say goodbye to you deirdre stepped forward to kiss blairs cheeks and trust youll keep my eldest out of trouble do my best youll need to hes a handful she opened her mouth to speak again then took a steadying breath i was going to say be safe but thats not what warriors want to hear so im saying fight well you can count on it without pomp or pageantry they mounted horses and dragons groups of children were gathered clucked over by the women who remained behind the old leaned on walking sticks or the arms of the younger there were tears glimmering while they might look through the mist of them to loved ones leaving them behind moira knew they looked to her as well bring them back to me how many had that single desperate wish in their hearts and minds not all would have that wish granted but she would as shed sworn to sinann do her best and she wouldnt leave them or lead them with tears moira signalled to niall who would lead the ground force when he called for the gates to be raised she lifted the sword of geall high and leading the last of the troops from castle geall she shot an arc of fire into the pale morning sky the dragon riders arrived first to mobilize the troops they would abandon the first base to begin the next leg of the march to the battlefield supplies and weapons were packed and men were taken up on dragons or onto horses when they arrived those who went on foot were flanked by riders air and ground so they traveled across the land and the skies of geall at the next stop they rested and watered their mounts youll have tea my lady ceara joined moira near a stream where dragons drank what oh thanks moira took the cup ive never seen such a sight no moira continued to watch the dragons and wondered if any of them would see such a sight again youll ride with your husband ceara i will my lady were near ready where is the cross you won ceara the one youre wearing is copper i ceara lifted her hand to the copper cross i left it with my mother majesty i wanted my children protected if of course you did she wrapped her fingers around cearas wrist and squeezed of course she turned as blair strode toward them time to round them up mounts are rested and watered supplies and weapons are packed except for what were leaving behind with the squad thatll hold this base until tomorrow the troops behind us should arrive well before sunset moira looked to the skies do they have enough protection if theres a change in the weather natural or otherwise lilith may have some snipers and scouts scattered this far west but nothing the troops cant handle we have to move on moira leapfrogging this way keeps soldiers from being exposed and vulnerable at night but it takes time and weve a schedule to keep moira agreed give the order then and well move on i t was well past midday when the first of them arrived at their final destination below where she flew men stopped and cheered she saw larkin come out of the house lift his face then change into a dragon to fly up and join them and she saw the dark earth of fresh graves larkin circled her with a quick showy flourish then paced himself to blairs mount moira lost her breath when blair stood on her dragons back then sprang off into the air the cheers from below rose up like thunder as blair landed on larkin and rode him down like a festival moira thought as other riders executed showy turns and dives perhaps they needed the show and the foolishness for these last few hours of daylight night would come soon enough she would have seen to her own mount as she had along the way but larkin plucked her off her feet gave her a whirl and a kiss that doesnt sweeten me up she told him ive a bone to pick with you you were to travel gather reports and secure not go out looking for trouble we do what we must when we must he kissed her again and alls well isnt it is it it is he is go inside there are plenty here to see to the mounts youve had a long journey no trouble along the way blair says no none she let him lead her inside there was a pot of stew simmering over the fire and the scent of it of men and mud filled the air maps were spread over a table where she imagined a family had once gathered hangings over the windows were homespun and cheerful and the walls were clean and whitewashed weapons stood at every door and window youve a chamber upstairs if you want a bit of a rest no im fine but in fact i could use a whiskey if theres any to be had there is she could see by his face that blair had come behind them mounts are being tended blair began supplies and weapons unloaded hoyts on it whats the setup here weve troops bunking in the stables the barn the dovecote and the smokehouse as well as in here theres a loft thats roomy enough and were using it as a kind of barracks he poured a whiskey as he spoke cocked his head at blair but she shook hers sitting room here is serving as the main arsenal he continued and weve weapons stockpiled in all the buildings the men take shifts day and night training continues daily there were raids as you know but none since cian and i arrived saw to that didnt you moira asked before she drank we did and gave lilith a good boot in the arse we lost another man yesterday one who was wounded in the raid that killed tynan he didnt die easy moira looked down into her whiskey are there more wounded aye but walking theres a kind of parlor open to the kitchen and weve been using that for tending those who need it glenna will have a look at that and arrange it as she sees best well she downed the rest of the whiskey we all know theres not enough room inside shelters for all the troops nearly a thousand here tonight and half again that many wholl be here within the next two days then wed better get busy making camp blair said there was some pride in it moira discovered at seeing so many of her people men and women old and young working together tents began to spread over the field while wood and turf was gathered for cook fires wagons of supplies were unloaded and stacked you have your army glenna said from beside her one day i hope crops will be planted here again instead of tents there are so many there never seemed so many before can you hold so many within a protective circle glennas face tightened with sheer determination liliths pet dog managed to shield their entire base i hope youre not suggesting hoyt and i cant measure up wouldnt think of it damn big circle to cast glenna admitted and the suns getting low well have to get started we could use you i was hoping you could with them moira walked the field from end to end and as glenna had instructed gathered blades of grass small stones bits of earth as she went they met again in the center as word had passed that magic would be done the troops fell silent in the hush moira heard the first whispers of power they called on the guardians east and west north and south on morrigan their patron she took up the chant with them as shed been given it in this place and in this hour we call upon the ancient powers to hear our needs and grant our plea to shelter all in this company upon this grass this earth this stone protection from harm bestow only life at its fullest may cross this ring and none may enter with harm to bring within this circle that was cast no enemy nor his weapon may pass night or day day or night shield earth and air within its light now our blood will seal this shield and circle it round this field as hoyt and glenna did moira cut her palm with an athame then fisted it around the dirt the grass the stones shed gathered it pumped and plunged through her the heat hers and theirs and the wind they raised blew in widening circles slapping at the tents singing through the grass until it whipped around and around the edges of the field in a cyclone of light with hoyt and glenna she threw down the bloodsoaked earth felt the shudder under her feet as three small flames bloomed and died when they clasped hands her body bowed back from the force of what joined them rise and circle she shouted with them circle and close and bar this place from all our foes blood and fire here mix free as we will so mote it be around the field red flames speared up when the earth was scorched white in a perfect ring the flames vanished in a thunderclap moiras vision wavered and the voices that spoke to her seemed to blur as well as if the world were suddenly underwater when she came back to herself she was on her knees glenna was gripping her shoulders and saying her name im all right im all right it was just it was so much just need my breath back take your time it was a powerful spell only more so because we used blood moira looked down at the slice on her hand everythings a weapon she stated as blair says whatever it takes as long as it works id say it has hoyt said quietly following his direction moira saw cian standing outside the circle though the cloak protected him from the last rays of the sun she could see his eyes and the fury in them well then well leave the men to finish setting up camp lean on me glenna told her youre white as a sheet no it wont do though her knees were still like pudding the men cant see me drooping now im just a bit off in the stomach is all as she crossed the field cian turned on his heel and strode back to the house he was waiting inside and something of his mood must have translated as he was alone are you trying to lay her out before lilith gets the chance he demanded what are you thinking dragging her into magicks like that strong enough to brew up your own personal hurricane we needed her hoyt said simply it isnt an easy matter to throw a net over an area so large that holds so many and as it stopped you on the edge the spell holds it hadnt just stopped him but had shot jolts of electricity through him he was surprised his hair wasnt standing on end shes not strong enough to dont tell me what im not strong enough to do ive done what was needed and isnt that the same youd say to me if i dared question your reckless journey to the valley both are done now and were able to stand here and argue about it so id say both are well done im told i have a chamber upstairs does anyone know where it might be first door left cian snapped when she walked haughtily he thought up the stairs he cursed then followed her she sat in the chair by the fire that had yet to be lit with her head between her knees my heads light and it doesnt need you bringing a scold down on it ill be myself again in a moment you seem yourself to me he poured water into a cup held it down so she could see it drink this youre white as a corpse ive made corpses with more color than you a lovely thing to say truth is rarely pretty she sat back in the chair studying him as she drank the water youre angry and thats just fine and good as im angry right with you you knew i was here but you didnt come down no i didnt come down youre a great fool is what you are thinking youd ease back from me that id let you weve only days left before we end this thing so you go ahead and take steps back from me ill just take them toward you until your backs in the corner ive not only learned to fight ive learned not to fight clean she gave a little shiver its cold ive nothing left after that spell to get the fire lit he moved toward the hearth and before he bent down for the tinderbox she took his hand and she pressed it against her cheek it broke him a snap like glass he lifted her out of the chair holding her off the floor while his mouth plundered hers she simply wrapped herself around him wantonly arms and legs aye thats better she said breathlessly much warmer now the hours seemed endless since i watched you go so little time so little for eternity look at me yes theres that face he held her close again so her head rested on his shoulder did you miss it my face i did you dont have to fight dirty when youve already carved yourself inside me easier to be angry with each other it hurts less she squeezed her eyes tight for a moment then eased back when he set her on her feet i brought the vielle i thought you might like to have it to play it we should have music like we should have light and laughter and all the things that remind us what were ready to die for she walked to the window the suns setting will you go back to the battlefield tonight she glanced around when he didnt speak we saw you go with larkin two nights ago and saw you go alone last night each time i go im a little stronger i wont be any good to you or myself if whats soaked into that ground turns me youre right on that and tonight ill be going with you you can waste time arguing cian she said as he began to but ill be going geall is mine after all and every inch of its ground whatever is under it i havent been on the edges of that place since my childhood except in my dreams of it i need to see it and at night as it will be on samhain so ill be going with you or ill be going alone b ut i want to go i want to please please please lilith wondered if her head could actually explode from the boys incessant whining and wheedling davey i said no its too close to samhain and much too dangerous for you to leave the house im a soldier his little face went sharp and vicious lucius said so i have a sword he unsheathed the small blade shed had made for him to her current regret after his field kill its just a hunting party she began i want to hunt i want to fight davey slashed at the air with his sword i want to kill yes yes yes lilith waved him away and you will to your hearts content after samhain not another word she snapped the order out while a tinge of red smeared the whites of her eyes ive had enough from you for one day youre too young and too small and thats the end of it now go to your room and play with that damned cat you wanted so much his eyes gleamed red and his lips peeled back in a snarl that stripped away even the mask of human innocence im not too small i hate the cat and i hate you he stormed off his little legs pumping in his tantrum he swung his sword wildly as he went slicing through the torso of a human servant who wasnt quick enough to leap aside damnation look at that mess lilith threw up her hands at the blood spatter on the walls that boys driving me mad needs a good swat if you ask me face livid now lilith rounded on lora shut your mouth dont tell me what he needs im his mother bien sur dont bite at me because hes being a brat sulking lora slumped into a chair her face was nearly healed now but the scars that remained burned into her like poison simple to see where he gets his bitchy attitude one of liliths hands curled the redtipped nails like talons maybe youre the one who needs a good swat knowing lilith could do worse than a swat in her current mood lora shrugged i wasnt the one who hammered at you the last hour was i i backed you up with davey and now youre taking it out on me maybe were all on edge but you and i should stick together youre right youre right lilith dragged her hands through her hair he actually gave me a headache imagine hes just how do they say it acting out hes so proud of himself for that kill in the field i cant let him go out no no lora waved a hand you did absolutely right weve lost a hunting party and a raiding party and its no place for davey out there i still say you shouldve given him a good slap for talking back to you he may get one yet have someone clean that up she gestured vaguely toward the body of the servant then make sure the hunting party gets on its way maybe theyll be luckier tonight and track down the odd human the troops are tired of sheeps blood oh one more thing she said as lora started out i want a little something to eat to calm myself down do we have any children left ill check something small in any case i dont have much of an appetite tonight have it sent up to my room i need some quiet alone she paced the room as if it were a cage her nerves were stretched she could admit that so much on her mind so many details so many responsibilities with it all coming to the end of the circle at last the loss of troops was infuriating and worrisome deserters had been a problem but she sent out scavengers nightly to hunt them down and destroy them it simply wasnt possible two full squads had deserted more human traps she wondered they were costing her dearly and would cost the humans a great deal more when she was done no one understood the pressure she was under the weight of her responsibility she had worlds to decimate her destiny was pressing down on her and she was surrounded by fools and incompetents now her own sweet davey her own darling boy was behaving like a snarling spitting brat hed actually sassed her something she took from no one she wasnt certain if she should be proud or furious still she thought hed looked so cute and fierce waving that miniature sword and hadnt he nearly cut that stupid servant in two then stomped right out almost swaggered without a backward glance it was annoying of course but how could she not be a little proud she walked to the door stepped out so she could feel the night slide over her into her he felt trapped in this house poor davey so did she but soon of course of course what a terrible mother she was shed arrange a hunt right here on the shielded grounds just the two of them it would perk up her appetite her spirits and davey would be thrilled pleased with the idea she went back in and stepping over the bleeding body went upstairs davey wheres my bad little boy i have a surprise for you she opened the door of his room the smell came first there was a considerable amount of blood on the floor on the walls on the bed covers shed had made for him of royal blue silk pieces of the cat were strewn everywhere it had been she recalled a very large cat she sighed then felt a laugh bubbling up what a temper her little darling had davey you naughty boy come out from wherever youre hiding or i might change my mind about the surprise she rolled her eyes being a mother was such work im not angry my sweetheart ive just had so much on my mind and i forgot you and i need to have some fun she searched the room as she spoke then frowned when she didnt find him there were little pricks of concern as she stepped again lora dragged a woman behind her by a neck shackle were out of children but this ones small no no not now i cant find davey not in his room lora peeked in ah creative hes hiding somewhere because youre angry with him i have something lilith pressed a hand to her belly something tight inside me i want him found quickly they called out a search scoured the manor house the outbuilding the fields within the protected area the tightness in liliths belly became strangling knots when they discovered his pony missing hes run away hes run off oh why didnt i make certain he was in his room i have to find him wait wait lora insisted and grabbed lilith hard you cant risk going outside the safety area hes mine i have to find him we will we will well send our best trackers well use midir ill go myself no struggling for calm lilith closed her eyes i cant risk you lucius find lucius and have him come to me in midirs lair hurry she cooled her blood and her mind to rule took heat she knew but it also took ice it was ice she needed to hold strong until the prince was safe again i depend on you lucius my lady ill find him i give you my word and my word that i would give my life to see him safely home i know it she laid her hand on his shoulder theres no one i trust more bring him back to me and anything you ask of me is yours she whirled on midir find him find the prince in the glass i am searching on the wall was a large oval of glass it reflected the wizard in his dark robes the room where he worked his dark magicks and none of the three vampires who watched him smoke slithered over the glass swirled and clawed its way to the edges through the haze of it night began to bloom and in the night came the shadow of a boy on a pony oh there there he is crying out lilith gripped loras hand look how well he rides how straight in the saddle where is he where in this cursed land is the prince hes behind the hunting party lucian told her as he studied the vision in the glass and moving toward the battleground i know that land my lady hurry then hurry willful brat she muttered ill take your advice this time lora when hes back hell have a good hiding keep him in that glass midir can you send me to him the illusion of me you ask for many magicks at once majesty robes swirling he moved to his cauldron and letting his hands flow through the air over it brought up a pale green smoke ill need more blood he told her human i suppose his eyes glittered it would be best but i can make do with the blood of a lamb or young goat this is the prince she said coldly we dont make do lora have the one i was going to have brought in midir can have it i n the dark davey rode quickly he felt strong and fierce and fine he would show them show them all that he was the greatest warrior ever made the prince of blood he thought with a glinting smile hed make everyone call him that even his mother shed said he was small but he wasnt hed thought to trail behind the hunting party then move in among them and order them to let him take the lead none would dare question the prince of blood and he would have the first kill but something was pulling him away from them from the scent of his own kind something strong and tempting he didnt need to stay with a hunting party trail along after them like a baby they were all less than he was he wanted to follow the music that was humming in his blood and the smell of ancient death he rode slowly now and with excitement bubbling inside him there was something wonderful out in the dark something wonderful and his in the moonlight he saw the battlefield and the beauty of it made him shake as he did when his mother let him put himself into her and ride as if she were a pony while it burned through him he saw figures on the high ground two humans he thought and a dragon he would have them all slaughter them drain them and take their heads to drop at his mothers feet no one would ever call him small again chapter t here was a hard place in the middle of moiras chest like a fist poised to strike breathing around it was an effort but she stood as cian did at the edge of silence what do you feel she asked him pulled youre not to touch me pulled how chains on my feet around my throat pulled in opposite directions pain yes but its mixed with fascination and thirst i can smell the blood in the ground its thick and its rich i can hear your heartbeat taste your scent yet his eyes were cians eyes she thought they didnt burn red as they had the night hed come here with larkin theyll be stronger here than on other ground he looked at her then realizing he should have known she would understand that theyll be stronger here therell be more of them than there are of you driven by whats bred in this place by liliths power over them death wont mean to them what it does to you theyll come and theyll come without thought of their own survival you think well lose well die here every one of us truth he thought would shield her better than platitudes i think the chances of beating this diminish you may be right ill tell you what i know of this place what ive read and what i think is the truth of it she looked out again across the pitted land called ciunas long long ago before the worlds had separated and were one instead of many there were only gods and demons man had yet to come between to fight either to tempt either both were strong and fierce and greedy both wanted dominion but still the gods however cruel didnt hunt and kill their own kind didnt hunt and kill demons for sport or food so had the margin of good against evil there has to be a line even if its only that there was war eons of it all leading to this place this was their last battle the bloodiest the most vicious and most fruitless i think there was no victory only an ocean of blood that rose here formed this harsh valley and in time ebbed away so that blood soaked into the earth deep and deep why here why in geall i think when the gods made geall deemed it would live centuries in peace in prosperity this valley was the price the balance now payments due its always been coming to this cian now the gods charge the humans to fight the battle with this demon that began as human vampire against what is its source and its prey it balances here or it all falls but lilith doesnt understand what may happen if she wins this well burn out my kind he nodded having come to the same conclusion himself in chaos nothing thrives moira said nothing for a moment youre calmer now because youre thinking he let out a half laugh youre right still its the last place in this world or any id want to spread out for a picnic well have a moonlight one after samhain theres a place thats a favorite of mine and larkins its though hed told her not to touch him he gripped her wrist now ssh something saying nothing moira reached into the quiver on her back for an arrow i n the shadows davey grinned and drew his treasured sword now he would fight the way a prince was supposed to fight hed slice and thrust and bite and drink and drink and drink he leaned low over the saddle preparing to loose a war cry and lilith appeared before him davey you turn that pony around this minute and come home the fierceness on his face turned into a childish pout im hunting youll hunt when and where i tell you i dont have time for this nonsense this worry i have a war to wage now his face tightened into stubborn lines and his eyes gleamed against the dark im going to fight im going to kill the humans then you wont treat me like a baby i made you and i can unmake you youll do exactly what i what humans he gestured with his sword as she turned and she saw true fear bloomed in liliths belly uselessly she grabbed for the bridle but her hand passed through the ponys neck listen to me davey only one of them is human the male is cian hes very powerful very strong very old you have to run make this pony run as fast as it can youre not meant to be here were not meant to be here now im hungry his eyes were turning and his tongue flicked out over fang and lip i want to kill the old one i want to drink the female theyre mine theyre mine im the prince of blood davey no but with a violent kick of his heels he sent the pony racing forward it was all so quick moira thought flashing moments the silver snick of cians sword leaving its scabbard the shift of his body in front of hers like a shield the rider flew out of the dark and her arrow was notched and ready then she saw it was a child a little boy on a sturdy roan pony her heart stumbled her body jerked and her arrow went wide of the mark the child was screaming howling snarling a wolf cub on the hunt lilith flew behind the pony an emerald and gold shedemon streaking through the air hands curled into claws fangs gleaming moiras second arrow spiked through her heart and soared into the air shes not real cian shouted but he is take the dragon and go even as she reached for a third arrow cian shoved her aside leaping over the charging pony a little boy moira thought a little boy with eyes burning red and fangs spearing it waved a shortened sword as it dragged on the reins liliths screams were like lances of ice through moiras brain as the boy tumbled off the pony and fell hard on the rocky ground it bled moira saw where the rocks struck and scraped it cried as a boy would when he had a fall her breath caught in denial as cian advanced with the illusion of lilith clawing at him with intangible hands sick in heart and mind moira lowered her bow the second rider came out of the moonstruck dark like fury not a boy now but a man armed for battle his broadsword already cleaving the air cian pivoted and met the charge swords clashed and crashed the deadly music of them ringing over the valley cian leaped dismounting the rider with a vicious kick to the throat with no clear shot moira tossed down her bow and drew her sword before she could rush to fight with cian the boy gained his hands and knees he lifted his head stared at her with those gleaming eyes it growled dont moira backed up a step as davey crouched to spring i dont want to hurt you ill rip out your throat his lips peeled back as he circled her and drink and drink you should run i like it best when they try to run i wont run but you should davey run run now he whipped his head toward lilith and snarled like a rabid dog i want to play hideandseek tag youre it i wont play moira circled with him trying to work him back with thrusts of the sword hed lost his sword in the fall but moira told herself she would use hers if he sprang at her he wasnt unarmed no vampire ever was and those fangs glinted sharp and keen she spun kicking out aiming low to hit him in the belly and drive him back liliths form crouched over him hissing ill kill you for that ill peel the skin from your bones before i do lucius lucius hacked out at cian there was blood on them both blood in their eyes they leaped at each other meeting violently in midair run davey lucius shouted run davey hesitated and something came over his face moira thought for an instant she could see the child the demon had swallowed the fear the innocence the confusion he ran as a child runs limping on his scraped knees and gaining speed gaining that eerie grace as he rushed toward the slashing swords dropping her own sword moira grabbed up her bow a moment too late as davey leaped onto cians back struck with fang and fist if she shot now the arrow could go through the boy and into cian a fingersnap more flashes of time the boy tumbled through the air propelled by a savage blow he knuckled his hands over his burning eyes and cried for his mother again lilith called out lucius the prince help the prince his loyalty his years of service cost him as lucius turned his head a fraction toward lilith cian took it with one singing strike of his sword davey scrambled to his feet wild panic on his face now take him cian called out as davey began to run take the shot now those flashes of time slowed down wild screams wild weeping echoing through the dragging air the figure of a child running on bleeding tired legs lilith her face alive with fear and horror standing between the child and moira her arms spread in defense or plea moira looked into liliths eyes as her own blurred then with a tear in her heart she blinked them clear and sent the arrow flying the shriek was horribly human as the arrow passed through lilith that shriek went on and on and on as the arrow continued straight and true into the heart of what had once been a little boy whod played in the warm surf with his father then moira was standing alone with cian on the edge of a valley that hummed with the hunger for more blood cian bent picked up the swords we need to go now shell have already sent others she loved him moiras voice sounded strange and thin to her own ears she loved the child love isnt exclusive to humans we need to go her mind dull she tried to focus on cian youre hurt and i dont relish leaving any more blood here get mounted she nodded taking her own weapons before pulling herself onto the dragon shed killed him moira murmured as cian vaulted on behind her but she loved him she said nothing more as they flew away from the battlefield g lenna took over the moment they got back herding them both into the parlor for first aid im not hurt moira insisted but sat heavily i wasnt touched just sit glenna got to work on cians buttons off with your shirt handsome so i can see the damage some cuts a few punctures he bit back a wince as he shrugged out of the shirt he was good with a sword quick on his feet id say you were better and quicker blair handed him a cup of whiskey thats a nasty bite on the back of your shoulder pal what this guy fought like a girl it was the boy moira said before cian could answer she shook her head at the whiskey blair offered liliths boy the one she called davey he came at us riding a little pony waving a sword no bigger than a toy he wasnt a boy cian said flatly i know what he was moira simply closed her eyes a kiddie vamp did all this blair demanded no with some annoyance cian scowled at her what do you take me for the soldier trained and seasoned lilith must have sent after the whelp did this except for the shagging bite how do i treat it glenna asked him a vampire bite on a vampire like any other wound you can sure as hell hold the holy water itll heal quick enough like the others it was a foolish risk going out there hoyt said it was necessary cian shot back for me and our happy news is whatever holds that place doesnt stop me from dusting another vampire moira cian waited until she opened her eyes and met his it had to be done there might have been others coming behind the one she called lucius if id gone after the young one it would have taken time and left you alone he was no less your enemy because of his size i know what he was she said again he was what killed tynan what tried to kill larkin what would have killed us both tonight if it had gone another way still i saw his face under what it was i saw his face it was young and sweet i saw liliths face and it was the face of a mother terrified for her child i put the arrow into it as it ran away crying for its mother i know whatever comes now nothing i ever do will be worse than that and i know i can live with it she let out a shuddering breath i think ill be having that whiskey now after all ill take it up with me if you dont mind im tired cian waited until moira left the room lilith will try for her she may not be able to get physically into the house but in dreams or illusions hoyt rose ill see to it make certain the protection we have is strong enough she wont want me now larkin murmured or any of us he added with a quiet look for cian shell need to curl up with it for a while and she will live with it just as she said he sat now across from cian you said the one you fought was called lucius thats right thats the one i tangled with along with the boy in the caves id say youve just taken out one of liliths top men a kind of general this would be a very hard night for lilith thanks to you and moira shell come harder now because of it weve destroyed or damaged those closest to her and shell come at us like bloody vengeance let her come blair said s he would have come then and there so mad was her fury her rage her grief it took six guards and midirs magic to hold her down while lora dosed her with drugged blood ill kill you all every one of you for this take your hands off me before i cut them off and feed them to the wolves hold her lora ordered and forced more blood down liliths throat you cant go to their base tonight you cant go with the army and attack everything youve worked and planned for would be lost everything is lost she put an arrow in him she whipped her head flashed fangs and sank them into one of the restraining hands her own screams mixed with the howls of the wounded release her and ill take more than your hand lora warned theres nothing to be done for him my love my darling its a dream just a dream bloody tears ran down liliths face he cant be gone there now there signalling the others back lora gathered lilith into her arms leave us all of you get out she sat on the floor rocking lilith cooing to her while their tears mixed together he was my precious lilith wept i know i know and mine i want that pony found i want it slaughtered it will be there now he only wanted to play seeking comfort she nuzzled at loras shoulder in a few days i could have given him everything and now ill peel the skin from her bones pour her blood into a silver tub ill bathe in it lora i swear it well bathe together while we drink from that turncoat who took lucius lucius lucius tears ran faster he gave his eternity trying to save our davey well build a statue of him of both of them well grind the bones of humans and build it from their dust theyd be so pleased come with me now you need to rest i feel so weak so tired with loras help she gained her feet have whatever humans we have left in stock executed and drained no no tortured and drained slowly i want to hear their screams in my sleep m oira didnt dream she simply dropped into a void and floated there she had hoyt to thank for the hours of peace she thought as she began to wake hours of peace where she hadnt seen a childs face blurred together with that of a monster now there was work to be done the months of preparation had whittled down to days that could be counted in hours while the vampire queen mourned the queen of geall would do whatever needed to be done next she stirred sat up and saw cian sitting in the chair near the simmering fire its still shy of dawn he said you could use more sleep ive had enough how long have you watched over me i dont count the time shed slept like the dead he thought now he hadnt counted the time but he had counted her heartbeats your wounds healing youd have had fewer of them but i was weak i wont be again i told you to go didnt you trust me to deal with two of them especially when one was half my size less she leaned back clever of you to try to turn this into a matter of my trust in your fighting skills instead of my lack of spine if youd had less spine and more sense youd have gone when i told you to bollocks the time for running is well done and i would never have left you i love you i should have taken him with the sword quickly instead i wavered and tried to find a way to drive him off so i wouldnt be the one to end him that moment of weakness could have cost us both believe me when i tell you its burned out of me and the misplaced guilt that goes with it may take a bit longer but it wont get in the way we have only two days left two days she looked toward the window its quiet this time just before dawn is quiet she killed a young boy and came to love what shed made of it yes it doesnt make either of them less of a monster two days she said again almost in a whisper something inside her was already dying youll go when this is done if we win if we dont youll go back through the dance ill never see you again or touch you or wake to find youve watched over me in the dark ill go was all he said will you come hold me now before the sun comes he rose went to her sitting beside her he drew her against him so her head lay on his shoulder tell me you love me as ive loved nothing else he met her lips when she turned them to his touch me taste me she shifted so she lay over him trembling body seeking lips take from me what choice did he have she was surrounding him saturating his senses stoking his needs till they burned offering as much as demanding as she pressed his lips to her breast take more more and more her mouth was hot and desperate as she pulled away clothes her teeth nipping at his jaw in sharp quick bites while her breath shuddered she was alive now burning and alive with everything inside her rising aching how could she step back from this the love the heat the life if she was destined to die in battle then shed accept it but how could she live day after day night after night without her heart she straddled him taking him in hips whipping as she fought to feel more to take more to know more her eyes gleamed almost a madness and stayed locked on his then she leaned to him and her hair fell curtaining them both trapping him in its texture and fragrance love me i do his fingers dug into her hips as she drove him toward the jagged edge of peak touch me taste me take me on a cry she lowered her throat to his lips pressed that soft flesh with its pounding blood against him change me it was beyond him to stop the flood it gushed through him hot strong turbulent and through her he knew as her body bucked and quaked and shuddering she rubbed that throbbing pulse against his mouth make me what you are give me forever with you stop as his body shook he shoved her away with a force strong enough to nearly send her to the floor youd use what i am against me yes her chest burned with the tears that streamed through her voice anything anyone why should we find this only to lose it two days only two days left i want more theres no more to have there could be lilith loved what shed made i saw it you love me now and i love you we wouldnt stop with the change you know nothing of it i do she grabbed his hand as he rolled out of bed theres nothing i havent read how can we just turn away from each other and go on why should i choose death on the field rather than by your hand its not true death if you change me he pulled his hand free then seemed to sigh with a gentleness she couldnt see in his eyes he framed her face not for all the worlds if you loved me a poor female trick that phrase not worthy of you if i loved you less i might do exactly what you ask i have before he moved to the window dawn was upon them but there was no need to draw the drapes dawn had come with rain i cared for a woman once long ago and she loved me or loved what she believed i was i changed her because i wanted to keep her he turned back to where moira knelt on the bed silently weeping she was beautiful and amusing and bright wed make interesting companions i thought and we were for almost a decade until she ran afoul of a wellaimed torch it wouldnt be that way she was twice the killer i was she liked children best she was beautiful and amusing and bright and no less so for the change only once she was like me she put those qualities to use luring toddlers i could never you could he said flatly and most certainly would i wont turn the brightest light of my life into a monster no id never see you like me i dont see a monster when i look at you i would be again if i did this it wouldnt just be you who changed moira would you damn me all over again she pressed her hands to her eyes no no stay then she dropped her hands stay with me as we are or take me with you once geall is safe i can leave it in my uncles hands or and what live in the shadows with me i cant give you children i cant give you any kind of true life how will you feel in ten years in twenty when you age and i dont when you look in the mirror and see in your nature what youll never see in mine weve already stolen these weeks theyll have to be enough for you can they be for you theyre more than i ever had or thought to i cant be a man moira not even for you but i can feel hurt and youre hurting me now im sorry im sorry i feel as if everything in me is being squeezed my heart my lungs i had no right to ask you i know it i knew it even when i did knew it was selfish and wrong and weak she added when id sworn not to be weak again i know it cant be i know it cant what i dont know is if you can forgive me he came to her again sat beside her the woman i changed didnt know what i was until that moment if she had shed have run screaming you know what i am you asked because youre human if i dont need to ask you to forgive me for being what i am you dont need to ask me to forgive you for being what you are chapter f or most of the day moira worked with glenna forming forging and charming the fireballs every hour or so two or three people would come into the tower and haul away what was done to store them in their stockpile outside i never thought id say it moira began after the fourth straight hour but magic can be tedious hoyt would say what were doing here is nearly as much science as magic glenna swiped at her damp face with her arm and yes both can be boring as everliving hell still youre doing this with me cuts back on the time and increases the payload hoyts bound to be closeted with cian over maps and strategy all day which is probably just as tedious betcha more once again glenna walked the line of the hardened balls theyd made hands stretched out eyes focused as she chanted from where she stood at the worktable moira could see the constant use of power was taking its toll the shadows under glennas green eyes seemed to deepen every hour and each time the flush the miserable heat brought to her cheeks faded her skin looked more pale more drawn you should stop for a bit moira told her when glenna completed the line get some air have a bite i want to finish this batch but i will take a minute first it reeks of sulphur in here she walked to the window leaned out to draw in cool fresh air oh this is a sight moira come look dragons circling over tent city moira wandered over to watch dragons most of them mounted by riders training them to dive or turn on command they were quick studies she mused and made a bold bright show against a hazy sky youre wishing you could take a picture of it or sketch it at least ill spend the next ten years doing sketches and artwork of what ive seen these past months ill miss you so much when this is done and youre not here anymore understanding glenna draped an arm over moiras shoulders then pressed a kiss to her hair you know if theres a way to come we will well visit you we have the key we have the portal and if what weve done here doesnt earn the gods blessing nothing could i know as horrible as these past months have been in so many ways theyve given me so much you and hoyt and blair and cian moira kept her eyes on the dragons he wont come back to visit with or without the blessing of the gods i dont know he wont even if it were possible for him he wont come back to me little deaths moira thought every hour every day i knew it all along wanting it different doesnt change what is or cant be its one of the things morrigan was telling me about the time of knowing using my head and my heart together both my head and my heart know we cant be together if we tried it would tear at us until neither of us could survive it i tried to deny that disgracing myself hurting him how before moira could answer blair strode in whats up a little girl time whats the topic fashion food or men ohoh she added when they turned and she saw their faces must be men and me with no chocolate to pass around listen ill get out of your way i just wanted to let you know the last incoming troops have been sighted theyll be here within the hour thats good news no stay a moment would you moira asked you should know what i was about to confess both of you have put your heart and blood into all of this youve been the best friends to me ive ever had or will have youve got a serious voice on there moira what did you do decide to turn to the dark side and hang out with lilith its not so far from that i asked cian to change me blair nodded as she walked closer i dont see any bites on your neck why arent you angry or even surprised either one of you i think glenna said slowly i might have done the same in your place i know id have wanted to if we walk away from this blair and i walk away with our men you cant do you want us to judge you for trying to find some way to change that i dont know it might be easier if you did i used his feelings for me as weapons i asked all but begged him to make me like him when we were at our most intimate below the belt blair stated if i were going to do it thats the method id have picked he turned you down which tells me there cant be any doubt what you are to him back to me again id feel better knowing he was going to be just as miserable and alone as i was when he had to take a walk moira let out a surprised and muffled laugh you dont mean that i said it to lighten things up but down in the gut i dont know i might im sorry youre getting the shaft in this sincerely ah well maybe ill have a bit of luck and die in battle tomorrow night that way i wont be miserable and alone after all positive thinking thats the ticket in lieu of chocolate blair gave her a hug and met glennas eyes over moiras shoulder i t was important moira knew for the last of the troops to be welcomed by their queen and to show herself to as many as she could in the final hours before the last march she walked among the tents as twilight came as did the other members of the royal family she spoke to all she could she dressed as a warrior with her cloak pinned with a simple claddaugh brooch and the sword of geall at her side it was well after dark when she returned to the house and to what she knew would be the final strategy meeting with her circle they were already gathered around the long table with only larkin standing apart scowling down at the fire something new she thought with a little quiver in her belly something more she unpinned her cloak as she studied the faces of those shed come to know so well what plans are you making that has larkin so worried sit down glenna told her hoyt and i have something if it works she continued as moira walked to the table it would win this as moira listened the little quiver became a frozen knot so many risks she thought so many contingencies and so many ways to fail for cian most of all but when she looked into his eyes she understood hed already made his decision it lays most on you she said to him the timing if its off by a moment it lays on all of us we all knew what we were taking on when we started this no one of us should be risked more than the others larkin interrupted we may sacrifice one of us without need without do you think i bring this lightly hoyt spoke quietly i lost my brother once then found him again found more i think than either of us had before now doing this doing what i was charged to do i may lose him again im not getting a sense of confidence in my abilities there was a tankard on the table and cian lifted it to pour ale apparently surviving over nine hundred years isnt considered a strong point on my résumé id hire you blair said and held out her cup yeah its risky a lot of steps a lot of variables but if it works itd be one hell of a thing im figuring youll make it through she tapped her cup to cians so this has my vote im not a strategist moira began and my magic is limited you can do this she asked hoyt i believe it can be done he reached for glennas hand we got the idea actually from something you said back at castle geall glenna told her and were using gealls symbols all of them it would be strong magic and i think though it takes blood to bind it pure i believe separately we have more true power than midir hoyt scanned the faces around him together well crush him and the rest moira turned to cian if you stayed back a signal to you to all of us once all the steps have been taken liliths blood on the battleground is essential she has to be wounded at least by one of the six of us and liliths mine cian said flatly if i get through or dont shes mine for king for king moira thought and for himself as well once hed been innocent too once hed been a victim and his life taken from him shed shed his blood fed him hers now what theyd shared might be vital to the survival of mankind she rose carrying the weight of it and walked to larkin youve already decided she looked back at the four who sat at the table four of the six so it would be done as youve planned however larkin and i vote on this but its best if were together if the circle agrees with no breaks no doubts she took larkins hand now its best all right all right larkin nodded were together then if we could go over it oncemore moira came back to the table the details and the movements of it then well pass this on to the squadron leaders it would be like a brutal and bloody dance moira thought sword sacrifice and magic playing the tune and the blood of course there must always be blood the first preparations in the morning then shed risen to pour and pass short cups of whiskey for each then well each do our part and the gods willing well end this and end it fittingly i think with the symbols of geall well to us then and the hell with them when theyd drunk she walked over to the vielle would you play she asked cian there should be music well have music and send it out to the night i hope she hears it and trembles you dont play hoyt began i didnt speak cantonese once upon a time things change still cian felt a little odd sitting down with the vielle testing the strings for tune what is that thing blair wondered like a violin with gout well it would be a predecessor he began to play slowly feeling his way back from war to music the oddness faded away with the quiet haunting notes its lovely glenna said a little heartbreaking because she couldnt resist she went for paper and charcoal to sketch him as he played from outside pipes and harps began to play blending in with cians music each note moira thought like a tear youve a hand with that larkin told cian when the notes faded away and a heart for music thats the truth but would you be after playing something a bit livelier you know with a little jump to it larkin lifted his pipe and blew out quick cheerful notes so those echoes of melancholy were swept away in joy more music poured in from outside drums and fifes as cian matched melody and rhythm with a quick hoot of approval larkin stomped his feet his knees like loose hinges while moira clapped the time come on then tossing his pipe to blair larkin grabbed moiras hands lets show this lot how geallians dance laughing moira swung into step with him in what cian saw was cousin to an irish stepdance quick feet still shoulders all energy he bent over the vielle smiling a little at the persistence of the human heart as shadows and firelight played over his face we wont let them get the better of us hoyt yanked glenna to her feet i cant do that sure you can its in the blood the floorboards rang with booted feet and it flowed out into the night the dance the tune the laughter it was cian thought so human of them to take the joy to not only use it but to squeeze every drop of it there his brother the sorcerer who prized his dignity as much as his power whirling around with his sexy redheaded witch who giggled like a girl as she tried to do the steps the kickyourfaceandyourass demon hunter mixing a little twentyfirstcentury hiphop into the folk dance to make her shapeshifting cowboy grin and the queen of geall loyal devoted and carrying the weight of her world flushed and glowing with the simple pleasure of music they might die tomorrow every one but by the gods they danced tonight lilith for all her eons all her power and ambition would never understand them and the magic of them the light of them might just carry the day for the first time he believed whether he survived or not humankind would triumph it couldnt be snuffed out not even by itself though hed seen too often it try there were too many others like these five who would fight and sweat and bleed and dance he continued to play when hoyt paused long enough to drink some ale send it to her cian murmured look at my glenna dancing as if shed been born to it hoyt blinked frowned whats that you said cian glanced up no longer smiling though the music he played was as cheerful as a red balloon send lilith the music send it out just as moira said you can do that lets rub her fucking face in it then we will hoyt laid a hand on cians shoulder damn right we will power rippled warming cians shoulder as he played and played i n the dark lilith stood watching her troops fight yet another training battle as far as she could see and her eyes were keen vampires halfvampires human servants were spread in an army shed spent hundreds of years building tomorrow she thought they would swarm over the humans like a plague until the valley was a lake of blood and in it she would drown that whore who called herself queen for what had been done to davey when lora joined her they slid arms around each others waists the scouts are back lora told her we outnumber the enemy by three to one midir is on his way as you commanded its a good view from here davey would have enjoyed standing here seeing this by this time tomorrow or soon after hell be avenged oh yes but it wont end there she felt midir as he climbed to the rooftop where she and lora stood it begins soon she said without turning to him if you fail me ill slit your throat myself i will not fail tomorrow when it begins youll be in place i want you standing on the high ridge to the west where all can see majesty she turned now her eyes cold and blue did you think id let you stay here locked and closeted within this shield youll do and be where i say midir and youll stand on that ridge so our troops and theirs can see your power an incentive for them and for you she added make your magic strong or youll pay the price of it during the battle or after ive served you for centuries and still there is no trust no trust between us midir only ambition i prefer that you live of course she smiled now thinly i have uses for you even after my victory there are children inside castle geall protected i want them all of them when ive taken the night from among them ill choose the next prince the others will make a fine feast youll stand on the ridge she said as she turned back again and youll cast your dark shadow theres no cause for concern after all youve seen the outcome of this in your smoke and so youve told me countless times i would be more use to you here with my silence she snapped it out tossed up a hand whats that sound do you hear it it sounds like lora frowned out into the dark music their sorcerer sends it midir lifted face and hands into the air i feel him reaching out pale and petty power in the night make it stop i wont be mocked on the eve of this i wont have it music she spat it out human trash midir lowered his arms folded his hands i can do what you will my queen but they make a small and foolish attempt to anger you see your own troops training wielding weapons preparing for battle and what does your enemy do with these final hours he dismissed them with a flick of his fingers that sizzled out fire they play like careless children wasting the short time they have left before the slaughter on music and dance but if you will it wait she held up a hand again let them have their music let them dance their way to death go back to your cauldron and smoke and be prepared to take your place tomorrow and hold it or ill toast my victory with your blood as you wish majesty i wonder if he spoke the truth lora said when they were alone again of if he hesitated to strike his power against theirs it doesnt matter lilith couldnt let it matter not this close to the fulfillment of all she coveted when everything is as i want it when i crush these humans drink their children hell have outlived his uses certainement and his power could be turned against you once he has what he wants what do you propose to do about him im going to make a meal of him share only with you she continued to stand watching the training but the music the damned music soured her mood i t was late when cian lay beside moira in these last hours their circle was in three parts hed seen the fire flare and the candle flames flash and knew hoyt and glenna were wrapped in each other as hed been with moira as he imagined larkin was with blair it was always meant to be this way moira said quietly the six of us making the circle with each of us forming a stronger link with another to gather together to learn of and from one another to know love and this house is bright with love tonight its another kind of magic and as powerful as any other we have that whatever comes she lifted her head to look down at him what i asked you to do was a betrayal theres no need for that no i want to tell you what i know as much as i know anything it was a betrayal of you of myself of the others and all weve done you were stronger and now so am i i love you with everything i am thats a gift for both of us nothing can take it or change it she lifted the locket he wore it held more than a lock of her hair she thought it held her love dont leave this behind when you go i want to know you have it always it goes where i go my word on that i love you with everything i am and all i cant be she laid the locket back over his heart then a hand over the stillness tears filled her but she fought to hold them no regrets none for either of us love me again she murmured love me again one last time before dawn it was tender and slow a savoring of every touch every taste long soft kisses were a kind of drug against any pain silky caresses a balm over wounds that must be endured she told herself her heart beat hard and strong enough for both of them now this last time her eyes stayed open and on his drinking in his face so that at the peak of pleasure she saw him slide away with her tell me again she murmured once more i love you eternally then they lay together in the quiet all the words had been said in the last hour before dawn they rose the six to prepare for the final march to battle they went on horse on dragon on foot in wagons and carts above clouds shifted over the sky but didnt block out the sun it beamed through them in shimmering fingers and sudden flashes to light the way to silence the first arrived to lay traps in the shadows and in the caves while guards flew or rode over and around the valley with their eyes trained for any attack and there found traps laid for them under a mans feet a pool of blood would spread sucking him down ooze black as pitch bubbled up to burn through boots and into flesh midirs work hoyt spat as others ran to save who they could block it cian ordered well have a panic on our hands before we start halfvamps blair shouted the warning from dragonback about fifty first line lets go she dived down to lead the charge arrows flew and swords slashed in the first hour the geallian forces were down fifteen men but they held ground they just wanted us to have a taste of it with her face splattered with blood blair dismounted we gave them a bigger one the dead and wounded have to be tended to steeling herself moira looked at the fallen then away hoyts pushing back midirs spell how much is it costing him hell have whatever he needs to have im going up again do a couple of circles see if shes got any more surprises for us blair vaulted back on her dragon hold the line we werent as prepared as we might have been for the traps for a daylight attack sheathing his stained sword larkin stepped to moira but we did well well do better yet he laid a hand on her arm drawing her away so only she would hear glenna says some are already here under the ground hoyt cant work with her now but she thinks between herself and cian they can find at least some and deal with it good even a handful will be a victory i need to steady the archers the sun moved to midday then beyond it twice she saw the ground open up where glenna held a willow rod then the flash of fire as the thing burrowed in the earth caught the sun and flamed in it how many more she wondered a hundred five hundred hes broken off hoyt swiped a hand over his sweaty face when he joined her midirs traps are closed you beat him back i cant say he may have gone to other work but for now hes blocked this ground it shakes the soul of a man it pours up this evil it holds all but chokes the breath ill help cian and glenna no you need to rest a few moments save your energies ill help them knowing he needed to gather himself hoyt nodded but his eyes were grim as he scanned the valley passed over where glenna and cian worked they wont be able to find them all not in this ground no but every one is one less still when she reached glenna moira could see the work was taking its toll glenna was pale her skin clammy as hoyts had been its time to rest moira told her restore yourself ill work it awhile its beyond your power its on the edge of mine grateful glenna took the water bag moira offered weve only unearthed a dozen a couple more hours she needs to stop you need to stop cian took glennas arm youre nearly tapped out you know it if you dont have anything left come sundown what good will you be i know there are more a lot more then well be ready when this ground spits them out go hoyt needs you hes worn himself thin good strategy cian told moira when glenna walked away using hoyt it is but its also true enough were draining them both and you she added i can hear in your voice how tired you are so ill say what you said to her what good are you if youre worn out by sundown the bloody cloak smothers me then again the alternatives not pleasant i need to feed he admitted then go up to the high ground and see to it weve done nearly all we can all we set out to do by this time she saw blair and larkin with hoyt and glenna now the six of them together as the sun sank lower might push their strengths up again they went across the broken ground climbed over an island of pocked rock and began up the hard slope everything in her wanted to shudder when they reached the ridge even without midirs spell the ground seemed to pull at her feet cian took out a water bag she knew held blood waiting on you blair began a lot of your troops have the jitters if youre meaning they wont stand and fight dont get all geallian pride on me blair held up a hand for peace what they need is to hear from you to get revved they need their st crispins day speech whats this blair arched her brows at cian guess you missed henry v when you mowed through cians library there were a lot of books after all its about stirring them up glenna explained about getting them ready to fight even die reminding them why theyre here inspiring them im to do all of that no one else would have the same impact cian closed the water bag youre the queen and while the rest of us might be generals in a manner of speaking youre the one they look to i wouldnt know what to say youll think of something while you are larkin and i will get your troops together add a little braveheart to henry he said to blair get her on horseback excellent blair headed off to get cians horse what did this henry say moira wondered what they needed to hear glenna gave moiras hand a squeeze so will you chapter i dont have a thing in my head its not going to come from there or not only from there glenna handed moira her circlet head and heart remember listen to both and whatever you say itll be the right thing then i wish youd say it instead foolish to be afraid of speaking to them moira said with a weak smile and not as afraid to die with them put this on blair held out moiras cloak good visual the cloak billowing in the wind and speak up kiddo you have to project to the ones in the peanut gallery ill ask you what that means later moira took one huffing breath then mounted the stallion here we go then she walked the horse forward then her heart gave a hard thud there were her people more than a thousand strong standing with the valley at their backs even as the sun dipped lower in the sky it glinted off sword and shield and lance it washed over their faces those who had come here ready to give their lives and her head understood the words in her heart people of geall they cheered as she trotted her horse in front of their lines even those already wounded called out her name people of geall i am moira warrior queen i am your sister i am your servant we have come to this time and this place by order of the gods and so to serve the gods i know not all of your faces all of your names but you are mine every man and woman here the wind caught at her cloak as she looked into those faces tonight when the sun sets i ask you to fight to stand this bitter ground that has already tasted our blood this day i ask this of you but you dont fight for me you dont fight for the queen of geall we fight for moira the queen someone shouted and again her name rose up above the wind in cheers and chants no you dont fight for me you dont fight for the gods you dont fight for geall not this night you dont fight for yourselves or even your children not for your husbands your wives your mothers and fathers they quieted as she continued to ride the lines looking into those faces meeting those eyes its not for them you come here to this bitter valley knowing your blood may spill on its ground its for all humankind you come here for all humankind you stand here you are the chosen you are the blessed all the worlds and every heart that beats in them is your heart now your world now we the chosen are one world one heart one purpose her cloak snapped in the wind as the stallion pranced and the dying sun glinted on the gold of her crown the steel of her sword we will not fail this night we cannot fail this night for when one of us falls there will be another to lift the sword the lance to fight with stake and fist the pestilence that threatens humanity and all it is and if that next of us should fall there will come another and another and still more for we are the world here and the enemy has never known the like of us her eyes were like hellsmoke in a face illuminated with passion her voice soared over the air so the words rang out strong and clear here on this ground we will drive them down even past hell she continued to shout over the cheers that rippled and rose from the men and women like a wave we will not yield this night we will not fail this night but will stand and triumph this night you are the heart they can never have you are the breath and the light they will never know again this night they will sing of this samhain sing of the battle of silence in every generation that comes after they will sit by their fires and speak of the glory of what we do here this night the sun sets she drew her sword pointed west where the sun had begun to bleed red come the dark well raise sword and heart and mind against them and as the gods witness this i swear it we will raise the sun she sent fire rippling down the blade of her sword and shooting into the sky not too shabby blair managed as the troops erupted with shouts and cheers your girls got a way with words shes brilliant cian kept his eyes on her how can they stand against that much light she spoke the truth hoyt stated theyve never seen the likes of us the squadron leaders split the troops so they began to move into position moira rode back dismounted its time she said and held out her hands the six formed a circle to forge that final bond then released each other see you on the flip side blair flashed a gleaming smile go get em cowboy she leaped on her dragon then shot skyward larkin swung onto his own last one to the pub when this is done buys the round he flew up and away from blair blessed be and lets kick ass with hoyt glenna started toward their posts but shed seen the look that had passed between the brothers whats going on with cian dont lie this close to what might be bloody death he asked for my word if were able to bring the spell into play he asked for my word we not wait for him but we cant it was the last he asked of me pray we wont have to make the choice behind them moira stood with cian fight well she said to him and live another thousand years my fondest hope he covered the lie by taking her hands a last time pressing them to his lips fight well mo croi and live before she could speak again hed leaped onto his horse and galloped away from the air blair called out commands directing her mount with her legs and scanning the ground for what would come with the dark the sun fell plunging the valley into night and in that night the ground erupted they poured out of the ground from earth from rock from crevice in numbers too great to count show time she whispered to herself swinging south as arrows from moira and her archers rained down hold them hold them a quick glance to where nialls foot soldiers voices rose like chants told her niall was waiting for the signal a little longer a little more she thought as vampires swarmed up the valley as arrows pierced some missed others she flashed the firesword and dove as men charged she yanked the rope on her harness dropping the first bomb fire and flaming shrapnel flew and there were screams as vampires were engulfed and still they spewed from the ground pushing their lines toward the geallians freed of his cloak cian sat his horse his sword raised to hold the men at his back bombs exploded fire scorching the enemy and the ground but they came slinking and slithering clawing and leaping on a cry of battle cian slashed his sword and led his troops into the firestorm with flashing hooves and hacking steel he cleaved a hole in the advancing armys line it closed again surrounding him and his forces screams came in a torrent on her sloping plateau moira gripped her battleax her heart knocked in her throat as she saw the vampires break through the line to the east she led the charge even as hoyt led his so that they took their warriors in a stream of steel and stake to flank the enemys lines over the screams the crashes the fire came the trumpeting call of dragons the next wave of liliths army was advancing arrows moira shouted as her quiver emptied and another filled was tossed at her feet she notched and loosed notched and loosed until the air was so full of smoke the bow was useless she raised the fiery sword and rushed with her line into the thick of it of all shed feared all shed known all shed seen in the visions the gods had given her what came through the smoke and stink was worse men and women already slaughtered ash of vanquished enemy coating the bitter ground like fetid snow blood spurted like a fall of water painting the yellowed grass red shrieks human and vampire echoed in the dark under the pale threequarter moon she blocked a sword strike and her body moved with the instinct of hard training to spin to pivot to block the next when she leaped over a low slash she felt the wind of the sword under her boots and with a scream of her own slashed for the throat through the haze she saw the dragon that held blair spiraling to the ground with its side pierced with arrows the ground was littered with stakes grabbing one in her free hand she rushed forward then flung it through the back and into the heart of one who charged at blair thanks duck blair shoved moira aside and severed the sword arm of another larkin i dont know they keep coming remember your own hype blair leaped up striking with her feet then rammed a stake through the one shed kicked then she was lost in the waves of smoke and moira was once again battling for her life as blair hacked through the line they closed in around her she struck sword stake fought to gain ground and was suddenly soaked as her attackers screamed from the flood of blessed water that rained down from above larkin flew out of the smoke grabbing her lifted arm to haul her up behind him nice job she told him drop me off there big flat rock you drop me its my time to have a go down here youre out of water but there are two fireballs shes pushing in hard from the south now ill give her some heat he leaped off and she soared through the melee hoyt searched with his eyes with his power he felt the brush of midirs dark but there was so much black so much cold he wasnt sure of its direction then he saw glenna fighting her way back up a ridge and standing on it like a black crow was midir in horror he watched a hand snake out of a fold of earth and rock and grab glennas leg in his mind he heard her scream as she kicked as she clawed to keep from being dragged into the crevice even knowing he was too far away he rushed through swords continued to run even when the fire she shot from fingertips coated what dragged at her sensing power midir hurled lightning black as pitch and had her flying back mad with fear hoyt fought like a wild man ignoring blows and gashes as he worked his way toward her he could see the blood on her face as she answered midirs lightning with white fire t he stake missed cians heart by a hairsbreadth and the pain buckled his knees as he went down he thrust his sword up all but cleaving his attacker in two before he managed to roll a lance dug into the stony ground beside him he gripped it heaved it up to strike at another heart then planting it he vaulted up kicking out to send another flying to the wooden stakes the geallians had hammered into the ground he saw blair through the smoke that billowed from the fireballs and flaming arrows with a pump of his legs he leaped up grabbing her dragons harness to swing behind her an instant before she released another bomb didnt see you she called out got that moira dont know take over here im going down she jumped down to the table of a rock cian saw her flip off shooting stakes from both hands before the haze buried her he swung his mount aiming his sword sending out fire the ground continued to pull at him its intoxicating scents of blood and fear driving hunger into him as keenly as a sharpened stake then he saw glenna struggling her way up a sheer slope and outnumbered threetoone her battleax flamed and each time she took an enemy more crawled their way up toward her and when he saw the black figure on the high ridge he understood why so many would go against a single woman the power of the circle battled back the hunger as he swept through the air toward his brothers wife he sent three tumbling down against rock into traps of stakes and pools of holy water with a wild strike from the dragons tale his sword took two more even as glennas fiery ax turned enemies into flaming dust give you a lift he swooped down circled her waist with his arm and hauled her up midir the bastard understanding cian soared up again but when he struck out with the dragons tail it bounced off as if it hit rock hes shielded the coward breath short and choppy glenna searched the ground for hoyt and felt the lock on her lungs release when she saw him fighting his way up the slope set me down on the ridge and go the hell i will this is whats needed cian its magic against magic for this this is why im here find the others get ready because by all the gods and goddesses were going to do this okay red my moneys on you he flew over the ridge pausing while she slid down and left her to face the black sorcerer so the red witch has come here to die i didnt come for the ambiance she raised a hand and charged with a swing of her ax the widening of his eyes told her the move had surprised him the flaming edge of the ax cut through the shield but the blade missed its mark she was propelled back lifted into the air slammed hard into the ground though she threw out her own power the scorching heat of his black lightning seared the palms of her hands she held them out held her power in them as she pushed painfully to her feet you cant win this he told her as dark shimmered around him ive seen the end and your death youve seen what whatever devil you sold yourself to wants you to see she hurled fire and though he deflected it with a snap of his wrist she knew he felt her burn even as shed felt his the ends what we make it with icy fury on his face he brought a cutting wind that slashed at her skin like knives t hey were holding blair thought she believed they were holding but for every foot of ground the geallians held more vampires swarmed through the night and over it shed lost track of her kills a dozen at least with sword and stake at least that many with air attacks and still it wasnt enough bodies littered the ugly ground and even her strength was pushed to its limit they needed to pull the rabbit out of the hat she thought and screamed in vengeance as she slayed a vampire whod stopped to feed on one of the fallen whirling slashing at others she saw glenna and midir on the high ridge and the firestorm of black against white as they battled she grabbed a lance from a dead hand shot it out like a javelin the spear tip went through two vampires fighting back to back and the wood pole pierced hearts something leaped down from above her senses caught just the edge of it and her instincts had her pumping up into a high wide flip she slashed her sword as she touched ground and clashed it against loras there you are lora slid her blade down until it met blairs to form a v ive been looking for you been around you got something on your face there oh gee is that a scar did i do that my bad ill be eating your face shortly you know thats wishful thinking right in addition to being disgusting enough small talk for you more than the swords sang as they slid apart then the music crescendoed as blade struck blade in moments blair understood she was facing the most formidable enemy of her career lora might look like a b movie dominatrix wrapped in snug black leather but the french bitch could fight and take a punch she thought when she finally got past loras guard long enough to slam a fist in the vampires face blair felt the burn shoot a line across her knuckles as fangs sliced her flesh blair flipped up to the jagged teeth of a rock hacked down and met air as lora rose off the ground as if she had wings loras sword whistled past blairs face and the tip of it sliced her cheek oh will that leave a scar lora landed on the rock with her my bad itll heal nothing about you is going to last much longer she answered first blood with a lightning parry of her own gashing loras arm then followed it through with a ripple of fire but loras sword struck the blade aside going black against the red flame the fire spurted and died you think we werent ready for that lora bared her teeth as they hacked and thrust and swung midirs magic is more than your magicians can ever hope for then why dont all of your troops have swords like yours he couldnt pull it off blair flew up again flipping over and striking lora with her feet the vampire used the momentum to soar up driving down with the sword on her descent raising hers to block blair didnt see the dagger that flew out of loras other hand she stumbled from the shock the pain when it pierced her side look at all that blood its just pouring out of you yum lora laughed a tinkling sound of delight when blair fell to her knees and her eyes gleamed red as she raised the sword high for the killing blow with a mad undulating howl the gold wolf pounced from above claws and fangs raked as he leaped over the swinging sword as he lunged and snapped when he bunched to spring for the throat blair cursed no shes mine you gave your word her breath whistled as she stayed on her knees the dagger still lodged in her side back off wolfboy back the hell off the wolf shimmered into a man as larkin stepped back get it done then he snapped his eyes grim and stop messing about pussywhipped is he lora circled so that she could keep them both in her line of sight the bleeding woman the unarmed man but hes right we really should stop messing about ive a busy schedule she swung the sword down and blair thrust hers up to meet it to block it to hold it the muscles in her arms screamed with the strain and her side wept blood and agony im no pussy she panted hes not whipped and youre done she yanked the dagger from her side stabbed it to its bloodied hilt into loras belly that hurts but its steel sos this with all her remaining strength blair shoved loras sword aside and plunged her own into the vampires chest now youre just annoying me lora hefted her sword point down now whos done you blair replied as the blade still in loras chest erupted with flame burning screaming lora started to tumble from the rock blair yanked the sword free swung it hard and true and cut off the flaming head fucking well done blair stumbled swayed would have fallen if larkin hadnt sprung forward to catch her how bad how bad he pressed his hand to her bleeding side through and through i think no organs hit quick patch to stop the bleeding and im back in the game well see about that get on when he shimmered into a dragon blair crawled onto his back as they soared she saw glenna on the ridge clashing with midir and she saw her friend fall oh god shes hit shes done how fast can you get there inside the dragon larkin thought not fast enough g lenna tasted blood in her mouth there was more seeping out of a dozen shallow slices in her skin she knew shed hurt him knew shed chipped at his shield his body even his power but she could feel her own power ebbing out of her along with her blood shed done all she could and it hadnt been enough your fires cooling barely an ember left to glow midir stepped closer now to where she lay on the scorched and bloody ground still it might be enough to trouble myself to take along with whats left of your life itll choke you she gasped out the words hed bled she thought shed made him bleed onto the ground i swear it will ill swallow it whole its so small after all can you see below can you where what i helped wrought runs over you like locusts its as i foretold and as you fall one by one my power grows nothing will hold it now nothing will stop it i will hoyt swung bloody and battered over the lip of the ridge theres my guy glenna managed gritting her teeth against the pain i softened him up for you now here is something more to chew on whirling midir shot black lighting it crashed sizzled spewed bloody flames when it struck against hoyts blinding white the force blew them both back searing the air between them on the ground glenna rolled away from a streaking line of flame then clawed to her hands and knees whatever she had left she gathered to send to hoyt closing a trembling hand around the cross at her neck she focused her power into it and to its twin hoyt wore while she chanted the sorcerers black and white battled on the smokehazed ridge and in the filthy air above it the fire that sliced at hoyt carried the burn of ice it sought his blood what was shed what it aimed to shed to draw away his power it clawed and slashed at him while the air flashed and boomed with magicks sending smoke billowing high to drown the swimming moon the ground beneath his feet cracked splitting fissures under the enormity of pressure while his lungs labored and his heart pounded he ignored those earthy demands on his body ignored the pains from his wounds and the sweat that ran salt into them he was power now beyond that moment at the beginning of this journey when hed wavered for an instant over the black now on this ridge over blood and death over the courage of man the sacrifice and the fury he was the whitehot flame of power the cross he wore flashed silver and brilliant as glenna joined her magic to his with one hand he reached for hers gripping it firmly when she linked fingers with him and pulled herself to her feet with the other he raised a sword and the fire on it went pure white it is we who take you hoyt began and slashed away a thunderbolt with his sword we who stand for the purity of magic for the heart of mankind it is we who defeat you who destroy you who send you forever into the flames be damned to you midir shouted and lifting both arms hurled twin thunderbolts fear rushed over his face when glenna waved a hand over the air and turned them to ash no be damned to you hoyt swung down the sword the white fire leaped from the blade to strike midirs heart like steel where he dropped and died the ground turned black h igh ground moira thought she had to get back to higher ground regroup the archers shed heard the shouts warning that their line had broken again to the north flaming arrows would drive that invading force back give the troops in its path time to forge their lines again she searched through the melee for a horse or dragon that would take her where she knew she was most needed and looking up saw hoyt and glenna bathed in brilliant white facing midir a spurt of fresh hope had her racing forward even as the ground seemed to catch at her feet she swung her sword at an advancing enemy the gash she served it slowed it down and as she poised to strike again riddock took it from behind with a fierce grin he charged with a handful of men toward the broken line he lived she thought her uncle lived as she raced to join him the ground bucked under her feet sent her sprawling as she pushed up she looked down into isleens dead and staring eyes no no no isleens throat was torn open the leather strap where moira knew shed worn a wooden cross was snapped and soaked with blood grief struck so strong so deep she gathered the body up against her still warm she thought as she rocked still warm if shed been faster she might have saved isleen isleen isleen isleen isleen the words were a mocking mimic as lilith flowed out of the smoke shed dressed for battle in red and silver a mitre like moiras banding her head her sword was bloody to its jeweled hilt seeing her crashed waves of fear and fury through moira that had her surging to her feet look at you the grace and deftness with which lilith spun the sword as she circled warned moira this vampire queen knew the art of the blade small and insignificant covered with mud and tears im amazed i wasted so much time planning your death when its all so simple you wont win here queen to queen moira thought and blocked liliths first testing thrust life against death were beating you back well never stop oh please lilith waved the words away your lines are crumbling like clay and ive two hundred yet in reserve but thats neither here nor there this is you and me with barely a blink lilith shot out a hand grabbing the soldier who charged her by the throat and snapping his neck she tossed him carelessly to the ground while slicing down at moiras swinging fire sword midir has his uses lilith said when the fire died i want to take my time with you you human bitch you killed my davey no you did and with what you made of him destroyed i hope what he was the innocent he was is cursing you liliths hand streaked out flashing like the fangs of a snake she raked her nails down moiras cheek a thousand cuts she licked the blood from her fingers thats what ill give you a thousand cuts while my army feeds its belly full on yours you wont touch her again on his stallions back cian rode slowly forward as if time had stopped youll never touch her again come to save your whore from her belt lilith drew a gold stake gilded oak i had this made for you for when i end you as i made you tell me doesnt all this blood stir you warm pools of it bodies not yet cooled waiting to be drained i know whats in you wants that taste i put it in you and i know it as i know myself you never knew me go he said to moira yes run along ill find you later she flew at cian then sprang up a swords length away to spin over his head as she sliced down her sword met air while he threw his body up and back with the heels of his boots barely missing her face they moved so fast that eerie speed that moira saw little more than a blur heard the clash of swords like silver thunder this would be his battle she knew the one only he could fight but she wouldnt leave him leaping onto the horse she drove vlad up bloodslicked rock until she was positioned over their heads there she shot fire from her sword to hold off liliths men who tried to reach their queen she vowed that she and the sword of geall would stand for her lover to the last lilith was skilled cian knew after all she had centuries to learn the arts of war just as he had her strength and speed were as great as his perhaps greater she blocked him drove him back slithered away from the force of his attack this ground was still hers he knew this pocket of black she fed off it as he didnt dare she fed off the screams that echoed through the air and the blood that seemed to spew through it like rain he fought her and the war inside him the thing that struggled to claw free and revel in what it was what shed made him taking her advantage she beat his sword aside and in that flash of an instant he was open plunged the stake at his heart it struck with a force that sent him staggering back but as her cry of triumph echoed away he continued to stand whole and unharmed how was all she said as she stared at him he felt the imprint of moiras locket against his heart and the pain was sweet a magic youll never know he sliced out scoring across the scar of the pentagram the blood that welled from the wound was black and thick as tar pain and fury brought the demon to her eyes the killing red now her screams rang as she came at him with a new and wild strength he slashed back spilled more blood drove as he was driven as the locket seemed to pulse like a heart on his chest her sword ripped down his arm sending his clattering against the rocks now you then your whore when she charged he gripped the wrist of her sword arm in his bloody hand she smiled at him this way then its more poetic she bared her fangs to strike at his throat and he plunged the stake she had made for him into her heart id say go to hell but even hell wont have you her eyes went wide faded to blue he felt the wrist he held dissolve in his hand and still those eyes stared into his another moment then there was nothing but the ash at his feet ive ended you he declared as you ended me so long ago thats poetic the ground under his feet began to quake so he thought it comes the black stallion leaped from the rocks scattering ash youve done it moira vaulted from the saddle into his arms youve beaten her youve won this saved me he dragged her locket out showed her the deep dent in the silver from the force of the stake you saved me cian as the rock behind her split like an egg she jumped down and her face went pale again hurry go hurry its begun her blood her end was the last of it theyve started the spell its you who beat her you who won remember that he pulled her into his arms crushed his mouth to hers then he was flying onto the horse and was gone everything around her was chaos screams and shouts through the haze the moans of wounded the rush of the enemy in mad retreat a gold dragon speared through it blair on its back with the ground rippling in waves under her moira lifted her arms so larkin could cradle her in his claws she flew over the quivering land toward the high ridge on it hoyt gripped moiras hand it must be now cian we cant be sure i gave my word to him it must be now he raised their joined hands and together they lifted their faces their voices to the black sky in this place once damned we hold the power and we wield it in this final hour on this ground blood was shed in blackest night theirs for dark and ours for light black magic and demon here are felled by our hand and now we claim this bloody land now call forth all we have done now through dark we raise the sun its light will strike our enemy as we will so mote it be the ground trembled and the wind blew like a fury we call the sun hoyt shouted we call the light we call the dawn glennas voice rose with his and the power grew as moira clasped her free hand burn off the night rise in the east moira chanted staring through the smoke that swirled up around them while larkin and blair completed the circle spread to the west its coming blair cried look look east over the shadow of mountains the sky lightened and the light spread and speared and grew until it was bright as noon below fleeing vampires burned to nothing on the rocky broken ground flowers began to bloom do you see that larkins hand tightened on moiras and his voice was thick reverent the grass its greening she saw it and the sweet charm of the white and yellow flowers that spread over its carpet she saw the bodies of the fallen on the meadow of a lush and sunlit valley but nowhere did she see cian chapter t hough the battle was won there was still work moira labored with glenna in what glenna called triage for the wounded blair and larkin had taken a party out to hunt down any vampires that might have found shelter from the sun while hoyt helped transport those whose wounds were less severe back to one of the bases after rinsing blood from her hands again moira stretched her back and spotting ceara wandering as if in a daze rushed to her here here youre hurt moira pressed a hand to the wound on cearas shoulder come let me dress this my husband her gaze roamed from pallet to pallet even as she leaned heavily against moira eogan i cant find my husband hes here hes here ill take you hes been asking for you wounded ceara swayed hes not mortally i promise you and seeing you hell heal all the quicker there over there you see hes moira got no further as ceara cried out and in a stumbling run rushed to fall to her knees beside where her husband lay its good to see good for the heart to see she turned smiled at her uncle riddock his arm and leg bandaged sat on a supply crate i wish all lovers would be reunited as they are but we lost so many more than three hundred dead and the count still coming and how many live moira he could see the wounds she bore on her body and in her eyes the wounds she bore on her heart honor the dead but rejoice in the living i will i will still she scanned the wounded those who tended them and feared for only one are you strong enough to travel home ill go with the last ill bring our dead home moira leave that for me she nodded and after embracing him went back to her duties she was helping a soldier sip water when ceara found her again his leg eogans leg glenna said he wont lose it but then he wont she wouldnt lie to you or to him on a steadying breath ceara nodded i can help i want to help ceara touched her bandaged shoulder glenna looked after me and said im well enough ive seen dervil she came through very well cuts and bruises for the most of it i know i saw your cousin oran and he said sinanns phelans already on his way back to castle geall but i havent found isleen as yet have you seen her moira lowered the soldiers head then rose she did not come through no my lady she must have you just havent seen her again ceara searched the pallets that stretched over the wide field there are so many i did see her she fell in the battle no oh no ceara covered her face with her hands ill tell dervil tears flowed down her cheeks when she lowered her hands shes trying to find isleen now ill tell her and well i cant fathom it my lady i cant fathom it moira glenna called from across the field i need you here ill tell dervil ceara repeated and hurried away moira worked until the sun began to dim again then exhausted and sick with worry flew on larkin to the farm where she would spend one last night he would be here she told herself here is where he would be safe out of the sunlight and helping organize the supplies the wounded the transportation of course he would be here near dark larkin said when he stood beside her and therell be nothing in geall that will hunt in it tonight but that which nature has made you found none at all no enemy survivors ash only ash even in caves and deep shade there was ash as if the sun we brought burned through it all and there was none of them could survive it no matter where they hid her already pale face went gray and he gripped her arm its different for him you know it hed have had the cloak hed have gotten it in time you cant believe any magic wed bring would harm one of our own no of course of course youre right im just tired thats all youll put something in your belly then lay your head down he led her into the house hoyt stood with blair and glenna something on their faces turned moiras knees to water hes dead no hoyt hurried forward to take her hands no he survived it tears shed held for hours spilled out of her eyes and flooded her cheeks you swear it hes not dead youve seen him spoken to him i swear it sit moira youre exhausted but she shook her head at glennas words and kept her eyes on hoyts face upstairs is he upstairs a shudder passed through her as she understood what she read in hoyts eyes no she said slowly hes not upstairs or in the house or in geall at all hes gone hes gone back he felt damnation im sorry for this moira he was determined to go straight away i gave him my key and he was going by dragonback to the dance he said hoyt took a sealed paper from a table he asked if id give you this she stared at it and finally nodded thank you they said nothing as she took the paper and went upstairs alone she closed herself in the room shed shared with him lit the candles then sitting simply held the letter to her heart until she had the strength to break the seal and read moira this is best the sensible part of you understands that staying longer would only prolong pain and theres been enough of it for a dozen lifetimes leaving you is an act of love i hope you understand that too i have so many pictures of you in my head of you sitting on the floor in my library surrounded by books poring through them of you laughing with king or larkin as you so rarely laughed with me in those first weeks courageous in battle or lost in thought you never knew how often i watched you and wanted you ill see you in the morning mists drawing a shining sword from a stone and flying a dragon with arrows singing from your bow ill see you in candlelight holding out your arms to me taking me into a light ive never known before or will know again youve saved your world and mine and however many others there might be i think you were right that we were meant to find each other to be together to forge the strength the power needed to save those worlds now its time to step away im asking you to be happy to rebuild your world your life and to embrace both to do less would be a dishonor to what we had to what you gave me with you somehow with you i was a man again that man loved you beyond measure what i am that is not a man loved you despite everything in all the centuries ive loved you if you loved me youll do what i ask live for me moira even a world apart ill know that you do and be content cian she would weep a human heart needed to shed such a deep well of tears lying on the bed where theyd loved each other for the last time she pressed the letter to her heart and let it empty new york city eight weeks later h e spent a great deal of time in the dark and a great deal of time with whiskey when a man had eternity cian figured he could take a decade or two to brood maybe a century since hed given up the love of his endless bloody life hed come around of course of course he would hed get back to business travel for a while drink a bit longer first a year or two of a sodding drunk never hurt the undead he knew she was well helping her people recover planning the monument she would build in the valley come the next spring theyd buried their dead and she herself had read every name nearly five hundred of them at the memorial he knew because the others were back now as well and had insisted on giving him details he hadnt asked for at least blair and larkin were in chicago now and wouldnt be hammering at him to talk or get together with them youd think humans after spending such an intense amount of time with him would know he wasnt feeling sociable he was going to wallow goddamn it the lot of them would be long dead by his estimation before he was finished wallowing he poured more whiskey he told himself at least he had enough standards left not to drink it straight from the bottle and here were hoyt and glenna nagging at him to spend christmas with them christmas for bleeding judass sake what did he care for christmas he wished they would go the hell back to ireland and the house hed given them and leave him be did they have christmas in geall he wondered running his fingers over the dented silver locket he wore night and day hed never asked about that particular custom but why should he have it would likely be yule there with burning logs and music whatever it was nothing to him now but she should celebrate moira should light a thousand candles and set castle geall glowing hang the holly bushes and strike up the bloody band when the hell was this pain going to ebb how many oceans of whiskey would it take to dull it he heard the hum of the elevator and scowled over at it hed told the shagging doorman no one was to be let up hadnt he he ought to snap the idiots neck like a used chopstick but no matter he mused hed locked the mechanism from inside as second line of defense they could come up but they couldnt get in he could barely drum up a curse when the doors slid open and he saw glenna step into the dark oh for pitys sake her voice was impatient and an instant later the lights flashed on they seared his eyes so that this time his curses were loud and heartfelt look at you she set aside the large and elegantly wrapped box shed carried in sitting in the dark like a vampire go away it reeks of whiskey in here as if she owned the place she walked into his kitchen and began making coffee while it was brewing she came out to find him exactly as hed been merry christmas to you too she angled her head you need a shave a haircut and one day when youre not sulking im going to ask how you accomplish that sort of thing a shave she repeated a haircut and since whiskeys not the only reek in here a bath his eyes remained hooded and his lips curved without a whiff of humor going to give me one red if thats what it takes why dont you clean yourself up cian come back to the apartment with me we have plenty of leftover christmas dinner its christmas day she said to his blank look nearly nine oclock christmas night actually and ive left my husband home alone because hes as stubborn as you and wont come back here without an invitation thats something anyway i dont want leftovers or that coffee youre making in there he lifted his glass ive got what i want fine stay drunk and smelly and miserable but maybe youll want this too she marched over to the box hefted it then brought it over to drop it in his lap open it he studied it without interest but i didnt get anything for you she crouched at his feet now well consider your opening it my gift please its important to me will you go away if i open it soon to placate her he lifted the lid with its silver paper and elaborate bow brushed aside the top layer of sparkling tissue and moira looked out at him ah damn you damn you glenna neither whiskey nor will could hold against the image of her emotion shook in his voice as he lifted the framed portrait its beautiful shes beautiful glenna had painted her in that moment moira had drawn the sword free from the stone the dreaminess and power of it with green shadows silver mists and the new queen standing with the shining sword pointed toward the heavens i thought hoped that having it would remind you what you helped give her she wouldnt have stood there without you thered be no geall without you i wouldnt be here without you none of us would have survived this without each one of us she laid a hand on his were still a circle cian we always will be i did the right thing for her leaving i did the right thing yes she squeezed his hand now you did the right thing an enormous and pure act of love but knowing you did the right thing for all the right reasons doesnt stop the pain nothing does nothing id say time will but i dont know if its true sympathy swam in her voice in her eyes i will say you have friends and family who love you and will be there for you you have people who love you cian who hurt for you i dont know how to take what you want to give me not yet but this he traced his finger around the frame thank you for this youre welcome there are photographs too ones i took in ireland i thought you might like to have them he started to lift the next layers of tissue then stopped i need a moment sure ill go finish the coffee alone he uncovered the large manila envelope and opened it there were dozens of them one of moira and his books and with larkin outside one of king reigning over the stove in the kitchen of blair eyes intense sweat sheening her skin as she held a sword in warrior position there was one of himself and hoyt he hadnt known shed taken as he studied each one his feelings swirled and mixed pleasure and sorrow when he looked up at last he saw glenna leaning against the doorjamb with a mug of coffee in her hand i owe you more than a gift no you dont cian were going back to geall for new years all of us i cant no she said after a moment and the understanding in her eyes nearly broke him i know you cant but if theres any message there cant be theres too much to say glenna and nothing to say youre sure you can go back yes we have moiras key and an assurance of morrigan herself you didnt wait around long enough for the thanks of the gods she walked over set the coffee on the table beside him if you change your mind were not leaving until midday new years eve if you dont after that hoyt and i will be in ireland we hope youll come see us blair and larkin are taking my apartment here vampires of new york beware damn right she leaned over kissed him happy christmas he didnt drink the coffee but he didnt drink any more whiskey either surely that was a step somewhere instead he sat and studied moiras portrait and the hours passed that way toward midnight a swirl of light brought him out of the chair since it was the closest weapon he grabbed the whiskey bottle by the neck as he wasnt nearly drunk enough for hallucinations he decided the goddess standing in his apartment was real well this is a redletter day i wonder if such as you has ever paid a call on such as me before you are of the six morrigan said i was are yet you hold yourself apart from them again tell me vampire why did you fight not for me or mine no not for the gods why he shrugged and now did drink from the bottle in a kind of defiance of disrespect it was something to do its foolish for such as you to pretend with such as me you believed it was right that it was worth fighting for even ending your own existence for ive known your kind since they first crawled through the blood none would have done what you did you sent my brother here to see i fell into line the god lifted her brow at his tone then inclined her head i sent your brother to find you your will was your own you have love for this woman she gestured toward moiras portrait for this human you think we cant love cians voice shook with rage with grief you think we arent capable of love i know that you are and while that love may run deep in your kind its selfishness runs as strong but not yours robes flowing she walked to the portrait she asked you to make her one of you but you refused you could have kept her had you done as she asked like a goddamn pet kept her damned her is what it would have done killed her crushed out that light in her given her eternity of dark of a craving for the blood of what shed been condemned her to a life that is no life she didnt know what she asked me she knew such a strong heart and mind she has and courage yet she asked and she knew and would have given you her life youve done well havent you you have culture and wealth skills fine homes thats right made something of my dead self why shouldnt i and enjoy it when youre not sitting in the dark brooding over what cant be what you cant have you enjoy your eternity your youth your strength and knowledge he sneered now damning the gods would you rather i beat my breast over my fate endlessly mourn my own death is that what the gods demand we demand nothing we asked and you gave gave more than we believed you would if it were otherwise i wouldnt be here fine now you can go away again nor she continued in the same easy tone would i give you this choice continue to live grow wealthier yet century upon century with no age no sickness and the blessings of the gods got that already without your blessing her eyes sparkled a little but he couldnt tell didnt care if it was amusement or temper but now its given to you the only of your kind who has it you and i know more of death than any human can and fear it more there need be no end to you or you can have an end what staked by the gods he snorted out a laugh took another long pull from the bottle burned in godfire a purification of my condemned soul you can be what you were and have a life that comes to an end as all do you can be alive and so age and sicken and one day know the death as a man knows it the bottle slipped out of his fingers thudded on the floor what this is your choice morrigan said holding out both hands palms up eternity with our blessing to enjoy it or a handful of human years what will you vampire i n geall a quiet snow had fallen a thin blanket over the ground the morning sunlight glinted off it and sparkled on the ice that coated the trees moira passed her cousins infant back to sinann shes prettier every day and i could spend hours just looking at her but our companys coming after midday i havent finished preparing you brought them home to me sinann nuzzled her daughter all i love i wish you could have all you love moira i had a lifetime in a few weeks she gave the baby a last kiss then glanced around in surprise as ceara rushed in majesty theres someone downstairs theres someone who wishes to see you who i i was only told theres a visitor whos traveled far to speak with you moiras eyebrows shot up when ceara dashed away again well whoever it is has her fluttered up ill see you again later she went out brushing at her trousers theyd been cleaning for days in preparation of the new year and her most anticipated guests to see them again she thought to speak with them to watch larkin grin over his new niece would they bring any word any at all of cian she pressed her lips together reminded herself not to let her inner grieving show it was a time of celebration of holiday she would not put a pall over geall after all theyd fought to preserve something trembled along her skin as she started down the stairs shivered up her spine and to the base of her neck where her lover had liked to press his lips then it trembled in her heart and she began to run that trembling heart began to race and then to soar what she believed never could be was and he was there standing there looking up at her cian the joy that had been shut away burst out of her like music you came back she would have launched herself into his arms but he was staring at her so intently so strangely she wasnt sure shed be welcomed you came back i wondered what id see on your face i wondered can we speak in private of course aye well flustered she looked around it seems we are everyones gone what could she do with her hands to stop them from touching him how did you come how its new years eve he said watching her the end of the old the start of the new i wanted to see you on the edge of that change i wanted to see you no matter when or where the others come in a few hours youll stay please say youll stay for the feasting it depends her throat burned as if shed swallowed flame cian i know what you said in your letter was true but it was hard so hard not to see you again to have our last moment together standing in blood i wanted tears flooded her eyes and she nearly lost the war to will them back i wanted just a moment more now i have it would you take more than a moment if i could give it i dont understand then she smiled and choked back a sob when he drew the locket shed given him from under his shirt you still wear it yes i still wear it its one of my most treasured possessions i left nothing of me behind for you now im asking would you take more than that moment moira would you take this he lifted her hand pressed it to his heart oh i was afraid you didnt want to touch me her breath shuddered out with relief cian you know you must know that i the hand beneath his trembled and her eyes went wide your heart your heart beats once i told you if it could beat it would beat for you it does it beats under my hand she whispered how a gift from the gods in the last moments of yule they gave me back what was taken from me now he drew out the silver cross that hung around his neck with her locket its a man who stands before you moira human she whispered you live its a man who loves you he pulled her toward the doors flung them open so the sun poured over them and because it was still so miraculous he lifted his face closed his eyes and let the stream of it bathe his face she couldnt stop the tears now or the sobs that came with them youre alive you came back to me and youre alive its a man who stands before you he said again its a man who loves you its a man who asks if youll share the life hes been given if youll live it with him if youll take me as i am and make a life with me geall will be my world as youre my world it will be my heart as youre my heart if youll have me ive been yours from the first moment and ill be yours until the last you came back to me she laid a hand on his heart and the other on her own and my heart beats again she threw her arms around him and those whod gathered in the courtyard and on the stairs cheered as the queen of geall kissed her beloved in the winter sunlight s o they lived the old man said and they loved so the circle grew stronger and formed circles out from it as ripples spread in a pool the valley that had once been silent sang with music of summer breezes through green grass the lowing of cattle of pipes and harps and the laughter of children the old man stroked the hair of a little one whod climbed into his lap geall flourished under the rule of moira the warrior queen and her knight for them even in the dark of night a light shone and that brings the tale of the sorcerer the witch the warrior the scholar the shifter of shapes and the vampire to its own circle he patted the rump of the child on his lap off with you now all of you while theres still sunlight to enjoy there were shouts and whoops and he smiled as he heard the arguments already starting for who would be the sorcerer who would be the queen because his senses were still keen in some areas cian lifted his hand to the back of the chair and covered moiras you tell it well easy to tell what youve lived easy to enhance what was she corrected coming around the chair but you stayed very close to the truth wasnt the truth strange and magical enough her hair was pure white and her face as she smiled at him lined with the years and more beautiful than any hed known walk with me before twilight comes she helped him to stand hooked her arm through his and are you ready for the invasion she asked tipping her head toward his shoulder when it comes at least youll be finished fussing over it im so anxious to see them all our first circle and the circles theyve made once a year for the whole of them is so long to wait even with the little visits between and listening to little pieces of the tale brings it all back so clear doesnt it it does no regrets ive never had a one when it comes to you what a fine life weve had cian i know were in the winter of it but i dont feel the cold well i do when you put your feet on my arse in the night she laughed turned to kiss him with all the warmth all the love of sixty years of marriage theres our eternity moira he said gesturing toward their grandchildren and greatgrandchildren theres our forever hands linked they walked in the softening sunlight though their steps were slow and measured from age they continued through the courtyards and the gardens and out through the gates while the sound of children playing rang behind them high
