medical poems contents the morning visit the two armies the stethoscope song extracts from a medical poem a poem for the meeting of the american medical association at new york may a sentiment rip van winkle m d medical poems the morning visit a sick mans chamber though it often boast the grateful presence of a literal toast can hardly claim amidst its various wealth the right unchallenged to propose a health yet though its tenant is denied the feast friendship must launch his sentiment at least as prisoned damsels locked from lovers lips toss them a kiss from off their fingers tips the morning visit not till sickness falls in the charmed circles of your own safe walls till fevers throb and pains relentless rack stretch you all helpless on your aching back not till you play the patient in your turn the morning visits mystery shall you learn t is a small matter in your neighbors case to charge your fee for showing him your face you skip upstairs inquire inspect and touch prescribe take leave and off to twenty such but when at length by fates transferred decree the visitor becomes the visitee oh then indeed it pulls another string your ox is gored and thats a different thing your friend is sick phlegmatic as a turk you write your recipe and let it work not yours to stand the shiver and the frown and sometimes worse with which your draught goes down calm as a clock your knowing hand directs rhei jalapae ana grana sex or traces on some tender missives back scrupulos duos pulveris ipecac and leaves your patient to his qualms and gripes cool as a sportsman banging at his snipes but change the time the person and the place and be yourself the interesting case youll gain some knowledge which its well to learn in future practice it may serve your turn leeches for instance pleasing creatures quite try them and bless you dont you find they bite you raise a blister for the smallest cause but be yourself the sitter whom it draws and trust my statement you will not deny the worst of draughtsmen is your spanish fly its mighty easy ordering when you please infusi sennae capiat uncias tres its mighty different when you quackle down your own three ounces of the liquid brown pilula pulvis pleasant words enough when other throats receive the shocking stuff but oh what flattery can disguise the groan that meets the gulp which sends it through your own be gentle then though arts unsparing rules give you the handling of her sharpest tools use them not rashly sickness is enough be always ready but be never rough of all the ills that suffering man endures the largest fraction liberal nature cures of those remaining t is the smallest part yields to the efforts of judicious art but simple kindness kneeling by the bed to shift the pillow for the sick mans head give the fresh draught to cool the lips that burn fan the hot brow the weary frame to turn kindness untutored by our grave m ds but natures graduate when she schools to please wins back more sufferers with her voice and smile than all the trumpery in the druggists pile once more be quiet coming up the stair dont be a plantigrade a human bear but stealing softly on the silent toe reach the sick chamber ere youre heard below whatever changes there may greet your eyes let not your looks proclaim the least surprise its not your business by your face to show all that your patient does not want to know nay use your optics with considerate care and dont abuse your privilege to stare but if your eyes may probe him overmuch beware still further how you rudely touch dont clutch his carpus in your icy fist but warm your fingers ere you take the wrist if the poor victim needs must be percussed dont make an anvil of his aching bust doctors exist within a hundred miles who thump a thorax as theyd hammer piles if you must listen to his doubtful chest catch the essentials and ignore the rest spare him the sufferer wants of you and art a track to steer by not a finished chart so of your questions dont in mercy try to pump your patient absolutely dry hes not a mollusk squirming in a dish youre not agassiz and hes not a fish and last not least in each perplexing case learn the sweet magic of a cheerful face not always smiling but at least serene when grief and anguish cloud the anxious scene each look each movement every word and tone should tell your patient you are all his own not the mere artist purchased to attend but the warm ready selfforgetting friend whose genial visit in itself combines the best of cordials tonics anodynes such is the visit that from day to day sheds oer my chamber its benignant ray i give his health who never cared to claim her babbling homage from the tongue of fame unmoved by praise he stands by all confest the truest noblest wisest kindest best the two armies as lifes unending column pours two marshalled hosts are seen two armies on the trampled shores that death flows black between one marches to the drumbeats roll the widemouthed clarions bray and bears upon a crimson scroll our glory is to slay one moves in silence by the stream with sad yet watchful eyes calm as the patient planets gleam that walks the clouded skies along its front no sabres shine no bloodred pennons wave its banner bears the single line our duty is to save for those no deathbeds lingering shade at honors trumpetcall with knitted brow and lifted blade in glorys arms they fall for these no clashing falchions bright no stirring battlecry the bloodless stabber calls by night each answers here am i for those the sculptors laurelled bust the builders marble piles the anthems pealing oer their dust through long cathedral aisles for these the blossomsprinkled turf that floods the lonely graves when spring rolls in her seagreen surf in floweryfoaming waves two paths lead upward from below and angels wait above who count each burning lifedrops flow each falling tear of love though from the heros bleeding breast her pulses freedom drew though the white lilies in her crest sprang from that scarlet dew while valors haughty champions wait till all their scars are shown love walks unchallenged through the gate to sit beside the throne the stethoscope song a professional ballad there was a young man in boston town he bought him a stethoscope nice and new all mounted and finished and polished down with an ivory cap and a stopper too it happened a spider within did crawl and spun him a web of ample size wherein there chanced one day to fall a couple of very imprudent flies the first was a bottlefly big and blue the second was smaller and thin and long so there was a concert between the two like an octave flute and a tavern gong now being from paris but recently this fine young man would show his skill and so they gave him his hand to try a hospital patient extremely ill some said that his liver was short of bile and some that his heart was over size while some kept arguing all the while he was crammed with tubercles up to his eyes this fine young man then up stepped he and all the doctors made a pause said he the man must die you see by the fiftyseventh of louiss laws but since the case is a desperate one to explore his chest it may be well for if he should die and it were not done you know the autopsy would not tell then out his stethoscope he took and on it placed his curious ear mon dieu said he with a knowing look why here is a sound that s mighty queer the bourdonnement is very clear amphoric buzzing as im alive five doctors took their turn to hear amphoric buzzing said all the five theres empyema beyond a doubt well plunge a trocar in his side the diagnosis was made out they tapped the patient so he died now such as hate newfashioned toys began to look extremely glum they said that rattles were made for boys and vowed that his buzzing was all a hum there was an old lady had long been sick and what was the matter none did know her pulse was slow though her tongue was quick to her this knowing youth must go so there the nice old lady sat with phials and boxes all in a row she asked the young doctor what he was at to thump her and tumble her ruffles so now when the stethoscope came out the flies began to buzz and whiz oh ho i the matter is clear no doubt an aneurism there plainly is the bruit de rape and the bruit de scie and the bruit de diable are all combined how happy bouillaud would be if he a case like this could find now when the neighboring doctors found a case so rare had been descried they every day her ribs did pound in squads of twenty so she died then six young damsels slight and frail received this kind young doctors cares they all were getting slim and pale and short of breath on mounting stairs they all made rhymes with sighs and skies and loathed their puddings and buttered rolls and dieted much to their friends surprise on pickles and pencils and chalk and coals so fast their little hearts did bound the frightened insects buzzed the more so over all their chests he found the rale sifflant and the rale sonore he shook his head theres grave disease i greatly fear you all must die a slight postmortem if you please surviving friends would gratify the six young damsels wept aloud which so prevailed on six young men that each his honest love avowed whereat they all got well again this poor young man was all aghast the price of stethoscopes came down and so he was reduced at last to practise in a country town the doctors being very sore a stethoscope they did devise that had a rammer to clear the bore with a knob at the end to kill the flies now use your ears all you that can but dont forget to mind your eyes or you may be cheated like this young man by a couple of silly abnormal flies extracts from a medical poem the stability of science the feeble seabirds blinded in the storms on some tall lighthouse dash their little forms and the rude granite scatters for their pains those small deposits that were meant for brains yet the proud fabric in the mornings sun stands all unconscious of the mischief done still the red beacon pours its evening rays for the lost pilot with as full a blaze nay shines all radiance oer the scattered fleet of gulls and boobies brainless at its feet i tell their fate though courtesy disclaims to call our kind by such ungentle names yet if your rashness bid you vainly dare think of their doom ye simple and beware see where aloft its hoary forehead rears the towering pride of twice a thousand years far far below the vast incumbent pile sleeps the gray rock from arts aegean isle its massive courses circling as they rise swell from the waves to mingle with the skies there every quarry lends its marble spoil and clustering ages blend their common toil the greek the roman reared its ancient walls the silent arab arched its mystic halls in that fair niche by countless billows laved trace the deep lines that sydenham engraved on yon broad front that breasts the changing swell mark where the ponderous sledge of hunter fell by that square buttress look where louis stands the stone yet warm from his uplifted hands and say o science shall thy lifeblood freeze when fluttering folly flaps on walls like these a portrait thoughtful in youth but not austere in age calm but not cold and cheerful though a sage too true to flatter and too kind to sneer and only just when seemingly severe so gently blending courtesy and art that wisdoms lips seemed borrowing friendships heart taught by the sorrows that his age had known in others trials to forget his own as hour by hour his lengthened day declined a sweeter radiance lingered oer his mind cold were the lips that spoke his early praise and hushed the voices of his morning days yet the same accents dwelt on every tongue and love renewing kept him ever young a sentiment o bios bpaxus life is but a song h rexvn uakpn art is wondrous long yet to the wise her paths are ever fair and patience smiles though genius may despair give us but knowledge though by slow degrees and blend our toil with moments bright as these let friendships accents cheer our doubtful way and loves pure planet lend its guiding ray our tardy art shall wear an angels wings and life shall lengthen with the joy it brings i a poem for the meeting of the american medical association at new york may i hold a letter in my hand a flattering letter mores the pity by some contriving junto planned and signed per order of committee it touches every tenderest spot my patriotic predilections my wellknownsomethingdont ask what my poor old songs my kind affections they make a feast on thursday next and hope to make the feasters merry they own theyre something more perplexed for poets than for port and sherry they want the men of word torn out our friends will come with anxious faces to see our blankets off no doubt and trot us out and show our paces they hint that papers by the score are rather musty kind of rations they dont exactly mean a bore but only trying to the patience that such as you know who i mean distinguished for their what d ye call em should bring the dews of hippocrene to sprinkle on the faces solemn the same old story thats the chaff to catch the birds that sing the ditties upon my soul it makes me laugh to read these letters from committees theyre all so loving and so fair all for your sake such kind compunction t would save your carriage half its wear to touch its wheels with such an unction why who am i to lift me here and beg such learned folk to listen to ask a smile or coax a tear beneath these stoic lids to glisten as well might some arterial thread ask the whole frame to feel it gushing while throbbing fierce from heel to head the vast aortic tide was rushing as well some hairlike nerve might strain to set its special streamlet going while through the myriadchannelled brain the burning flood of thought was flowing or trembling fibre strive to keep the springing haunches gathered shorter while the scourged racer leap on leap was stretching through the last hot quarter ah me you take the bud that came selfsown in your poor gardens borders and hand it to the stately dame that florists breed for all she orders she thanks you it was kindly meant a pale afair not worth the keeping good morning and your bud is sent to join the tealeaves used for sweeping not always so kind hearts and true for such i know are round me beating is not the bud i offer you fresh gathered for the hour of meeting pale though its outer leaves may be rosered in all its inner petals where the warm life we cannot see the life of love that gave it settles we meet from regions far away like rills from distant mountains streaming the sun is on franciscos bay oer chesapeake the lighthouse gleaming while summer girds the still bayou in chains of bloom her bridal token monadnock sees the sky grow blue his crystal bracelet yet unbroken yet nature bears the selfsame heart beneath her russetmantled bosom as where with burning lips apart she breathes and white magnolias blossom the selfsame founts her chalice fill with showery sunlight running over on fiery plain and frozen hill on myrtlebeds and fields of clover i give you home its crossing lines united in one golden suture and showing every day that shines the present growing to the future a flag that bears a hundred stars in one bright ring with love for centre fenced round with white and crimson bars no prowling treason dares to enter o brothers home may be a word to make affections living treasure the wave an angel might have stirred a stagnant pool of selfish pleasure home it is where the daystar springs and where the evening sun reposes whereer the eagle spreads his wings from northern pines to southern roses a sentiment a triple health to friendship science art from heads and hands that own a common heart each in its turn the others willing slave each in its season strong to heal and save friendships blind service in the hour of need wipes the pale face and lets the victim bleed science must stop to reason and explain art claps his finger on the streaming vein but arts brief memory fails the hand at last then science lifts the flambeau of the past when both their equal impotence deplore when learning sighs and skill can do no more the tear of friendship pours its heavenly balm and soothes the pang no anodyne may calm may rip van winkle m d an afterdinner prescription taken by the massachusetts medical society at their meeting held may canto first old rip van winkle had a grandson rip of the paternal block a genuine chip a lazy sleepy curious kind of chap he like his grandsire took a mighty nap whereof the story i propose to tell in two brief cantos if you listen well the times were hard when rip to manhood grew they always will be when theres work to do he tried at farming found it rather slow and then at teaching what he did nt know then took to hanging round the tavern bars to frequent toddies and longnine cigars till dame van winkle out of patience vexed with preaching homilies having for their text a mop a broomstick aught that might avail to point a moral or adorn a tale exclaimed i have it now then mr v hes good for something make him an m d the die was cast the youngster was content they packed his shirts and stockings and he went how hard he studied it were vain to tell he drowsed through wistar nodded over bell slept sound with cooper snored aloud on good heard heaps of lectures doubtless understood a constant listener for he did not fail to carve his name on every bench and rail months grew to years at last he counted three and rip van winkle found himself m d illustrious title in a gilded frame he set the sheepskin with his latin name ripum van winklum quem we scimus know idoneum esse to do so and so he hired an office soon its walls displayed his new diploma and his stock in trade a mighty arsenal to subdue disease of various names whereof i mention these lancets and bougies great and little squirt rhubarb and senna snakeroot thoroughwort ant tart vin colch pil cochiae and black drop tinctures of opium gentian henbane hop pulv ipecacuanhae which for lack of breath

change its name the drawing salve of many an ancient dame argenti nitras also spanish flies whose virtue makes the waterbladders rise some say that spread upon a topers skin they draw no water only

acarus crawling on a pin mountains have labored and have brought forth mice the dutchmans theory hatched a brood of twice ive wellnigh said them words unfitting quite for these fair precincts and for ears polite the surest foot may chance at last to slip and so at length it proved with doctor rip one fullsized bottle stood upon the shelf which held the medicine that he took himself whateer the reason it must be confessed he filled that bottle oftener than the rest what drug it held i dont presume to know the gilded label said elixir pro one day the doctor found the bottle full and being thirsty took a vigorous pull put back the elixir where t was always found and had old dobbin saddled and brought round you know those oldtime rhubarbcolored nags that carried doctors and their saddlebags sagacious beasts they stopped at every place where blinds were shut knew every patients case looked up and thought the babys in a fit that wont last long hell soon be through with it but shook their heads before the knockered door where some old lady told the story oer whose endless stream of tribulation flows for gastric griefs and peristaltic woes what jackolantern led him from his way and where it led him it were hard to say enough that wandering many a weary mile through paths the mountain sheep trod single file oercome by feelings such as patients know who dose too freely with elixir pro he tumbl dismounted slightly in a heap and lay promiscuous lapped in balmy sleep night followed night and day succeeded day but snoring still the slumbering doctor lay poor dobbin starving thought upon his stall and straggled homeward saddlebags and all the village people hunted all around but rip was missing never could be found drownded they guessed for more than half a year the pouts and eels did taste uncommon queer some said of applebrandy other some found a strong flavor of new england rum why cant a fellow hear the fine things said about a fellow when a fellows dead the best of doctors so the press declared a public blessing while his life was spared true to his country bounteous to the poor in all things temperate sober just and pure the best of husbands echoed mrs van and set her cap to catch another man so ends this canto if its quantum suff well just stop here and say weve had enough and leave poor rip to sleep for thirty years i grind the organ if you lend your ears to hear my second canto after that we ll send around the monkey with the hat canto second so thirty years had passed but not a word in all that time of rip was ever heard the world wagged on it never does go back the widow van was now the widow mac france was an empire andrew j was dead and abraham l was reigning in his stead four murderous years had passed in savage strife yet still the rebel held his bloody knife at last one morning who forgets the day when the black cloud of war dissolved away the joyous tidings spread oer land and sea rebellion done for grant has captured lee up every flagstaff sprang the stars and stripes out rushed the extras wild with mammoth types down went the laborers hod the schoolboys book hooraw he cried the rebel armys took ah what a time the folks all mad with joy each fond pale mother thinking of her boy old grayhaired fathers meeting have you heard and then a choke and not another word sisters all smiling maidens not less dear

seen it to perfection done by joe van wink i mean rip jefferson well so it was old rip at last came back claimed his old wife the present widow mac had his old sign regilded and began to practise physic on the same old plan some weeks went by it was not long to wait and please to call grew frequent on the slate he had in fact an ancient mildewed air a long gray beard a plenteous lack of hair the musty look that always recommends your good old doctor to his ailing friends talk of your science after all is said theres nothing like a bare and shiny head age lends the graces that are sure to please folks want their doctors mouldy like their cheese so rip began to look at peoples tongues and thump their briskets called it sound their lungs brushed up his knowledge smartly as he could read in old cullen and in doctor good the town was healthy for a month or two he gave the sexton little work to do about the time when dogday heats begin the summers usual maladies set in with autumn evenings dysentery came and dusky typhoid lit his smouldering flame the blacksmith ailed the carpenter was down and half the children sickened in the town the sextons face grew shorter than before the
