lippincott company to the memory of emmet crawford captain third regiment of cavalry one of the noblest men one of the knightliest soldiers and one of the most inexcusable sacrifices in the history of our army this story of scenes wherein he was loved and honored is dedicated preface the kind reception accorded the colonels daughter was a surprise and delight to the author nevertheless it was a long time before he could be induced to write this sequel when mr sam slick at the first essay shot the cork out of a floating bottle some thirty yards away he had the deep sagacity never to pull trigger again well knowing he could not improve on the initial effort and so prudence whispered that with the finis to the story of jack truscott and sweet grace pelham there had best come a full stop but many a plea has been received to tell us more about the th and at last the motion prevailed thackeray has said it is an unfair advantage which the novelist takes of the hero and heroine to say goodby to the two as soon as ever they are made husband and wife and i have often wished that we should hear what occurs to the sober married man as well as to the ardent bachelor to the matron as to the blushing spinster and so many of the characters of the old story reappear upon the scene that they will be welcomed for the sake of auld lang syne has been promised and that they and their

were to leave you a fortune humph pay for the clothes i have on i suppose is the answer half humorous half wistful as the interrogated party the younger of two officers glances down at his wellworn regimentals thats one reason im praying we may be sent to reinforce crook up in the sioux country no need of new duds when youre scouting for old gray fox you know i thought you wanted to take a leave this summer and visit the old home in kentucky says the major with a look of rather kindly interest from under his shaggy eyebrows want must be my master then i couldnt pay my way home if theyd take me as freight replies the lieutenant in the downright and devilmaycare style which is one of his several pronounced characteristics of course he continues presently i would like to look in on the mother again shes getting on in years now and isnt over and above strong but she has no cares or worries to speak of she dont know what a reprobate i am sister nell is married and out of the way the old home is sold and mother lives in comfort on the proceeds shes happy up at lexington with her sisters people whats the use of my going back to kentuck and being a worry to her before id been there a week id be spending most of my time down at the track or the stables i could no more keep away from the horses than i could from a square game and she hates both they swamped my father before i knew an ace from an anthill no sir the more i think of it the more i know the only place for me is right here with the old regiment whats more the livelier work we have in the field and the less we get of garrison grind the better it is for me i almost wish we were back in arizona today why confound it man it isnt a year since we left there breaks in the major impatiently and we havent begun to get a taste of civilization yet you let the women in the regiment hear you talk of wanting to go back there or whats worse going up to join crook in wyoming and theyll mob you who was it your sister married he suddenly asks a man named rallston a swell contractor or something up in iowa i never saw him indeed its nearly nine years since i saw her but she promised to be a beauty then and they all say she grew up a beauty but nell was headstrong and always in mischief and im glad shes settled down she used to write to me when she was first married four years ago and send me occasional tips for christmas and birthdays and she was going to give me a lexington colt when i came east but shes quit all that because i was an ungrateful cub and never answered i suppose she knows theres nothing i hate worse than writing and oughtnt to be hard on me its all i can do to send a monthly report to the mother did you say you never saw her husband asks the major after a pause in which he had been apparently studying the quicktripping hoofs of rays nimble sorrel no never set eyes on him it was a sudden smite one of those flashinthepan loveatfirstsight affairs he was down in kentucky buying horses saw her at a party and made no end of fuss over her had lots of money and style you know and the first i heard of it they were married and off it was our first year in arizona and mails were a month old when they got to us how long is it since you heard from her says the major after another pause mr ray looks up in some surprise he hardly knows what to make of this display of curiosity on the part of his ordinarily indifferent companion but he answers quietly enough over a year i reckon she was in omaha then and rallston was away a good deal had big cattle interests somewhere i know that mother used to ask if nell told me much about him and she seemed anxious nell herself said that mother was much opposed to the match didnt seem to take to rallston at all but she was bound to have him and she did and shes just that highstrung sort of girl that if disappointed or unhappy would never let on to the mother as long as she lived they are riding slowly in from troopdrill the battalion commander and a pet of his mr ray of the th cavalry it is one of those exquisite may mornings when the rolling prairies of western kansas seem swimming in a soft hazy light and the mirage on the horizon looks like a glassy sea the springy turf is tinted with the hues of myriads of wild flowers purple pale blue and creamy white the mountain breeze that is already whirling the dustclouds on the denver plains has not yet begun to ruffle the cottonwoods or the placid surface of the slowmoving stream and in many a sheltered pool the waters of the smoky hill gleam like silvered mirror without break or flaw far out on the gentle slopes small herds of troophorses or quartermasters stock each with its attendant guard give life to the somewhat sombre tone of the landscape while nearer at hand two or three wellfilled cavalry troops with fluttering guidons are marching silently in towards the little frontier garrison that lies in a shallow dip in the wide treeless prairie bits of color are rare enough save the faint hues of the flowerets almost as indistinguishable in the general effect as their fairy fragrance on the air aloft the sky is all one blaze of sunshine that seems to bleach it into palest most translucent blue far to the west some fleecy clouds are rolling up from the horizon wafted from the peaks of the hidden rockies down in the swale the wooden barracks stables quarters and storehouses are all one tint of economical brown brightened only by the hues of the flag that hangs high over the scene beyond the shallow valley and across the stream looking only long rifleshot away but a good two miles when one comes to walk it a brick schoolhouse with glistening cupola stands sentinel in the centre of the scattering frontier town there too lies the railway station from which an ugly brown freighttrain is just pulling out denverwards puffing dense clouds of inky smoke to the sky space light and air there are in lavish profusion shade there is little or none except close along the winding stream but shade is a thing neither sought nor cared for as the suntanned faces of the troopers show every now and then a trumpetcall floats softly over the prairie or the ringing prolonged word of command marks some lazilyexecuted manoeuvre on the homeward way drill is over the sharp eyes and sharper tongue of the major no longer criticise any faulty or slouchy wheel the drill proper has been stiff and spirited and now the necessary changes of direction are carried out in a purely perfunctory manner while the battalion commander and his subaltern troops and all amble back and give their steeds a breathing spell typical cavalrymen are those two who chatting quietly together are riding somewhat in advance of the returning companies the major is a man a trifle over forty short stout with massive shoulders chest and thighs a neck like a bull a wellshaped head covered with straight closecropped brown hair innocent of kink or curl a florid face bronzed and tanned by years of life in sun and wind and storm cleanshaven but for the drooping brown moustache that conceals the rugged lines of his mouth and twinkling bluegray eyes that peer out with searching gaze from under their shaggy brows firmness strength selfreliance even sternness can be read in every line but around the gathering crowsfeet at the corners of his eyes and lurking under the shadow of the grim moustache are little curves or dimples or something that betray to the initiated the presence of a humorous vein that softens the asperity of the soldier some who best know him can detect there a symptom of tenderness and a possibility of sentiment whose existence the major would indignantly deny the erect carriage of the head the square set of the shoulders the firm yet easy seat in the saddle speak of the experienced soldier while in the first word that falls from his lips one hears the tone of the man far more at home in camp than court there is something utterly blunt and abrupt in his manner a scathing contrast to the affected drawl brought into the regiment by recent importations from the east and assiduously copied by a professed anglomaniac among the captains rude indeed may he sometimes be in his speech and little versed in the set phrase of peace but through it all is the ring of sturdy honesty and independence he uses the same tone to general and to private soldier alike extending the same degree of courtesy to each no one ever heard of old stannards fawning upon a superior or bullying an inferior to all soldiers he is one and the same short blunt quick and to the point literally he obeys the orders of his chiefs and literally and promptly he expects his own to be obeyed he has his faults like the best of men he will growl at times he is prone to pick flaws and to say sharp and cutting things for which he is often ashamed and sorry he can see little good in the works or words of the men he dislikes he absolutely cannot praise and he is overquick to blame but after all he is true as steel as unswerving as the needle and no man no woman could need a stancher friend than the new major of the th old stannard as for ray no officer in the regiment is better known or more talked about ten years of his life he has spent under the standard of the th barring a very short but eventful detail at the point nebraska kansas and arizona he knows as well as the savannas of his native bluegrass country he has been in more skirmishes with the regiment and more scrapes of his own than any fellow of his age in service but he has the faculty of lighting on his feet every time as he himself would express it and today he rides along as buoyantly and recklessly as he did ten years ago and the saddle is rays home ephemeral pleasure he finds in the hoproom for he dances well perennial attraction his detractors say he finds at the cardtable but ray is never quite himself until he throws his leg over the horse he loves he is facile princeps the light rider of the regiment and to this claim there are none to say him nay a tiptop soldier too is ray keen on the scout tireless on the trail daring to a fault in action and either preternaturally cool or enthusiastically excited when under fire he is a man the rank and file swear by and love you never hear lootnant ray saying go in there fellers tis always come on boys thats why i like him is the way sergeant moriarty puts it among his comrades his brother officers that is to say opinions are divided ray has trusty friends and he has his bitter enemies though the latter when charged with the fact are prone to say that no one is so much rays enemy as ray himself an assertion which cannot be altogether denied but as his own worst enemy ray is thoroughly open and aboveboard he has not a hidden fault his sins are many and they are public property for all he cares whereas the men who dislike ray in the regiment are of the opposite stamp among themselves they pick him to pieces with comparative safety but outside their limited circle the damnation of faint praise the covert insinuations or that intangible species of backbiting which can without sneering others teach to sneer has to be their resort and for good reason ray tolerates no slander and let him once get wind of the fact that some man has maligned him there is a row in the camp minding his own business however unsuccessfully he meddles with the affairs of no one else and thinking twice before he alludes once to the shortcomings of a comrade he claims that consideration for himself but doesnt get it there be men who outrival the weaker sex in the sinister effect they can throw into the faintest allusion to anothers conduct and in the dexterity with which they evade the consequences and of such specimens the th has its share there was crane whom ray had fearfully snubbed and afterwards cut in arizona there was wilkins whom ray had treated with scant courtesy for over a year because of some gossip that veteran had been instrumental in putting into circulation there was captain canker who used to like and admire ray in the rough old days in the caсons and deserts but who had forfeited his esteem while they were stationed at camp sandy and when they met again in kansas ray touched his cap to his superior officer but withheld his hand canker felt very bitterly towards ray claiming that there was no officer in the regiment whom he had treated with such marked courtesy and to this when he heard it ray made response in his characteristic way he would have no middleman he went straight to canker and said his say in few terse words you consider me unjustified in refusing to treat you as a friend captain canker now let us have no misunderstanding whatever your conduct towards my best friend captain truscott and towards towards another good friend of mine at sandy was an outrage in my opinion and i have yet to learn that you have expressed regret or made amends thats my position sir and if you care for my friendship you know how to regain it canker was too much astonished by such directness to make any reply other officers who happened to be standing near maintained an embarrassed silence and ray faced about and walked off for all the world said wilkins as though he had that dd chip on his shoulder again and was begging somebody to knock it off canker was hit in a sore place long before this occurrence he realized that several officers of the regiment had withdrawn every semblance of esteem in their intercourse with him he well knew why but the officer whose cause ray so vehemently championed was away on detached service and canker really did not know just what to do and was too proud and sensitive to seek advice he was a gallant soldier in the field but a man of singularly unfortunate disposition crabbed cranky and suspicious and thus it resulted that he too joined the little band of ray haters despite the fact that he felt ashamed of himself for so doing then there was gleason that man gleason as he was generally alluded to and to those familiar with army life or army ways the mere style is indicative of this character for good and sufficient reason mr ray had slapped mr gleasons face some years back when the th was serving in arizona and there was no possible reason for his failure to seek the immediate reparation due him as an officer no possible reason except the absolute certainty of rays promptly according him the demanded luxury the th was commanded by a colonel of the old school in those days one who had observed the code when a junior officer and would have been glad to see it carried out to this day but gleason was not made of that stuff and to the scandal of the regiment and the incredulous mirth of mr ray gleason pocketed the blow as complacently as he did the money he had won from the kentuckian by a trick which was transparent to every lookeron and would have been harmless with ray had he been himself those were the rough days of the regiments campaign against the apaches officers and men were scattered in small commands through the mountains in the general and absorbing interest of the chase and scout after a common foe there was no time to take up and settle the affair as something affecting the credit of the entire corps many officers never heard of it at all until long afterwards and then it was too late but to this day gleason stood an unsparing bitter but secret and treacherous enemy of the younger officer he hated ray with the venom of a snake so far as the regiment was concerned the enmity of a man of gleasons calibre could hardly be of consequence like canker he had come into the th from the supernumerary list at the time of the general reorganization in scores of infantry officers left out of their regiments by consolidation were saddled upon the cavalry and artillery and in many instances proved utterly out of their element in the mounted service all the cavalry regiments growled more or less at the enforced addition to their list of total commissioned and the th had not been especially fortunate many a fine soldier and excellent comrade had come into the cavalry in this way and of them the th had found a few but a dozen or more valuable neither as soldiers nor comrades had drifted into the mounted service and of these the regiment had to say the least its full share all ive got to remark on the subject said old black bill the senior major at that eventful period all ive got to remark is simply this those infantry fellows showed profound discrimination in getting rid of their chaff but they had no mercy on us when a man aint good enough for a doughboy officer he aint fit for anything now it by no means resulted from inefficiency on their part that so many of the transferred officers had left their own regiments many had requested the move many more were rendered supernumerary as being the juniors of their grades but there were others still who ranked well up in their old regiments and yet were mysteriously left out in the cold and of such was that man gleason six years had he served with the new regiment in the field and not a friend could he muster among the officers not one who either liked or respected him not one who more than tolerated him except among the two or three who daily and nightly haunted the cardroom at the traders store but to hear gleason talk one would fancy him to be on terms of intimacy with every solid man of the regiment and the casual visitor at the garrison would be more than apt to leave it with the impression that gleason was the figurehead of the commissioned element he had fair manners his appearance was prepossessing he was bland and insinuating among daily associates confidential and hospitable with strangers a visitor could go nowhere without meeting gleason for his social status was just so balanced between adverse influences that one could neither forbid nor welcome him to his home no matter who might be the entertaining officer the first to call and pay his respects to the guest would be that objectionable gleason and very sprightly and interesting could he be ten to one the chances were that when he took his departure he had left a pleasant impression on the mind of the new arrival who would find himself at a loss to account for the evident perturbation with which his host proper regarded his acceptance of gleasons hospitable invitations gleasons horse gleasons dogs or guns or rods were promptly at the door for him to try and when others sought to do him honor and other invitations came to hunt or ride or dine gleason had the inside track and somehow or other it seemed to make the better men of the th retire into their shells when they heard of it this had been the way with visiting officers from other posts and regiments when in arizona and the same thing was being repeated here in kansas the th did not like it but could not exactly see how to help it the only vulnerable and tangible points upon which he could be sent to coventry were shady transactions at cards or horseracing that had occurred in arizona and his failure to resent rays blow but two and three years had elapsed since these occurrences the scattered condition of the regiment had prevented regimental notice of them at the time and it was generally held that now it was too late for any such action with any other man coldness distance of manner or at the least the pronounced snubs that greeted gleason would have long since had effect but he was proof against such methods and no sooner detected them than he found excuses to force himself upon the attention or conversation of the officer and in so insidious a way as to disarm resistance he would fairly beam with cordiality and respect upon the commanding officer who was short and gruff with him he would invade old stannards quarters to ask his advice about the purchase of a horse or the proper method of dealing with some one of his men and the major had a soft side in looking after the rights of the rank and file he would drop in to ask mrs stannard the name of a new flower he had picked up out near the targets he cared no more for flowers than she did for him but it gave him temporary admission generally when other ladies had called for a morning chat and though she cordially disliked him mrs stannard was too thorough a lady to show the least discourtesy to an officer of her husbands regiment gleason well knew it and laid his plans accordingly for a long time indeed there were ladies who could not understand why mr gleason should be so contemptuously spoken of by the officers he was so thoughtful so delicate and then he was so lonely gleason was a widower whose eyes would often overflow when he spoke of the little woman whom he had buried years ago down in connecticut but when mrs turner once questioned captain baxter who knew them when they were in the old infantry regiment in louisiana and referred to its being so sad and touching to hear mr gleason talk of his dead wife and their happy days among the orangegroves near jackson barracks the captain astonished her by an outburst of derisive laughter happy madam said he by gad if ever a woman died of neglect abuse and illtreatment mrs gleason did and next time he attempts to gull you with sentiment just you refer him to me but then as mrs turner said poor captain baxters finer sensibilities seemed to have been blunted by a lifetime in the quartermasters department and for quite a while mr gleason was one of her favorites quite a devotee in fact until the disastrous day when she discovered that so far from having been ill and unable to ride with her as he claimed he had been spending the afternoon in the fascinations of poker one by one the ladies of the th had learned to trust mr gleason as little as did their lords but there was no snubbing him snubs said the senior major are lost on such a pachydermatous ass as gleason and however tough might be his moral hide and however deserved might have been the applied adjective the major was in error in calling gleason an ass intriguing full of low malice and scheming a slanderer and substractor he certainly was but no fool mores the pity mr gleason was far too smart for the direct methods and simple minds of his associates in the th he never in all his life failed to take full note of every slight or coldness and though it was his rфle to hide the sting and smile and smile and be a villain still never was it his purpose to permit the faintest snub to go unpunished sooner or later unrelentingly but secretly he would return that stab with interest ten times compounded and sooner or later to the bitter end he meant to feed fat his ancient grudge on ray up to this time he had scant opportunity for two or three years preceding their removal to the east gleason had been stationed in southern arizona while ray after months of lively service in the mountains had been sent to regimental headquarters and marched with them when they came into kansas now once more six companies were gathered at the post of the standard two were tenting on the prairie just outside the garrison the other four were regularly in barracks and the concentration there boded a move or business of some kind old catnip the colonel was east but the lieutenantcolonel was commanding and the junior major was there drills were incessant but scouts were few and after the years of goasyouplease work in arizona the th was getting rapidly back into soldierly shape the little frontier fort was blithe and gay with its merry populace all the officers families had joined several young ladies were spending the spring in garrison and taking their first taste of military life hops and dances came off almost every night a german every week rides drives hunts and picnicparties were of daily occurrence the young officers were in clover the young ladies in ecstasy the young matrons perhaps not quite so well pleased as when they had the field to themselves in arizona where young ladies had been few and far between and all promised delightfully for the coming summer all but the warcloud rising in the far northwest chapter ii garrison talk it was a picturesque group that assembled every pleasant morning on the veranda of the colonels quarters there had been a time in the not very distant past of the regiment when the ladies gathered almost anywhere else in preference but that was when colonel pelham had retained the command and when his wife sought to rule the garrison after methods of her own devising however successful may be such feminine usurpation for a time it is at best but a temporary power for women are of all things revolutionary the instances where some ambitious matron has sought to assume the control of the little military bailiwick known as the garrison are numerous indeed but the fingers of one hand are too many to keep tally of the cases of prolonged and peaceful reign mrs pelhams queendom had been limited to a very brief fortnight so twas said in the regiment despite the fact that the more prominent members of the social circle of the th had been quite ready to do her every homage on her first arrival provided the prime ministry were not given to some rival sister but mrs pelhams administration had been fraught with errors and disasters enough to wreck a constitutional monarchy and as a result affairs were in a highly socialistic if not nihilistic condition for some months after the return of the regiment from its exile in arizona only a few of the officers had taken their families thither with them for the journey in those days was full of vast discomfort and expense and life there was an isolation but those ladies who had shared the heat and burden of the arizona days with their lords were not unnaturally given to regarding themselves as entitled to more consideration as regimental authorities than those of their sisterhood who had remained in comfort in the east then too there was a little band of heroines who had made the march cross country with the th and held themselves and were held by the men as having a higher place on the regimental unwritten records than those who were sent home by way of the pacific san francisco and the one railway that then belted the continent of these heroines mrs pelham was not and when she rejoined at fort hays got her house in order and proceeded though with inward misgiving to summon her subjects about her she found that even the faint rally on which she had counted was denied her the ladies who knew her at camp sandy had thrown off the yoke and those who were joining for the first time had been unmistakably cautioned by the determined amazons of the homeward march courtesy civility and a certain degree of cordiality when in their social gatherings the ladies were willing to extend to the colonels wife but the declaration of independence had been signed and sealed they would have no more of her dominion to a woman of her character garrison life was no longer tolerable to mrs pelham the colonel too was getting tired of it was aging rapidly and no longer able to take his morning gallops then too he was utterly lonely his one daughter the light of his old eyes had married the man of her choice during the previous year his sons were scattered in their own avocations and the complaints and peevishness of his wife were poor companions for his fireside the officers welcomed him to their clubroom and gladly strove to interest him in billiards or whist to the exclusion of the gleason clique and concomitant poker which was never played in the colonels presence but even this solace was denied him by his wife she was just as lonely at home poor lady and she had to have some one to listen to her long accumulation of feminine trials and grievances otherwise the overcharged bosom would burst we claim it an attribute of manhood that to suffer and be strong is an everyday affair but the best of men feel infinite relief in having some trusted friend who will listen in patience to the ofttold story of their struggle to suffer be strong and be silent is a task for the stoutest of our sex but woman triumphs over nature itself in accomplishing the triple feat and undergoes a torture that outrivals martyrdom suffer mrs pelham could and did if her voluble lamentations could be credited strong she deemed herself beyond all question in not having succumbed to the privations and asperities of western life but silent ah no poor old pelhams life had become a perennial curtainlecture so lieutenant blake expressed it and when january came and with it an opportunity to accept a pleasant detail in the east the colonel lost no time in taking his departure he left the th with a sorrowful heart for officers and men were strongly attached to the old soldier who had for years past shared every exile with them but they could not bear his domineering wife and many a fellow who hadnt told an appreciable lie for six months gulped unconscionably when it came to saying goodby to mrs pelham how could an honest man say he regretted her going stout old bucketts the quartermaster looked her straight in the eye and wished her a pleasant journey and a long and happy visit east whereat several ladies gasped audibly yet told it over and over afterwards with infinite delight the majority of the officers contented themselves with saying that the garrison would not be the same place without the colonel and herself which was gospel truth despite its ambiguity but gleason came in from a hunt purposely to say farewell and was most effusive in his regrets at her ladyships departure and as for the ladies of the regiment ah well why should they be any different any more frank in garrison than out of it there was not one of their number who did not inwardly rejoice at mrs pelhams going but they clouded their gentle faces in decorous mourning they grouped about her on the piazza when the hour for parting came looking infinitely pathetic and picturesque and the soft voices were touching in their subdued sorrow there were even eyes that glistened with unshed tears and both mrs raymond and mrs turner begged that she would write to them and heaven only knows what all who that saw it could doubt the forgiving nature of the gentler sex who dare asperse the sweet sincerity of feminine friendship but lady pelham had gone and gone for good they hoped the lieutenantcolonel had arrived and assumed command and major and mrs stannard made their first appearance at regimental headquarters a new era had dawned on the th the staff sent in their resignations and were promptly and pleasantly notified by the new commander that he hoped they would not deprive him of services that had been so valuable to his predecessor whereat they resumed duty with lighter hearts it was all well enough where bucketts was concerned he had been quartermaster for years and no one expected anything else but there were those in the regiment who hoped there might be a change in the adjutancy the office was held by one of the senior lieutenants to be sure and one who possessed many qualifications which were conceded but his appointment had been something of an accident he too had come into the th by transfer in for the avowed purpose of seeking service on the western frontier with the cavalry as it was the artillery which he abandoned for that purpose the th admitted that here was a fellow who might be worth having but to the scandal of the entire regiment no sooner was the order issued which doomed them to a five years exile in arizona then overrun with hostile apaches than the newly transferred gentleman accepted a detail as aidedecamp on the staff of a general officer and the th went across to the pacific and presently were lost to recollection in the then inaccessible wilds of that marvellous territory here they spent four long years of hard scouting hard fighting and no little suffering while the aide in question was presumably enjoying himself in unlimited ball and opera in a gay southern capital suddenly he turned up in their midst just in time to take part in the closing campaign which left the apaches for several years a disarmed and subjugated race he happened to get command of a wellseasoned and thoroughly experienced troop and through no particular personal merit but rather by the faculty he had of seeking the advice of the veteran sergeants in the company he had won two or three lively little fights with wandering bands of hostiles and had finally been quite enviably wounded it was all a piece of his confounded luck said some of the th not unnaturally many a gallant fellow had been killed and buried many another wounded and not especially mentioned and all of them had done months of hard work where billings had put in only so many days but here he came in at the eleventh hour and they who had borne the heat and burden of the campaign and received every man his penny couldnt help a few goodnatured slings at the fact that billingss penny was just as big and round as theirs the department commander had been close at hand every time that fortunate youth came in from a scout and even ray who was incessantly seeking the roughest and most dangerous service could not repress a wistful expression of his views when he heard of the final scrimmage far up towards chevelons fork here we fellows have been bucking against this game for nigh onto four years now and if ever we raked in a pile its all been anted up since and now billings comes in fresh never draws but he gets a full hand and he scoops the deck he has too much luck for a white man the remark was one that said by ray himself in his whimsical and downright manner was destitute of any hidden meaning and billings who had not seen ray for years would never have misunderstood it but when he first heard it six months afterwards and while ray and himself had yet to meet it was told semiconfidentially told as ray never said it told in fact by gleason and billings who was of a nervous sensitive disposition as outspoken in a way as ray was in his was hurt more than a little he had known ray a dozen years before when both were wearing the gray as cadets at the point but they were in different classes and by no means intimate each however had cordially liked the other and billings would have been slow to believe the statement as told him for a single instant except for two things one was that gleason was a new acquaintance of whom up to that time he knew nothing really discreditable the other was that just before the regiment came east from arizona the adjutancy became vacant lieutenant truscott who had long held the position was detailed for duty at west point and speedily promoted to his captaincy billings was brought in wounded and sent off by sea to san francisco as soon as he could travel and so heard little of the particulars of some strange mystery that was going on at regimental headquarters and when some months later he rejoined the regiment in kansas it was with much mental perturbation that he received from old catnip the offer of the still vacant adjutancy of course he had heard by that time just why truscott had resigned and refused to reaccept the position he also knew that the colonel had said that he could give it to no officer who had not served with them in the rough days in arizona and moreover that he had once declared that offering the adjutancy to a second lieutenant was equivalent to saying that no first lieutenant was capable of performing the duties but he did not know that soon after truscotts resignation the colonel had tendered the adjutancy to ray and that impolitic youth had promptly declined he knew as did the whole regiment that for truscott ray had an enthusiastic admiration and regard and for that matter billings himself had reason to look upon the exadjutant as a friend worth having but he did not suspect as some at old camp sandy more than suspected that ray had been offered his place the colonel in his surprise and mortification would speak of it to no one ray in his blunt honesty conceived it to be his duty to regard the offer as confidential since he had declined and so snubbed any one who strove to extract information most of the senior lieutenants were on detached service when they came in from arizona everybody thought stryker would get the detail as soon as he returned from abroad whither he had gone on leave after making as mountain scout leader the best four years record in the regiment but stryker came just as billings did and to billings not stryker was the adjutancy tendered what made the regiment indignant was that so far from being in the least put out about it stryker placidly remarked that billings was the very man for the place he isnt entitled to it said the th in ten years service he hasnt spent ten months with us but stryker did not see fit to tell them what he knew and the colonel knew that he had been tendered and had accepted the position of aidedecamp to his old arizona chief and was daily awaiting orders to join and ray was off scouting with his troop when billings reached headquarters and had to face as he supposed an opposition stannard was the only man who really knew very much about him as a cavalry officer and stannards opinion was what brought it all about they had served for some months at the same post and both the major and his clearsighted wife had taken a fancy to the young officer whose first appearance in citified garb and a pincenez gave little promise of future usefulness in the field pelham and stannard knew that it had to be billings or a second lieutenant but billings had at first no such intimation possibly his strong sense of selfesteem might have stood in the way of acceptance had he supposed that he was merely a last resort stannard really hoped he would be the appointee but all he would say to the colonel when asked for his opinion was i have had less to find fault with in him than any officer who ever served in my troop but then he was only with me six months or so i like him which was tantamount to saying others probably wouldnt but stannard and billings were firm friends as anybody could see and the colonel was quick to note that when stannard had given billings anything to do he bothered himself no further about the matter instead of going along and supervising as was his wont with most of the others if hes good enough for stannard hell do for me was the colonels comment and when billings sought to decline the appointment offered hinting with wellmeant but awkward delicacy that perhaps it ought to go to some man of more established reputation and record in the regiment the colonel cut him short with here mr billings i must have some one at once old bucketts has been doing officework as both quartermaster and adjutant until he is getting used up and young dana is only good for parade and guardmounting ill detail you as acting adjutant and if you like it at the end of a week well make the appointment permanent consult your friends meantime if you choose and so it happened that when stannard said take it and stryker told him quietly that there were reasons why he himself would have had to decline billings shook his head a few minutes in thinking over what he had heard of mrs pelham and wished he might see ray and make him understand that he thought the place should go to him but stannard said emphatically that ray was too harumscarum for officework good as he was in the field and then came a brief letter from truscott cordial and straight to the point as ever it wound up by saying the colonel attributes your hesitation to the fact that you think it ought to go to some man who has served longer with the regiment we respect that and appreciate it but you are offered this with the best backing in the regiment stannards and with that you can afford to laugh at anything the growlers may say the next morning the order was issued in due form that afternoon mr ray returning dusty and unshorn from a two weeks scout up the saline was informed of the fact as he stood at the stables unstrapping from the back of his sorrel the carcass of a fat antelope gave a low whistle remarked well im damned and as bad luck would have it postponed rushing in to congratulate billings until dinner when to his genuine disappointment the latter did not appear he was dining at the colonels to meet some officers from leavenworth and when the new adjutant went to his rooms late that night he had not seen ray at all but there was that man gleason smoking a cigar sipping a toddy and evidently primed for a chat already billings had begun to look upon him with disfavor but could find no reason to avoid him entirely he did not welcome the unwanted guest he could not chill him gleason had his chat and when ray stepped forward with sunny smile and glistening white teeth and cordial outstretched hand the next morning billings looked him in the eye took his hand but there was no warmth in the welcome and ray felt rebuffed i heard ned billings had developed into something of a snob said he afterwards but hes changed more for a frankhearted fellow that he was ten years ago than any man i know and so it happened that two men whose lives were closely interwoven from that time on who had much in common who had they but known could never have drifted apart began the next stage with an unknown unseen yet undeniable influence thrusting them asunder and it was of these two men that the picturesque group on the colonels piazza happened to be speaking this very may morning as the major and mr ray dismounting at the south gate strolled lazily up the lane it was the habit of the former when not on military duty to thrust his hands deep down into his trousers pockets and allow his ample and aldermanic paunch to repose its weight upon his sabrebelt as the belt was worn only at the hours of drill or parade it followed that there were lapses of time wherein the paunch knew no such military trammel and a side elevation of the battalion commander warranted the simile put in circulation by lieutenant blake the major looked as though he had swallowed a drum ray on the contrary was slimly even elegantly built a trifle taller than his bulky superior and though indolent in his general movements excitement or action transformed him in an instant then in every motion he was quick as a cat it was his wont to wear his foragecap far down over his forehead and canted very much over the right eye while contrary to the fashion of that day his dark hair fell below the visor in a sweeping and decided bang almost to his eyebrows which were thick dark brown and lowarched a semidefiant backward toss of the head was the result as much perhaps of the method of wearing his cap as of any pronounced mental characteristic when stannard was talking eagerly of any subject his hands went deeper into his pockets his head thrust forward and his eyes fairly popped as though slight additional pressure would project them into space like manytinted grapeshot if he were standing still he tilted on his toes and dropped his head to one side as he expounded until the ear wellnigh reposed upon the shoulderstrap ray on the other hand threw his head farther back and unless he was angry showed his white teeth to the molars as they came along the walk from the main gate and passed one by one the snug little brown cottages known as the officers quarters the ladies grouped on the colonels piazza began their very natural comment there were no other men in sight on that side of the garrison last year you never saw major stannard without mr billings now you never see him with him and he is just as chummy with mr ray remarked our old friend mrs turner who was languidly swinging in the hammock her eyes commanding a view of the sidewalk and the sidewalk commanding a view of her very presentable feet encased in a new pair of french heeled slippers and stockings whose delicate mauve tint matched the ribbons of her airy dress well mr billings is adjutant and cooped up in the office all day was the reply of mrs raymond who could readily find reason for taking exception to the remarks or theories of her nextdoor neighbor and social rival there were five ladies in the group all under thirty two of them under twenty only one unmarried none of them avowedly interested in either of the two officers slowly approaching no one of them however neglected a sweeping glance at her draperies or some slight readjustment of pose or petticoat possibly the formality would have been equally observed had they all been over fifty i never could understand why mr billings was made adjutant remarked the one spinster her eyes dreamily resting on the lithe form of mr ray i dont mean of course that he doesnt do very well but there were so many others who would have at least who deserved it so much more well you must remember this responded mrs turner there wasnt anybody else when it was given to him and there was no real reason why the colonel should remove him when he took command mr stryker was going as aidedecamp mr gleason well anybody knows he wouldnt do mr crane and mr wilkins were neither of them fit for it mr ray wouldnt have it and mr blake and mr freeman hadnt joined it was really billings or nobody except of course the second lieutenants dear me how i wish one of them could have been appointed and mrs turner sighed pathetically the younger officers were her especial henchmen and each in turn paid his devotion a year or more at the shrine if any one of them had been put in power how much easier twould have been to get the band every evening and then the hops wouldnt have to close at midnight either and mrs turner was devoted to dancing but papa says mr billings is right about not letting the band play after midnight broke in the young lady whose years had been spent in many a garrison and whose papa the post surgeon had pronounced views on matters of military and medical discipline papa says the officers have no right to make the band play until late at night unless they pay them extra they have to be up at reveille and its a shame to make them work all day and at night too the doctor is by no means alone in that idea began a third speaker in a quiet voice and both mrs turner and mrs raymond who had impulsively burst into speech at the same instant checked their nimble tongues bridled sweetly said i beg your pardon mrs stannard and inclined attentive ears to a lady who at the moment had stepped from the open doorway to the piazza it was evident that she was a late arrival in whose presence the others felt bound to observe the deferential manners which further intimacy would possibly extinguish indeed she went on only this morning at breakfast colonel foster was saying that the bandsmen were getting their full share of work and that mr billings was quite right in the stand he made in the matter ah mrs stannard i dont wonder mr billings is devoted to you said mrs raymond you are always ready to defend him he was in our troop you know and i feel that he belongs to us to a certain extent said mrs stannard smiling brightly and nodding pleasant greetings to the two officers who were passing at the moment still intent in their earnest talk the major merely glanced at the piazza and pulled off his cap as though he wished its fair occupants were beyond saluting distance ray bowed with laughing grace and sung out cheerily dont expect the major home just yet mrs stannard hes giving me fits and im in for a lecture the ladies were silent a moment until the pair had passed on out of earshoot then mrs turner took up the cudgels again and yet mrs stannard it wasnt so when mr truscott was adjutant we could have the band night after night if we wanted to and surely you wont say that mr truscott wasnt the very paragon of an adjutant no indeed was the reply we all know how unequalled mr truscott was but then were not the conditions very different mrs turner for instance in arizona the band was not mounted the men had no stable duty and it was so hot in the daytime that they really had no duty to perform but to play after dark when it was cool now here they have their horses they have two parades each day they practice every morning and play on the parade every afternoon that with morning and evening stable duty keeps them very busy and dont you think mr billings is right now all this was well understood by both mrs turner and mrs turners friends and as put by mrs stannard the case was clearly in favor of the bandsmen and the adjutant down in the depths of her consciousness mrs turner was well aware of the fact she had gone over the fight with her liege lord the captain more than once since the spring weather had set in and the services of the band were in requisition several hours each day she knew perfectly well that there was no parallel in the conditions existing in arizona in mr truscotts time and those of the day in kansas with billings still she wanted to contrast the men and their methods and as is not unusual pronounced the abstract statement that it wasnt so with mr truscott then we could have the band night after night she was only stating a fact was her mental justification but that she was doing an injustice she would probably have not admitted for an instant mrs stannard however had seen through the argument and in her courteous way had shattered its effect this put mrs turner on her mettle and she half rose from the hammock dont for a moment think i mean to criticise mr billings mrs stannard i really like him very much only its so poky not to have the band now the evenings are so lovely for dancing and with so many young officers here it seems such a pity to waste so much time they are out drilling or shooting or something all day long and who knows but what theyll all be ordered off somewhere the next minute then we can have the band all day and nobody to dance with its always the way well i like mr billings too said mrs raymond eager to say something pleasant of mrs stannards friend and captain raymond says he is a very soldierly officer very military i mean and knows his duties so well only we cant help contrasting him with mr truscott mr truscott was so dignified and calm and deliberate while mr billings is a regular bunch of springs they say hes very quick and irascible real peppery you know but i suppose that is because they bother him a good deal mr billings has a very nervous temperament i know replied mrs stannard but we never thought him illtempered at fort gaines and certainly captain truscott thinks all the world of him they correspond constantly and only last evening he showed me a letter just received from the captain did he said mrs turner with sudden interest what did he say about grace about mrs truscott said mrs stannard smilingly he said a good deal about her she was so bright and well and so pleased with west point and they had such lovely quarters looking right out on the plain where they could see everything that was going on and miss sanford was visiting them what miss sanford asked mrs turner with that feminine impetuosity which is born of an incredulity as to any ones being able to convey information in ones own time and way miss marion sanford she was a classmate of mrs truscotts in their schooldays and belongs to a wealthy new jersey family mr billings says oh i know said mrs raymond shes that handsome girl in the album that grace had at sandy dont you know with the worth dress and the something or other the matter with her forehead a burn or a birthmark wears her hair so low over it dont you know grace told us she had such a sad history her mother died when she was sixteen and her father married again and she has her mothers fortune and had gone abroad she was travelling with the zabriskies and was presented at court last year and the prince of wales said something or other about her dont you know we read it in the new york something as we were coming out on the kansas pacific last fall my just think of her at west point what a catch and mrs raymond paused breathless with admiration not with effort talking fatigued her far less than silence yes mrs raymond that is the very one i believe continued mrs stannard in her pleasant tones as soon as the lady came to a full stop mr billings says that he has heard that her father married a very unpleasant woman the last time and that twas said he would be what mr billings said that oh mrs stannard how rejoiced i am to hear it captain turner tried to make me believe that he was another truscott in his horror of gossip now wont i crow over him when he comes in to dinner not crow dear cackle suggested mrs raymond mildly its the other sex that does the crowing very possibly i have betrayed a trust laughed mrs stannard coming to the rescue in the interests of harmony it was my mistake in referring to it do tell me about mrs truscott you know i never met her what is there to tell except that she is mrs truscott half laughed half pouted mrs turner who never quite forgave the fact that her queendom real or imaginary had been invaded by that very lady a year before to the temporary loss of her throne as grace pelham mrs truscott had won all hearts at sandy she is undeniably pretty and ladylike but what else can any one say of her stylish no now mrs raymond you need not try and say you think her stylish because only last year at prescott you wouldnt admit it and as to her winning mr truscott as she did it is simply incomprehensible what men see in some women is beyond me she is neither deep nor intellectual nor particularly well read that i ever saw or heard of and how shes a match for him as people say i cant see hes just head over heels in love with her at least he was and she was simply wrapped up in him at least she is you ought to have seen the letter she wrote mrs page a few months ago all about her happiness and jack just as if there never had been another man in the world worth looking at shed have been just as rapturous over mr glenham if shed married him as she promised to do i havent a doubt or ray he was ready to bow down and worship her at one time and she encouraged him not a little before we left sandy too dont you believe that interposed mrs raymond they were warm friends i know but ray was never her lover you always will contradict me nellie protested mrs turner but if you could not see what every one else saw you were simply blind i wonder she doesnt sometimes regret not marrying glenham though they say he has gone abroad and has more money than he can ever spend more than he ever could if hes as close as he was in arizona interposed mrs raymond but did you not know that captain truscotts ventures were coming out wonderfully well asked mrs stannard eager to give a pleasanter tone to the talk i heard not only that was true but that an uncle had left him a good deal of money one thing is certain they have fitted up their quarters beautifully at the point and are living there in a good deal of style here come the officers in from drill exclaimed mrs turner as a group of bronzed and soldierlylooking men came suddenly around the corner of the adjutants office and strolled towards them ask captain merrill he will know captain merrill she called raising her voice do come here a moment and obediently he came doffing his cap and accepting the seat tendered him beside her by mrs raymond you were at the point last month is it true that captain truscott has a good deal of money now cant prove it by me madame said merrill sententiously ask blake hes our jenkins how is it blake dont call me pet names dearie when my tongue blabs then let mine eyes not see declaimed mr blake sauntering up to the group and swinging a long lean leg over the railing what do you want to know is mr captain truscott rich if my individual experiences are indicative i should say he was boundless in wealth and prodigality why he lent me a hundred dollars when i was east on leave and i know he never expects to see it again i declare mr blake you are as bad as mr ray they are scoundrels and substractors that say so of me mrs turner you you make me blush ray come hither and bear me consolation friend of my youth merrill calls me jenkins mrs turner calls me bad as you and you called me with a pair of kings when mine was a bobtail the world is hollow ray mr blake will you stop your everlasting nonsense and tell us about truscott when were you there mrs turner you aggrieve me but i was there in april and are they so delightfully situated yea verily blissfully was miss sanford there she came alas the very eve i hied me hence i saw her but a moment twas you saw her tell us what shes like is she pretty is she sweetmannered as they say sweet shes sweet aye dixhuit at least she was a year agone pretty ah me and blake sighed profoundly and straddled the rail a picture of dejection his auditors groaned in chorus the customary recognition of one of blakes puns but gathered about him in manifest interest with all his rattling nonsense he was a regimental pet but where is she from what connection of the new jersey sanford the autocrat of the preakness stable mean you marry i know not she is a sanford and has a sanfords wealth but twas not for me she adores a horse and worships a horseman this i gathered from our too brief converse i strove to win her ear with poesie but she bade me cease her soul is not attuned to melody shed none of mine she preferred my lady truscott and buttered muffins what did truscott say about crooks fight with crazy horse asked ray who looked blank enough at blakes jargon and wanted facts i dont think jack liked the looks of things said blake relapsing into sudden gravity he told me that he thought it more than likely wed all be in the field again in less than a month we said merrill it isnt a matter that affects truscott one way or another he has his four years detail at the point what difference does it make to him whether were ordered up to reinforce crook just this difference my bully rook that truscott would catch us before we got to laramie unless we went by rail why blake youre addled replied the captain in that uncomplimentary directness which sometimes manifests itself among old comrades of the frontier even in the presence of the gentler sex why mr blake you dont suppose he is going to give up his young wife his lovely home his pleasant duties to join for a mere indian campaign do you asked more than one present and a general murmur of dissent went round what do you say major said one voice in direct appeal to the senior officer of the group it depends on what you consider a mere indian campaign was the cool response but as to truscotts going what do you think ray i dont think anything about it i know chapter iii heroines what is so rare as a day in june sings the poet and where can a day in june be more beautiful than at this highland gate of the peerless hudson it is june of the centennial year and all the land is ablaze with patriotic fervor from north from south from east and west the products of a nations ingenuity or a nations toil have been garnered in one vast exhibition at the

have time to think of those three columns far far out in the broad northwest those three columns of regulars cavalry and infantry roughgarbed bronzed and bearded steadily closing in towards the wild and beautiful region along the northern watershed of the big horn range where ten thousand hostile indians are uneasily watching their coming on the atlantic seaboard comrades in fulldress uniform with polished arms are standing guard over government treasures on exhibition and thoughtless thousands wonder at the ease and luxury of the soldiers life out on the frontier in buckskin and flannel slouch hats and leggings and bristling prairiebelts the little army is concentrating upon an outnumbering foe whose signalfires light the way by night whose trail is red with blood by day from the northeast up the yellowstone terry of fort fisher fame the genial the warmhearted general whose thoughts are ever with his officers and men leads his few hundred footmen while custer whose division has flashed through battery after battery charge after charge in the great rebellion now rides at the head of a single regiment from the northwest down the yellowstone with but a handful of tried

neighborhood and swarm in lively interest all over the historic spot listening with uncomprehending but tireless patience to examinations on fortification or grand tactics mechanics or calculus gasping with excitement over dashing charges on the cavalry plain shuddering over the reckless daring in the ridinghall stopping their ears against the thunder of the great guns at the batteries and beating time with head and foot to the spirited quicksteps of the band dressparade the closing ceremony of each day concentrates the entire assemblage along the shaded walk that borders on the west the beautiful green carpet of the infantry plain and at last as the four gray and white companies go dancing off in doubletime through the grim sallyport beneath the barracks and the carriages and stages whirl away the watching throngs and the plumed cadet officers scurry off to supper and group after group the spectators saunter homewards the band disappears below the crest of the plain towards bumtown and little by little the light turns to violet on the wooded heights across the swirling hudson and silence settles down upon the scene gazing out from under the foliage of the great elms watching these very changes two ladies are seated upon the piazza of the officers quarters opposite the southern half of the plain one is a young matron whose eyes once seen are not soon forgotten so soft so deep so brown so truthful are they under the long curling lashes under the lowarched heavy brows beautiful eyes were they when in all their girlish fearlessness and innocence they first beamed upon our old friends of the th in the days of exile in arizona lovelier still are they now in that consummation of a womans happiness a worshipped wifehood it was early in the previous winter when captain truscott brought his fair bride to make her home among the scenes so dear to both and her life has been one song of unutterable gladness if earth contained a thing to wish for in those six months grace truscott could not name it her pretty army house is the gem of the military community the envy of many a wife her husband is a man whom all men honor and hold in deep esteem in strength in dignity in soldierly ability and in his devotion to her he is all her heart could ask if she loved him dearly when they were married her love has developed into almost an idolatry jack is her world not that she talks or writes very much of that matter however for quite a wise little head is that which is perched on mrs truscotts white shoulders once in a while in some letter to an old and trusted friend she finds it more than she can do to utterly repress her overwhelming sense of bliss and then she lets slip some little confession of which jack is the subject she never dreamed a man could be so lovely so delicate so thoughtful so considerate so everything that was simply perfect is the way she has once or twice found herself constrained to clinch the matter in default of adjectives sufficiently descriptive every day he develops some new lovely and unsuspected trait she once confided to her friend mrs tanner with whom she has corresponded quite regularly since her marriage and to whom we are indebted for some of these interesting details and as jack truscott was confessedly a man of many admirable qualities before his matrimonial alliance it may be conjectured that ere the waning of her honeymoon mrs jacks enumeration table was beginning to prove inadequate and bliss has been and is becoming to grace she has lost none of the girlish delicacy of expression which was so marked a characteristic of her youthful beauty a year before still she has rounded somewhat and both mentally and physically has developed the slender white hand that rests upon the volume of carlyle in her lap looks less fragile than it did that day at old camp sandy when in tanners library searching for the childrens books among the shelves it showed itself to truscotts eyes without a certain ring mrs jack does not fancy carlyle he is too crabbed by far she thinks and she wonders how and where people get such distorted views of life but the captain has been reading him a great deal during the past two months and anything that interests him is food for her happy she is beyond all question happy as woman ever becomes in this world where happiness is never perfect if it were where would be the use of heaven hereafter and as she sits here gazing out upon the soft lights and shadows settling upon the distant hills her sweet mobile face is fit subject for the brush of some inspired painter who seeks a model for an ideal picture i ask no more it is twilight too the hour of all others when the faintest sorrow is apt to assert itself upon reposeful features the hour when it takes a very happy woman to look happy yet grace truscotts eyes tell of only one story love peace tranquillity and at last the silence is broken by the remark which is naturally the result of a womans undisturbed contemplation of such a face i declare grace it is enough to make one want to marry just to look at you mrs truscott returns to earth with sudden bound dropping her blissful daydream with a merry laugh and a blush that refuses to down at her bidding she holds forth her hand appealingly leaning forward in the great wicker rockingchair in which till now she has been lazily inclining how absurd to be sure i wish you would seize me and shake me marion whenever you see me going off into dreamland like that it is simply detestable yet i cant help it oh with sudden impulse wait till you marry some one the least like jack and then see for yourself but i never shall marry any one the least like jack replies miss sanford to begin with you would not be apt to admit any such man could exist now dont bristle all over grace you are not in the least absurd to ordinary people that is you really behave very creditably for so young a wife but you are quite warranted in betraying your admiration to me i like it it was simply mean of me to interrupt your revery as i did but the exclamation was involuntary i had been watching your face for several minutes and thinking how few how very few women are blessed as you are mrs truscotts eyes filled with tears and her hand sought and clasped that of her friend a most unusual caress for her sometimes i fear im growing very selfish in it all marion and i blame myself more than i can tell you when these spells come over me we had planned to make your visit lovely jack and i and here the moment we are alone together i go mooning off and leaving you to be entertained by the sight of my imbecility mrs truscott gave herself a vigorous shake there now tell me about your walk was mr ferris pleasant pleasant very they all are for that matter and i hate to think how much ive lost in being away all may father insisted though and so those six weeks had to be spent at with them it is mockery to call it home and a deep trouble seemed to settle on her beautiful face mrs truscott leaned nearer to her friend an eager tremor in her voice listen marion dear she spoke i cannot allude to the subject except when you do but much as your father loves you he must see now that it is next to impossible for you to live at home and after her conduct this spring first demanding that you should come instead of spending may with us as was arranged and then making it so wretched for you and finally almost driving you from the house it is useless to think of going back this summer do spend it with us we both ask it jack and i it was such a disappointment to lose you in may and now that weve got you again though you said twas only for a week we talked it all over last night maid marion and here mrs truscott has recourse to one of the pet names of their schooldays we talked it all over jack and i and that was one of the things he went to the city for today he had determined to ask your father to let you spend the summer here i want it so much so does jack for he may have to go to kentucky to buy horses for the cavalry stables marion do stay if he will let you and both mrs truscotts white hands now seized and clasped the unresisting passive members that lay still gloved in her companions lap for a moment there was no move two big tears were starting from miss sanfords eyes her sweet sensitive lips were twitching nervously she glanced hurriedly up and down the broad road in front of the quarters they were unobserved and alone and leaning back in her chair she gently withdrew one hand and held her handkerchief to her face mrs truscott quickly rose and bent over her pressed her lips one instant upon the luxuriant hair that fell thickly over the girls forehead then twining her arm around her head nestled her own soft cheek where she had pressed her lips and there she hovered saying nothing more waiting until the little raincloud had passed away presently there came the sound of quick springy footsteps along the asphalt from the direction of the barracks mrs truscott raised her head it is sergeant wolf marion i think he is coming here miss sanford started up wiped her eyes and half turned her back as a young soldier in the undress uniform of a cavalry sergeant entered the gateway and halting at the foot of the steps respectfully raised hand to his cap and stood there as though addressing an officer pardon me madame he asked with a distinctly german accent but with the intonation of a gentleman on every syllable the captain has not yet returned not yet sergeant i expect him on the eightthirty train it is about corporal stein madame he has overstayed his pass i presume mr waring should be told have you seen him madame the lieutenant is neither at his quarters nor the mess then there is nothing further to be done that i know of said mrs truscott whose girlhood had been passed in garrison at times and whose earliest recollections were of papas dragoons i will tell the captain as soon as he returns and she stepped backward towards the chairs the sergeant paused one moment he was tall lithe of graceful and muscular mould his face was of the singular saxon cast so very fair his eyes were blue and clear his nose and mouth finely shaped his teeth were white and even his hair crisp and curly and the very color of bleached straw but redeemed from that dead sodadried effect by the sheen of every lock his face was oval cleanshaved but for the upper lip whose long blond moustache twirled trooperfashion till the ends almost swept his ears he was a handsome fellow and his manners and language bespoke him a man of education after the moments hesitation he again touched his cap and quitted the little garden walking with quick brisk steps and erect carriage away towards the upper end of the row mrs truscott stood silently looking after him a moment then she turned did you notice his hands marion certainly i did the first time i saw him and he is always here you say wolf is an assumed name yes jack says there can be no question but that he is an educated german officer who has had to quit the service there for some crime or trouble he came here just when i did last december and jack says he is the finest first sergeant he ever saw though i believe the men dont fancy him he speaks french as well as he does english and there is apparently nothing he does not know about cavalry service and how did he happen to be in the army i do not know there was nothing else for him to do i suppose the old first sergeant of the cavalry detachment here was discharged last fall and when a new one was needed and there seemed to be no really good one in the troop jack wrote to a recruiting officer in the city to send him a firstclass man one day he got a letter saying that a young german desired to enlist for cavalry service who was evidently a thorough soldier and that there was some mystery about him he was dressed like a gentleman but had not a cent of money and claimed to have arrived only within three days from the old country next day the man himself came here jack had told me nothing about the letter the servant said there was a gentleman in the parlor wanted to see the captain jack was away at the ridinghall and i went into the parlor and there stood this tall finelooking fellow i thought of course he must be some officer on leave some one whom jack knew it was a little dark one of those rainy december days and he had his back to the light but the moment he spoke and i heard the german accent i saw there was a mistake he seemed greatly embarrassed said he had been told he would find the captain here apologized for the intrusion and started for the door when i saw his face was as white as a sheet and that he was staggering and the next thing i knew he had dropped like a fainting woman in the big armchair something told me he was weak from want of food i called mary and got some wine and made him drink it and pretty soon he revived and then jack came and i left them together he said that he had eaten nothing for three days and was exhausted well jack questioned him closely that evening after he had made him rest and had fed him well poor fellow and the result was that in a day or two he regularly enlisted jack really tried to induce him not to telling him that a man of his education would surely find something better but it was useless he said that if he could not enlist here he would go back to new york and enter for service on the frontier so finally it was settled he was made a corporal in a few weeks and now he is first sergeant he is invaluable in that respect still i do wish there were no mystery i hate mysteries he is never seen with the men at all and when not on duty he is always reading jack lends him books that no other soldier cares to look at and that they do not have in the troop library that is what brings him here so often he comes every day or two with a book he has read and wants another but his name isnt wolf somewhere he has a seal ring with a crest on it and last month there had been some trouble among the men and two hard characters had laid in wait for the sergeant one dark night near the stables and assaulted him but he was too quick and powerful for them though they escaped last month he brought jack a sealed packet which he asked him to keep and if anything happened to him it was to be returned to an address he gave in dresden its really quite a romance but i wish and mrs truscott broke off abruptly without saying what she did wish miss sanford was silent she had recovered her selfcontrol and the traces of recent tears were vanishing once more mrs truscott seated herself by her side you will stay with us wont you she said with that uninterrogative accent on the wont which is indicative of a conviction on part of the questioner that denial is impossible yes grace gladly if captain truscott can win papa over to it i shall be far happier here and he will at least have peace at home she will be satisfied and content if i am not there how can i thank you enough gracie i had almost made up my mind to ask mrs zabriskie to take me back to europe with her you know she returns on the werra in july indeed you shall not i had counted on having you for bridesmaid and you would not come home that was the only disappointment in my wedding but after all since mr ray couldnt come there would have been a groomsman short if you had been there why didnt he come you never told me why poor mr ray he wrote one of his laughing letters to jack to say that hed be switched if he was going to play hangman at his own execution you never knew such a queer fellow as he is the real reason was that he could not afford to come east from kansas and give us a wedding present too jack and i would have far rather had him drop the present but could not see how to tell him he sent us that lovely icecream set you know one of the prettiest of all my presents everybody thought ray must have been studying up on art it was so graceful and pretty mr gleason i believe it was said that ray wrote to colonel thayer of the lieutenantgenerals staff and had him buy it he was in chicago when we were married you know that was grandmother de ruyters stipulation and that colonel thayer not ray was entitled to the credit for taste but jack says that there is far more to ray than most people give him credit for hes a loyal friend anyway what was the name of that droll creature who was here last april drake blake mr blake oh yes he is one of the characters of the regiment he is the book of nonsense on two very long legs but he is full of fun and full of goodness he is not at all mr rays kind however jack says that mr ray is the man of all others whom he would most expect to come to the front in a general war and that nothing could shake his faith in him ray could never do or say a dishonorable thing and wasnt it mr ray who saved you when your horse was running away the very man you glory so in daring horsemanship marion i just wish you could see ray ride jack is splendid of course but he is so much larger heavier you know ray rides as lightly as a bird flies he seems just part of a horse as indeed jack does but then theres this difference mr ray rides over hurdles and ditches and prairiedog holes and up and down hill just like an indian and the wonder is he isnt killed jack is a fine horseman nobody looks better in the saddle than he but then jack rarely rides at top speed never unless theres some reason for it see marion its almost dark shall we go in the parlor and light the lamps grace wasnt mr ray just a little bit in love with you once honestly marion no i know he admired me and i liked him and had reason to like him greatly for he was a true friend to me when i wanted one at sandy once he was a wee bit sentimental and even in the dusk grace could feel that marion saw the flush that mounted to her very brows but that was when i fainted after the runaway never before never since dont talk nonsense maidie i think i should like to know him said miss sanford as she rose to enter the hall i know you would only well you might not like him entirely either jack should be here in less than half an hour now then well have tea oh marion im so glad you will stay so will he be on the parlortable as they entered lay two letters turning up the gas mrs truscott scanned the superscriptions both were addressed to her husband one was postmarked fort hays this is the one jack will open first she said to her friend i dont know whom the other comes from but this is news from the regiment it is mr billingss writing and jack is always eager for news from him mr ferris asked me this evening while we were walking if captain truscott had any news from his regiment he seemed unusually interested i could not tell why but it was something about general crook being heavily reinforced by troops from somewhere they were talking of it down at the mess today and mr waring said that if his regiment were ordered on that duty he would apply by telegraph to washington for orders to join it at once there was some embarrassment then because one of the gentlemen present mr ferris wouldnt say who belonged to a regiment already there on that very campaign and he had not applied for orders at all and wasnt going to andwhy grace what is the matter with her face rapidly paling grace truscott had stood gazing piteously at her companion and then seizing the letter in her trembling hands she stood glaring at the address for a moment she made no reply and again miss sanford alarmed repeated her question marion marion it means that i know now why jack did not show me major stannards last letter it means that this letter from the adjutant is to tell jack that the th is ordered into the field it means it means and she threw herself prone upon the sofa clinching her hands above her head it means that my dream of delight is shattered they will take my husband from me but how but why grace i dont understand mr ferris said distinctly that captain truscott would not be affected that he had just begun his detail here if an officer doesnt have to go when his regiment is already in the field how can your husband be required my husband marion you dont know him neither does mr ferris if thats his idea my husband would never wait to be ordered to join his comrades on campaign if that letter says the th is to go that ends it all for jack will start tomorrow chapter iv impending shadows when captain truscott drove up from the ferry and sprang from the carriage at his gate a cheerful light beamed from the open door and windows of his home and grace all loving greeting met him on the piazza he could not but note the warmth of her embrace and welcome but jack had been in town since early morning and never before since their marriage had they been separated a single day in the dim twilight on the piazza he could not see what was apparent as soon as they entered the parlor that his young wifes face was unusually pale and her lovely eyes showed suspicious trace of tears but he could only glance an anxious inquiry there was then no time for more as miss sanford stood smilingly at the centretable truscott stepped forward with his oldfashioned courtesy and bowed over her extended hand a few words of pleasant welcome and greeting were exchanged a few inquiries as to whom he had seen in new york and what had been the result of his various commissions then as the diningroom door was opened and the maid announced that tea was served truscott looked inquiringly at the table any mail gracie oh yes jack i put them under carlyle two letters the captain merely glanced at the superscription of the first letter but when the second caught his eye he shot one quick look at his wife their eyes met and leaving the first letter upon the table he stowed the heavier missive in the breastpocket of the civilian suit he was wearing led the way to the diningroom door and there smilingly bowed the ladies to the brightlylighted table and demanded of miss sanford an immediate and detailed account of the days conquests not until near midnight could grace see her husband alone it was band night and long before they had finished tea rich strains of music came floating in from the parade and as is always the case visitors began to arrive several ladies and officers dropped in during the evening they sat on the piazza enjoying the serenade until the shrill piping of the fifes and rattle of the drums sounding tattoo sent the musicians off to bed and numerous pairs of white trousers scurrying towards the cadet barracks they watched the simultaneous dousing of the glim in the long faзade as the clock struck ten and the three taps of the drum ordered lights out then they entered the parlor and grace had to sing for the last year she had gloried in singing her voice seemed so rich with melody her heart so rich with joy tonight all the strange old feeling came back it made her think of those wretched days at sandy when with jack thousands of miles away perhaps never to see or speak to her again she had to sing because her father loved it so she was a soldiers daughter a soldiers wife and she rallied all her strength and pride and strove to be blithe and animated and entertaining from her first appearance mrs truscott had been a favorite in that somewhat exacting garrison perhaps the hardest one in the army in which to achieve popularity because of the various cliques and interests and now that that very interesting miss sanford was with her their pretty home on the plain was always a rendezvous for the socially disposed and so it happened that all the long evening neither she nor jack could obtain release from their duties as entertainers eleven oclock came before the last of the ladies departed and then mr ferris lingered for a tкteаtкte with miss sanford and poor grace found herself compelled to sit and talk with mr barnard who was a musical devotee and afflicted with a conviction that they ought to sing duets and mrs truscott could not be induced to sing duets with any man unless jack would try she knew that he had gone to the little library where he kept his favorite books and did his writing she heard the door close after him and with unutterable longing she desired to go and throw herself upon her favorite perch his knee and twine her arms around his neck and bury her head upon his broad shoulder she could think of nothing but that fateful letter from hays she wished that it might be mr waring who had come in for he was in the cavalry and would know something of what really was going on out on the frontier she was feverishly anxious to learn the truth and twice directed the talk that way but mr barnard was obtuse he only vaguely knew from remarks he had heard at mess that general crook had called for reinforcements and that sheridan was ordering up cavalry and infantry to his support he did not know what cavalry in fact he did not care he was in the artillery and forgetful of modoc experiences believed that indian fighting was an abnormal species of warfare of which men of his advanced education were not expected to take cognizance that it ever could call for more science skill and pluck than the socalled civilized wars of which mr barnard was a conscientious student he would probably never have admitted and his comment at mess on the frequentlyrecurring tales of unsuccessful attack upon savage foes was the comprehensive remark that the affair must have been badly handled those fellows of the cavalry didnt seem to understand the nature of the work they had to tackle as those were the days before a cavalry superintendent went to the academy and showed an astonished academic board what a cavalrymans idea of scholarship and discipline really was it followed that the corps of instructors was made up almost entirely from the more scientific arms only two or three cavalrymen were on the detail of forty officers and they were mainly for duty as instructors in tactics and horsemanship so when mr barnard dreamily blew the smoke of his cigarette through his elevated nostrils and gave it as his opinion that those cavalry fellows didnt seem to understand their work his audience consisting mainly of staff and artillery officers gave the acquiescence of silence or the nod of wisdom and the casual visitor would have left with the impression that the whole mistake of this indian business lay in failure to consult the brilliantlytrained intellects of the higher corps odd as it may seem it is the men who have had the least to do with indians and indian fighting who have apparently the most ideas on the subject this is not a paradox those who have spent several years at it probably started in with just as many and exploded them one after another mr barnard therefore was more intent on humming the tenor part of see the pale moon than of affording mrs truscott any information as to rumors of the orders sending additional troops to the field but her anxiety was only slightly appeased by his airy dismissal of the subject indeed mrs truscott i would not feel any concern in the matter with the forces now concentrated up there in the yellowstone country the result is a foregone conclusion the indians will simply be surrounded and starved into surrender at last they went mr ferris with evident reluctance and not until he had plainly received intimation from miss sanford that it was more than time knowing mrs truscott well she could see what was imperceptible to their visitors that the strain was becoming almost unbearable the moment they were gone she turned to her friend i must write a short letter before going to bed grace dear now go to him at once then impulsively she threw her arms around her i shall pray it is not true she murmured then turned and ran quickly to her room mrs truscott closed and bolted the front door turned out the parlor lights and stepped quickly to the library then she paused a moment before turning the knob her heart was beating heavily her hands trembling she strove hard to control the weakness which had seized her and for support rested her head upon the casement and took two or three long breaths then with a murmured prayer for strength she gently opened the door and the soft swish of her trailing skirts announced her presence his back was towards her as she entered he was seated in a lowbacked librarychair with both elbows upon the writingtable before him and resting his head upon the left hand in an attitude that was habitual with him when seated there thinking before him opened lay a long letter the adjutants letter from hays a pen was in his hand but not a scratch had he made on the virgin surface of the paper truscott never so much as wrote the date until he had fully made up his mind what the entire letter should be and he had far from made up his mind what to say in this without a word mrs truscott stole quietly up behind him he had been expecting her any moment he knew well she would come the instant her visitors left her free he was listening waiting for her step and had heard miss sanford trip lightly upstairs then came the soft quick pitapat of her tiny feet along the hall and the froufrou of the skirts never yet could he hear it without a little thrill of passionate delight he half turned in readiness to welcome her his love his wife then came her pause at the door a new an unknown hesitancy for from the first he had taught her that she alone could never be unwelcome undesired no matter what his occupation in the sanctum and jacks heart stood still while hers was throbbing heavily could she have heard could she have suspected must he tell her tonight he turned again to the desk as she entered and waited for something he loved more than he could ever tell her own greeting often when he was reading or writing during the day and she on household cares intent was tripping lightly about the house singing sweetly softly as she passed the library and bursting into carolling melody when at undisturbing distance away it was odd to note the many little items that required her frequent incursions on the sanctum itself books to be straightened and dusted scraps of writingpaper to be tidied up maps to be rolled and tied mollie the housemaid could sweep or tend the fires in that domestic centre the captains den but none but the young housewife herself presumed to touch a pen or dust a tome jacks mornings were mainly taken up at the barracks ridinghall or in mounted drill far out on the cavalry plain whence his ringing baritone voice could reach her admiring ears and for it was only honeymoon with her still set her to wondering if it really were possible that that splendid fellow were her own her very own and time and again mrs grace would find herself stopping short in her avocation and going to the front windows and gazing with all her lovely brown eyes over to the whirling dustcloud on the eastern plain and revelling in the power and ring of jacks commanding voice and going off into daydreams was it possible that there had been a great a fearful war in which the whole country was threatened with ruin and hundreds of men had made wonderful names for themselves and jack not one of them jack her hero her soldier beyond compare could it be that the war was fought and won without him but then who could be braver in action wiser in council than he did not the th worship him to a man was not indian fighting the most trying hazardous terrible of all warfares and was not jack preeminent as an indianfighter was there not a deep scar on his breast that would have been deeper and redder but for her little filmy handkerchief that stopped the cruel arrow just in time was any one so gallant so noble so gentle so tender true faithful ummm sweet was the way mrs graces intensified thoughts would have found expression had she dared even to herself to give them utterance and he loved her he loved her and heavens and earth but this isnt practising or housework either and pretty happy blushing mrs truscott would shake herself together so to speak and try to get back to the programme of daily duty she had so conscientiously mapped out for herself perhaps it was because she accomplished so little in the mornings that when jack betook himself to his study for his two hours of reading or writing in the afternoon his witching wife would find such frequent need of entering at first she had been accustomed to trip in on tiptoe after a timid little knock and the query do i disturb you jack dear a query which he answered with quite superfluous assurance to the contrary later even after their wise conclusion that they must be rational she had been accustomed to put the question not at all as a purely perfunctory marital civility but as she shyly admitted to herself because it was so sweet to hear jacks negation and see the lovelight in the eyes that soon brought her fascinated and fluttering to be folded in his arms a moment later still so confident had she become in her dominion both knock and query were abandoned and unless only five minutes or so had elapsed since the previous visit she had a pretty little way of greeting him that though very gradually acquired despite surging impulse was at last quite a settled fact and he loved it well he would have been an unappreciative undeserving brute had he not she would steal behind him lean over the back of the chair jack refused to exchange it for the highbacked one suggested by mrs pelham on the occasion of a brief visit paid them in march and twining her arms around his neck would draw back his head till it rested on her bosom then sink her soft sweet lips upon his forehead it was this he waited for tonight and not in vain another minute and he had drawn her around and seated her on his knee folding her closely in his arms but soon she gently released herself slipped to the little ottoman that stood always ready by his chair and clasping her hands upon his knee looked bravely up in his face no need to speak one word no need to break it to her he saw she well divined that news and hard news had come from the frontier news which meant more to her than to any woman at west point shall i read it gracie he presently asked gently stroking the shining shimmering wealth of her hair her glory and his she bowed lower her head and clasped tightly her hands one word first jack does the th go yes darling she shivered as though a sudden chill had seized her but spoke no word truscott bent and strove to draw her again to his breast but she roused herself with gallant effort threw back her head and again looked bravely up in his eyes no ill bear it best here jack i wontread it dear my brave girlie was all he said as his eyes moistened suspiciously and his hand lingered in its caress upon her soft cheek its from billings you know yes jack go on and then he read to her fort hays kansas june dear truscott stannard showed me your letter and bade me answer it there was no time for him to do it and i myself am writing on the jump you sized up the situation about as comprehensively as crook himself could have done it and your predictions have come true eight troops of the regiment left night before last by rail for cheyenne via denver and by this time headquarters and most of the th are tenting somewhere near fort russell where we are all to take station and wait further developments the band follows as fast as we can pack up plunder and be off it means of course a permanent transfer of the regiment to the department of the platte and from the mere fact that the colonel and eight companies were hurried ahead there can be no question but that we are destined to take part in the campaign against sitting bull crazy horse etc and for myself im glad of it but im glad you werent here jack there was weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth among the womenfolks and some two or three benedicts looked bluer than brimstone you know they had counted on a peaceful summer and a good time and its particularly rough on those who had fitted up their quarters so handsomely and had young ladies to visit them like the raymonds and others most of them have to break up and go east but as six troops are to take permanent station at russell yours among them those who are ordered there will simply move from hays to russell with us as the officers can choose quarters on the way up for up we are going and ill bet a farm we water our horses in the yellowstone before we see russell a second time as soon as packed i shall move all baggage to russell public and personal escort the ladies thither and see them comfortably settled in their new quarters mrs stannard mrs turner and mrs wilkins of course go to russell with us old whaling of the infantry is to remain in command there until the campaign is over as it will be the main supply depot his wife is an enlivening christian a sort of mrs gummidge and mrs malaprop rolled into one but barring a sensational tendency and a love for theatricals in everyday life there is nothing dangerous about her im glad my own wife will be able to remain with the home people for mrs whaling would scare the life out of her with her tales of fearful adventure in the indian country and i dont quite like the idea of our ladies being subjected to her ministrations during the separation however mrs stannard will be there and shes a balancewheel bless that woman what would we do without her now jack a word from stannard himself he said to write you fully that nothing might be concealed strykers letter is straight to the point it is going to be the biggest indian war the country has ever seen and one in which there must be hard fighting armed equipped and supplied and mounted as those sioux and cheyennes are it will take our best to thrash them stannard says that you must be influenced in your action by no misrepresentation one way or other no man in the regiment can say in his presence or mine that you have not done your full share of indian work and no gentleman in the regiment will blame you should you see fit to stick to the point and let the rest of us tackle mr lo you are the only newlymarried man in the crowd on the other hand your troop is commanded in your absence by gleason whom well you know him better than i and in his absence by young wells who is to take his first lesson in campaigning this summer just as luck would have it gleason and ray were ordered to leavenworth on a horse board and were not here to go with the command ray heard of the move and telegraphed begging stannard to get him relieved and sent at once to the regiment but the board was ordered at division headquarters and twas no use ray will have to stay until the horses are all bought and im bound to say he did his best to get back for some reason which i could better explain if i didnt have to write ray and i dont seem to gee he has been offish to me ever since our first meeting here and was one of the men whose failure to congratulate me on the adjutancy i felt then i heard of some unjustifiable though perhaps natural things he said however let that slide i wish you were adjutant again thats all very probably the others do too the colonel telegraphed to all officers on leave and every blessed one responded inside of twentyfour hours coming first train you bet or words to that effect it makes one proud of the old th gleason hasnt chirped but then he is somewhere in central iowa buying they say rays brotherinlaw is one of the largest horsedealers and stannard clamps his mug and looks ugly when it is spoken of he knows something about him and was a good deal stampeded when he heard ray was being wined and dined by him at kansas city but be it understood i dont think ray has any suspicion of stannards objection to the man and now jack ill wind up this rigmarole it is long after taps and the men are still at work packing ive been interrupted time and again and this is all incoherency if you decide to join let it not be said for an instant that the faintest urging came from us address your next to russell the colonel forbade my telegraphing you lest it might sound like a hint my compliments to mrs truscott and tell her i saw her old friend ranger off for the wars two nights ago likewise that young imp of the devil the kid tanners old troop isnt what it was in his day yours always faithfully billings long before he had finished reading she had bowed her head upon her hands but there came no sound at last he laid the letter down and then bent over her grace darling slowly she lifted her eyes and looked up in his face all the light all the joy and gladness had fled her lips moved as though to question but a hard dry lump seemed to have formed in her throat she could not speak his strong hands trembled as they gently raised her from the lowly attitude in which she had been crouching at his knee he would have drawn her to his breast again but she put her little hands upon his shoulder and held herself back twice she essayed to speak before the words came jack god knows i have tried to be ready for this but is there no way i never thought to stand between you and your duty your honor i would not i would not now if i were all oh jack my husband there there is another reason chapter v marion sanford as a schoolgirl marion sanford started by being unpopular on first acquaintance there were very few girls in madame reichards excellent establishment who did not decide that she was cold and unsympathetic courteous wellbred selfpossessed she was to a fault but unpardonable sin in schoolgirl eyes she shrank from those dear and delicious intimacies those mushroom friendships of our tender years that are as explosive as firecrackers and as evanescent as the smoke thereof the volumes of satire that have been written on the subject have exhausted the field and rendered new ideas out of the question but they have in no wise diminished the impetuosity with which such friendships are daily hourly entered into and they never will ours is a tale which has little that is new and less that is didactic army life and army loves differ after all but little from those which one sees in every community human nature is the same the world over despite our different tenets and traditions boys are as full of mischief and sure to get into scrapes as in the days of elijah and the bears girls have had their sweet secrets and desperate intimacies with one another since long before elijah was heard of nothing one can say is apt to put a stop to what the almighty set in motion let us not rail at what we cannot correct but make the best of it let us accept the truth schoolgirls meet take desperate and sudden fancies swear eternal friendships have eternal tiffs and squabbles kiss and make up fall out again and as they grow in grace and wisdom they keep up the system simply taking a new object every few months it is one of their weaknesses by divine right over which common sense has no more control than it has over most of ours but marion sanford had no such weakness being destitute of the longing for intimate and confidential intercourse with some equally romantic sister she was spared the concomitant heartburnings recriminations and enmities she passed her first year at the school without an intimate friend she left it without an enemy hers was not the most brilliant mind in the class she was not the valedictorian of the school on that eventful day when sweet girlgraduates with their shining hair they listened in tears and white muslin to madames parting injunctions but her last two years at the old pension had been very precious to her grace pelham was her roommate and grace pelhams loving arms had opened to her when motherless and heartbroken marion sanford had returned from the second years summer vacation between the two girls there had gradually grown a deep and faithful friendship born of mutual respect and esteem it would be saying too much to assert that at first there had been no differences four years at one school give opportunities which are illimitable but the present writer knew neither of them in the breadandbutter period and was properly reproved by the one and snubbed by the other when in the supposed superiority of his years and coextensive views on the frangibility of feminine friendship he had sought to raise the veil of the past and peer into the archives of those schooldays partly from schoolmates and partly from observation the author formed his opinion of what marion sanford had been as an undergraduate what she became the candid reader must judge for self for a woman she was reticent to a marked degree in discussing the faults and foibles of others she was slow to anger loath to believe ill of a man or woman truthloving sincere and simplehearted she had not been the most studious girl at school deep down in her heart of hearts she had a vein of romance that made the heroes of fiction the idols of a vivid imagination wilfrid of ivanhoe sir galahad launcelot william wallace bayard philip sidney were men whom she fondly believed to have existed in other shapes and names time and again and yet she was staggered in her faith because the annals of our matteroffact days told no such tales as those she loved of knighthood and chivalry once once she had found a modern hero heaven only knows to what a wild worship would not that brief dream have expanded had she not seen him he was the elder brother of one of her friends at school a navy officer a man who when his ship was cut down by a blundering briton and sent to the bottom with over a hundred gallant hearts highbeating because homeward bound he the young ensign gave his whole strength his last conscious minute to getting the helpless into the lowered boats and was the last man in the sickbay before the stricken ship took her final plunge carrying him into the vortex with a fevered boy in his strong young arms both were unconscious when hauled into safety and that ensign said marion was the man she would marry she was less than sixteen and had never seen him the nearest approach to a desperate intimacy she ever had was with that fellows sister a girl of hitherto faint attractions at last the ensign came to the school such a day of excitement and as a great a very great concession madame had permitted that he should be allowed in her presence to speak with his sisters most intimate friends she was threatened with popularity for the time being and marion was presented the hero of her four months dream was a stoutlybuilt youth of twentyfive with florid complexion and hair and a manner so painfully shy and embarrassed that additional color was lent to his sunblistered features he had faced death without a tremor and in the most matteroffact way in the world had saved three lives at the imminent risk of his own but he could not face these wideeyed worshipping schoolgirls and was manifestly ill at ease in a very unbecoming civilian suit still he wriggled through the interview and made his escape leaving only a modified sensation behind the fatal coup occurred next day when as prearranged he came to say farewell this time jack tar had braced for the occasion and was unexpectedly hilarious and demonstrative in bidding goodby to his sister he had effusively embraced her then turned suddenly upon marion and before she could dream of what was coming had caught her in his arms and imprinted upon her fresh young lips a bacchanalian salute that left thereon a mingled essence of angostura bitters cloves and tobacco and drove her in dismay and confusion from the room to seek her own in a passion of angry tears and disenchantment never before in her life had she known such an affront never for long afterwards did she worship modern heroes but while she sought no intimacies as a schoolgirl her friendship and affection for grace pelham strengthened with every week of their association their last two years at school were spent as roommates and then marion had gone almost immediately abroad some hint has been conveyed to the reader of a domestic unpleasantness in the sanford homestead sanford paterfamilias was a successful business man of large means and small sensibilities his first wife marions mother was a new york beauty a sweet sensitive refined and delicate girl in fine a sacrifice at the altar of mammon she married mr sanford when she was eighteen and he thirtyeight and she married him because the family necessities were such that she could not help herself marion was their first child the darling of a young mothers heart and later the pride of a fond fathers yet before that daughter was eighteen she was called upon to welcome in the place of her idolized mother who had died after some years of patient suffering the childrens governess it marred all joys of graduation so far as miss sanford was concerned she had gone home in obedience to her conviction of filial duty and had striven to make her little sister and her brother believe that the new mamma was all that she should be she had been conscientiously earnest in her effort to like in her new rфle the exgoverness whom she had found it impossible to believe in before the effort was a failure due quite as much to the jealous and suspicious nature of the lady of the house as to miss sanfords unconquerable prejudice pretences for rupture were easily found the rupture came mrs sanford did all the talking miss sanford said nothing when her father came home from the city he found his new wife in tears and his daughter fled the frenchman who wrote les absents ont toujours tort was undoubtedly thinking of the field as left in possession of a woman and that mrs sanfords recital of the trouble was a finished calumny at marions expense we are spared the necessity of asserting in her few words written to her father that day miss sanford simply said that she was going to pay a brief visit to the zabriskies but in less than a fortnight with his full consent and a liberal allowance she went with them abroad that his experiences in his new marital relations were not blissful we may conjecture from the fact that he soon found reason to believe that he couldnt believe mrs sanford unbelief grew to conviction and developed into profound distrust still as she not infrequently had to remind him she was his lawfully wedded wife and held the fort he aged rapidly and his struggles for the mastery were futile she was young active healthy and wise as the serpent he mourned for his absent daughter and when yielding to her own yearnings she returned to america in the spring of the centennial year he sent for her to come to him she went and remained as long as she could but in leaving she told him with eyes that filled and lips that quivered but never shrank that it was her last visit so long as her stepmother remained beneath the roof and he broke down and sobbed like a little child but sought not to dissuade her her mothers fortune said the mrs grundys of fort hays was now her own but her mother had no fortune and if she had it would have been shared by the two other children in the old days her father had laughingly bought and set aside for marions own account some government bonds and some railway stocks the latter at time of purchase being practically drugs on the market in fifteen years they were at a heavy premium when it came to parting he had placed these bonds with all their unclipped coupons to her credit at his bankers and she was mistress of a little fortune it seemed to her which added to the liberal allowance he insisted on keeping up gave her far more than she could ever spend on herself even were her tastes extravagant she dressed richly she would have nothing that was not of the best but she was never wasteful it had been her habit to keep accurate account of her expenditure and to send her father a quarterly balancesheet that was a delight to his pragmatical eyes he would have doubled her allowance her last two years at school but she would not agree to it she was in deep mourning and in sore distress and money was the one thing she had no use for all the same he paid it to her account as he termed it and in due time the money became her own she had loved him dearly despite his rough exterior and what she thought his lack of appreciation of her gentle mother but when he married the governess before that second winters snow had mantled the hallowed grave her soul rebelled in indignation and dismay for a year her heart had held out against him and softened only when she saw that he was breaking under the selfimposed burden a shrewish second wife however mrs sanford held the fort as has been said and marion highspirited sensitive refined and loving was entering on her twentieth year without a home was she pretty yes more than pretty said those who knew her best she was simply lovely but alas for those to whom disappointment is sure to come she was a decided blonde a fairer lovelier whiter skin than marion sanfords was rarely seen her complexion was wellnigh faultless her eyes were large clear full of thought and truth and expression and in tint a deep deep blue shaded like grace truscotts with curling lashes not so long but thick and sweeping her hair was too dark perhaps for the purity of her blond complexion it was a shining wavy brown very soft thick and luxuriant she would be far more striking said her commentators had she real blond hair but those who grew to know her well soon lost sight of the defect her mouth was a trifle large but her teeth were perfect and the lips so soft so sweetly curved that one readily forgave the deviation from the strict rule of facial unity when watching her frequent smiles in stature she was perhaps below as grace was above the medium height of womanhood but her figure was exquisite her neck and arms were a soft and creamy white and the perfection of roundness and grace she must lace fearfully was the invariable comment of the sisterhood on first acquaintance in truth she did not lace at all it was a fault beyond her control but her waist was perhaps too small her hands and feet were not like graces long and slender they were tiny but her hand was plump and white and might be compressible it was undeniably pretty and her foot was always so stylishly shod that its shape was outlined most attractively but what would have made marion sanford attractive had she been simply plain instead of pretty was her manner cold and unsympathetic had been the original schoolgirl verdict pronounced because of her distaste for imparting confidences this was amended in her second year abandoned in her third and would have been attacked if asserted in her fourth over no girls departure was there such frantic lamentation among the younger scholars as over marions they had learned to love her to all who were her elders there was gentle deference to her equals and associates a frank and cordial bearing without degeneration into confidences to younger girls and to children marion sanford was an angel the sweetest the gentlest the kindest the most winning girl that lived no matter who was with her no matter what her occupation for them she had ever smiles and sunshiny greeting it was to her the younger girls soon learned to go in homesickness or troubles sure of welcome to her arms and comfort in her sympathy it was to her that the wee toddlers were never afraid to run for sweeties or refuge from pursuing nursemaids it was to her that girls of younger sets accustomed to being snubbed and put down by those two years older would yield the outspoken homage of loyal subjects she was queen marion to the youngsters of the school brave wise and oh so generous while to the chosen few in the class who knew something of her love for the heroic she was maid marion but only maidie to one her loyal and faithful ally grace she was still abroad in the fall of when that quiet wedding took place which she was vainly implored to attend as first bridesmaid three years had elapsed since her mothers death but her heart was still in mourning but early in the spring of the centennial year after a stormy passage she was safely restored to her own land and the evening after the arrival of their party captain and mrs truscott were dining with them at the clarendon there had been a brief a very brief call from her father and stepmother and then she accepted graces invitation to come to them at the point a slight illness of mr sanfords made it necessary to abandon the visit at the time as she was telegraphed for before she had been fortyeight hours at the point the month that followed settled the question as to future relations with mrs sanford she would meet her father whenever or wherever he wanted except under that roof on that point she was adamant and he neither could nor did blame her and so it resulted that she was once more with grace and the admirable crichton as she had been accustomed to allude to him in her letters for the past year and up to the moment of his return from the city he was the only hero who had appeared to her eyes in that manufacturing centre where the article is supposed to be turned out at the rate of fifty a year it never had occurred to her that men so particular about the cut of their uniform trousers the set of a blouse or the nice adjustment of the hair could by any possibility develop heroic qualities and yet captain truscott always looked as though he had stepped out of a bandbox it was late when she went to her room this lovely night in june it was true that she had one or two letters to write but they were very brief she longed to have grace come to her and tell her the result of her interview with jack and she longed to know what that letter would say never for an instant had it occurred to her that at a moments notice a home could be abandoned a young wife left to mourn a delightful station left to anybody who wanted the place and all as an everyday incident of army life that such things could be expected and demanded in the midst of a mortal struggle for national honor was another matter entirely something to be encountered once in a lifetime and something to be cherished in family tradition as grand patriotic heroic and worthy of keeping in remembrance from generation to generation but that to do all this merely as a piece of duty because ones particular regiment happened to be setting forth on probably hazardous service but of a trivial nature as compared with the interests involved in the only war she heard much talked of why she never dreamed of such a possibility and her ideas were no more vague than are those of the general public on precisely the same subject twelve oclock struck from the great bell over at the tower and still grace and her husband remained below it was time high time to go to bed said miss sanford though still perplexed anxious and distressed grace would surely come to her as soon as matters were decided she stepped to her window to take a goodnight look at the moonlit plain drawing aside the curtain she peered through the blinds standing in silence at the front gate leaning on the iron fence and gazing fixedly in the direction of the library window which opened toward the north there appeared the figure of a man a moment he stood there motionless attentive then without a sound he swung back the gate and quickly and almost on tiptoe it seemed to her stepped up the walk passed through a broad moonlit space and was as quickly lost to sight and hearing around the corner of the house she recognized the form and bearing at a glance the man was sergeant wolf chapter vi at the front rare indeed is a day in june warmth and fragrance sunshine and roses strawberries straw hats summer costumes music and moonlight soft zephyrs softer speeches softest of swains have we left at the point farewells sweet sad sentimental some of them have been said the corps of cadets has gone to the centennial with thousands of sightseers from all over the nation they hardly had dared hope for such an unaccustomed delight they had not expected to go but went the nation flocks to philadelphia but out in the northwest some hundreds of its defenders are flocking in another direction come with us and take another look at our old friends of the th they had expected to go but didnt it is a rare rare day in june but where are the soft breezes the sweet fragrance the blossoms and the bliss of that month of months at the dear old point rare indeed is the breeze cloudless the sky brilliant beaming magnificent the sunshine but not a leaf stirs in answering rustle to the wind far and near no patch of shade delights or tempts the eye look where you will look for miles and miles over boundless expanse of rolling upland of ridge and ravine of dip and divide of butte and swale no speck of foliage no vision is there of even isolated tree the solid earth beneath our feet is carpeted with dense little bunches of buffalograss juicy lifegiving yet bleaching already of the faint hues of green that came peeping through the last snows left in may tiny wild flowers purple the surface near us but blend into the colorless effect of the general distance we stand on a wave of petrified ocean tumbling in wild upheaval close at hand stretching away to the east in a leaguelong level flat as the barn floor of tradition and bare as the description far to the east the prairie rolls up to the horizon wave after wave till none is seen beyond far to the north bare and treeless too the same effect is maintained far to the south across an intervening lowland one would call a valley elsewhere the ground rises against the sky until its monotonous graygreen meets the grayblue of the southern heaven but west of south what have we here the farthest wave of prairie surges not against the naked sky but against a cold gray range whose peaks and turrets are seamed and sprinkled with glistening snow aye there they stand the monarchs of the rockies there through the short summer sunshine their lofty crests defy the melting rays and bear their plumage through the very dogdays to greet and welcome the first faint timid snowflakes of the early fall there they gleam and glisten no longer as we saw them from the kansas plains dim in the western distance unapproachable but close at hand neighborly sheltering for we nestle under their very shoulders here to the west just behind us no great days walk away and seemingly far nearer in jagged outline against the blue of heaven are the guardians of the old transcontinental pass here to the west where you see the rugged spurs jutting out from the range runs the old trail which the engineers have followed and carried the union pacific to its greatest altitude between the oceans far out there among the buttes runs that climbing ridge yet it seems so close so neighborly with the foreshortening of that strange scenery that one cannot realize that in its climb it carries the iron rails still two thousand feet farther aloft for years we have read of the rockies and is this possible do you mean that here with this expanse of level prairie before us we are up among the clouds so to speak far up on the very backbone of the continent and that is why instead of towering thousands of feet aloft in air the great peaks longs and hahns and pikes seem so near us to the southard and no higher at all aye call it prairie level if you will for straight to the east it looks as flat as illinois but we are standing six thousand feet higher in air than the highest steeple in chicago and our prairie flat is but the long long slope of mountainside that begins in the black hills of wyoming back at cheyenne pass and ends at the forks of the platte down near julesburg you say it must be uphill to that ridge that meets the horizon at the east is it look over here to our left front a little to the northeast see that tiny lake surrounded by low wooden buildings and approached by the hard beaten road from the distant town a pleasure resort of some kind judging from the streamers and bright flags about the place it stands on a hill does it not and the hill has risen gradually from the west but slopes abruptly again to the east and south to the general level did you ever see a lake on a hill before how does the water get there springs no mark that slender rivulet that runs from far up the ravine at the southwest it crosses the prairie in the near distance and then goes twisting and turning up that apparent slope until it reaches the little lake on the hill the outlet you say yes from here it certainly looks so but step forward a few hundred feet and look at the rivulet and by all thats marvellous the water is running uphill so it certainly seems but the explanation is simple the prairie is not horizontal by any means it is a gradual but decided slope to the east and the top of the little hill two miles away is forty feet lower than the point on which you stand then how deceptive is the distance across the level to the southeast lies the bustling frontier city you wonder to see glistening dome and spire far out there under the very shadow of the rockies at least you would have wondered a decade ago in the centennial year you note the transparency of the atmosphere science has told you that at such an altitude the air is rarefied there is no light haze to soften outlines and to lend enchantment to a distant view roof spire chimney all stand out clear and hard and the coalsmoke from the railway blots the landscape where it rises yet is quickly scattered by the mountain breeze between you and the little town lies the prairie over which the stage road runs straight and hard as a pike until nearing us it begins to twist and turn among the foothills for a climb across the ridge into the valley of lodge pole creek beyond lodge pole indeed the creek valley has not a stick of timber far as one can see it follow it to its source two days trot or tramp up towards cheyenne pass and there you find them as the sioux did twenty years ago before we bade them seek their lodgepoles farther north how far is it to the prairie metropolis a mile and a half you venture my friend were you an artillerist and were you to sight a twohundredpounder to throw a shell into cheyenne from where we stand setting your sights for three thousand yards more than your mile and a half the shell would rip up the prairie turf somewhere down there where you see the road crossing that acequia cheyenne lies a good four miles away and is a good deal bigger than you take it to be but here to the south lies a strange diamondshaped enclosure a queer arrangement of ugly brown wooden barns and sheds far out all by itself on the bare bosom of the prairie that is called a frontier fort it is not a fort it never has been even tradition cannot be summoned to warrant the name it was built after our great civil war and named for one of the gallant generals who fell fighting in the shenandoah valley it has neither stockade nor simplest defensive work it is all it can do to stand up against a cheyenne zephyr and a shot fired at one end of it would go clean through to the other without meeting anything sufficiently solid to deflect it from its course it is a fort by courtesy as some of our noncombatants are generals by brevet and would be as valuable in time of defensive need all around it east west and north sweeps the level prairie south of its unenclosed limits there flows a rapidrunning stream down in whose barren valley are placed the long unsightly wooden stables the big square corrals for quartermasters stock the huge stacks of hay and straw and vast piles of cordwood farther east along this tortuous stream and on its left bank too midway between fort and city is another big brown enclosure in which are dozens of sheds and storehouses it is a great supply depot for quartermasters stores and ordnance and over it as over the fort flutters the little patch of color which stamps the property as uncle sams for reasons that can soon be explained only smallsized flags are ever hoisted near cheyenne by noon of three hundred days a year straight from the wild pass to the west there comes sweeping down a gale that would snap the stoutest flagstaff into flinders and that whips even a stormflag threadbare in a few brief weeks but it is a rare june morning now too early for the zephyr and nature beams and sparkles even over such bare landscape the air is crisp cool invigorating far out on the slopes and side hills great herds of horses and mules are grazing guarded by vigilant troopers some alert in saddle others prone upon the turf out along the road from town comes a train of whitecovered wagons slowly crawling northward with stores and supplies for the army up in the indian country and down here to our right front covering the flat between fort and depot blocked out in regular rows and groups dotting the plain with gleaming canvas is the camp of the th regiment of cavalry for the first time since the war of the rebellion twothirds of its entire strength is massed under command of its senior officer morning mounted drill is just over and the two battalions having unsaddled and turned the horses out to graze are now busily occupied about the camp the soft notes of the trumpet sounding officers call has drawn to the colonels tent a knot of tanned and athletic men in rough field uniform and bristling beards those who best know the th will be quicker to recognize old friends in this guise than when in the glitter of parade uniform or the accurate and irreproachable evening dress of civilization there is not a man in the group who is not quite at his ease in ballroom attire most of them have held acquaintance time and again with the white tie and stiff choker of conventionality but the average gallant of metropolitan circles would turn up his supercilious nostrils at the bare suggestion were he to see them now the th is in its element however for the order has come and with the coming dawn it will be on the march for the black hills of dakota and the colonel has summoned the officers to his tent for some final instructions it must be conceded that they look like business in their darkblue flannel shirts their reinforced ridingbreeches the substantial boots and the field blouses and broadbrimmed campaign hats that arizona suns and storms have long since robbed of gloss or freshness the faces are strong and virile in almost every case it is ten days since the razor has profaned a single chin and very stubbly and ugly do they look but long experience has taught them that the sooner the beard is allowed to sprout when actual campaigning is to be done the greater the eventual comfort occasionally some fellow draws off the rough leather gauntlet and then the contrast between his blistered windandsun tanned face and the white hand is startling every man is girt with belt of stout make and wears his revolver and huntingknife the sabre is discarded by tacit consent its last appearance for many a long month some of the number indeed have taken the order to prepare for campaign work as a permit to doff the uniform entirely gruff old stannard hates the blouse on general principles and looks solid and stocky in his flannel shirt not a vestige of rank can be found about him turner and old wilkins crane and hunter are of his way of thinking but others who preserve the military proprieties to the last are still garbed in the undress uniform coat perhaps they are thinking of the goodbyes to be said in the garrison tonight less than twenty officers are there who report in answer to the signal and having saluted the colonel dispose themselves on the few campstools or on the grass and wait for his remarks some are old friends and some old friends are absent it is odd to think of the th being here in force without truscott or ray or old bucketts the men we knew so well in arizona colonel pelham is of course not looked for he is far too old to be in saddle on so hard a campaign as this promises to be truscotts troop is not yet here but is under orders to remain in kansas for the present and he we know is far away at the point ray with one of the captains whom we have yet to meet and with mr gleason is still detained on that horse board very reluctantly too fretting himself into a fever over it say some accounts and other accounts say worse bucketts as quartermaster is behind at hays gathering up the fragments that remain and shipping property to the new station captain canker is here he was east with his wife and little ones vastly enjoying the surf at cape may when the telegram reached him saying that the th were off for the wars again and within twelve hours he was in pursuit four of the group now waiting around the colonels tent came in just that way gentlemen says the colonel stepping quickly from the tent i called you here for a word or two first there will be forty new horses here at three this afternoon they will be distributed according to color among the eight companies five to each see to it that they are shod first thing there will be twenty in the next lot they are to be left here for webb and truscott overhaul your ammunition and equipments at once and if anything is lacking you can draw from cheyenne depot this afternoon i presume those of you who are to take station at russell will want to go over to see about your quarters but my advice is that only those who have families make any selection there will be some changes by the time we get back we march at six in the morning so have everything cleared up today there will be no further drill those who have business to attend to in town or at the fort can leave camp without further permission i shall remain here until we start and one officer from each troop must be in camp at stables and during night thats all unless somebody has questions to ask and the colonel looks inquiringly around apparently nobody has and the group breaks up some few of the older officers remained to talk over the prospects at the colonels tent others went to the garrison to rejoin anxious wives and children and to spend the last day with them in helping get things settled in the new army homes to which they had been so suddenly moved a third party the youngsters or junior officers sauntered across the intervening stretch of prairie towards the low wooden building standing just north of the entrancegate of the fort in old army days twas known as the sutlers in modern parlance it is simply called the store the middle room of which fitted up with a couple of oldfashioned billiardtables a huge coal stove some rough benches chairs two or three round tables and the inevitable bar and cigarstand bore on the portals the legend officers as distinguished from the general clubroom beyond seated around the room in various attitudes of ennui and dejection were three or four infantry officers stationed at the post while at one of the tables a trio of young lieutenants were killing time after morning drill in the fascination of limited draw target practice as now conducted was then unknown or there would have been no time to kill the announcement languidly conveyed from the occupant of the windowseat a squad of the th coming produced neither sensation nor visible effect a minute more however and the door burst open and in they came half a dozen glowing breezy vigorous young cavalrymen ruddy with health elastic with openair life and exercise brimful of good spirits and cordiality and headed by the declamatory blake who made a beeline for the bar shouting an if a man did need a poison now here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him his names muldoon and hes a fluid man step out muldoon whatll ye have fellers he asked with the sudden transition from the sublime to the ridiculous which was one of blakes delights name your respective pizens gentlemen come join us ye gallants of mudcrushers what ho poker and with one stride he was at the table and peering over the hands no use sammy two queens with but a single ace two sharps that beat as one thats no hand to tackle a onecard draw with never you mind whether hes bluffing or not there aint enough in that pot to warrant the expense of testing the question take another deal what did you say muldoon whiskey no throw whiskey to the dogs ill none of it give me foaming lager thats right my doughboy ancient didnt i tell you to take another hand what says the inimitable pope fair tresses mans imperial race ensnare and sammy scoops us with a single pair good heavens blake give us a rest here swallow your beer or take something to choke you laughed the victim at the table while a chorus of groans saluted blakes unconscionable parodies if you were to be here a week longer i vow id go mad the best news ive heard in a year is that youre ordered to march in the morning what quarters did you choose what difference does it make to you rags put in mr dana you fellows will have the post to yourselves all summer anyhow we shant get out so much as a chair until we come back from the campaign well the married officers have chosen theirs you know stannards traps are all moved into no and they are pretty nearly settled already the carpets were all down yesterday so they were at turners mrs whaling has been helping them unpack for the last three days and telling everybody what they had and didnt have i tell you what fellows were going to have no end of a good time here this summer with your band and all the ladies while youre roughing it out on the big horn whaling says hell bet a hat none of you get back before thanksgiving is it so that truscott comes here with his troop asked one of the captains of lieutenant crane well the troop comes but as to truscott thats another matter i dont understand you crane said mr blake with sudden change from his roystering manner i thought you heard ray say that he knew truscott would be after us as soon as it was settled that we would take the field ray knew no more about it than you do blake was the impatient reply ray has a fashion of being oracular where truscott is concerned as though he were on intimate and confidential terms with him now i for one dont believe he had any authority whatever for saying what he did well hold on here said blake deliberately my recollection is that ray only spoke of it as his conviction not that truscott had told him anything still he was certain that truscott would come and that he would lose no time in getting relieved either you know he is at the point he said in explanation to the silent infantryman well im dd if i can understand it in him muttered wilkins as he buried his broad face in a beermug no wilkins i dare say you cant was the drawling reply and the sarcasm was not lost among the listeners though it missed its effect on the stolid object truscott ray heath and wayne and canker are not the style of men to spend this summer of all others away from the regiment well here we are marching tomorrow and where are your ray and truscott asked wilkins with as near an approach to a sneer as he dare venture blake rose quickly from his chair near where the trio still continued their game though by this time far more interested in the tone of the talk than in tencent ante dana and hunter too were flushing and looking ill at ease this is no time or place to be discussing regimental matters said he but since the matter has come to it i mean to give what i believe to be the general opinion as opposed to that of a limited few crane wilkins you are the only men i have heard express any doubts as to truscotts coming or rays for that matter ive got just fifty dollars here to bet against your ten that if this regiment has any fighting to do this summer theyll both be in it im not making bets on any such event blake and i did not mean to intimate that they were not apt to come said crane conscious that he had been incautious well you then wilkins said blake impulsively i want this thing clinched it is the third or fourth time ive heard you half sneering about these two men its bad enough in the regiment but you are talking now in a barroom and among outsiders by jove if theres no other way i say stop it there was an embarrassed silence this was a new trait in blake one of the most jovial wholesouled rattlebrained fellows imaginable ordinarily but now he seemed transformed for years the regiment had been serving by itself now for the first time it was thrown into contact with the comparative strangers of the infantry these gentlemen too were ill at ease at the suppressed feeling in the conversation but wilkins was mulish at times and he had a reserve if you know truscotts coming it aint fair to bet he muttered sulkily but youd better go slow on backing ray thats my advice blake unless youve more money than you know what to do with all the same i stand by my bet do you take it oh dash your bet blake im no betting man but youd better be certain what rays doing before you champion him so glibly perhaps i know more than you think blakes face clouded a little i dont like your hints wilkins we all know of course that ray has been wild and reckless many a time but he is disbursing officer of that horse board he is the man of all others on it to decide what theyll take and what they wont take buxton knows mighty little about horses and will vote as ray does so that leaves the responsibility with him he never failed us yet and by gad i dont believe he will now all right blake just you wait all ive got to say is that if ray wants to keep his skirts out of the mud hed better quit the company of that fellow rallston and i hear hes with him day and night and has done no little drinking and cardplaying with him already i dont say gambling but theres those that do continued wilkins hotly more than that he went on after a pause when wayne came through kansas city gleason and buxton were at the train to meet him but they didnt know they said where ray was i heard he was at the hotel sick been on a tear i suppose see here wilkins unless you can prove it let up on this sort of talk ray told stannard when he went on this detail that he would touch no card so long as he was disbursing officer and that hed let john barleycorn alone now do you know he has been on any spree no i dont know it blake and yet im certain of it just from past experience with him by gad youre as bad as old backbite himself do you remember that time chip of the artillery was walking down nassau street and a steamboiler or something burst under the sidewalk and broke his leg the first thing old backbite said when he heard of it was hm been drinking i suppose now heres billings with a despatch what is it bully rook he hailed as the adjutant came bounding in truscott starts tonight and the horse board will break up next week so well have jack and ray with us inside of ten days precisely now wilkins if you want a nice mudbath for your head theres an elegant spot back of the stables come on billings im going to camp and with that he left followed by all the cavalrymen but wilkins and his associate crane the latter held the ground and as they were plainly the defeated parties in the argument so far human nature demanded that mr wilkins should set himself right in the eyes of the reluctant auditors and so it happened that among the officers composing what might be termed the permanent garrison of the post the first impressions received of mr ray were conveyed by a tongue as ill regulated as other peoples children chapter vii war rumors the announcement that captain truscott had gone to washington was received at the officers mess with no little excitement questioned as to the meaning of it the commandant of cadets unreservedly replied that truscott would not risk failure but with the full permission of the superintendent had gone to see the secretary of war and get immediate orders to join his regiment the th was to take the field at once said the colonel and truscott felt that it was his duty to go things looked very much as though there would be a stubborn and protracted indian war and undoubtedly the captain was right in his view of the matter in this opinion there was general acquiescence among the staff and artillery officers present it is always safe to adhere to general principles which are not apt to be personal in their application and the staff and artillery rarely were called upon to take part in such hostilities and mr ferris being a cavalryman of spirit was quite disposed to think it the proper thing for him too to ask for orders although the possibility of his regiments being involved was indeed remote one or two officers however maintained that the principle was bad as a precedent that hereafter officers might feel it a reflection upon them if they did not immediately ask to be sent to their commands on the first rumor of hostilities no matter how important might be the duties upon which they were detached on this view of the case very little was said but one or two gentlemen whose regiments were known to be marching on the yellowstone country looked gratefully at the originator and nodded their heads appreciatively it was mid june now and except the fight with crazy horses band on patricks day and an unimportant brush with the sioux on the headwaters of the tongue river nothing that could be called hostilities had really taken place the indians will be surrounded and will surrender without a blow said those who sought for reason to evade going but no man who knew anything of indian character or indian methods believed that for an instant every experienced officer knew and knew well that a mortal struggle must come and come soon and come it did but jack truscott needed no such spur to urge him on the path of duty what it cost to cut loose from all that was so beautiful to him in his happy home no one ever knew what it cost his brave young wife to let him go was never told barely half a year had they rejoiced together in their lovelit surroundings the most envied couple at the point and there is vast comfort in being envied and grace truscott had never for an instant dreamed that so rude an interruption could come but come it had with blinding sudden force that for a time stunned and wellnigh crushed her jack had lifted her in his strong arms and almost carried her to their room the night when he had to tell her of his determination but once satisfied that his duty was plain she rallied like the soldiers daughter she was and spoke no word of repining she looked up in his eyes and bade him go true she cherished faint hope that in washington there would be attempt to dissuade him for she had good reason to know that in the days whereof we write there were officials of the war department who regarded indian warfare on the frontier as a matter quite beneath their notice one which might of course concern the officers and men actually engaged but that could be of small moment to the army that is the army as known to society as known to the press and tis to be feared as understood by congress the army in its exclusive and somewhat supercilious existence at the national capital colonel and mrs pelham were there and jack would of course see them and was it not possible that there would be officials of the highest authority who could convince him that his services were not needed at the front but could not be dispensed with at the point poor grace she little dreamed that for such a place as her husband held there were dozens of applicants and that senators and representatives by the score had favorites and friends whom they were eager to urge for every eastern detail and then even now she did not entirely know her jack so gentle loving caressing as he was with her she could hardly realize the inflexibility of his purpose the interview with the secretary of war was over in five minutes and never had that functionary experienced such a surprise he had received captain truscotts card and directed that he be admitted vaguely remembering him as the tall cavalry officer whom he had seen at the point on the first of the month and whom after the manner of his kind he had begged to let him know if there should ever be anything he could do for him in washington and now here he was and had a favor to ask the secretary sighed and looked up drearily from his papers but rose and shook hands with the young officer who entered and blandly asked him to be seated captain truscott however bowed his thanks said that he had just left the adjutantgeneral and had his full permission to present in person this note from the superintendent of the academy and his the captains request to be immediately relieved from duty at west point with orders to join his regiment then en route to reinforce general crook the secretary mechanically took the note between his nerveless fingers and simply stared at his visitor at last he broke forth by the eternal and the administration was not jacksonian either captain truscott this beats anything in my experience since ive been in office every man who has called upon me has wanted orders for himself or somebody else to come east do you mean you want to go west and rejoin your regiment to do more of this indian fighting certainly mr secretary was truscotts halfamused reply it shall be as you wish of course said the cabinet officer but ive no words to say how i appreciate it you seem to be of a different kind of timber from those fellows who are always hanging around washington not but what they are all very necessary and that sort of thing put in the secretary diplomatically but we have no end of men who want to come to washington youre the first man ive heard of who wanted to go by jove captain truscott is there anything else you want is there anything i can do that will convey to you my appreciation of your course well sir i have spoken to the adjutantgeneral about some six men of the cavalry detachment at the point who are eager to go to the frontier for active service if they could be transferred sent out with recruits we are shorthanded in the th and my own troop needs noncommissioned officers certainly it can be done well see general tabout it at once that night graces last hope was broken by the telegram from washington which told her that jack would be home next day and that the orders were issued mrs pelham had stormed of course that is to her husband she stood in awe of jack and had counted on spending much of the summer at the point living as they were at a washington hotel expenses were very heavy and madame had planned to recuperate her exhausted frame and fortune in a long visit to dear grace who really ought to have a mothers well at least if the captain is to be away so much of the time she will surely be lonely madame had argued it was really quite fortunate that he had to go to kentucky to buy horses in his absence she might recover much of the ground she felt she had lost in the last year the plan was fairly developed in her strategical mind when who should appear but the captain himself and with the brief announcement that they would start for wyoming in a week madame could not believe her senses but either from shock or unusually profound discretion she refrained from an expression of her sentiments and truscott continued his calm explanation grace had borne up bravely at the idea of his throwing away the detail at the point but had made one stipulation she should go with him to the frontier rebuild their nest at the new station of his troop and be near him as woman could be during the summers campaign and all ready to welcome him home at its close he could not say her nay old pelhams eyes brimmed with tears but when he spoke it was only to repress the impetuous outbreak of his wife now dolly no words truscotts right so is grace its bound to be a sharp campaign no matter what your society friends say by gad id id give anything to go but im too old jack id only be in the way youre right my boy youre right you always are your place is with the regiment when theres work to be done and grace is a soldiers wife shes right too her place is near him in vain mrs pelham argued that grace could better remain east jack knew his wifes mind she would be just as comfortable she would be far happier in the cosey quarters of the big garrison at russell she would have mrs stannard whom they all loved for friend and companion and there were a dozen pleasant acquaintances among the ladies there to be quartered it was simply useless for madame to interpose everything had been settled beforehand and without reference to her the best they could do was to accept jacks invitation to come to the point be his guests at the hotel and see them off he would dismantle his quarters forthwith and when he returned to grace next day she was brave smiling really happy she gloried in the idea of going with her soldier husband back to the dear old th and she had another plan a surprise she and marion had had a long talk and as a result marion wanted to go too it was novel it was almost startling yet why not several young ladies were already visiting at hays two of them were going had gone to russell with relatives who were married in the th miss sanford was to have spent the summer with them at the point why should she not accompany grace to wyoming and see something of that odd army life of which she had heard so much if captain truscott would have her she knew no reason to prevent and they all knew that in the captains enforced absence on the campaign no one could be so great a comfort so dear a companion to grace as her schoolmate marion there was only one question said truscott will mr sanford consent i will write tonight said the young lady in reply and i feel confident of his answer within a week as we know the telegram had reached the th announcing truscotts move and that very afternoon mrs stannard seated on the piazza of her new quarters and gazing southward across the bare parade to the duncolored barracks on the other side and the snowcapped peaks of colorado seemingly just beyond was startled by a sudden sensation in the group of officers in front of colonel whalings another telegram presently her husband left the group and came quickly to her hands in his pockets as usual and with his customary expression of unastonishable nonchalance still she saw he had disturbing news and she rose anxiously to meet him her sweet blue eyes clouded with the dread she strove to repress what is it luce she asked the major unpursed his lips and abandoned the attempted whistle been a fight way up on the rosebud he briefly said as he dropped into a chair still maintaining his apparent indifference of manner yes but what was it who is hurt this time h of the third shot through the face cant live they say reckon that isnt the worst of it either crook found the indians far too many for him and he had to fall back to his camps oh luce then it will be a hard campaign what news for the th nothing as yet we march of course at daybreak and i suppose the rest of the regiment will be hurried up from kansas what must be looked after at once is the great mass of indians at the red cloud and spotted tail reservations on white river they will get this news within the next twentyfour hours and it will so embolden them that the entire gang will probably take the warpath there is where we will be sent i fancy orders will reach us at laramie they say sheridan himself is on his way to the reservations to look into matters mrs turner been here he suddenly asked with a quick glance from under his shaggy eyebrows mrs turner not since morning why there was a sort of snarl down at the store this morning some mention of it was made while we were talking there at whalings and i was anxious to get the particulars wilkins was saying something about ray that worries me have you heard nothing not a thing luce did you suppose mrs turner was possessed of all the information and would come to me with it the major looked uncomfortable she would be apt to go to somebody and you were the nearest both those youngsters dana and hunter were present and they are leaky vessels im told turner never tells her anything but the boys do what a thing to say luce cant help it growled the major thrusting out his spurred bootheels towards the railing and tilting back in his chair you never heard i suppose that between her and mrs raymond and mrs wilkins there was a regular intelligence bureau at sandy two years ago so you heard nothing about this affair not a word and it occurs to me major stannard that you look vastly as though you wish mrs turner had come with the details thats just the way with you men you rail at our sex for gossiping and growl when we cant or wont tell you anything luce luce how consistent and in her enjoyment of her burly lords discomfiture mrs stannard forgot for the moment her many anxieties and laughed blithely the major had too much to worry him however and this was so evident to his devoted wife that her laugh was brief it was never loud or strident and she moved her chair nearer to his own is mr ray in any trouble she asked with genuine concern i dont know of the officers present at the conversation in the store this morning all i have since seen were infantrymen whom i couldnt ask wayne and merrill heard something of it and came to me at once because of their regard for ray but blake has gone to town he is the man who snubbed crane and wilkins it seems wilkins claims to have a letter from somebody that man gleason probably to the effect that ray has been on a perpetual tear with the very man of all others i dreaded his meeting you remember that contractor rallston mr rays brotherinlaw yes worse luck i knew the fellow by reputation before we went to arizona hes a scoundrel and a very polished one too ray is smart enough ordinarily but if rallston has been trying to sell him horses there will be trouble sooner or later im more worried about that than over the campaign news sorry about h of course though id never met him they say he is a capital officer but i cant start tomorrow and have this thing haunting me all the way up to laramie ill go down to camp and hunt up wilkins and ask him flatfooted for his whole story then there will be time to write to ray or telegraph if need be that was a dreary night at russell all the afternoon the telegraph instrument at headquarters was clicking away with details of the brief and sudden fight upon the rosebud and the officers read in silence the description of the hordes upon hordes of savages that swooped down upon crooks little column and whirled his allied absarakбs and shoshones off the wooded bluffs they must have been reinforced from every reservation between the missouri and the mountains was the comment for the whole country swarmed with them scout after scout had been sent out to strive to push through to the yellowstone and communicate with general terrys forces known to be concentrated at the mouth of the tongue some had come back chased in to the very guard by yelling hostiles several had failed to return at all but significant fact none had succeeded in getting through the last of june would soon be at hand the forces that were to cooperate crooks from the big horn foothills at the south terrys from the banks of the yellowstone at the north had reached their appointed stations and even gone beyond but not a vestige of communication could they establish one with the other crook striving to force his way through from his corrals and camps had been overpowered and thrust back by the concentration upon him of five times his weight in foes terry sending his cavalry scouting up the rosebud found an unimpeded passage for miles and miles and even as our friends at russell were reading with gloomy faces the tidings from the front a little battalion of cavalry pushing venturously up the wild and picturesque valley came suddenly upon a sight that bade their leader pause up from among the wild rosebushes along the sparkling stream and climbing the great divide to the west there ran a broad newbeaten dusty trail pounded by the hoofs of ten thousand ponies strewn on every side with abandoned lodgepoles wornout blankets or other impedimenta malodorous unsightly the indians have crossed to the little horn within the last three days said the experienced scouts in the advance back went the column down the valley to report the news and three days afterwards two wartried regiments of horse were en route from the south heading for the black hills of dakota with orders to find the trail leading from the reservations to the indian country and put a stop to the forwarding of reinforcements or supplies rode our old arizona acquaintances of the th from the north pushing up the rosebud into the very heart of the hostile regions with orders to find the lurkingplace of the swarming savages and hold them from the east there came a command and a commander famed in song and story between them and the big horn heights and caсons where lay the comrade force of crook there rolled a glorious tract of wooded crest of sweeping upland prairie of deep and sheltered valley of plashing stream and foaming torrent and there in their guarded fastness exulting in their strength mad with rejoicing over their easy victory lighting the valley for miles with their councilfires rousing the echoes with triumphant shout and speech thousand upon thousand gathered the indian foemen covering the hills like a red cloud chapter viii at russell what do you think exclaimed mrs turner breathlessly as she rushed in upon her friend mrs stannard one bright morning a week later mrs truscott and miss sanford will both be here tomorrow mr gleason escorts them why she added in visible disappointment you knew all about it all the time why didnt you tell me i only knew yesterday mrs turner was the smiling reply they will stay with me until their quarters are ready captain truscott and captain webb will camp here with their troops until further orders and you knew of course that they were on their way the ladies were to have gone to the hotel in town but major stannard sent word before he left that mrs truscott must come to me and i have plenty of room for miss sanford too wont it be delightful to have them it will add ever so much to the life of the post said mrs turner with visions of hops and parties innumerable flitting through her pretty head it was a week since the th had broken camp and marched away already they were far across the platte and up out of reach of all telegraphic communication somewhere among the breaks of the south cheyenne and right in among the bands now known to be hurrying day and night northwestward to join the hordes of sitting bull captain turner had been unusually grave in parting with his wife but that blissfully constituted matron had shed few tears she was philosophic and sensible beyond question what good was there in borrowing trouble didnt the captain have to go time and again just the same way in arizona and didnt he always come back safely of course poor captain tanner and captain squires and mr clay and mr walters and others had been killed and lots of them were wounded at one time or another but heavens if one had to go into deep mourning every time a husband had to take the field there would be no living in the cavalry at all mrs turner was unquestionably sensible and far be it from our intention to upbraid her ladies there were in the th who spent several days in prayers and tears after they had seen the last of the guidons as they fluttered away over the divide towards lodge pole and with these afflicted ones mrs whaling the commanding officers lady would fain have lavished hours of time in sympathizing converse she loved the melodramatic and was never so happy said blake as when bathed in tears detractors of this estimable woman indeed were wont to complain that she was too easily content with these pearly but insufficient aids to lavatory process and her propensity for adhering for weeks at a time to an ancient black silk which had seen service all over the western frontier gave sombre color to the statement the few ladies of the th who had come to russell for the summer were hardly settled in their new quarters when the regiment was hurried away and from one house to another had mrs whaling flitted a substantial and seemingly wellfed matron in appearance and one whose eccentricities of costume and toilet were attributable no doubt to a largeness of nature which rendered all care for personal appearance subordinate to the claims of afflicted humanity all the ladies had gracefully accepted her proffered sympathy and some had warmly thanked her for the wellmeant attentions but mrs turner was completely nonplussed by the good ladys offer to come and pray with her and it must be allowed that mrs whalings visit of condolence had been productive of far more comfort to mrs turner than was expected and in a far different way for that volatile young matron rushed in upon mrs stannard late in the afternoon choking with laughter to describe her sensations in striving to be proper and decorous until the venerable black silk had whisked itself off out of hearing three days after the th had gone the band arrived from hays mr billings had spent two days at the post in seeing his men comfortably established and in turning over property to the infantry officer designated to be post adjutant and then he had taken stage to laramie and gone in chase that evening after the band had played delightfully an hour or two on the parade the officers suggested an informal dance their own ladies went readily and mrs turner decided to go and see the hoproom and once there it seemed so poky to come away without a waltz or two the floor was lovely so much better than ours at hays and really several of the garrison officers danced remarkably well so we infer mrs turner had satisfied herself by personal experiment on that score very properly the informal hops became regular features of the garrison life and several ladies of the th grasswidowed for the summer were speedily induced to join in these modulated gayeties what with the band the influx of some half a dozen new ladies and the constant arrival of officers en route to the front the garrison not unnaturally remarked that russell was jollier now that the th had gone than it was before and now mrs truscott and the very interesting miss sanford were coming this was indeed news they were to take quarters next to the stannards and be mrs stannards guests until the furniture arrived and all was made ready for them truscotts troop with webbs was coming along by rail fast as they could travel in the heavy freighttrains to which they were assigned and the ladies mrs webb included were being escorted on the express direct to cheyenne by lieutenant gleason who had joined the party as they passed through kansas city and who had doubtless made himself especially agreeable to the young and lovely mrs truscott of whom he had heard so much and to her friend the heiress from new jersey these were details of which mrs turner was in ignorance when she came in to surprise mrs stannard with the news and after her first astonishment mrs turners sensations were not those of unmixed delight a whole day it seemed had the majors wife been in possession of the tidings and had not imparted them to her this was indicative of one of two things either mrs stannard was so reticent that she did not care to tell anybody or else she had told others and kept it from her from her who believed that she had made a most favorable impression on this charming and popular lady of whom all men and most women spoke so admiringly mrs turners face betrayed her mental perturbation and mrs stannard was quick to divine the cause in genuine kindness of heart she came promptly to the relief of her pretty friend without being in the least blind to her frivolities mrs stannard saw much that was attractive and pleasant in mrs turner she was vastly entertained by her and enjoyed studying her as she would a graceful statue or a finished picture beneath the surface she had no desire to penetrate warm friends and loving friends she had in troops and women of mrs turners mental calibre were sources of infinite though quiet entertainment she enjoyed their presence was cordial kindly even laughingly familiar yet always guarded mrs stannards most pronounced characteristic was consummate discretion she knew whom to trust and others might labor in vain to extract from her the faintest hint that repeated carelessly or maliciously would wound or injure a friend but here was a thing all the world might know truscotts telegram had reached her the evening before saying that the three ladies escorted by lieutenant gleason would arrive at such a time and that mrs truscott and miss sanford would gladly accept her offer the average woman could hardly restrain herself from going out and seeking some one to whom to tell the interesting news few pleasures in life are keener than the bliss of being able to convey unexpected tidings when they are welcome but mrs stannard knew that the ladies of the regiment with whom she felt at all intimate were over at the hoproom she had all a womans eagerness to tell the news but she was loyal to the th and would not even in so little a thing let others be the bearers that mrs stannard was a woman capable of deeds of heroism we deduce from the simple fact that she went to bed that night without having breathed the story to a soul she had a strong impulse to tell her cook and housemaid old and reliable followers of her fortunes but she well knew that those amiable domestics would be clattering up and down the back yards all the evening and the news would surprise nobody when she came to tell it next day she was too true a woman to want to part with such a pleasure then she had ah must it be confessed a little mischievous desire of her own to see how mrs turner would take it for those who knew mrs turner best were given to the belief that she would far rather have the attention of the masculine element of the garrison concentrated upon herself than shared with such undoubted rivals as these would be and so with perfect truth mrs stannards reassurance took the form of these words you see i could not make up my mind to let any one know until i had told you and ive been expecting you all the morning and mrs turner was charmed but said mrs stannard tell me how you heard it i thought no one knew it but myself oh mr gleason telegraphed as a matter of course to announce that he was escorting these ladies it was quite a feather in his cap to be able to show the commanding officer here that captain truscott intrusts to him the duty of guarding anything so precious when you get to know mr gleason better youll appreciate that said mrs turner with a pout captain turner cant bear him and dislikes to have me notice him at all and what i wonder at is his escorting them why is he not with his company and where is mr ray if the board has adjourned i should suppose that mr gleason would be on duty with his men he is truscotts first lieutenant you know and that mr ray would be rushing through to catch his company why isnt he escorting them i wonder perhaps captain truscott had reasons of his own for not permitting that ray was smitten with her i dont care what mrs raymond says have you heard where mr ray is not a word i wish i knew said mrs stannard wistfully have you have you heard anything about his being in any trouble in anything likely to keep him from going with the regiment asked mrs turner hesitatingly yet watching closely mrs stannards face nothing in the least that is anything more than a very improbable story and one that i have too little faith in to repeat tell me what news you have from the captain and mrs turner knew twas useless to ask questions she hurried through her visit and tripped eagerly away up the row to carry the news throughout the garrison meeting mrs whaling coming down and the latter had the start and so before the setting of a second sun grace truscott was once more in garrison and miss sanford with quietly observant eyes was forming her first impressions of army life in the far west and welcoming with sweet and gracious manner the ladies who could not resist their hospitable impulse to gather on mrs stannards piazza and greet the newcomers as soon as they had removed the dust and cinders of railway travel and in the bewildering freshness of their new york costumes reappeared on the parlor floor that evening of course they held quite a levee the band played delightfully upon the parade welcoming back to the frontier the colonels daughter and wishing many of them that old catnip too had come for he was very thoughtful and kind to his men and they were realizing that it is no fun to be musicians for somebody elses regiment many officers and ladies called and mrs stannards pleasant parlor was filled from early until late one man appeared there before anybody else accepted an invitation to join them at dinner and stayed until after eleven this was mr gleason the sunshine of mrs stannards bonny face was something the th were prone to speak of very often perhaps too often to suit other ladies whose visages on the domestic side were not infrequently clouded just as it is an unsafe thing to speak in presence of some mothers of the grace or beauty or behavior of other children than their own so it is simply idiotic to talk of mrs soandsos sweet manners or sweeter face to mrs vinaigre who is said at times to be snappish it may be far from your intention to institute comparisons or to refer by inference to graces which are lacking in the lady to whom you speak but there is nothing surer in life than that you get the credit of it in the fullest sense and that most unwittingly you have affronted a woman in a way the meekest christian of her sex will find it hard to forgive she will never forget it mrs stannards smile was sweetness itself her eyes smiled quite as much as her mouth and her very soul seemed to beam through the winsome winning beauty of her face all the young officers looked up to her with something akin to worship all the elders spoke of mrs stannard as the perfection of an army wife even her closest friends and acquaintances could find no one trait to speak of openly as a fault the nearest approach to such a thing was mrs turners exasperated and petulant outbreak when her patient lord had ventured in presence of several of her coterie to speak once too often of that lovely smile merciful powers captain turner any woman with mrs stannards teeth could afford to smile from morning till night but its all teeth but even mrs turner knew better it was a smile born of genuine goodness of charity of lovingkindness and of a spiritual grace that made mrs stannard marked among her associates in all the regiment no woman was so looked up to and loved as she grace truscott had known her well by reputation though this was their first meeting it seemed not a little strange to miss sanford that they should be going thus suddenly and unceremoniously to be the guests of a lady whom neither of them had ever seen but tis the way we have in the army was the laughing response when she ventured to speak of it and any hesitancy or embarrassment she might have felt vanished at the instant when their hostess appeared on the piazza and both her hands were outstretched in welcome did you ever see a lovelier expression in a womans face was her first impulsive exclamation when she and grace were shown to their rooms yet once her guests were upstairs and out of the way mrs stannards brow clouded not a little as she descended to the piazza where she had left mr gleason superintending the unloading of trunks boxes and other baggage and giving directions about the distribution of this thing or that quite as though one of the family she had never liked him the major cordially hated him she knew that captain truscott could not possibly feel any friendship for such a man and yet here he was the escort of mrs truscott and miss sanford on their journey they were her guests and therefore she had to be unusually civil to him one or two officers came up to speak to him as he stood at the little gate and the post adjutant invited him to send his traps to his quarters where a room was ready gleason looked around at mrs stannard and remarked well im much obliged but you see im rather bound as yet to our ladies and plainly intimated that he hoped mrs stannard would offer him the spare room on the parlor floor but mrs stannard did nothing of the kind and not very gracefully he availed himself of the young infantrymans courtesy the baggage was all in by this time and there was no need of his prolonging his stay mrs stannard of course announced that they expected the pleasure of his company at dinner at six and asked him to come in and rest unless he preferred to go at once and dress gleason concluded it best to go but in the hearing and presence of the garrison officers who were standing near begged mrs stannard to explain to the ladies that he had to report to the commanding officer and would she please say to miss sanford that he would call at five what could that mean was mrs stannards vexed inquiry of her inner consciousness was the widower bent on making the most of his time in an endeavor to fascinate the eastern belle the ladies were hardly dressed when he reappeared and was urging miss sanford to come out with him for a brief stroll to see the mountain prairie and take a whiff of wyoming breezes when the appearance of mrs turner and others who had just happened by but hearing their voices could not resist rushing in to welcome mrs truscott etc etc put an end to the possibility it was a comfort to note that though perfectly courteous and pleasant in her manner even to the extent of that indefinable yet perceptible half intimacy which exists between travelling companions miss sanford seemed in no wise encouraging and by no means displeased at the interruption to the plan so audaciously proposed at dinner mr gleason sat opposite the young lady and was therefore obliged to talk much with mrs stannard after dinner he promptly established himself by miss sanfords side showing her albums full of photographs of the officers a collection the major and his wife had been making for years and one in which they took great delight gleason knew most of them and it enabled him to be very entertaining as he could tell some anecdote or incident connected with so many but the early coming of visitors broke in upon his monopoly yet could not wholly drive him from her side it was observed by every man and woman who came in that evening how assiduous was gleason in his attentions more than that there was something about them that can best be described by the word possessive it seemed as though he had studied the art of behaving as though he felt that every look and word was welcome to her mrs stannard was secretly exasperated mrs truscott who knew nothing of him until their westward journey was only vaguely annoyed but no one could tell from her manner what miss sanford thought it was after eleven when the last of the visitors withdrew and still he lingered once more miss sanford stood by the centretable and bent over one of the albums she turned rapidly over the pages until she reached a cabinet picture of a darkeyed darkhaired trimbuilt young officer in cavalry undress uniform you did not tell me who this was mr gleason that oh that is mr ray of our regiment was the reply in a tone lacklustre of all interest mr ray where let me see exclaimed mrs truscott coming quickly to them oh isnt that perfect when did you get it mrs stannard how mean of him not to send us one it was taken in denver this spring said mrs stannard the major says its the only picture he has ever seen of mr ray and it is as good as one can be that doesnt represent him in the saddle you know we think him the best rider in the th we ladies that is she added knowing this to be one of gleasons weak points mr gleason made no remark what became of the other members of the board mr gleason she continued i expected to see captain buxton and mr ray oh they gave us all ten days delay in joining so as to say goodby to friends you know buxton stopped to see his wifes family at leavenworth but hell be through here in a day or two then came a pause and where is mr ray i supposed that he would be off like a shot there was an unmistakable sneer on mr gleasons face though the reply was vague and hesitating yes ray made no end of fuss about getting off until the orders came since then i havent heard much that is i havent seen anything of him he couldnt well get to the regiment without going through here could he no but he hasnt gone and he wont be going in any great hurry it was evident to mrs stannard that gleason was striving to be questioned whatever he knew he was ready to tell provided some one would ask mrs truscott and miss sanford stood silently by still looking at the photograph when mrs stannard again spoke well mr ray was never behind in any previous campaign and ill venture to predict he isnt far behind now now mr gleason im going to send you home for these ladies are tired out with their long journey he would fain have put in another word about ray but she was vigilant and checked him he hoped for an invitation to breakfast but it did not come he plead with languishing eyes for a few moments more at the side of the lady he desired to fascinate but miss sanford was still looking at the photographs and would not return his glance go he had to and it was plain to him that in striving to belittle ray he had damaged his own cause it made him bitterer still as he strode through the darkness down to the beaconlights of the store gleason drank more and talked more before he went to bed than was good for him but no seed is so easily sown as that of slander chapter ix ray to the front it has been said that major stannard told his wife that he proposed going down to camp hunting up mr wilkins and getting from him flatfooted the authority he had for his insinuations at mr rays expense the day before the regiment marched for the black hills the major went as he proposed but at the very moment he reached camp the object of his search was unpacking mrs wilkinss trunks up in the garrison stannard left word with the officer of the day that he wanted to see mr wilkins on important business right after retreat sunset rollcall and wilkins was quick to divine that the major had already heard of his mornings mischief at the store he stood in awe of the battalion commander and knew well that when it came to a face to face encounter with him there could be no dodging he must swallow his words or give his authority wilkins therefore had important business of his own or his able wifes devising which kept him from going to camp during the evening and stannard being only the major could not order him thither in the face of the colonels permission to be absent he trudged back across the prairie in no amiable mood therefore and swore in stalwart anglosaxon to captain merrill that he would bring wilkins to the scratch if he had to go to his quarters to do it they looked in at the store and wilkins wasnt there so together they walked up the row until they came to the cottage into which the lares and penates of the wilkins family had so recently been carried and mrs wilkins herself met them at the door she was afraid of nobody and had doubtless been requested he never directed by her husband to see who was knocking now mrs wilkins was as fond of major stannard as her husband was afraid of him she liked his blunt sturdy unaffected ways and many a time and oft she had held him up to her submissive lord as the sort of soldier he ought to be she knew nothing of the affair at the store as yet and wilkins was afraid to tell her with her keen insight she had long since discovered that her husbands associates and intimates in the regiment were not the strong or the good men and she had warned him at sandy that whatever he might have against such men as truscott or ray he had better stamp it out and seek to reestablish himself in their good opinion such men as gleason with whom he consorted would soon get him into trouble poor wilkins heard the majors blunt salutation at the door and his wifes cordial invitation to walk in but the major declined with thanks ask mr wilkins to come out here on the piazza please i want to see him on business was his request and when mrs wilkins came puffing upstairs supplementing the message with a hurry now the major isnt the man for you to keep waiting the hapless veteran wished himself anywhere out of wyoming but down he went with rather a hangdog look stannard had met him with unexpected kindness of manner im worried about the story told of ray mr wilkins and ive come to get the authority from you of course you must have had something to base such statements upon and being fairly cornered wilkins said his informant was gleason being asked to show the letter wilkins declared that he had burned it and would never have alluded to it but for blakes manner which he declared had goaded him into the remarks then he told stannard that gleason wrote in so many words that ray was with rallston night and day and intimated that the latter kept him at cards and wine most of the time and that if some scandal did not result when it came to paying for the horses he would be surprised still he could not quote the language but he gave his impressions stannard had called merrill to witness the statement then giving wilkins injunctions to say nothing more to anybody on the subject and pledging merrill to reticence he had gone home written brief and hurried letters to ray and to gleason told his wife that he had heard the stories and that until ray had a chance to explain would regard them as baseless rumors or at the worst as exaggerations for which gleason was responsible then he had slept the sleep of the just until the corporal of the guard came banging at the door at four am to say the reveille had sounded out in camp two hours later he had jogged away at the head of his battalion mr gleasons complacent acceptance of her reluctant invitation and his evident expectation of more to come were matters that therefore annoyed mrs stannard not a little she knew well that her husband had written him an angry letter demanding that he either withdraw or substantiate the allegations he had made at the expense of mr ray but she had not been told what those allegations were she felt certain that the letter had reached mr gleason for it was sent to the care of the commanding officer at hays yet here was the lieutenant himself beaming with effusive cordiality she felt more than certain that were luce at the post mr gleason would by no means be seeking to make himself at home in his quarters but luce with the eight companies of the th was out of reach gleason was striving to make himself at home with her and her guests and as far as the latter were concerned he had the sanction and apparent approval of captain truscott whose name he incessantly quoted as though the terms of intimacy between them were already established beyond peradventure truscott paid me one of the highest compliments i ever remember having received said mr gleason to the three ladies at dinner and mr gleason was a man who was always receiving compliments of one kind or another if one could accept his statements he said that he had never seen the troop look so well as when i turned it over to him at wallace now as he had arrived at wallace on the same train with the truscotts and did not turn over anything connected with the troop but the property returns anybody acquainted with such matters would have known that truscotts commendation if bestowed at all was probably given to the junior lieutenant who had put the troop in handsome shape during the absence of mr gleason on the horse board but what gleason aimed at was to make an impression on miss sanfords mind since she could not be expected to know the intricacies of such matters mrs stannard would have been glad to correct the impression but could not in courtesy to her guests and so she remained silent she meant however to discourage his visits in future but he was too old a practitioner for her simple methods she had slipped into the kitchen to see how nice a breakfast was being prepared for her guests the following morning and in that brief absence he had appeared at the open doorway to urge the ladies to come out and see guard mounting they were just down the air was delicious out on the piazza the band was inspiring so what more natural than that mrs truscott and miss sanford should make their first appearance that morning escorted by the obnoxious gleason when mrs stannard came back from the kitchen they were all on the piazza and others were strolling up the walk to join them after the spirited little parade was over and the infantry officers had to go to the presence of their commander gleason lingered he had no duties as yet and how could she avoid it ladies mrs stannard had to ask him if he had breakfasted when the maid came to announce that breakfast was served he had but it was easy for gleason to say that he had merely sipped a cup of coffee and to insure the invitation he intended to extract after breakfast she had her household duties to attend to mrs truscott had unpacking and other matters to look after miss sanford felt that some one ought to entertain their late escort and the duty fell to her garrison people who called that morning were edified by finding mr gleason and miss sanford tкteаtкte in the parlor despite mrs stannards efforts mrs turner was promptly on hand so were other ladies and that they made certain inferences at the time and compared notes later in the day is perhaps supererogation to state on one pretext or another there was not an hour during that morning in which mr gleason failed to appear at major stannards quarters and by two pm at which hour there was a gathering at the adjutants office to await the distribution of the mail it is not to be wondered at that one of colonel whalings officers remarked to another that the cavalry seemed to have the inside track if there was to be any race for the jersey belle and that others looked knowing when gleason appeared to inquire if any letters had come for the ladies at major stannards there was no necessity whatever for his going mrs stannard protested the orderly would bring the mail in five minutes if anything had come but gleason said that the orderly would have to stop in two or three houses before he got there and he knew mrs truscott was impatient and so she was in a minute he was back with letters for all three but miss sanfords was a mere note in reply to an order she had sent east and while mrs stannard and mrs truscott retired to read the long letters that had come from their respective lords once more miss sanford found herself entertaining the assiduous gleason she was beginning to think army life distasteful determined to break up this monopoly the majors wife came speedily again to the parlor something she had read in her husbands letter had fired her with resentment against gleason and nerved her to resolute measures not a word of reply have i had from ray wrote stannard nor has gleason yet answered though i know the letter was delivered to him in conversation with billings last night he admitted that he too had heard that ray had been playing fast and loose at kansas city and when i asked him how it was brought to him he replied that wayne told him and wayne had a letter from gleason i wish billings and ray could have seen more of each other this spring there is some feeling between them which i cannot fathom and do not understand it will disappear when ray joins us for billings cannot help admiring his energy and usefulness in actual campaign as yet nothing of great interest has occurred but everything points to wild excitement at the reservations we are camping tonight at the cardinals chair up on the niobrara and march northward tomorrow by way of old woman fork to the mini pusa general sheridans orders are to hide in the valley of the south cheyenne and keep a sharp watch on the trails crossing northwestward and be ready to strike any and all parties of hostiles going up from the reservations on white river of course here will be sharp work we have had two rushes already for the sioux have warparties out robbing stock and running off horses from far south of the platte and a big band swept down the chug water within fortyfive miles of you the very day we left lodge pole k went forward in pursuit but they had too big a start this letter goes by courier to laramie tonight expect nothing more now for a week as even the black hills stages have quit running the indians have driven off every white man between the platte and the yellowstone except those in the black hills settlements and they are practically isolated it was rumored that webb and truscott would be ordered forward to join us and i suppose buxton and ray will take that opportunity of joining their companies should mr gleason stay any time near russell he will doubtless be inclined to cultivate the ladies from wallace mrs truscott and miss sanford especially if i could have seen truscott or foreseen the plan it would have been easy to prevent it as i could not do either you must give him few opportunities of visiting them at our house they will be in their own though by the time he comes they were not however as we have seen the major had not contemplated the possibility of gleasons taking a ten days delay before reporting for duty and so having ample time in which to ingratiate himself with the ladies what he would have said in his own vigorous english could he have seen the lieutenant leaning over miss sanfords shoulder as she sat at the table once more looking through the cavalry album will not bear recording in these pages as mrs stannard herself glanced in from the hallway she more than wished that luce were home if only to hear her lion growl she thought anxiously of him and of the situation of affairs in the indian country only a hundred miles to the north she dreaded to tell mrs truscott of the regiments prospects for immediate action but she determined to try some expedient to rid miss sanford and the house of the presence of mr gleason her air was brisk and determined therefore as she entered the parlor the major writes me from the niobrara crossing that the regiment has had some sharp chasing to do already and that they will be across the trails in two days when they will certainly have fighting she said looking intently at mr gleason what news do you get well my mail has all gone on to wallace you see mrs stannard explained he unwilling to admit in the presence of the ladies that nobody in the regiment cared enough for him to write it will all be up tomorrow or next day i presume and by that time the troops will be here and ill be myself again the real cavalryman miss sanford is like a fish out of water if separated more than a day from his horse i long to be in saddle again he added with a complacent glance at the tall wellproportioned figure reflected in the mirror gleason prided himself and not without reason on his manly build and was incessantly finding some means of calling attention to it if the majors views are correct you will have abundant cavalry duty this summer mr gleason said mrs stannard and i was about to ask you if you heard nothing at the office if none of the garrison officers had letters or news from the front she hoped he would offer to go and inquire in person as he had gone for the mail but gleason preferred to have the officers suppose that he was in full possession of news which would not be sent to them going for the ladies letters implied certain authority from them certain intimacy in the household going to inquire for news on the contrary implied lack of information and it was his rфle to play that the th kept him fully posted his reply was therefore brief and he quickly changed the subject there was no news that i heard of mrs stannard but i will go and see colonel whaling after he has had time to read all his mail miss sanford was just asking me something about mr stryker she was admiring his photograph bring the album out on the piazza it is lovely and bright there now and the wind is not blowing for a wonder i think we will all be better for fresh air and mrs truscott will be down in a moment mrs stannard spoke decidedly and he had no course but to obey even though he did not see the grateful look in miss sanfords eyes he much preferred the confidential flavor which was possessed by a parlor interview but there was no help for it following the lead of his hostess he stepped out upon the piazza just as mrs truscott bright animated and happy came fluttering down the stairs waving the captains letter miss sanford glanced up at her bonny face and smiled sympathetically no need to ask you is all well gracie no indeed jack writes that they will be in camp close beside us tomorrow morning oh listen theres the band and that is the very quickstep he used to love so much at the point and fairly dancing in her happiness she threw her arm around marions waist and together they appeared at the threshold a lovely picture as the capdoffing group of officers thought to a man half a dozen of these gentry were lolling at the gate the broad walk was already alive with graceful forms in summer dresses with playful children and sedate nursemaids trundling the inevitable babycarriage the band had just taken possession of its circular stand out on the parade a few carriages and buggies had driven out from town it was a lovely june saturday afternoon the hebdomadal half holiday of the military bailiwick and the dingy brown frontier fort looked merry as sunshine music and sweet faces could make it seeing the ladies upon the piazza there was a general movement among the officers on the walk indicative of a desire to join the party and mr gleason gritted his teeth and went for more chairs mrs turner had appeared on her own gallery just before possibly with the intention of starting a rival levee and one or two youthful moths were fluttering about her candle already she was not averse to a flirtation ordinarily but it did not look well to see her sitting with only one or two of the infantry subalterns when mrs stannards piazza was filled she wisely determined to join the majority smilingly transferred herself and escort thither and was as smilingly welcomed there must have been a dozen in the group officers and ladies when the commanding officers orderly entered the gate saluted mr gleason and said colonel whalings compliments sir and could you tell him when lieutenant ray will be here the ladies looked up in surprise the officers all of whom remembered the name in connection with what had been said by messrs crane wilkins and gleason himself listened for his reply gleason was quick to note the silence and to divine its cause give my compliments to the colonel and say that i do not know i have not seen or heard rather i have not seen mr ray since leaving kansas city he replied for a moment no one spoke then as the orderly walked away mrs stannard coloring slightly turned full upon the lieutenant mr gleason it seems strange that you should know nothing of mr rays movements you are generally well informed and the major writes me how pleasantly they are looking forward to rays coming you know that out in the regiment they expect him by pony express she laughingly said for the benefit of her silent auditors gleason well divined her object it was to convey to the garrison officers that ray was popular among his comrades at the front however he might be regarded by those at the rear he had already committed himself in presence of several of those now in the party and he answered im afraid some people will be disappointed then to begin with there is no way of his reaching the regiment until truscott and webb go up with their companies he could get no farther than laramie by stage even were he here to try but he isnt here and he isnt likely to be either will you tell me why asked mrs stannard paling now but looking fixedly at him with a gleam in her blue eyes that made him wince well id rather not go into particulars he muttered looking uneasily around is it illness mr gleason no i dont know that it is then for one i feel confident that he will be here in abundant time to go by first opportunity she said with quiet meaning who may this swell be languidly remarked one of the officers looking down the road towards the gate all eyes followed his in an instant speeding at easy lope upon a spirited sorrel a horseman came jauntily up the row the erect carriage the perfect seat the ease and grace with which his lithe form swayed with every motion of his steed all present could see at a glance mrs stannard rose quickly to her feet her gaze becoming eager then joyous look she almost cried its mr ray himself in another minute throwing himself lightly from the saddle and tossing the reins to a statuesque orderly the horseman came beaming through the gate and mrs stannard to miss sanfords mingled amaze and approbation was warmly grasping both his hands in hers mrs truscott blushing brightly and showing welcome and pleasure in her lovely eyes but with the reserve of younger wifehood had held forth one little hand then she heard the voluble gush with which mrs turner precipitated herself upon him and while he remained captive as he had to in that fair matrons hands laughingly answering her thronging questions marion sanford had her first look at the young officer who had been the subject of such varying report first impressions are ever strong and what she saw was this a lithe deepchested squareshouldered young fellow with nerve and spring in every motion standing bareheaded before them with the sunlight dancing on his closecropped hair and shapely head his eyes were dark and heavily shaded with thick brows and long curling lashes but the eyes brightened with every laughing word were full of life and health and straightforwardness and fun she could not but note how clear and brave and wideopen they were despite the little wrinkles gathered at the corners and a faint shading underneath his forehead what could be seen of it when he tossed aside the dark wavy bang that fell almost as low as her own was white and smooth but temples cheeks the smoothshaven jaws and the round powerful throat were bronzed and tanned by sun and wind and his white teeth gleamed all the whiter through the shading of the thick curling dark moustache and the lips that laughed so merrily were soft and pink as any womans might be at least they were when he bowed and smiled and spoke her name when introduced to her and when he nodded companionably to the bowing group of officers to whom mrs stannard presented him with marked pride mr ray of ours but how for a second his eye flashed and how rigid a spasm crossed his lips when gleasons name was mentioned to him he merely nodded and instantly turned his back all this and more miss sanford noted by that electric process which was known to women long before lightning was photographed and enabled the sex to see in a quartersecond intricate details of feminine costume that it would take the nimblest tongue ten minutes to describe she noticed his dress so unlike the precise attire of his comrades who wore to the uttermost detail the regulation uniform he had tossed a broadbrimmed lightcolored scouting hat upon the little grass plat as he entered and now stood before them in the field rig he so well adorned a darkblue doublebreasted broadcollared flannel shirt tucked in at the waist in snuglyfitting breeches of indiantanned buckskin while sioux leggings encased his legs from knee to ankle and his feet were shod substantially in alligatorskin mexican spurs were at his heels a broad leather belt bristling with cartridges and supporting knife and revolver hung at his waist a red silk handkerchief was loosely knotted at his throat and soft brown gauntlets covered his hands until they were discarded as he greeted them if ever man looked the picture of elastic health and vigor it was mr ray this then was something like the cavalry life of which she had heard so much marion sanford despite eastern education and refinement was so unconventional as to find something more attractive in mr ray in this same field rig than in mr gleason in faultlessly accurate uniform why mr ray how very well you look was mrs turners exclamation and somebody said you had been ill i no indeed i never felt better in my life but where have you been when did you come why didnt you write were some among the countless questions thrust upon him i had a few days delay you know came by way of omaha to see my sister just arrived at one today left my trunks with the quartermaster at the depot got into field rig in fifteen minutes packed my saddlebags and slung them on dandy who has been waiting for me ever since the regiment marched galloped out here to say goodby to you and in half an hour ill be off for laramie why mr ray what can be the hurry why start this evening why not he laughed dandy and i can reach the chug and put up with old phillipse tonight and gallop on to laramie tomorrow once there it wont take me long to find my way out to the regiment why the whole country is full of indians expostulated mrs stannard the major writes in this very letter that no one ventures north of the platte how did the letter come in then and how is communication kept up asked the lieutenant showing his white teeth in his amusement oh couriers of course but they are halfbreeds and have lived all their life in that country well i can wriggle through if they can one thing is certain it wont be for lack of trying so whatever you may have to send to the major get ready the lightning express leaves at i must go and report my movements to the commanding officer and then will come back to you is the adjutant here he asked looking around at the party of infantrymen who were standing waiting for a chance to excuse themselves and leave the ladies to the undisputed possession of their evident favorite mr warner bowed at your service mr ray will you come and present me to the colonel i will be back in ten minutes mrs stannard and mrs truscott remember it is over a year since i saw you last and you gave me good luck the last time i went out scouting with that and a general bow by way of parting courtesy mr ray took himself and the post adjutant off for a moment there was silence everybody gazed after him except gleason isnt that just too characteristic of mr ray for anything exclaimed mrs turner i wonder if any other officer would be in such a hurry to risk his scalp in chasing the regiment you wouldnt would you mr gleason she added with the deliberate and mischievous impertinence she knew would sting and meant should sting and felt serenely confident that her victim could not resent he flushed hotly my duties are with my troop mrs turner and mr rays with his when my troop goes i go with it when his went he didnt thats all there is to it but he couldnt go mr gleason as you well know replied mrs turner and evidently mrs stannard too was eager to ask him what he had to say now about mr rays staying behind to tell the truth he was more dismayed by rays appearance than he dare admit even to himself he was startled he had grave reason for not wanting to meet him again and as the officers were scattering he seized a pretext called to one of them that he wished to speak with him a moment and hurried away when ray returned from the colonels quarters he had the field to himself and that they might have him their regimental possession to themselves mrs stannard begged the younger ladies to usher him into the parlor where they could be secure against interruption until he had to start gleasons business with his infantry friend was of slight moment apparently as he speedily left him and wended his way to the quarters of the commanding officer old colonel whaling was just coming forth and they met at the gate you sent me an inquiry a few moments ago sir which i could not answer at the time said the lieutenant in his blandest manner i see that mr ray has arrived to speak for himself may i ask if he was wanted for anything especial and gleason looked very closely into the grizzled features of the commandant some letters for him had been sent with my mail and a telegram i inferred that he must be coming and thought you might know rather a spirited young fellow he seems to be i was quite startled at his notion of riding alone in search of the regiment how soon does he start i see his horse there yet he spoke of going in a few moments sir you see we have been so much accustomed to this sort of thing in arizona that there is nothing unusual in it to us still i hardly expected mr ray would be going or rather there were some matters which he left unsettled that i supposed would prevent his going you didnt happen to notice where his letters were from i suppose asked the lieutenant tentatively the colonel would have colored had he been younger but his grizzled old face had long since lost its capacity for blushing he felt that it grew hot however and gleasons insinuation cut as gleason knew it would old whaling was morbidly inquisitive as to the correspondence of his officers and could rarely resist the temptation of studying postmarks seals superscription and general features of all letters that came through his hands not not especially he stammered gleason saw his advantage and pursued it he spoke with all apparent hesitancy and proper regret i feared that he might have been recalled or his going arrested by orders from division headquarters or from fort leavenworth some things with regard to the purchase of one lot of horses of which i disapproved were being looked into when i came away and whenwell colonel it is against the rule of our regiment to talk to outsiders of one another like ahem was old whalings muttered comment as he recalled what he had heard of gleasons revelations at the store and i would not allude to this but that as commanding officer you will be sure to hear of it all you see the principal dealer with whom we did business is a brotherinlaw of mr rays a fellow named rallston and some of his horses wouldnt pass muster anywhere but well ray was with him day after day and kept aloof from buxton and myself and there was some money transaction between them and theres been a row at the last moment rallston came to me to complain that he had been cheated and what im afraid of is that ray promised to secure the acceptance of a lot of worthless horses by the board for some five hundred dollars cash advanced him by rallston he was hot about it and swore he would bring matters to general sheridans notice instantly that is what made me so guarded in the reply i sent you i owe you this explanation colonel but trust you will consider it confidential whaling looked greatly discomposed but unquestionably interested he eyed gleason sharply and took it all in without a word i thought some of his letters might have been from leavenworth said gleason after a pause one of them was that is i think i saw the office mark but nothing official has reached me on the matter im sorry to hear it very for both your colonel and major stannard spoke in highest terms of mr ray when they were here oh ray has done good service and all that sort of thing but when a fellow of his age gets going downhill with debts and drinking and cards well you know how it has been in your own regiment colonel he dont look like a drinking man said the colonel i never saw clearer eyes or complexion in any fellow yees he looks unusually well just now and just at that moment as they stood there talking of him mrs stannards door opened and he came forth the three ladies following he did look well more than well as he turned with extended hand to say goodby dandy his lithelimbed sorrel pricked up his dainty pointed ears and whinnied eagerly as he heard his step on the piazza giving himself a shake that threatened the dislocation of his burden of blankets canteen and saddlebags the ladies surrounded him at the gate mrs stannards kind blue eyes were moistening how often had she said goodby to the young fellows starting out as buoyantly as ray today thinking as she did so of the mothers and sisters at home how often had it happened that they came back maimed pallid suffering or not at all she had always liked ray he was so frank so loyal so true and more than ever she liked now to show her friendship and regard since he had been slandered mrs truscott and miss sanford stood with arms entwined about each others waist the sweetest and best of them have that innate inevitable coquetry and mrs stannard bent forward to rearrange the silken knot at his throat giving it an approving pat as she surveyed the improvement ray smiled his thanks do you remember the night at sandy mrs truscott the last scout we started out on and how you came to see us off and wish me good luck as well as though it were only yesterday she answered we had good luck it was one of the best scouts ever made from sandy and the apaches caught it heavily it was a success all through except our our losing tanner and kerrigan jacks hit was to be envied she shuddered and drew closer to miss sanfords side oh mr ray i cannot bear to think of that fight i wont wish you good luck again you always expect it to mean unlimited meetings with the indians i pray you may not see one then i appeal to you miss sanford shall i confess that your name is one i have envied for the last five years no dont be amazed we kentuckians always associate it now with two of our grandest horses monarchist and harry bassett why im going to ride the old sanford colors myself this summer see the dark blue he laughed pointing to his breast then you should be among the first coming home she answered brightly and that isnt your custom im told but in this case the whole regiment will be wearing the dark blue so there will be no distinction i wont beg for a ribbon its bad luck i stole the tassel of miss pelhams fan in arizona and wore it on the next dash we never saw an indian and she married a fellow who stayed at home all the same miss sanford if you hear of the th doing anything especially lively this summer remember that one fellow in the crowd rides his best to win for the sake of your colors au revoir come dandy you scamp now for a scamper to the chug he sprang lightly into saddle waved his hat to them then bent low as by sudden impulse and held out his hand god bless you mrs stannard he said and looking at her in half surprise they saw her eyes were brimming with tears another moment and he had turned dandys head to the west and was tripping up the road past the adjutants office they saw him raise his gauntleted hand in salute to the post commander and heard his voice call out ringingly goodday colonel they saw that between him and mr gleason no sign of recognition passed and they stood in silence watching him until turning out at the west gate he struck a lope and disappeared behind the band quarters out on the open prairie when mr gleason touched his cap to the colonel and started to rejoin the ladies they saw him coming nobody said a word but the three ladies reentered the house mrs truscott last but it was mrs stannard who turned back in the hall and shut the door when gleason reached the front gate he concluded not to enter but went on down the row chapter x a june sunday it is a cloudless sunday morning the longest sunday in that month of longest days warm balmy rosebearing june only a few hours high is the blazing god of day but his beams beat fiercely down on a landscape wellnigh as arid as the arizona our troopers knew so well not a breath of air is stirring down in the shallow valley to the right where the cottonwoods are blistering beside the sandy streambed a faint column of smoke rises straight as the stem of a pinetree until it melts into indistinguishable air the sandy waste goes twisting and turning in its fringe of timber southeastward along a broad depression in the face of the land until twenty odd miles away it seems brought up standing by a barrier of rugged hills that dip into the bare surface at the south and go rising and falling rolling and tumbling higher and raggeder to the north all the intervening stretches are bare tawny sunscorched except those fringing cottonwoods all those tumbling heights are dark and frowning through their beards of gloomy larch and pine black they stand against the eastern sky from the jagged summits at the south to where the northernmost peak the inyan kara the heenghakaaga of the sioux stands sentinel over the sisterhood slumbering at her feet these are the black hills of dakota as we see them from the breaks of the mini pusa a long days march to the west here to our right southeastward rolls the powdery flood of the south cheyenne when earlier in the season the melting snows go trickling down the hillsides but today only in dry and waving ripples of sand can we trace its course if you would see the water dig beneath the surface here behind us rolls another sandy stream dry as its dakota name implies mini pusa dry water and to our right and rear is their sandy confluence southward almost to the very horizon in waves and rolls and ridges bare of trees void of color the earth unfolds before the eye while as though to relieve the strain of gazing over the expanse so illimitable in its monotony a blue line of cliffs and crags stretches across the sky line for many degrees beyond that out of sight to the southeast lies the sheltered fertile valley of the upper white earth river and there are the legal homes of thousands of the nations wards the bands of the dakotas ogallalla and brulй led by red cloud and spotted tail there too are clothed and fed and cared for a thousand odd cheyennes just over that ridge at its western end where it seems to blend into the general surface of upland prairie a faint blue peak leaps up into the heated air old rawhide the landmark of the region farther off southwestward still another peak rises blue and pale against the burning distance tis far across the platte a good hundred miles away plainsmen to this day call it larmie in that iconoclastic slaughter of every poetic title that is their proud characteristic all over our grand continent it is the same the names musical sonorous or descriptive handed down as the heritage of the french missionaries the spanish explorers or the aboriginal owners are all giving way to that democratic intolerance of foreign title which is the birthright of the freeborn american what name more grandly descriptive could discoverer have given to the rounded gloomy crest in the southern sierras bald at the crown fringed with its circling pines what better name than monte san matйo saint matthew he of the shaven poll over a century the title held adaptive indian catholic mexican acceptive dragoon one and all respected and believed in it but then came the miner and the cowboy and with them the new vocabulary monte san matйo slinks in unmerited shame to hide its heralded deformity as baldhead butte what devilish inspiration impelled the fortyniners to damn monte san pablo to go down to eternity as bill williams mountain who but an iconoclast would rend the sensitive ear with such barbarities as the loss angglees of today for the deepvowelled los angeles of the last century who but a yankee would swap the murky purgatoire for picketwire and make zumbro river of the riviиre des ombres of brave old pиre marquette and so too it goes through all the broad northwest indian names beautiful in themselves even though at times untranslatable are tossed contemptuously aside to be replaced by the homeliest of everyday appellations until the modern geography of wyoming dakota montana and idaho bristles with innumerable sage boxelder horse and pine creeks mini pusa dry water have the dakotas called for ages the sandy stream that twists and turns and glares in the hot sunshine down here in the vale behind us mugginss fork some stockman said he heard it called a month ago far over there to the east almost under the black shadow of the hills we see another slender thread of questionable green cottonwoods again no doubt for nothing but cottonwoods or sagebrush or greasewood worse yet will grow down in the alkaline wastes of this wyoming valley and that thread or fringe betokens the existence of a stream in the springtime one that the sioux have ever called the beaver after the amphibious rodent who dammed its waters and thereby rescued them from a like fate at the hands of modern residents far to the southeast miles and miles away dim and hazy through the heatwaves of the atmosphere one can almost see another twisting string of shade the cottonwoods on the banks of the winding war bonnet at least so the sioux named it after their gorgeous crown of eagle feathers but twas too polysyllabic too poetic for the bluntspoken frontiersman who long since compromised on hat creek we are in the heart of the indian country but the wild romance has fled we are on dangerous ground for there straight away before our eyes broad beaten as a racecourse prominent as any public highway descending the slope until lost in the timber of the south cheyenne then reappearing beyond until far in the southeast it dwindles in perspective to a mere thread and so dips into the valley of the war bonnet and indian creek there lies the broad road from the reservations to the warpath it is the trail over which for years the wards of the nation have borne the paidup prices of their good behavior to sustain their brethren renegados in the powder river country far up here to the northwest over this road all winter long all the springtide and to this very week in june arms ammunition ponies bacon flour coffee sugar clothing and warriors have been speeding to the hosts of sitting bull the united states is sending today three or four thousand men at arms equipped and supplied by the department of war to try conclusions with about twice that number of trained warriors similarly provided for by the department of the interior it is odd but it is a fact camping along the banks of the rawhide the first stream on the indian side of the platte the officer in command of the advanceguard of the th was surprised to see a train of wagons and without apparent escort galloping down to their fires he accosted the wagonmaster who smilingly assured him that he and his train were in no danger from the indians they were bringing them supplies what supplies why metallic cartridges of course winchester and henry for their magazinerifles dont you know oh yes he understood well enough that they were all going out on the warpath but he couldnt help that he was paid so much a month to haul supplies from sidney to red cloud agency and if it happened to be powder and lead twerent none o his business how much had he oh three or four hundred thousand rounds he reckoned to whom consigned why the trader the indian store at red cloud of course mr s in speechless indignation the officer rides off and reports the matter to the colonel and the colonel goes down and interviews the imperturbable boss with similar result and more for he comes back with a shrug of the shoulders and some honest blasphemy for which may heaven forgive him the fine inflicted by army regulations has not yet been collected we can do nothing he says that fellow has his papers straight from the interior department he has been hauling cartridges all spring and now here is the advanceguard of the th again far up on the mini pusa just arrived and that slender column of smoke rising from among the cottonwoods tells of a tiny fire where the men are boiling their coffee while miles away to the southwest the rising dustclouds proclaim the coming of the regiment itself out on the distant heights on either side other smokes are rising indian signals that say to lurking warriors far and near be on your guard soldiers coming and so here on the breaks of the mini pusa on this scorching sabbath morn the vanguard of the th has reached and tapped the broad highway of indian commerce the laws of the nation they are sworn to defend prohibit their interfering with the distribution of ammunition by that same nation to the foes they are ordered to meet the nation is impartial it provides friend and foe alike the war office sends its cartridges to the th through the ordnance officer lieutenant x the indian bureau looks after its wards through mr at red cloud and now the th is ordered to stop those cartridges from getting to sitting bull up on the rosebud that is what brings them here to the mini pusa and we see them now riding down in long dusty column into the valley heedless of the dust they make for the indians have hovered on their flanks out of sight out of range but seeing ever since they crossed the platte and here they are old stannard and billings with the advance lying prone on their stomachs and searching through their fieldglasses for any signs of indian coming from the reservations while with the column itself in their battered slouch hats and rough flannel and buckskin bristling with cartridges and ugly beards burned and blistered and parched with scorching sun and winds tempered only with alkali dust ride our arizona friends many of them at least old bucketts with his green goggles turner with his melancholy face and placid ways raymond stern and swart canker querulous and nagging with his men but eager for any service stafford who won his troop vice the noblehearted tanner whom we lost among the apaches wayne who is loquacity itself whenever he can find a listener and who talks his patient subaltern almost deaf through the long day marches and crane and wilkins who are a good deal together at every halt and consort more with canker than other captains and then there is the jolly element that ever clusters around blake whose spirits defy adversity and whose merry quips and jests and boundless distortions of fact or fancy are the joy of the regiment with blake one always finds merrill and freeman and some of the jovial junior captains and of course the boys hunter dana briggs and here they are on this blessed sabbath of the centennial june sent up to stop mr s cartridges after they have become the property of mr lo and once a cartridge becomes indian property there is only one way of stopping it the wealth of france is inadequate to purchase of alfred krupp a single gun from his shops at essen because his love for fatherland will not let him place a power in the hands of the hereditary enemy it takes enlightened england and free america to supply friends and foes alike with the means to kill stannard closes his glass with a grunt of dissatisfaction and turns to billings none of those cartridges get through here this day anyhow but how many do you suppose mr has sent up there already and he points as he speaks to the far northwest under that blue dome cloudless glaring under the sentinel peaks of the big horn shimmering there in the distance over the rolling divide in that glorious upland that heaves and rolls and tosses between the rosebud and the swirling stream in the broad valley farther west another regiment that of which we spoke whose leader is famed in song and story is riding rapidly this still sunday morning in search of mr s cartridges some say the tall blueeyed blondbearded captain who leads that beautiful troop of bays is mr s brother odd yet how can the indian bureau know that crazy horse and two bears and kicking mule want to buy mr s bullets to kill his brother with how indeed should mr know army officers tis true have warned them time and again but when were army officers statements ever potent in the interior department against the unendorsed assertion of crazy horse or kicking mule that he only wanted to kill buffalo indeed is not mr himself eager to go bail for the purchaser since his profits are so high over the divide hot on the broad beaten trail goes the long column how different are they from our sombre friends of the th who miles and marches away to the southeast are dismounting and unsaddling under the cottonwoods years in arizona have robbed the latter of all the old love for the pomp and panoply of war there is not a bit of finery in the command there is hardly a vestige of uniform but look here look here at the brilliance of the seventh bright guidons flutter at the head of every troop bright chevrons stripes and buttons gleam on the dress of many an officer and man the steeds though worn and jaded with an almost ceaseless trot of thirtysix hours are spirited and beautiful some are gayly decked foremost rides their tried leader clad from head to foot in beaded buckskin the long hair the sioux still call him though now the long hair waves not on the breeze and an auburn beard conceals the handsome outline of the face all troopers know so well near him rides his adjutant dressed like himself in their favorite buckskin so too are others among the officers though many wear the jaunty fatigue uniform of the cavalry and the rank and file are all or nearly all in blue but a short way back they have come upon the scaffolding sepulchre of indian warriors lately slain in battle but a few miles ahead they see a broad valley from which far from south to north a vast dustcloud is rising and for this there can be but one explanation thousands of indian ponies in excited motion ay scouts in advance already sight indications of the near presence of a great indian community and the column resolves itself into three trotting in parallel lines across the treeless upland a mile or so apart with the northernmost the largest rides now the leader of all while between them gallop couriers carrying rapid orders every face sets eagerly westward every heart beats high with the thrill of coming battle some there are who note the immensity of the dustcloud who reason silently that for miles and miles the valley before them is covered by the scurrying herds ten thousand ponies at least must there be to stir up such a volume then how many warriors are there to meet these seven hundred no matter what one thinks not a man falters far to the south the snow peaks glisten over the pinecrested range of the big horn nearer at hand deep dark caсons burrow in towards the bowels of the mountains then from their bases leap the rolling foothills brown and bare but for the dense growth of the suncured buffalograss westward open and undulating sweeps the broad expanse of almost level valley beyond the bluffs close under which is curling the fatal stream the greasy grass of the dakotas far to the north in the same endless waves the prairie rolls to the horizon beyond which lies the shallow river where the transports are toiling upstream with comrade soldiery behind the column eastward dip the sheltered valleys of the rosebud and the breaks of the tongue among the cheetish mountains and there not fifty miles away as the crow flies the soldiers of the gray fox over two thousand strong are camped awaiting reinforcements before renewing the attempt to advance upon these lurking bands of sitting bull not two days march away on both flanks are four times his numbers in friends and allies not two miles away in his front are ten times his force in foemen savage but skilled yet all alone and unsupported the long hair rides dauntlessly to the attack even though he and his well know it must be battle to the death for indian warfare knows no mercy there be those who say the assault was rash the speed unauthorized the whole effort mad as lucans launch of the light brigade at balaclava but once there in view of the fatal valley the sight is one to fire the brain of any trooper galloping to a little mound to the right front the broad expanse lies before the leaders eyes and far as he can see out to the west and northwest the dustcloud rises heavily over the prairie here and there nearer at hand are the scurrying ponies and close down by the stream excited bands of indians tearing down lodge after lodge and preparing for rapid flight but one conclusion can he draw they are panicstricken stampeded they are on the run already and unless attacked at once can never be overhauled they will scatter over the face of the wild northwest in an hours time he cannot see what we know so well today that only the northern limits of the great villages are open to his gaze that the sheltering bluffs hide from him all the crowded lodges of the bands farthest to the south and that while squaws and children are indeed being hurried off to the west hundreds thousands of exultant young warriors are galloping in from the western prairies herding the warponies before them he cannot see the scores that rifle in hand are rushing into the willows and cottonwoods along the stream eager and ready to welcome his coming he sends hurried orders to the leaders of the little columns on his left push ahead cross the stream gallop northward when you reach the western bank and attack that end of the village while i strike from the east he never dreams that behind that solid curtain of bluff ogallalla sans arc uncapapa and blackfoot lurk in myriads the biggest indian village on the continent they say he shouts to the nearest column but only the northern limits of it could he see far far away in the east the churchbells are ringing out their glad welcome to the godgiven day of rest mothers sisters wives lift up a prayer for the loved ones on the savage frontier aloft the sun in cloudless splendor looks down on all westward press the comrade columns until reaching the head of a shallow ravine that leads northwestward towards the stream the long hair spurs to the front oh those beautiful kentucky sorrels oh those gallant loyal hearts and the eager bearded faces the erect athletic forms the fluttering guidons one by one are lost to view as they wind away down the coulйe one by one they disappear from sight from hearing of the comrades now trotting down the bluffs to the west take the last look upon them fellows five fated companies obedient to their leaders order loyal steadfast unmurmuring to the bitter end they vanish once and for all from loving eyes only as gashed lifeless mutilated forms will we ever see them again who has not read the story of the little horn why repeat it here who that was there will ever forget the sight that burst upon the astonished eyes of renos men when breaking through the willows along the stream and reaching the level bench they saw not five miles away to the north as was the first idea but here in their very front only long rifleshot away the southern outskirts of the great indian metropolis that stretched away for miles to the north god of battles was this a position was this a force to be assailed by one regiment why linger over it the halfhearted advance of the dismounted skirmish line the hesitating rally then the volley from the willows the flanking warriors on the west the sudden consciousness of their pitiful numbers as against the hordes now swarming upon them the mad rush for the bluffs with the yelling indians dragging the rearmost from their steeds and butchering them as they rode the henrys and winchesters pumping their bullets into the fleeing mass the plunge into the seething waters the panting scramble up the steep and slippery banks the breathless halt at the crest and then then the backward glance at the field and the fallen who will forget mcintosh striving to rally the rearmost dragged from the saddle and hacked to death upon the sward who will forget benny hodgsons brave young face the pet the pride of the whole regiment even the daring and devotion of his men could not save him from the hissing lead of those savage marksmen then the strained suspense the halfhours listening to the fierce the awful volleying to the north that told of a fearful struggle the flutter of hope that it might be the stronger battalion fighting its way through to the relief of theirs the weak one the blank faces that gazed one into another with awestricken inquiry as trumpet blare and rallying shout and rattling volley receded not approached died away not thundered anew in coming triumph the pall of certainty that fell on every man when silence so soon reigned in the distance and pandemonium broke out afresh around them back from their bloody work drunk with blood and victory came by thousands the savage warriors to swell the forces that had driven the white soldiers to cover up thank god not an instant too soon came the comrades from the distant left and benteen and macdougall riding in with four full companies and the needed ammunition gave them strength to hold out through the hours of fierce battle that followed through that dread running the gauntlet for water that the wounded craved through the stern suspense and strain of the day and night that intervened before the rescuing forces of terry came cautiously up the valley and the sioux melted away before them ah how many a time was the question asked what can have become of custer far far to the east this still sabbath afternoon seeking shelter from the glare of the same blazing sun seeking sympathy from each others words seeking hope and comfort from him who alone can aid a little group of women gather at the frontier fort on the banks of the missouri they are the wives of the officers who that morning ride into the valley of death with their soldier leader fair young matrons and mothers whose thoughts have little room for the glad jubilee in the still more distant east whose world is with that charging column only a few days since there came to them the evil news that the indians had forced back the soldiers of the southern department that meant harder work fiercer fighting for their own and this dread anxiety it is that clusters them here lifting up sweet voices in their hymn of praise to the heavenly throne pleading pleading for the life and safety of those who are their all in all oh god there is prophecy in the very words of their mournful song though they know it not pitying father listen and be merciful een though it be a cross that raiseth me vain the trembling hope vain the tearful pleading far out on the slopes of the little horn those for whom these prayers are lifted have fought their last battle god has indeed asked of these women that henceforth they walk on in the shadow and alone chapter xi the wolf and the sheepfold the glorious fourth has come and gone the centennial anniversary has had its completed category of parade and picnic speech and song fun and fireworks the thronging cities of the east have rejoiced with unusual enthusiasm especially philadelphia whose coffers are plethoric with the tribute of visiting thousands out on the frontier we have celebrated with modified йclat since the national celebrants are mostly absent on active service and have no blank cartridges to dispose of the big garrison flags have been duly hoisted and saluted the troops have been paraded where there were any to parade as only a few infantrymen remain to take care of the forts and the families the declaration of independence has been read in one or two of the bigger posts where enough remains of defenders to make up a fairsized demonstration one of these is far up on the missouri where the cavalry ladies are all invited to hear the infantry orator of the day and go no news has come for some time from husbands and lovers on the warpath and it is best to be hopeful and cheery they make a lovely picture a dozen of them in their dainty white dresses their smiling faces their fluttering fans and ribbons they applaud each telling point with encouraging bravos and the clapping of pretty hands how free from care how joyous how luxurious is army life how gleeful is their silvery laughter how beaming the smiles with which they reward the young gallant who comes among them for their congratulations vanitas vanitatum they are nearly all widowed poor girls but they dont know it not yet the steamer laden with the wounded and the fell tidings of disaster is but a few hours away before the breaking of another day there will be none to smile in all their number verily in the midst of life we are in death and russell too has had its jubilee on a more extensive scale for here are webb and truscott with their fine troops of horse the band the infantry companies and a brace of old howitzers with which they make the welkin ring no tidings of any account have come from the front the gray fox is puzzled at the situation the indians are out there somewhere as he finds every time a scout goes forth but they appear to be engrossed in some big council over at the greasy grass one thing is certain he can get no word through to terry on the yellowstone and he cannot afford another tussle with such force as they show when he does come out the th is still down near the black hills busy oh yes busy is no word for it they are scampering all over the south cheyenne country after small bands of indians whose fleet ponies keep them just out of range of the carbines and just out of reach of the horses who grainfed all winter are now losing speed strength and bottom on the scant and wiry grass they find in the sandy valleys truscott and webb are eager to go forward but orders say wait mrs truscott is again almost in heaven jack has been with her nearly a fortnight they are domiciled in their new quarters mrs stannard is their nextdoor neighbor much of their furniture has come and the army home is beginning to look lovely mrs whaling and mrs turner can never see enough of it or say enough large numbers of recruits have been sent to the post to be drilled and forwarded to the cavalry at the front they are having ridingschool all hours of the day and the cavalry officers are in saddle from morn till night teaching them mr gleason is assiduous in this duty whatever captain truscott has heard to the gentlemans discredit in the past he admits to himself that it has prepared him for agreeable disappointment no lieutenant could be more attentive or subordinate more determined to please captain truscott cannot but wish that mr gleason were less attentive to miss sanford but that young lady is evidently fully able to keep him at a very pleasant distance it excites the captains admiration to see how perfectly ladylike how really gracious is her manner to the aspiring widower and yet how serenely unencouraging no one understood this better than mr gleason himself finding her deeper less impressionable than he at first supposed he simply changed his tactics he avoided the store he shunned conversations on dangerous topics he cultivated the society of colonel whaling and deeply impressed that veteran with the depth of his information on dogs horses and military affairs he dexterously lost small sums to the post commander at pool and billiards enough to keep the old gentleman in cigars and goodhumor he became serious in his conversation with the colonels amiable wife whose exemplary habit it was to be always found seated at a little table behind a very big bible when visitors called though the garrison did say as garrisons will that occasionally they had to knock or ring half a dozen times before the summons could be heard not because the good lady was so deeply plunged in religious meditation but because the clatter of angry tongues made all demonstration from without simply inaudible the longsuffering and shortserving domestics who successively reigned in the whaling kitchen and chambers were wont to say that it was nag and scold from morn till dewy eve sometimes later and that in the midst of wrathful tirade the lady of the house would only be brought to instant silence by the announcement of some one at the door a certain miss finnegan who served a brief apprenticeship in the household acquired lasting fame in the garrison for the mimetic power which enabled her to portray mrs ginerals instantaneous change from a posture of fury to one of rapt devotion she could look like hecate hibernicized and in one comprehensive second drop into a chair smooth her wrinkled front and side curls shake out her rumpled draperies and rise from an instants searching of the scriptures with features expressive of the very acme of christian peace and benediction mrs general was a petname the lady had won from a wifely and lovable trait that prompted her to aggrandize her placid lord above his deserts him she ever addressed in public and of him she ever spoke as the general irrespective of the fact that the rank was one he never had or never would attain even by brevet for the senate drew the line at the man who had been in the army through three wars and never heard a hostile bullet whistle his regiment had not been required in the florida business he himself was put on other duty when they went to mexico and finally in the great war of the rebellion there was constant need of regulars to act as mustering and disbursing officers at the rear such had been old whalings career and so long as he himself was utterly unpretentious never claimed to have done any war service and was content to drift along and draw his pay nobody would have said much in detraction had it not been for his wifes persistent pushing he was merely second in command of his regiment but the lady spoke of him as the general on all occasions and alluded to his immediate superior who had led corps and divisions in his day as colonel starr others of equal rank and with the brevets of majorgenerals she similarly belittled they were merely fieldofficers she admitted the existence of no greater man than the general her husband and whatever might be the sorrows of other parents with their children or housewives with their servants mrs whaling pitied even condoled but could not sympathize with uplifted eyes she would thank the giver of all good that he had blessed her with sons so noble and distinguished with daughters so lovely and so dutiful with servants so singularly devoted in the various garrisons in which the good lady had flourished what mattered it that her boys were known to be graceless young scamps whom cudgelling could not benefit or that her gentle daughters squabbled like cats and flew to the neighbors to spread the tales of their wrongs and mammas injustice what mattered it that her paragons of servants left her one after another and swore they couldnt stay in a house where there was so much spying and faultfinding there was no shaking mrs whalings christian determination to run with patience the race thus set before her gleason found in converse with her so much that reminded him of the mother he had lost alas so many years ago and mrs whaling welcomed him to the consolations of her sanctified spirit together they deplored the frivolity and vices of the younger officers ray came in for a good showingup just there no doubt and together they projected the reformation of some of her favorites in the garrison a wise man was gleason she and her meek and lowly husband could be useful very useful in time of need and did he abandon his devotions to miss sanford no indeed but they were modified as became the subject he called less frequently he became less personal less aggressive in his talk he had naught but good or silence for his comrades and charity for the world he threw into his every look and word a deference and a respect that made his manner proof against criticism and yet one and all they could not welcome him truscott his captain had never yet dropped the mr before the surname of his subaltern that wellunderstood barrier to all army intimacy and gleason who stood among the very first on the lineal list of lieutenants hated him for the restriction but gave no sign it was necessary that some one of the cavalry officers should be placed in charge of the newlyarrived recruits and this duty fell to gleasons lot it relieved him from service with his troop and made him independent of his captain webb and truscott if consulted would have named a far better instructor among their lieutenants but colonel whaling issued the order from post headquarters and there was nothing for it but obey gleason lent his best efforts to the work and he and his drill sergeants were ceaseless in their squad instruction several old cavalrymen had come among the dozens of green hands so had a small squad transferred by war department orders from west point among these men were competent drillmasters and among the drillmasters the most active and efficient was the saxon soldier sergeant wolf mr gleason had invited the ladies to walk out on the prairie east of the post one lovely morning late in june that they might see the skirmish drills of the two cavalry troops often as she had been a spectator before mrs truscott never tired of watching jack and his men and miss sanford was greatly interested at all times in the martial exercises especially the mounted strolling homeward about ten oclock having been joined by one of the young infantry officers mr gleason suggested their stopping at the store and refreshing themselves with a lemonade miss sanford would have declined with thanks but silently waited for her hostess to speak and mrs truscott who remembered how papa had sometimes called her into the clubroom when she was a child and who knew that the garrison ladies frequently accepted such invitations hesitatingly assented it must be confessed that mrs truscott sometimes acted before she thought and this was one of the times truscott himself rarely if ever entered the clubroom and had never thought it necessary to say anything to his wife on the subject the door stood invitingly open the attendant was lolling thereat in his shirtsleeves admiringly scanning the approaching group as soon as he saw they were heading for the clubroom instead of the gate he slipped behind the bar and put on his coat miss sanford hung back as mr gleason threw open the portals and called out encouragingly come right in ladies theres no one here but the barkeeper mrs truscott stepped lightly over the threshold and glanced with smiling curiosity around the first thing that caught her eye was a placard hanging at the entrance of a little alcovelike space beyond the rusty old billiardtables within were two or three green baizecovered cardtables and rude wooden chairs on the placard roughly stencilled was the legend he who enters here leaves soap behind mrs truscotts eyes expressed wonderment and mirth commingled how utterly absurd who did that mr gleason that oh thats some of blakes work i believe ah are you not coming in miss sanford thanks no mr gleason i believe ill wait here was the reply pleasant but decided why marion do come in cried mrs truscott hastening to the door miss sanfords face was flushing slightly but her voice was gentle as usual ill wait for you grace but i do not care for a lemonade and would rather not go in indeed i dont care for one either i only said yes because i thought perhaps you would like it or would care to see the clubroom mrs truscott protested as she hurriedly came forth we are just as much obliged to you mr gleason but not today and with that they resumed their homeward stroll once through the gate mr gleason slackened the pace so as to detain his fair companion a moment why would you decline my invitation he asked in a tone of what was intended to be tender reproach i prefer not to visit the clubroom as i believe it is called you would soon get used to it if you were in the army he ventured awkwardly but i am not in the army she began selfrestrainedly enough then as though she could not repress the words nor would i be if as you say i had to get used to that she has a temper then quoth gleason to himself ruefully noting that he had made a bad move it gave him an opportunity of putting in what was generally considered a pretty effective piece of work however one that had been often employed on somewhat similar occasions and will be again ah miss sanford were there more women like you there would be fewer places like that but to this she made no reply whatsoever if anything its effect was to quicken her pace arriving near their quarters a small party of enlisted men apparently recruits were observed clustered about a wagon loaded with boxes a spruce handsome blondmoustached young soldier stepped suddenly into view from behind the wagon where he had been superintending the unloading of some of the goods at sight of him miss sanford stopped short looking wonderingly at her mr gleason saw that her face had paled and that she was gazing intently on the approaching soldier and on mrs truscott who absorbed in laughing talk with her escort had apparently not observed him as he halted and saluted mr gleason could not but note that she started then that she had flushed crimson he glanced quickly from one to the other the pale girl by his side the startled young matron in front and the statuesque soldier respectfully standing with his hand at the cap visor pardon madame the quartermaster sends me to unload these boxes at captain truscotts quarters if madame will designate the room to which they shall be carried the captain will be here in a moment she replied hurriedly and moving into the gate as though eager to avoid the very presence of the soldier oh may i ask you in gentlemen she added glancing over her shoulder and still evidently discomposed and gleason followed the parlor was cool and pleasant after the hot sunshine without mrs truscott threw herself into a chair then rose as hastily and went into the diningroom beyond miss sanfords eyes followed her anxiously as she stood at the sideboard pouring out a glass of water that man er wolf who came with this batch of recruits tells me he was first sergeant of captain truscotts troop at the point he said tentatively yes when did he get here or how he came with recruits two nights ago transferred from west point with some other men on the captains application as i understand it i presume he is to be assigned to our troop and here the clatter of hoofs outside announced the captains return from drill and gleason soon took his leave pondering over what he had seen what was the secret of mrs truscotts evident uneasiness if not agitation what of miss sanfords visible annoyance it was very late that night when miss sanford sought her room there had been a drive to town during the afternoon and a pleasant dance at the hoproom afterwards not once had she had an opportunity of speaking alone with mrs truscott nor was she quite certain of what she wished to say even had the opportunity occurred for several days previous to their start from the point sergeant wolf with others of the cavalry detachment had been constantly at the house packing goods and furniture nothing could exceed the punctilious distance and respect with which he addressed the ladies whenever occasion required that he should speak to them at all but miss sanford could not forget his mysterious conduct the night she discovered him at the front gate once she spoke with halflaughing hesitancy of the assiduity with which the sergeant devoted all his spare time to his captains service or to madames and grace had looked so annoyed that she ceased further mention of him she wanted to tell her of his being at the gate that night and his going around under the librarywindow but it proved a difficult thing and she postponed it from day to day then came the sudden departure of the sergeant and his party for new york where they were ordered to report at a recruiting rendezvous believing that they had seen the last of him she breathed freer and decided to keep the story of his midnight visit to herself at least for a time and now here he was again and his coming had evidently startled her friend she wanted above all things to have a frank talk with mrs truscott this keeping a secret from her was distressing and she could not bear the thought of a possible cloud or misunderstanding between them but poor grace had totally forgotten the existence of such a person as wolf by the time they got home she was having a little trouble of her own they were strolling across the parade in the brilliant moonlight grace on her stalwart husbands arm looking up in his face with all her soul in her eyes chatting merrily over the events of the day miss sanford was amiably listening to the dissertation of an infantry friend upon astronomical matters while gleason was elsewhere escorting mrs whaling at the door truscott looked back and hospitably invited the young officer to enter but the latter doffed his cap and gallantly said something to the effect that all who entered left their hearts behind and took himself off with the conviction that he had made a glowing impression it reminded mrs truscott of the stencil inscription over the local inferno oh jack have you seen mr blakes latest absurdity that slangy paraphrase of dante at the clubroom i heard of it said truscott smilingly who told you of it queenie why i saw it today she replied as though suddenly conscious that she had put her foot on forbidden ground then as he said nothing whatever she went on in anxious explanation mr gleason asked us in to have a lemonade on our way from drill you know the ladies often go jack i know some of them do gracie ought we not to have gone i mean ought i not to have gone for marion would not indeed jack the moment i saw she had not come in i left at once was it are you vexed theres no great harm done dear i had not thought to warn you against it though i knew the others some of them went there at times you mean you had not supposed it would be necessary jack and so it must be admitted he had and poor grace was in the depths as a natural consequence it was the first time she had felt that he was disappointed in her and though the matter was trivial and his loving kiss and caress reassured her she was plunged in dismay to think that in entering the clubroom with mr gleason she had done what he disapproved of what as a woman of refined breeding she should have shunned and what marion had declined she was too much a woman not to feel that therein lay an additional sting she was too gentle and loving a wife not to feel forlorn at thought of having disappointed jack some women would have resented the idea of his objecting to such a thing no fair reader of course i dont mean you but is it not just possible i may be right in saying so of mrs next door grace had kissed her friend goodnight just a wee bit less affectionately than usual and marion well knew that husband and wife were best left alone together as the surest and speediest way of settling the affair she therefore went to her room there were only two rooms upstairs in the little army house each with its big closet a door connecting the two and others opening out on the narrow landing above the stairs each with its sharply sloping roof and dormerwindow grace had insisted on her guests taking the front room looking out on the parade as she had at the point but after much laughing discussion they settled it by pulling straws as many a question had been decided in the old school days this reversed the assignment and the rear room became miss sanfords the view from the window was not attractive immediately beneath was the shingle roofing of the diningroom and kitchen annex stretching out to the servants rooms and sheds beyond the yard like all its fellows was bare and brown for nothing would grow on such a soil rough unpainted wooden fences separated them one from another rough cowsheds coalsheds or woodsheds were braced up against the fences and back of all the yards along the row ran a high rickety barrier of boards as rough and unprepossessing as the others beyond this fence lay a triangular space of open prairie ornamented only by ashbarrels and occasional heaps of empty cans awaiting the coming of the police cart beyond this space stood the big brown hospital on the north the backyards of the surgeons and sutlers quarters on the east while the hypothenuse of the rightangled triangle thus limited was the unsightly fence that bounded the backyards of officers row mr dick swivellers delightful view of over the way was a gem of landscape in comparison but for such gloomy outlook miss sanford had little thought she went to the window to draw the curtain and far out across the distant prairie slopes where she could see them at all the moon was throwing her silvery beams while closer at hand broad irregular wastes of blackness sailed over the dry plateau as the clouds that caused them drifted across the dazzling face harsh and unlovely as were the surroundings by day they lost something of their asperity under the softening shimmer of that mystic light far down by the stables she could hear the ringing watchcall of the sentries proclaiming halfpast twelve oclock and all well and then and then as a cloud floated away and the bright beams poured down in unhindered radiance she became aware of a form enveloped in a cavalry overcoat standing in the corner of the fence she could see the moonlight glinting on the polished insignia the crossed sabres on the front of his foragecap and though she could not see the face she knew it was that of sergeant wolf captain and mrs truscott were still below she could hear them putting out the parlor lamps and locking the doors she could hear a quick footstep on the hardbeaten walk in front and the clink of a scabbard and knew it must be the officer of the day starting out to make his rounds so too apparently did the mysterious prowler in the backyard he stepped quickly out of the enclosure and the next instant she could see the erect soldierly figure moving rapidly away towards the northwestern entrance of the post where lay the bands quarters chapter xii a serenade news from mr ray exclaimed mrs stannard as she came in all smiles and sunshine the morning after the fourth just think of it captain truscott the major says they were all wondering when they could hope to get letters from home when who should come trotting into camp but ray with a bagful he found a couple of men at laramie who had been left behind when the regiment went through and the three of them slipped off together and by riding all night managed to escape the indians did you ever know such a reckless fellow truscott shook his head i wish ray would be more prudent if there were any occasion for such a risk twould be a different thing but there was said mrs stannard promptly the commanding officer at laramie had received important orders for the th by telegraph and he didnt know how to get them through no scouts or runners were in ray got there the evening before and the moment he heard of it he went right to the colonel and begged to be allowed to go it seems that trouble is expected at the agency she continued the major sends just a few lines to say they expect to leave the cheyenne valley and go right in there the pickets have chased indians coming from the northwest runners from sitting bull they say and the officers do not like the looks of things truscotts face was very grave but his manner was unchanged mrs grace and her friend had risen from the breakfasttable to welcome their exhostess and valued neighbor and the three ladies looked as though news from the front brought far more of anxiety than comfort before anything further was said there came a light tap at the door and mrs turner fluttered in bewitchingly pretty in her white muslin with brightcolored ribbons there were illnatured people who observed at times of mrs turner that she took far more pains with her dress when the captain was away on campaign and the doughboys were running the garrison than she did when her liege lord was at home of this we cannot speak advisedly certain it is that on this particularly bright glorious sunshiny morning of the fifth of july in the centennial year mrs turner was most becomingly attired i wouldnt have intruded at so unconventional an hour only i saw mrs stannard come running in i knew she had a letter and so had i isnt it horrid captain turner says it looks as though they might be out all summer oh miss sanford im so glad you are dressed and ready for the ambulance is coming around now and i know you and mrs truscott want to go in this morning and see mrs wings new goods she opened yesterday you know and mrs wilkins says all the bonnets are fresh from new york and lovely you will go wont you come just as you are youll only need a light wrap for the sun is very warm why is it that when one woman knows herself to be tastefully and becomingly dressed she is so eager to assure others who are to accompany her that they need nothing by way of adornment the ambulance was at the door the visit to town had been contemplated for two or three days so matters were quickly arranged there was abundant room and mrs stannard decided to go too in a few minutes half a dozen ladies in their airy summer costumes were gathered around the concord wagon ordinarily referred to as the ambulance mr gleason was promptly on hand with other officers to assist the band was just marching away towards its quarters when miss sanfords quick eye was attracted by the sight of some evident commotion at the adjutants office at the west end one soldier was running at full speed in pursuit of the old and new officers of the day who were descending the slope to the creek valley another soldier the commanding officers orderly came running down the road towards the party she was already seated as were most of the others mrs turner sprang lightly in and coquettishly kissed her hand to the group of officers on the walk go on driver she said one moment mrs turner please wait i think something is the matter look and miss sanford pointed to the running men all eyes were instantly fixed on the orderly he came up wellnigh breathless captain truscott gentlemen the commanding officers compliments and desires to see all the officers at once the group started at the instant truscott turned and held out his hands to his wife with the quick intuition of a woman accustomed to wars alarms she felt that evil tidings had come and was already starting to leave the carriage oh what can it be almost wailed mrs turner do you know orderly its been a big battle maam and they say general custer and lots of officers is killed truscott swung his wife from the wagon and almost lifted her to the piazza miss sanford white and silent sprang out unaided and ran to her side mrs stannard with an awful dread in her kind blue eyes took truscotts hand as he returned and assisted her to alight will you stay with grace he whispered i will go at once to the office come mrs turner but mrs turner hung back irresolute perhaps it isnt true at all captain and this may be the only time we can have the ambulance for a week for answer he silently took her at the waist in his powerful hands set her speechless with astonishment on the sidewalk sprang in and spoke sharply to the driver whirl round get there to the office quick as you can and the lashed mules went at a gallop entering the office with the customary knock at the open door truscott stood first in the presence of the post commander and his adjutant for gods sake read that said the colonel holding up to him some three or four sheets of telegraphic despatch paper the other officers came hurrying in read it aloud truscott and so to the group of speechless officers and to the knot of soldiers who had gathered in the hall the dread news of the battle of the little horn was told at russell custer and his five pet companies completely wiped out said the staffofficer who sent the news flashing around to the military posts in the department three hundred and twentyfive soldiers swept out of existence only an easy days gallop in front of the gray foxs pickets and it had taken all this time ten days to get the news into civilization there was no sign of a smile the rest of that long day at russell the gloom of death had settled down on the post the ladies were seen no more the doctor was sent for in more than one instance mrs truscott was reported very ill but if garrison after garrison was thrown into dismay all over the frontier by the sudden news who can picture the scene at lincoln when at dawn of that dreadful day a sergeant came over from the boat at bismarck to arouse the people at the hospital and to break the blow to the widows and orphans reveille had not sounded when the commanding officer the adjutant and a surgeon started on the gloomy round of the cavalry garrison yesterday we saw those fair smiling women bravely striving to hide their anxieties and loneliness and to lend enthusiasm to the celebration of the nations anniversary one after another they were startled from the deep slumber of early morning by the knocking at the door the first knell of disaster and who that saw the old missouri post when the fearful news was finally made known to all will ever forget the scene that ensued may god avert the possibility of such another the day wore gloomily away at russell twice mr gleason called at captain truscotts quarters the second time mrs stannard appeared at the door and briefly told him that mrs truscott was not well enough to see anybody and that miss sanford begged to be excused mrs whaling permeated the post in an ecstasy of soulful comfort shedding prayers and prophecies of similar fortune for the th with the impartiality of a saint she even succeeded in scaring mrs turner half to death and exasperating mrs wilkins to the verge of a tirade but the latter had contented herself with the spirited though ungrateful announcement that when it came to having hearses and mutes it wouldnt be mrs whaling theyd inquire for matters are bad enough without your making em worse maam she said in her decided way and the good lady longing to deluge somebody with sympathetic tears was compelled to confine herself to the round of the infantry quarters where with the ladies of her own regiment she could bemoan the unfathomable ingratitude and lack of appreciation of their sisters of the th late that afternoon there came more orders and despatches truscott and the other cavalry officers were summoned to colonel whalings where they found most of the infantrymen already assembled captain webb had been called back to kansas as a witness before a civil court and to truscott the order of the division commander was conveyed that he should march with the two troops at russell without delay and join the th wherever he could find them north of the platte three of the four infantry companies would also march for laramie at dawn colonel whaling with one small company the recruits the band and the noncombatants would remain to take charge of the post sending for his first sergeant truscott ordered him to have everything put in readiness at once a man was sent to town to recall all soldiers on pass there had been no drills during the day officers and men alike seemed stunned by the tidings that had come at guardmounting he then went to his quarters and to his young wifes bedside she was prepared for the news he had told her during the day that now every available officer and man would be hurried to the front she was in no danger whatever it was the shock the abruptness of the announcement of the orderly that had so prostrated her she lay there very pale and still never taking her soft eyes from his face and holding tightly his hand as he gently told her all he had to say i cannot be too thankful he said at last that i have miss sanford and mrs stannard here to be your companions during the campaign it will be late in autumn before we can hope to return my darling later that evening the young subalterns of his own and webbs troop came to him for certain instructions as to the mess and baggage arrangements mr gleason had not appeared since the issuance of the orders to march tattoo was just sounding out on the parade and the men could be seen flitting to and fro against the lights of the company barracks they were standing at the little gate in front of his quarters and two or three officers passed them oh mr gleason one moment called truscott gleason turned and approached them i presume you will mess with the rest of us at least until we reach the regiment mr wells has been arranging for messfurniture and supplies well er no captain said gleason in evident embarrassment the fact is the colonel directs that i remain here somebody has to stay to instruct recruits and the colonel has settled upon me it is merely temporary of course truscott stood looking at him in silence a moment a dark line was growing between his brows the colonel er sent for me just at retreat gleason stumbled on i assure you i had nothing to say to him to bring about such a thing it was entirely against my wishes but orders are orders i am glad to hear you say the order was unsolicited said the captain shortly the colonel will doubtless notify me that is all mr gleason i will not detain you and gleason went on his way to the store which he had lately avoided he felt that he stood in need of bracing still so far as saying that he had made no request of colonel whaling he had told the truth he had simply represented the detachment of recruits as being utterly demoralized by the news of the massacre and that he had reason to believe many of them would desert and as that would reflect on the vigilance of the post commander the latter jumped at what was suggested to him by his farsighted wife the temporary detention of mr gleason to take charge of them at daybreak on the sixth truscotts squadron of over a hundred horse finely mounted equipped and disciplined was marching rapidly over the ridge to lodge pole leaving russell wives and children behind leaving to care for them among others gleason and sergeant wolf wearily the day of their departure rolled away mrs truscott never left her room mrs stannard and miss sanford rarely left her once or twice had mr gleason called being met again by mrs stannard whom he was beginning to hate the ladies were resting he was informed so too was mrs whaling told when she came and seemed discomfited at not being invited upstairs it was difficult indeed to persuade her that she had not better remain in the parlor in case mrs truscott should ask for her you see mrs stannard explained gleason the last thing i promised truscott as he rode away was that i would not lose sight of the ladies would watch over them incessantly and i want to keep faith with him mrs stannard had her doubts as to how much of this statement was true though she had no doubts as to how much was uncalled for mr gleason went away feeling injured and rebuffed it was miss sanfords business he held to come down and see him if only for a moment he had gained his object in being kept back at the post that he might pursue his wooing satisfied of the wealth and social standing of the lady he felt no doubt whatever that if given a fair field he could win her and win her he would if unlimited conceit has not yet been mentioned or indicated as one of mr gleasons prominent traits the omission is indeed important he felt that up to the time of truscotts coming his progress had been satisfactory officers and ladies were already making sly allusions in his presence as to his prospects for a second entanglement and were heard with complacent undenial ever since the day of his aspersion of ray he had been losing ground however and now confound it here was ray looming up as a hero again making a wild nightride with despatches he felt that things must be brought to a crisis speedily he knew that properly handled he had the means of clouding rays name with something worse than suspicion he had already sneeringly replied to the officers who had spoken admiringly of rays daring by saying that ray was doubtless trying to make a record to block matters that were working against him here some of his auditors had gone off disgusted one had plainly said he was sick of insinuations now however they were all gone and he had the field practically to himself the halfdozen officers left at the post would be little apt to interfere with him only he must manage mrs stannard gleason took a fortifying glass or two ordered up his horse and late as it was rode in to cheyenne there he dropped in at the telegraphoffice he could have sent it from the adjutants office just as well and after some deliberation wrote this despatch willard rallston esq omaha why no letter when you coming act now ferguson gone g being in town he dropped in at one or two places of popular resort and had more or less conversation with the hangerson at the open bars he drank more freely than usual too and while by no means off his balance mentally or physically when at midnight he turned his horses head homewards he was rather more capable of any deed of meanness than would ordinarily have been deemed expedient his quarters reached he stood for a moment gazing along the dark and silent row suddenly soft and sweet on the clear night air he heard the notes of a guitar then a tenor voice well trained rich and melodious he well knew there was no officer in the garrison who could sing like that who was it where was it slipping through the backyard and keeping close under the high board fence mr gleason tiptoed up the row until behind truscotts a convenient knothole enabled him to peer through and his eye lit on the dim figure of a man enveloped in cavalry overcoat standing beneath the rear window this then was the troubadour a moment or two previous miss sanford wearied after a long day of anxiety and care was roused from a broken sleep by a soft sweet tenor voice beneath her window and the tinkling accompaniment of a guitar each word came floating through the silent night rings stille herscht es schweigt der wald vollendet ist des tages lauf der vцgleins lied ist lдngst verhallt am himmel ziehn die sterne auf schlaf wohl schlaf wohl und schliess die schцnen augen zu schlaf wohl schlaf wohl du sьsser lieber engel du she knew instantly who it must be she noiselessly slipped to the door leading into graces chamber and the dim nightlight showed her sweet friend sound asleep returning she crept to the window shrouded as it was by the inner curtain no sign would she give that the song was heard but what woman would not have risked one peep finishing his song the serenader turned on his heel gave one long lingering look at the darkened window then strode out of the rear gate and away towards the band quarters drawing the curtain farther aside miss sanford plainly recognized the walk and bearing she followed him with her eyes until he had gone full a hundred yards was about to let fall the curtain when crouching like panther sneaking from shadow to shadow there slipped past the gate the dim figure of a second man in stealthy pursuit who could this be the first of course was sergeant wolf chapter xiii surrounded one thing is certain we ought to get word over to wayne or hell be cut off the speaker was old stannard and his auditors were a knot of half a dozen officers of the th it was just daybreak cold crisp and clear it was about a week after the news of the battle of the little horn had reached the regiment already its two strongest battalions were marching to join crook at the big horn but a little squadron two troops under command of captain wayne lay nearly two days march away lower down the broad valley towards the southeast the tidings that had come by special couriers were exciting even alarming a great outbreak had occurred among the indians still at the agencies on white river nearly a thousand of the southern cheyennes who had nothing whatever to do with the quarrel of sitting bull and his people who had no grievance whatever against the government but had been fed clothed petted and pampered for six or eight years and who up to this time remained at the reservations had become so emboldened at the success of the renegades and warriors in the big horn country so envious of their great massacre of custer and his men that they had suddenly thrown off all disguise loaded up with all the provisions arms and ammunition they could buy or steal and had jumped for the northwest murdering and pillaging as they went waiting no orders dropping indeed the retrograde movement he was ordered to make before this outbreak was known the regimental commander had turned his columns and shot cross country on a night march to head them off a soldier who doubted the grit of his officers and men who was himself indisposed to dare so strong and savage a foe could easily have taken refuge in these orders and marching as directed avoid the cheyennes entirely they were known to be the fiercest sharpest trickiest fighters of the plains full of pluck and science superb horsemen fine shots splendidly mounted and equipped a foe indeed the average man would think twice before tackling especially in the light of the fearful exhibition of indian prowess of the th of june but the leader of the th never thought twice no sooner did the breathless couriers reach him with the news than he formed his plans instanter within an hour every horse and man in the th seemed to know they had a race and a fight ahead eighty miles of rough country to ride over before they could strike the line on which the cheyennes were moving and then the th could speak for themselves the news of the tragedy of the little horn came like a stunning blow to many a fellow who had lost old and tried comrades in the fray but while laugh and jest seemed banished for the time there was no doubting the spirit of the regiment for the coming business they had turned sharply from their course late in the afternoon of the previous day had marched nearly all night had halted to make coffee and give the horses water and a good feed as they reached the sheltering cottonwoods by the stream and now while some of the officers with their fieldglasses were lying prone upon the commanding ridges studying the distant valley for signs another party was gathered here around the colonel who had been having a brief chat with old stannard wayne has been warned by this time i sent two of the scouts across from the rawhide last evening was the colonels quiet reply to the impulsive outburst of his junior he is off their line of march entirely i know admitted stannard but those fellows have had eyes out in every direction they know just where he is they know just where that wagontrain is and up to last evening they knew just where we were though they are puzzled now i reckon all im afraid of is that the moment they find were not in supporting distance theyll drop what theyre after and turn on wayne he ought to be only forty odd miles down this valley considerably off their line and if he has kept close and not fooled away his time he is safe enough but wayne is wayne colonel and ive known him to go poking off on side scouts and losing time topogging over pretty country when he ought to have been making tracks for home stannard would use the vernacular of the frontier when at all excited now it would be just like wayne to have lost a day in just such a manner i hope not but i fear it he has ray with him suggested captain turner i know that but wayne is buttheaded as a billygoat on some points and one is that he cant be taught anything about indians hes as innocent and unsuspicious and incapable of appreciating their wiles as the average secretary of the interior and wayne isnt the kind of man to be influenced by rays opinions hed be more apt to tell ray to keep them to himself it couldnt be helped of course but its a pity two companies had to be sent on that scout id feel safer under ray with one troop than under wayne with two i confess i wish we could see just where they were and what they were doing said the colonel with an anxious look on his sunblistered face but we have our hands full as it is come mr adjutant its time we were off get the men in saddle and have the arms and ammunition inspected fifty rounds to the man at least major stannard where would you locate truscotts command this morning i shall send couriers back from here to find him and tell him to join wayne to join wayne well just at that particular moment wayne was wishing that he might or somebody equally strong and if the colonel could but have seen the fix that doughty dragoon was in fifty miles away the concern on his ruddy face would have been intensified wayne had succeeded in justifying everything stannard had said of him he had indeed been fooling away his time on side scouts and now before he had fairly dreamed of the possibility of such a thing the hills around him were alive with indians ray with his troop had been assigned to the captains command for a scout of some importance over towards the reservations three days before this unlucky morning rumors of the disaffection of the cheyennes had come to the colonel everybody knew that the indians would be wild with delight over the news from sitting bull indeed there was reason to believe that it was being whispered at the reservations before the telegraph flashed the tidings broadcast on the th of july were there not two days there on the mini pusa the d and d of july when little parties of indians were chased towards as well as from the white river waynes orders were to scout the valley and report whether indians were venturing out that way before he had been two days away from the regiment he found trail after trail of warparties crossing the valley northward signalsmokes and nightfires were in the hills beyond the evidence was conclusive to expert eyes but wayne said that all told no more than one hundred warriors could have gone out he was bent on going farther and seeing how many more there were ray as second in rank among the five officers present ventured to suggest that they had seen quite enough and that without delay they should either return directly to the regiment or send word wayne would not send because only a hundred tracks had been seen and by the time he had run over double that number the two scouts with them refused to go back we would be cut off and killed sure as fate was their comprehensive reason they bivouacked that night in the timber keeping out strong guards and pickets but with early dawn were astir moving back up the valley once again had ray offered a suggestion that they should put back during the night but wayne was nettled at the fact that rays prophecy had come true they had stayed too long and gone too far he was a john bull sort of fellow full of the ponderous bumptious courage which prompts the men of that illustrious island empire to be shot down like cattle by boers and zulus and arabs and afghans adhering rigidly to the tactics of waterloo to fight the scientific light troops of the savages sooner than depart from that which was the conventional british method of making war wayne was lacking only in moral courage he was afraid to say he was wrong and ray was right before they had gone two miles he was forced to admit it he was hemmed in on every side the valley had narrowed considerably just here and the bare rounded bluffs came down to within two hundred and fifty yards of the timber along the stream willows in sparse groups and cottonwoods in sunbleached foliage were scattered along the level bench on both sides of the riverbed broad wastes of sand extended in places from bank to bank and what water there was lay in heated pools here and there the white incrustation on the sand told of the strongly alkaline nature of the soil and the consequent impurity of the fluid the little column with scouts well out on front and flanks was moving four abreast up the south bank along their trail of the previous day every now and then some officer or man would note a new signalsmoke puffing up to the sky among the hills some distance off the valley and wayne was riding in rather sulky dignity at the head of the command he had come to the conclusion that he had done an idiotic thing the morning previous in pushing on down the valley after discovering beyond question that so many indians were already on the move he well knew that ray was the last man in the regiment to counsel avoiding danger unless it were danger which would prove overwhelming and for encountering which there could be no excuse he knew he had been idiotic now for he could see indications that indians were closing in on him from every side but worse than that he knew that he had added to his idiocy a performance that was simply asinine he had lost his temper and said an outrageous thing to ray and some of the men had heard it from earliest dawn the lieutenant had been out with the pickets eagerly scanning the surrounding country indians of course were not to be seen they kept out of sight behind the bluffs and ridges but their signals were floating skyward from half a dozen different points and ray knew it meant that they were calling in their forces to concentrate on this lone command at last he had gone to wayne who was sipping his coffee with as much deliberation as though the troops had nothing on earth to do all day captain wayne may i ask if anything further has been done towards getting word back to the regiment wayne looked curiously at his junior a moment he had the unpleasant conviction that whatever his own views might be the regiment generally would be more apt to back rays opinions as to the chances in indian fighting than they would his he could not complain of the lieutenants manner in the least but all the same he felt certain that ray had a higher opinion of his own judgment than he had of his the squadron commanders it was time to take him down why do you ask ray he said with assumed composure setting down his tin cup and motioning to the attendant that he desired to have it refilled because we are now pretty well hemmed in and unless word has gone there will be little chance of sending any well mr ray why should we send any because captain wayne we have neither ammunition nor provisions for a siege and the chances are in favor of our having to stand one oh trash ray i expected more nerve of you and you are the first man in the crowd to get stampeded for an instant there was danger of an explosion rays eyes blazed with wrath he would have burst into a fury of denunciation captain or no captain but there close at hand stood many silent groups of the men for once in his life ray said not a word for one long ten seconds he stood there looking wayne straight in the eye then turned on his heel and left him the captain would have given much to recall the words he knew their utter injustice he knew worse luck that if they succeeded in getting back to the th in safety about the very first thing he would be called upon to do would be to eat them for the moment he was rays commanding officer and there was no resenting them but once back with the th then there would be fun wayne rode for the first mile or so in sulky dignity as has been said ray was out in front with the scouts he had gone without saying a word to the commander and though that was a breach of etiquette the captain well knew that there of all others was the place for ray to be none of his other subalterns came near him there were only two dana and hunter and they were riding each at the head of the troop to which he was attached a young assistant surgeon was with the party and a civilian who had charge of the halfdozen packmules ambling alongside but even these men seemed indisposed to chat with the commanding officer the column was riding at ease but in silence no whistling joking or singing was going on to the right was the timber through which well to the front half a dozen skirmishers were pushing so as to secure the main body against surprise to the left full eight hundred yards away rose the low line of bluffs sweeping around the left front so as to approach the stream two or three men rode warily along their crest keeping sharp lookout to the south while scattered across the valley a like distance ahead were half a dozen active troopers the two guides and ray the latter easily recognized at that distance by his riding and by dandys elastic stride had discarded his coat and was moving rapidly from point to point in his darkblue scoutingshirt nearing the bluffs that bent around their front it could be seen that the guides were hanging back a little so were the skirmishers in advance but the men on the flanks pushed ahead no indians could be seen from their more elevated position theyre shy of that bluff said wayne between his teeth here mr dana send a sergeant and two sets of fours forward and stir them up a little wait a moment there goes ray sure enough ray and a couple of horsemen opening out considerably could be seen spurring diagonally across the bottom towards a point of bluffs that rose higher than the general line off to the left before they had gone two hundred yards out from the very crest of the bluff there leaped half a dozen quick puffs of smoke half a dozen little spirts of dust and sand flew up from the prairie near the three horsemen farthest to the front two of whose steeds were seen to veer and shy violently and then six sharp spiteful halfmuffled reports were borne on the still air even before the shots were heard wayne was turning in his saddle deploy to the front dana only your first platoon he added as the young officer was about throwing forward the whole troop look out for the bluffs on your left ill have hunter face them half front your line that way so as not to let them enfilade you im going right out to the front with that he rode back said a few words to hunter and then followed by his orderly trumpeter went thumping off at ponderous gallop towards his distant advance almost at the same instant the flankers on the bluffs to the left were seen waving their hats and spurring about in violent excitement pointing towards the south then they fired two or three wild shots in that direction and ducking as though to avoid return fire came sweeping down the slopes at full speed it was stirring to mark the bearing of the little command just then every man knew that the unseen foe was present in front and flank in heavy force every hand seemed nerved to sudden strength the horses tossed their heads and pricked up their ears looking eagerly in the direction of the firing in obedience to his orders dana was rapidly deploying his leading platoon and a sheaf of skirmishers went scattering out to the front in support of the advance while hunter left for the moment alone divined in an instant that the indians were coming with a rush upon the southern flank he wheeled his fours to the left and dismounting his skirmishers sent them at the doublequick out across the prairie not an instant too soon almost simultaneously the ridge to the south the bluffs out in front and even the narrow level between them and the timber fairly bristled with daring dashing horsemen the cheyennes in all their glory oh what a brilliant sight they made with plume and pennon floating warbonnet lance and shield the sunlight dancing on their barbaric ornaments of glistening brass or silver on brightlypainted naked forms on the trappings of their nimble ponies on rifle and spear all at full speed all ayell brandishing their weapons firing wildly into the valley leaping some of them for an instant to the ground to take better aim then like a flash to saddle and top speed again through every little swale over every ridge they popped like so many savage jacksinthebox and came swooping circling down on the little column at the oldtime tactics of the stampede warily though with all their clamor for though they whoop and yell and shoot and challenge they veer off to right or left long before they get within dangerous range of those silent skirmishers of hunters now sprawling in long blue line out on the dusty prairie ventre а terre and every fellow with his carbine at the front just praying the painted scamps will come a little closer warily in front too where ray is skilfully retiring face to the foe but keeping them back while wayne has time to return to the column and move his horses into the sheltering timber and prepare for vigorous defence it is the only course now open to him this is not civilized warfare remember and far different rules must govern it would be no difficult matter against ordinary troops to lead a dashing charge cut through the opposing line and so make his way back to the regiment of course many men might be unhorsed and wounded and so left behind but they would be cared for as prisoners until exchanged or the war was at an end but war with the indian means on his side war а outrance war to the cruellest death he can devise when he is cornered all he has to do is surrender and become the recipient of more attention and the victim of higher living than he ever dreamed of until he tried it and found it so pleasant that it paid him to go on the warpath every spring to have a royal old revel in blood and bestiality until fall and then yield to the blandishments of civilization for the winter but to officer or soldier capture means death and death by fiendish torture as a rule the indian fights for the glory and distinction it gives him he has everything to gain and nothing to lose the soldier of the united states fights the red man only because he is ordered to he has nothing to gain even glory for the senate has fixed a bar sinister on gallantry in indian warfare he has everything to lose however no words of mine will ever effect a change of political heart in such matters the fact remains that the one thing left for wayne to do finding himself cut off by some two hundred cheyennes was to take to the timber and stand them off by this time the fray was spirited and picturesque in the extreme the whole line of bluffs was alive with indians dashing to and fro occasionally swooping down as though to burst through or over the slender skirmish line others had swung clear around to the left and were circling about in the valley below them from all but the north side therefore the bullets came whistling in and occasionally some stricken horse would plunge and snort madly and one or two men were being assisted to the bank of the stream where the young doctor had already gone to work hunters dismounted men sturdily fronting the south and southeast were holding five times their force in check while rays and danas mounted skirmishers fronting southwest and west were slowly falling back fighting the cheyennes encircled them on every side but the north busy in getting his horses into shelter under the bank which was a few feet high and directing where the provisions and packmules should be placed wayne was suddenly accosted by ray if twenty men can be spared sir ill put them on that island pointing to a clump of willows and cottonwoods that stood along the opposite shore the indians are crossing above and below and well soon have their fire on our backs wayne was soldier enough to see the force of the suggestion he was man enough too to want to ask rays pardon for his language of the morning but there was only time to accede to the request the kentuckian still mounted on dandy was darting across the sandy space with a dozen or more of his men at his heels the island was a godsend in less than five minutes the warriors who had ventured across and were now seeking for a shot at the safetyroost along under the bank were met by a score of wellaimed bullets that drove them to cover dragging with them the lifeless body of one of their number spread out there men shouted wayne seize every point you can get on tother shore run upstream fifty yards or so and scoop holes for yourselves in the sand and then he rode out to the front again to superintend the retirement of his slender lines but all this time the firing had been rapid and almost incessant as the troopers came slowly in towards the timber and the cheyennes realized that it was impossible to drive them into panic or stampede they seemed to give far more attention to the accuracy of their aim and for this purpose the best shots had thrown themselves from their ponies and were striving to pick off the officers and prominent sergeants still the greater number remained in saddle whooping and yelling and darting to and fro at a comparatively safe distance banging away at anything or anybody within the soldier lines and offering tempting though difficult marks for the sorelytried skirmishers until he noted the distant warparties crossing to the north side of the stream ray had been riding up and down the lines checking the useless waste of ammunition everywhere his voice could be heard placid almost laughing at times as he rebuked the senseless longrange shooting of the men hold your fire men you cant hit those skipping jackrabbits half a mile away what on earth are you shooting at mulligan you couldnt hit a whole barn at that distance but all the same he was seriously worried he knew well that at the utmost there were no more than fifty rounds per man with the troopers and that rapid firing would soon reduce this to next to nothing the indications were that once hemmed in to the timber they would need every shot to stand off the cheyennes until relief could come and before galloping off to secure the timbered island in rear of their position and so form a partially protected corral for the horses he had cautioned dana and hunter to be most sparing in their fire to allow no shot unless the indians charged the foe on the contrary were flush with ammunition mr s cartridges were abundant among them and from east south and west the bullets were whizzing overhead ripping up little grass tufts from the prairie and raising a dust wherever they struck the mounted skirmishers sheered off into the timber quite early as they were being shot at from three sides sprang from their horses and took to the trees but before they could do so several casualties had occurred six horses were lying dead out on the prairie others were wounded and bleeding but worse than that two old arizona sergeants veterans of a dozen fights and five of the men were severely wounded rays efforts to keep down the return fire were futile as long as the men had cartridges and he was not about they would fire just as wayne the second time rode out to the front he found dana slowly dismounting are you hit he asked dana nodded pressed his hand to his side and saying nothing walked up to a neighboring cottonwood and leaned against it looking rather pale damn the luck growled wayne this wont do i must get the whole crowd under cover you get under yourself grinned dana that hat of yours looks like a sieve now yiip there goes your horse and forgetting his own pain he strove to aid the captain whose horse had suddenly plunged forward and was now rolling and kicking in the agony of death im all right dana poor old ned hes carried me many a mile here sergeant help the lieutenant back to the doctor go dana ill get the men where they belong were all right once we get in the timber and so little by little slowly and steadily the skirmishers fell back to the shelter of the trees there in big semicircle they were distributed each in a little hastily constructed riflepit or shelter of his own and by nine oclock this bright july morning the first phase of the combat was at an end and there was time to take account of stock dana was shot through the side by a henry or winchester bullet and was lying under the bank faint thirsty but plucky sergeant gwinn and two of the men were dead and eight men now needed the care of the surgeon three of them were senseless probably mortally hurt at least fifteen horses were killed or rendered useless the others were corralled under the bank where in a deep bend they were safe except from longrange fire rays men on the island had improved their advantage by seizing defensible positions on the north bank and as against two hundred and fifty indians with two days rations left with abundant water to be had by digging in the sand with pluck and spirit left for anything they were not badly off provided the indians were not heavily reinforced and provided their ammunition held out the cheyennes now resorted to other tactics leaving but few warriors scurrying about on the open prairie both north and south they gathered in force in the timber upand downstream and began their stealthy approaches keeping up all the time a sharp fire upon waynes position every now and then would come a frantic cry from some stricken horse as a random bullet took effect but few struck among the men the surgeon and the wounded were well sheltered in a concave hollow of the bank there was fortunately little wind with a gale blowing either upor downstream the indians could have fired the timber and soon driven them out this was well understood on both sides but the besieged knew as well that other methods would be resorted to and speedily they were developed the rattling fire that had been kept up ever since the first assault had died away to an occasional shot when suddenly from the downstream side there came a volley a chorus of frantic yells and then a pandemonium of shots shouts howls and screeches answered by the soldiers with their carbines and the billingsgate of some irrepressible humorist a savage attack had begun on hunters men even as wayne and ray bending low to avoid the storm went scurrying through the trees to his assistance followed by some half a dozen of the old hands there came from upstream just such another assault and in ten seconds every able man in the command was hotly engaged for gods sake captain dont let them waste their fire shouted ray ill go back to the other front and hold them there all right i understand ray you watch the same thing over there answered wayne who at another time would have resented any suggestions but had seen the value of rays words a dozen times that day damn it men fire slow dont throw away a shot let them come closer thats what we want he shouted to the soldiers who lying behind logs or kneeling among the trees were driving their missiles through the timber where the smokewreaths told of the otherwise invisible foe out on the prairie too the mounted warriors went careering about dashing at full speed towards the woods as though determined to charge but invariably veering off to right or left as they came within three hundred yards of course there was no direction from which the bullets did not come whizzing into the timber and men were more likely to be hit in the back than elsewhere one of the many disheartening features of such warfare almost every moment somebody was hit though at the time it could not be seen or known as all were too busy with what was in their front to look around once in a while too some lucky shot would send an indian pony to his knees out on the prairie or a warrior would drop and be borne off by a ducking dodging trio of his fellows then there would be a shout of triumph from the timber answering yells of rage and defiance from the foe but finally after nearly an hour of such savage work the cheyennes seemed to give it up then came another respite another taking of stock one of the scouts one who had refused to try and ride through to the regiment was shot dead and lay on his face among the trees so too were two more of the men while six were wounded and wayne himself had a flesh wound in the thigh the hot sun of noonday was pouring down and matters looked ugly do you know how much ammunition we have left asked mr ray in a low tone of the commanding officer about an hour later no said wayne looking anxiously in his face not twelve rounds to the man chapter xiv rays ride for life darkness has settled down in the shadowy wyoming valley by the light of a tiny fire under the bank some twenty forms can be seen stretched upon the sand they are wounded soldiers a little distance away are nine others shrouded in blankets they are the dead huddled in confused and cowering group are a few score horses many of them sprawled upon the sand motionless others occasionally struggle to rise or plunge about in their misery crouching among the timber vigilant but weary dispersed in big irregular circle around the beleaguered bivouac some sixty soldiers are still on the active list all around them vigilant and vengeful lurk the cheyennes every now and then the bark as of a coyote is heard a yelping querulous cry and it is answered far across the valley or down the stream there is no moon the darkness is intense though the starlight is clear and the air so still that the galloping hoofs of the cheyenne ponies far out on the prairie sound close at hand thats what makes it hard says ray who is bending over the prostrate form of captain wayne if it were storming or blowing or something to deaden the hoofbeats i could make it easier but its the only chance the only chance of what when the sun went down upon waynes timber citadel and the final account of stock was taken for the day it was found that with onefourth of the command men and horses killed and wounded there were left not more than three hundred cartridges all told to enable some sixty men to hold out until relief could come against an enemy encircling them on every side and who had only to send over to the neighboring reservation forty miles away and get all the cartridges they wanted mr would let their friends have them to kill buffalo though mr and their friends knew there wasnt a buffalo left within four hundred miles they could cut through of course and race up the valley to find the th but they would have to leave the wounded and the dismounted behind to death by torture so that ended the matter only one thing remained in some way by some means word must be carried to the regiment the chances were ten to one against the couriers slipping out up and down the valley out on the prairie on both sides of the stream the cheyennes kept vigilant watch they had their hated enemies in a deathgrip and only waited the coming of other warriors and more ammunition to finish them as the sioux had finished custer they knew though the besieged did not that the very evening before the th had marched away westward and were far from their comrades all they had to do was to prevent any ones escaping to give warning of the condition of things in waynes command all therefore were on the alert and of this there was constant indication the man or men who made the attempt would have to run the gauntlet the one remaining scout who had been employed for such work refused the attempt as simply madness he had lived too long among the indians to dare it yet wayne and ray and dana and hunter and the whole command for that matter knew that some one must try it who was it to be there was no long discussion wayne called the sulking scout a damned coward which consoled him somewhat but didnt help matters ray had been around the riflepits taking observations presently he returned leading dandy up near the fire the one sheltered light that was permitted looks fine as silk dont he he said smoothing his pets glossy neck and shoulder for rays groom had no article of religion which took precedence over the duty he owed the lieutenants horse and no sooner was the sun down than he had been grooming him as though still in garrison give him all the oats you can steal hogan some of the men must have a hatful left wayne looked up startled ray i cant let you go theres no helping it some one must go and who can you send even there the captain noted the grammatical eccentricity what was surprising was that even there he made no comment thereon he was silent ray had spoken truth there was no one whom he could order to risk death in breaking his way out since the scout had said twas useless there were brave men there who would gladly try it had they any skill in such matters but that was lacking if any man in the command could make it that man was ray he was cool daring keen he was their best and lightest rider and no one so well know the country or better knew the cheyennes wayne even wished that ray might volunteer there was only this about it the men would lose much of their grit with him away they swore by him and felt safe when he was there to lead or encourage but the matter was settled by ray himself he was already stripping for the race get those shoes off he said to the farrier who came at his bidding and dandy wonderingly looked up from the gunnysack of oats in which he had buried his nozzle what on earth could that blacksmith mean by tugging out his shoenails was his reflection though like the philosopher he was he gave more thought to his oats an unaccustomed luxury just then there seemed nothing to be said by anybody wayne rose painfully to his feet hunter stood in silence by and a few men grouped themselves around the little knot of officers ray had taken off his belt and was poking out the carbinecartridges from the loops there were not over ten then he drew the revolver carefully examined the chambers to see that all were filled motioned with his hand to those on the ground saying quietly pick those up yall may need every one of em the blue grass dialect seemed cropping out the stronger for his preoccupation got any spare colts he continued turning to wayne i only want another round these he stowed as he got them in the smaller loops on the right side of his belt then he bent forward to examine dandys hoofs again smooth them off as well as you can get me a little of that sticky mud there one of you men there ram that into every hole and smooth off the surface make it look just as much like a ponys as you know how they cant tell dandys tracks from their own then dont you see three or four pairs of hands worked assiduously to do his bidding still there was no talking no one had anything he felt like saying just then whos got the time he asked wayne looked at his watch bending down over the fire just nine fifteen all right i must be off in ten minutes the moon will be up at eleven dandy had finished the last of his oats by this time and was gazing contentedly about him ever since quite early in the day he had been in hiding down there under the bank he had received only one trifling clip though for half an hour at least he had been springing around where the bullets flew thickest he was even pining for his customary gallop over the springy turf and wondering why it had been denied him that day only a blanket and surcingle said ray to his orderly who was coming up with the heavy saddle and bags were riding to win tonight dandy and i and must travel light he flung aside his scouting hat knotted the silk handkerchief he took from his throat so as to confine the dark hair that came tumbling almost into his eyes buckled the holsterbelt tightly round his waist looked doubtfully an instant at his spurs but decided to keep them on then he turned to wayne a word with you captain the others fell back a short distance and for a moment the two stood alone speaking in low tones all else was silent except the feverish moan of some poor fellow lying sorely wounded in the hollow or the occasional pawing and stir among the horses in the dim light of the little fire the others stood watching them they saw that wayne was talking earnestly and presently extended his hand and they heard ray somewhat impatiently say never mind that now and noted that at first he did not take the hand but finally they came back to the group and ray spoke now fellows just listen a minute ive got to break out on the south side i know it better of course there are no end of indians out there but most of the crowd are in the timber above and below there will be plenty on the watch and it isnt possible that i can gallop out through them without being heard dandy and i have got to sneak for it until were spotted or clear of them then away we go i hope to work well out towards the bluffs before they catch a glimpse of me then lie flat and go for all im worth to where we left the regiment then you bet it wont be long before the old crowd will be coming down just a humping ill have em here by six oclock if indeed i dont find them coming ahead tonight just you keep up your grit and well do our level best dandy and i wont we old boy now i want to see dana a minute and the other wounded fellows and he went and bent down over them saying a cheery word to each and rough suffering men held out feeble hands to take a parting grip and looked up into his brave young face he had long known how the rank and file regarded him but had been disposed to laugh it off tonight as he stopped to say a cheering word to the wounded and looked down at some pale bearded face that had stood at his shoulder in more than one tight place in the old apache days in arizona and caught the same look of faith and trust in him something like a quiver hovered for a minute about his lips and his own brave eyes grew moist they knew he was daring death to save them but that was a view of the case that did not seem to occur to him at all at last he came to dana lying there a little apart the news that ray was going to ride for them had been whispered all through the bivouac by this time and dana turned and took rays hand in both his own god speed you old boy if you make it all safe get word to mother that i didnt do so badly in my first square tussel will you if i make it youll be writing it yourself this time tomorrow night even if i dont make it dont you worry lad the colonel and stannard aint the fellows to let us shift for ourselves with the country full of cheyennes theyll be down here in two days anyhow goodby dana keep your grip and well larrup em yet then he turned back to wayne hunter and the doctor one thing occurs to me hunter you and six or eight men take your carbines and go upstream with a dozen horses until you come to the riflepits be all ready if i get clear through you wont hear any row but if they sight or hear me before i get through then of course there will be the biggest kind of an excitement and youll hear the shooting the moment it begins give a yell fire your guns go whooping up the stream with the horses as though the whole crowd were trying to cut out that way but get right back the excitement will distract them and help me now goodby and good luck to you crowd ray will you have a nip before you try it you must be nearly used up after this days work and wayne held out his flask to him no i had some hot coffee just ten minutes ago and i feel like a fouryearold im riding new colors didnt you know it by jove he added suddenly this is my first run under the preakness blue even there and then he thought too quickly to speak her name now then some of you crawl out to the south edge of the timber with me and lie flat on the prairie and keep me in sight as long as you can he took one more look at his revolver im drawing to a bobtail if i fail ill bluff if i fill ill knock spots out of any threes in the cheyenne outfit three minutes more and the watchers at the edge of the timber have seen him leading dandy by the bridle slowly stealthily creeping out into the darkness a moment the forms of man and horse are outlined against the stars then are swallowed up in the night hunter and the sergeants with him grasp their carbines and lie prone upon the turf watching waiting in the bivouac is the stillness of death ten soldiers carbine in hand mounted on their unsaddled steeds are waiting in the darkness at the upper riflepits for hunters signal if he shout every man is to yell and break for the front otherwise all is to remain quiet back at the watchfire under the bank wayne is squatting watch in one hand pistol in the other near by lie the wounded still as their comrades just beyond the dead all around among the trees and in the sandpits upand downstream fourscore men are listening to the beating of their own hearts in the distance once in a while is heard the yelp of coyote or the neigh of indian pony in the distance too are the gleams of indian fires but they are far beyond the positions occupied by the besieging warriors darkness shrouds them far aloft the stars are twinkling through the cool and breezeless air with wind or storm or tempest the gallant fellow whom all hearts are following would have something to favor something to aid but in this almost cruel stillness nothing under god can help him nothing but darkness and his own brave spirit if i get through this scrape in safety mutters wayne between his set teeth the th shall never hear the last of this work of rays if i get through this night mutters ray to himself far out on the prairie now where he can hear tramping hoofs and guttural voices it will be the best run ever made for the sanford blue though i do make it nearly five minutes have passed and the silence has been unbroken by shot or shout the suspense is becoming unbearable in the bivouac where every man is listening hardly daring to draw breath at last hunter rising to his knees which are all a tremble with excitement mutters to sergeant roach who is still crouching beside him by heaven i believe hell slip through without being seen hardly has he spoken when far far out to the southwest two bright flashes leap through the darkness before the report can reach them there comes another not so brilliant then the ringing bang bang of two rifles the answering crack of a revolver quick men go yells hunter and darts headlong through the timber back to the stream there is a sudden burst of shots and yells and soldier cheers a mighty crash and sputter and thunder of hoofs up the streambed a foot dash yelling like demons of the men at the west end in support of the mounted charge in the bed of the stream for a minute or two the welkin rings with shouts shots mainly those of the startled indians then there is as sudden a rush back to cover without a man or horse hurt or missing in the excitement and darkness the cheyennes could only fire wild but now the night air resounds with taunts and yells and triumphant warwhoops for full five minutes there is a jubilee over the belief that they have penned in the white soldiers after their dash for liberty then little by little the yells and taunts subside something has happened to create discussion in the cheyenne camps for the crouching soldiers can hear the liveliest kind of a powwow far upstream what does it mean has ray slipped through or have they caught him despite pain and weakness wayne hobbles out to where sergeant roach is still watching and asks for tidings i cant be sure captain one things certain the lieutenant rode like a gale i could follow the shots a full halfmile up the valley where they seemed to grow thicker and then stop all of a sudden in the midst of the row that was made down here theyve either given it up and have a big party out in chase or else theyve got him god knows which if theyve got him therell be a scalpdance over there in a few minutes curse them and the sergeant choked wayne watched some ten minutes without avail nothing further was seen or heard that night to indicate what had happened to ray except once far up the valley he saw a couple of flashes among the bluffs so did roach and that gave him hope that dandy had carried his master in safety that far at least he crept back to the bank and cheered the wounded with the news of what he had seen then another word came in ere long an old sergeant had crawled out to the front and could hear something of the shouting and talking of the indians he could understand few words only though he had lived among the cheyennes nearly five years they can barely understand one another in the dark and use incessant gesticulation to interpret their own speech but the sergeant gathered that they were upbraiding somebody for not guarding a coulйe and inferred that some one had slipped past their pickets or they wouldnt be making such a row that the cheyennes did not propose to let the besieged derive much comfort from their hopes was soon apparent out from the timber up the stream came sonorous voices shouting taunt and challenge intermingled with the vilest expletives they had picked up from their cowboy neighbors and all the frontier slang in the cheyenne vocabulary hullo sogers come out some more times we no shoot stay there we come plenty quick hullo white chief come fight fair soger heap fraid come have scalpdance plenty quick catch white soldier eat him heart bime by ah go to your grandmother the ould witch in hell ye musthardsthriped convict sings out some irrepressible paddy in reply and wayne who is disposed to serious thoughts would order silence but it occurs to him that mulligans crude sallies have a tendency to keep the men lively i cant believe theyve got him he whispers to the doctor if they had they would soon recognize him as an officer and come bawling out their triumph at bagging a chief his watch his shoes his spurs his underclothing would all betray that he was an officer though he hasnt a vestige of uniform pray god he is safe will you follow ray and see curiosity is what lures the fleetest deer to death and a more dangerous path than that which ray has taken one rarely follows will you try it reader just you and i come on then well see what our kentucky boy got in the draw as he would put it rays footfall is soft as a kittens as he creeps out upon the prairie dandy stepping gingerly after him wondering but obedient for over a hundred yards he goes until both upand downstream he can almost see the faint fires of the indians in the timber farther out he can hear hoofbeats and voices so he edges along westward until he comes suddenly to a depression a little winding cooley across the prairie through which in the early spring the snows are carried off from some ravine among the bluffs into this he noiselessly feels his way and dandy follows he creeps along to his left and finds that its general course is from the southwest he knows well that the best way to watch for objects in the darkness is to lie flat on low ground so that everything approaching may be thrown against the sky his plainscraft tells him that by keeping in the watercourse he will be less apt to be seen but will surely come across some lurking indians that he expects the thing is to get as far through them as possible before being seen or heard then mount and away after another two minutes creeping he peers over the western bank now the fires upstream can be seen in the timber and dim shadowy forms pass and repass then close at hand come voices and hoofbeats dandy pricks up his ears and wants to neigh but ray grips his nostrils like a vice and dandy desists at rapid lope within twenty yards a party of half a dozen warriors go bounding past on their way down the valley and no sooner have they crossed the gulley than he rises and rapidly pushes on up the dry sandy bed thank heaven there are no stones a minute more and he is crawling again for the hoofbeats no longer drown the faint sound of dandys movements a few seconds more and right in front of him not a stones throw away he hears the deep tones of indian voices in conversation whoever they may be they are in the cooley and watching the prairie they can see nothing of him nor he of them pass them in the tenfootwide ravine he cannot he must go back a short distance make a sweep to the east so as not to go between those watchers and the guiding fires then trust to luck turning stealthily he brings dandy around leads back down the ravine for some thirty yards then turns to his horse pats him gently one minute do your prettiest for your colors my boy he whispers springs lightly noiselessly to his back and at cautious walk comes up on the level prairie with the timber behind him three hundred yards away southward he can see the dim outline of the bluffs westward once that little arroya is crossed he knows the prairie to be level and unimpeded fit for a race but he needs to make a dйtour to pass the indians guarding it get way beyond them cross it to the west far behind them and then look out for stray parties dandy ambles lightly along eager for fun and little appreciating the danger ray bends down on his neck intent with eye and ear he feels that he has got well out east of the indian picket unchallenged when suddenly voices and hoofs come bounding up the valley from below he must cross their front reach the ravine before them and strike the prairie beyond go dandy he mutters with gentle pressure of leg and the sorrel bounds lightly away circling southwestward under the guiding rein another minute and he is at the arroya and cautiously descending then scrambling up the west bank and then from the darkness comes savage challenge a sputter of pony hoofs ray bends low and gives dandy one vigorous prod with the spur and with muttered prayer and clinched teeth and fists he leaps into the wildest race for his life bang bang go two shots close behind him crack goes his pistol at a dusky form closing in on his right then come yells shots the uproar of hoofs the distant cheer and charge at camp a breathless dash for and close along under the bluffs where his form is best concealed a whirl to the left into the first ravine that shows itself and despite shots and shouts and nimble ponies and vengeful foes the sanford colors are riding far to the front and all the racers of the reservations cannot overhaul them chapter xv rescue at dawn the short july night wears rapidly away in the high latitudes of the northwest it is barely dark at nine and in six hours morn in the white wake of the morning star comes furrowing all the orient into gold yet the night wears wearily watchfully away in the bivouac down among the cottonwoods south of the black hills exhausted with the excitement and fatigue of the day some few men sleep fitfully at times and other few doze once in a while among the watchers all the livelong night there is jubilee among the indians above and below they keep up their howlings and wardances in prospective triumph for so far as they can learn they have done no more damage to the soldiers than the killing of a few horses and the wounding of some half a dozen men their own loss has been greater than that and there is mourning for some of the braves slain in the combat of the day they know that escape is impossible to the soldiers they feel that with another day they can wear out the besieged tempt them into firing off their ammunition and if they can only keep off their friends the regiment they have them sure all the same it is pleasing to indian ideas of humor to keep up a delusion among the besieged of having captured their messenger we know ray is safely off but wayne and his men have no such comfort for for hours the indians shout their taunts of catch white soger eat um heart and in their deep anxieties many of the men seem ready to believe it to tell the truth wayne has hard work keeping up the pluck and spirits of some of the men and towards morning the sufferings of the wounded are more than he can bear every little while the roystering indians send a rattling fusillade in among the timbers but do no great damage beyond making people uncomfortable some of them crawl close to the lines of sentries but find nothing to encourage further inspection or advance but dana begs to be lifted in his blanket and carried some distance upstream where he can lie on the sand and get away from the sound of others suffering and wayne and hunter with two or three men bear him thither and there under the starlight and the waning moon they lie at full length and softly talk over the situation there is no disguising the truth their condition is most precarious hemmed in on every side ammunition almost gone thanks to the reckless extravagance of the men in twelve hours fighting their only hope lies in rays reaching the th that night and routing out the whole command for a dash to the rescue they never dreamed poor fellows that ray would never find the th where they left it all hope would have died had they known their comrades had gone yet that very circumstance stands at this moment in their favor the cheyennes had learned with huge delight that the strange soldiers had marched off westward apparently abandoning that watch near the reservations and leaving it safe for them to scurry forth with bag and baggage with women and children on their rush for freedom and sitting bull sighting this little detachment of soldiers venturing on down the valley instead of hurrying back they had signalled all over the country calling in warparties to their aid and formulated their scheme to ambuscade and corral it at the narrows of the valley but rays vigilance and plainscraft had defeated that scheme though they had good chances yet if they only knew where the regiment had gone late the previous evening it had disappeared behind a prominent headland far up a valley farther to the south and probably had there gone into camp for the night late this night they get the news that gives rise to vast speculation and some genuine anxiety runners come in who say that instead of camping there the white chief rode all night turned northward soon as it was dark crossed this very valley far above them at dawn and where he went from there they couldnt say they dare not follow was it possible the white chief was going to beat them at their own tactics could it be that he was going to head them off attack them in the early morning far to the northwest lying on the ground the officers heard many hoofbeats dying away in the distance and wondered what it might mean it meant that some fifty of their foemen had galloped away to look for their families and the rest of the band and warn them of the new danger it was more than certain that no help could come to the soldiers in the valley but they must guard their people against this mysterious move at daybreak those left behind would resume the effort to dislodge the soldiers and then there would be a revel and daybreak comes all too soon far to the east the stars are paling and a grayish veil rises slowly from the horizon one by one the nightlamps in the heavens lose their sparkle and radiance as the filament of the dawn shrouds and stifles them far down the valley tumbling outlines of ridge and height are carved out in sharper relief against the lightening sky there is a stir in the leaves oerhead and the soft rustle of the morning breeze presently the pallid veil at the east takes on a purplish blush that is changing every instant to a ruddier hue faces are beginning to be dimly visible in the groups of defenders pinched and drawn and cold in the nipping air and wayne notes with a half sob how blue poor danas lips are the boys thoughts are far away is he wandering is it fever already his eyes are closed and he whispered to himself but a moment ago hunter is taking a catnap wayne is too anxious too unhappy to sleep and his wound is stiff and painful a veteran first sergeant comes creeping up to them for orders and they are brief enough dont let the men waste a shot its our only hope of holding out until help can come theyll be on us again soon as it is fairly light captain whispers dana have you been awake all the time yes lad why have you heard nothing no signal nothing not a sound why do you ask im afraid ive been only dreaming yet i thought i surely thought a while ago i heard a trumpetcall far away far out on the prairie which way dana off to the southwest i didnt like to speak of it but i thought i heard it twice if ray got through all right thats where the th should be coming from it may be dana it may be for theyd lose no time though ray thought six would be the earliest hour at which he could fetch them even at a trot its only about three now or a little after ill put men on watch and have them listen go and bring the trumpeter to me he said to one of the men the light grows broader every moment already forms can be dimly distinguished up and down the streambed and mounted indians darting about out on the prairie a sergeant comes up to the group of officers with quiet salute those fellows upstream are getting ready captain several of them mounted a few minutes ago and rode away rapidly towards the southwest i saw others out on the prairie heading over to the bluffs they seemed excitedlike and looked to be in full fighting trim danas eyes light with eager hope captain they heard what i did some of our fellows are off there taking short cut across country to find us and are signalling with their trumpets let us go farther out to the prairie im sure i heard it and we can answer almost broad daylight now though it is long before sunup but in very short time wayne dana and the trumpeter are crouching just at the edge of the timber listening listening while a prayer goes up with every heartbeat at last danas weakness tells upon him he sinks down at the bottom of a tree exhausted but his ears are still alert suddenly he springs again to his knee there for gods sake listen what is that and far far out to the southwest far beyond the line of bluffs there rises upon the still morning air soft clear floating and oh sweeter than the harmonies of seraphs the quick joyous notes of officers call oh heaven was ever reveille so blessed up with you rheinhart answer them blow your whole soul into it but make em hear shouts wayne and the burly young prussian rolls over on his back braces his copper clarion at his lips and rouses the echoes of the valley with the ringing jubilant pealing reply none of the dolorous business of roland at roncesvalles about rheinharts performance this time it is like the buglehorn of roderick vich alpine dhu one blast were worth a thousand men from riflepit and stunted log from shore to shore the timber leaps into life and rings with the triumphant cheers of the besieged down with you you idiots back to your holes yell the officers none too soon for with vengeful howls every indian in the valley seems at the instant to open fire and once more the little command is encircled by the cordon of savage sharpshooters holding their own fire except where some rabid young foeman too daringly exposes himself the men wait and listen little by little the fury of the attack draws away and only scattering shots annoy them they can see though that already many indians are mounting and scurrying off to the north side of the valley though plenty remain in the timber to keep vigilant watch over their every move hunter begs permission to mount and move out with twenty men to guide the rescuers but there is no ammunition to warrant it all men are needed just where they are scattering shots keep coming in the yells of the indians still continue the trumpeter raises a lusty blast from time to time but officers and men are again all eagerly listening theyre coming theyre coming is next the cry for distant shots are heard then the thunder of hoofs the shouts and yells of excited indians then warrior after warrior comes darting back over the bluffs at the south springing from his pony at the crest as though for one more shot at rapidlyadvancing foe more shots and yells a trumpetblare and then then ringing like clarion over the turmoil of the fight echoing far across the still valley the sound of a glorious voice shouting the wellknown words of command left front into line gallop and dana can hold in no longer almost sobbing he cries aloud jack truscott by all thats glorious id know the voice among a million who in the th would not who in the old regiment had not leaped at its summons time and again who that was there will ever forget the scene the welcome those wellnigh hopeless fellows give it now danas men break from their cover and cheering madly go dashing through the timber towards their persecutors of the day before hunters skirmishers push eastward through the trees for one more crack at the besiegers others cheering too yet spellbound cling to the spot and go wild with joy as the long blue line comes flashing into view across the bluffs from the south the just rising sun flaming at their crests and tinting the wild warbonnets of the foe who go tumbling and scurrying away before them and their old adjutant comes thundering down the slopes with ninety splendid troopers at his heels sweeping the valley of their late humiliation riding home to the rescue fired by the sight some of waynes men seize their saddles and throw them on their excited steeds but before they can mount truscotts men are whirling up and down the valley driving the few remaining warriors to the other side and leaving some wounded ponies and two bedizened braves prone upon the prairies quickly the leader comes darting through the timber with hearty yet laughing greeting for wayne and a wave of the hand to the cheering group there is no time for compliments now out go the skirmishers across the river bottom through the trees and spinning away across the valley northward whirling the cheyennes before them until they are driven to the bluffs then as the halt is sounded and the vigilant line forms big semicircle to ward off further attack and the little packmules with their escort come ambling briskly in from the south jack truscott comes quietly back lining his broadbrimmed scoutinghat and wiping the sweat from his brow and as they throng about him officers and men almost the first question asked is and where is ray safe but badly wounded and then little by little the story was told but for ray no rescue could have come the regiment was miles away across country truscotts squadron had reached their late camp the previous evening to find them gone there was a stockade there where with underground defences and stout palings a little company of infantry stood guard over a lot of ammunition and supplies they found there the sick and two wounded of the regiment a doctor and some scouts who had backed out of going and they also found a letter to truscott from the colonel commanding telling him that wayne ought to be somewhere west of him up the next valley to push on and join him and then together they would be strong enough to ride through the cheyenne trails and find the regiment fearing that wayne would get too far up the valley truscott decided to make a night march due north and strike it some distance upstream from four pm until eleven they had rested then had coffee fed the horses and started somewhere about one oclock through the dim light of the waning moon they caught sight of a mounted man rapidly nearing them from the east and heard the whinny of a horse that was enough to prove twas no indian who could it be one or two flankers galloped to meet him and the next thing a sergeant came rushing to truscott at the head of column my god captain its lootnant ray an hes most dead in an instant truscott had halted the command and was at the side of his old friend whom the men had lowered weak and faint to the ground the surgeon came administered stimulant examined and rebound his wound a bullet had torn through the right thigh and he had bled fearfully but all he seemed to think of was the errand on which he came in few words he told of waynes position pointed out the shortest way and bade them be off at once three men were left with him one galloped back to the station for an ambulance and the hospital attendant there and with his faint blessing and good luck to you fellows ray had sent them at lively lope bound for the valley and the rescue there were men that july morning who hid their heads to hide their tears as truscott quietly told of rays heroism and suffering his narrow escape his imminent dangers all met and borne that they might live there were others who cared not if their tears were seen there was no one there who did not vow that it would go hard with him if ever man ventured to malign billy ray in his presence but there was no one there who dreamed that even while daring death to save them the man whose praise was on every lip stood bitterly in need of friends that blackest calumny that lowest intrigue had conspired to pull him down it was a week before the four companies rejoined the th and the reunited regiment pushed northwestward towards the big horn mountains but by that time ray with other wounded was being carefully wheeled back to russell where the news of his heroic exploit had preceded him and where widely different feelings had thereby been excited one household heard it as it will never be forgotten mrs truscott and miss sanford were just seating themselves at breakfast one bright morning when mrs stannard came rushing in all aglow with mingled excitement and emotion hurrah for the sanford colors she cried read that i cannot i cannot and throwing them a long despatch she astonished her nextdoor neighbors by fairly bursting into tears it was with difficulty that the ladies could recover composure in time for the inevitable visit that they knew must come from mrs whaling and did come at ten oclock chapter xvi how we heard the news some strange things had been happening at russell among others the midnight serenade at mrs truscotts had been repeated miss sanford and mrs truscott both heard it this time and when mrs truscott would have gone to the window to peep and see who it was who sang so delightfully miss sanford restrained her quietly saying that this was his second visit and she knew it to be sergeant wolf mrs turner and other ladies eagerly and naturally curious to find out who it was that serenaded one house in the garrison twice and similarly honored no others had plied mrs truscott with questions it was agreed that they should tell mrs stannard and seek her advice but avoid all talk with others such resolutions are all very well but rather impracticable in view of the indomitable energy with which the sex will pursue a train of inquiry it was delightfully romantic said the ladies delightfully sensational some of them thought and their theory was that some one must be paying his devotions in this way to miss sanford which would account for his total obliviousness to the charms of others married and single mr gleason when first questioned had assumed that air of conscious negation of confirmatory disclaimer which is calculated to impress the hearer with the belief that despite denial he was deserving the soft impeachment gleason would gladly have assumed the responsibility for a whole day he was the hero to many feminine minds of the serenades and the recipient of a dozen warm invitations to come and sing for them that evening but before nightfall one theory received a shock which was followed in an hour by another the first was when mrs whaling placidly asserted that she knew all about the serenades that while the supposed unknown had honored miss sanfords window twice it was getting to be an old story at the colonels as the troubadour had appeared under her cecilias window almost every night for oh she didnt know how long cecilia had blushingly confessed that morning and she mrs whaling had frequently heard his tinkling guitar and sweet tenor at odd times now among the infantry ladies it was an older story that fair cecilia had a way of arrogating to herself attentions never intended for her and of having a fertility of invention which enabled her at a moments notice to discount any story of devotions to another girl with exuberant descriptions of others more intense of which she was the prior object any statement of her sainted child was promptly backed by her adoring mother and well there was disbelief not loud but deep of this statement among the infantry ladies as for ours mrs stannard listened in silence but with glistening eyes mrs truscott and miss sanford with evident relief mrs turner and mrs wilkins with exclamatory interest the second shock came when a party of ladies miss cecilia whaling being of the number alluded to mr gleason as the probable manrico and this for the purpose of drawing out mrs turner nonsense said mrs turner mr gleason has no more voice than a frog he thinks he can sing but you just ought to hear him why but mrs turner said one of the fair advocates eager to sustain the theory she advanced mr gleason as much as admitted that he was the man he of course he would mr gleason imagines there is no accomplishment he does not possess if you need conviction ask him to sing ah me and this was the same lady who so vehemently stood up for gleason in the days when he was her devotee before she discovered that poker had attractions for him before which her own could but pale their ineffectual fires tantжne animis coelestibus irж if it wasnt gleason then who was it that was what the ladies demanded to know mrs turner and mrs wilkins being as determined as their sisters of the infantry it was evident all too soon that the subject annoyed and embarrassed mrs truscott she colored painfully when it was mentioned in her presence this only whetted the zeal and inquisitiveness of the inquisitors in one form or other it was constantly being brought up in her presence and her every look and gesture was narrowly scanned mrs turner grew wild with curiosity here was a mystery indeed from mrs stannard she could extract nothing from miss sanford she received smiling gracious treatment at all times but nothing tangible in the way of information she almost made up her mind to be gracious to mr gleason to be enticing in fact but before her wiles could take effect other developments had rendered that course impracticable gleason himself as we have seen had taken prompt measures to satisfy himself as to the identity of the serenader his next step was to institute inquiries as to just what was meant by these demonstrations on part of the sergeant insidious questions were propounded to mrs stannard mrs truscott and miss sanford only to mystify him the more they would say nothing to enlighten him but he plainly saw that each one of the three was conscious that wolf was the midnight visitor and that two of the three were in possession of knowledge with regard to the mysterious soldier which he could not fathom he took to studying wolf sent for him frequently had long talks with him ostensibly as to his duties with recruits but began to draw him out as to his past all he could learn was that he had come to this country determined to enlist had served a few months with truscott at the point and had secured a transfer because he wanted active service he declined to tell what had been his connections or his life before coming to our shores but he was evidently a man of education and refinement he was an admirable horseman swordsman and drillmaster he had evidently been trained for the military profession now how was it that he had so readily acceded to the detail which kept him on duty at russell when if he so wanted active service he could have been sent with the regiment gleasons one interpretation of that was that the sergeant loved alas above his station it behooved him now to find out which of the ladies at truscotts had inspired this romantic passion it occurred to him that the discovery might be made very useful he was plainly losing ground there invitations to tea and dinner had not been forthcoming since truscotts squadron marched away and his efforts to see miss sanford alone had been frustrated having secured the detail which kept him at the post while the regiment was out roughing it he relaxed the assiduity of his attentions to mrs whaling but kept up his hand with the old colonel through the medium of pool and billiards though he lost less frequently he was always having confidential chats with the colonel and when captain buxton came through on his way to catch the regiment three days after rays departure gleason took him to see the colonel and the three were closeted for some time together it worried mrs stannard who felt sure there was mischief brewing and she so wrote to the major who tackled buxton the moment he joined with questions about ray and buxton was dumb as sam wellers drum with a hole in it ray was there and chipper as a cricket everybody noted how blithe buoyant and energetic he was but this very trait prevented stannards having more than one talk with him before the separation of waynes command from the regiment ray was off on scouts from morning till night stannard frankly told him how worried he had been and ray looked amazed declaring he had never been more temperate and that his accounts were straight as a string he had played billiards but had not touched a card when told of the allegation that he had been incessantly with rallston and had cut loose from buxton and gleason ray replied that it was incomprehensible to him how any man who knew buxton and gleason could blame him for that he never spoke to gleason and as the two were always together he had no wish to embarrass their good times he was with rallston his brotherinlaw who had been most kind hospitable and jolly but ray went on to say he found that rallston tried to be sharp in palming off some inferior horses upon them and he had blocked it this had caused a split so to speak but nothing of consequence as he had immediately started to rejoin more than this there was no time to talk of ray went with wayne stannard with the th and they saw nothing more of each other for many a long day meantime gleason was getting in his work stannard had written briefly to his wife to tell her what ray had said but she was a keen judge of character and she could not but note the reticence and evident embarrassment of the young adjutant at russell a courteous and highminded fellow whenever she mentioned rays name failing in his effort to extract information from sergeant wolf gleason changed his methods he began worrying him restricting his movements in various ways and hampering him with corrections and suggestions one day a bandsman who was excellent as a clarionetand violinplayer took his dischargepapers on expiration of term of service and the bandmaster appeared at the adjutants office with sergeant wolf to announce that the sergeant was even a better musician than the discharged man and was desirous of giving up his lance rank and entering the band colonel whaling and his adjutant were delighted to make a temporary transfer to meet the case and to write to mr billings for regimental sanction all too late gleason heard of and tried to stop it it took wolf out of his control and compelled him to resort to watching him he had so palpably given it to be understood that he was the sweet singer who had entranced the garrison in his midnight serenades that gleason now felt he could not go to the adjutant and tell him that wolf was the man and that he must pen him up at night indeed he rather wanted to have more of the serenading he sniffed a scandal and in his resentment at mrs truscotts evident avoidance of him and miss sanfords serene indifference he was beginning to feel that he could welcome anything that would besmirch their names or cloud their domestic peace from his soldier servant he learned that wolf spent hours in writing letters most of which he burned or tore up that he held himself aloof from the bandsmen and was trying to get a little room to himself every night when he was officer of the day and occasionally when he was not gleason patrolled that back fence in search of wolf and one night he was rewarded he sprang suddenly from his hidingplace and the soldier turned and ran like a deer distancing gleason in no time but in his flight he had dropped a letter gleason could hardly believe his eyes when he saw it lying there upon the ground it bore no superscription but in three minutes the lieutenant had rushed to his quarters locked the doors and shut himself up with his prize the family next door was startled by the shout of triumph and delight with which he read the last lines he almost kissed the letter in his ecstasy he hardly slept that night from excitement and it was the very next morning that russell was electrified by the telegraphic news that the th had had sharp fighting that the main body of the regiment early in the morning three days previous had met and driven back to the reservation a large force of cheyennes seeking to join sitting bull that captain waynes squadron had been surrounded and cut off by others of the same tribe and rescued by truscotts squadron at the same instant that the fight was going on at the war bonnet that waynes people would undoubtedly have been massacred to a man as their ammunition was spent but for the heroism of ray who had run the gauntlet through the cheyennes all alone in the darkness found truscotts squadron going rapidly away in another direction turned him to the rescue just in the nick of time and now weak and wounded was being sent in to russell that there had been several men killed quite a number wounded and that among these latter were blake wayne and dana and that blake too would be sent to russell further particulars came every hour or two every report had something additional to say of rays valor and though he ground his teeth in rage at the thought of rays temporary exaltation gleason was philosopher enough to know that no man was long a hero in garrison life and so took advantage of the excitement to go and besiege the ladies with congratulations how could they exclude him at such a time grace was in an ecstasy of pride and joy over her jacks splendid charge and marion sanford who gloried in deeds of valor sat wondering if it were really true that she knew the man whose name was on every lip gallant daring ray that that even then as truscott wired them he never forgot he was riding for her colors but it was delicious to hear gleason i cannot rejoice too much ladies that it was the troop i so long commanded that made the decisive charge they have fulfilled my highest expectations was an oft repeated remark and when mrs whaling came the second time to dispense tearful felicitations she found him ready to say amen to her pious suggestions that they should unite in praise and prayer to the throne of mercy the man was indeed a rogue in grain veneered with sanctimonious theory they grace and marion had early fled to their rooms and knelt in overwhelming gratitude to thank the god they worshipped for the mercy vouchsafed to those so near to them he the twofaced villain held in his pocket at that moment the letter with which he meant to crush the woman who had dared to hold him aloof as yet however he had no intention of immediately using it for the time being the general rejoicing among the ladies made it possible for even a shirk like gleason to be among them a good deal they could talk of nothing but how splendid it was to be with the regiment and how admirably this or that officer had behaved and one would suppose that such conversation would have been galling to an ablebodied listener but that pachydermatous quality to which allusion has been made stood gleason in good stead he smiled serenely at all their shafts and spoke of the deeds of the regiment quite as though he had been an active participant he hung around truscotts quarters a good deal bringing all manner of trivial items of news from time to time and even manufacturing them that he might have an excuse to see the ladies he was so constantly there on pretext after pretext that he overdid the matter annoyed both the ladies by his persistency and his covert allusions to wolf and occasional flings at ray they begged mrs stannard to devise means to rid them of him at last and one afternoon when he appeared at the door and walked past the servant into the hall as was his custom the maid had twice to repeat the ladies beg to be excused before he would hear it say to mrs truscott with my compliments that i have some further news of the regiment he said in a voice he knew would penetrate the rooms on the second floor and it did but mrs stannard was there he had already called and spent an hour that very morning and the ladies had determined to check it mrs truscotts compliments said the maid smilingly as she came tripping down the stairs the ladies are lying down and would he please leave word if it was anything important of course mrs truscott would come oh no said gleason loudly say ill call this evening after retreat but when he came they were all on the piazza mrs stannard too and he knew that he could not be too careful what tidings or rumors he manufactured in her presence again on the following morning he presented himself with similar plea this time the ladies begged to be excused will you say to miss sanford that i would greatly like to see her a few minutes he persisted and then miss sanford came to head of the stairs no further what is it mr gleason i cannot come down she said very civilly but uncompromising for all that er i hoped you felt like er taking a walk or something thanks mr gleason i am too busy today well shall we say tomorrow then he persevered tomorrow i go riding with mrs stannard do you what time perhaps i can arrange to take a gallop at the same hour youve never ridden with me yet reproachfully you will have to ask mrs stannard now mr gleason i must go back to my desk goodmorning and she vanished sweet and smiling and he went off mad swearing mad that very afternoon an ambulance arrived from laramie with ray oh what a jubilee they had and how those women fluttered around him as he sat in a low recliningchair on the piazza of the quarters made ready for him a young assistant surgeon was with him whom ray cajoled and bullied alternately called him such military pet names as pills squills and sawbones whenever he had occasion to address him laughed him out of all his feeble protests against exciting himself and bade him reserve his ministrations for blake who would be in on the morrow the evening he came after he had been shaved and bathed and rebandaged and had his hair trimmed and had donned a very swell brandnew fatigue uniform in which he looked remarkably natty and well despite a slight pallor ray had insisted on being trundled up the row in a wheeled chair and there at mrs stannards they had a little rejoicing of their own ray and the young surgeon being surrounded by the ladies of the th for an hour when mrs wilkins had to go off to her brood mrs turner to visit some infantry friends and then awhile longer miss sanford sat and listened to the eager talk of mrs stannard and grace with the darkeyed cavalryman and those dark eyes of his sought hers every other minute they tried to get him to talk of his ride even grace declaring that he must and turning laughingly to her friend exclaimed come maidie add your plea you have a right to know how your colors went and miss sanfords face flamed with its sudden blush but she spoke no word mrs stannard smiling and happy but seeing everything as usual noted that ray too had flushed underneath the deep tan of his frontier complexion but he came to the rescue blithely as ever ah miss sanford it would have been easy enough if i had only had monarchist though dandy did nobly bless him it was a blissful evening and all too short for the doctor simply ended it by wheeling ray home at nine oclock and putting him to bed for two days more he was incessantly up the row in his wheeled chair twice gleason saw him tкteаtкte with miss sanford on the piazza and the garrison ladies were slyly twitting him with his prospects of being cut out the whole garrison by this time saw that he and ray were not on speaking terms blake too had arrived a little cross and crabbed for him as his wounds were painful consisting mainly of bruises where his wounded horse had fallen and rolled with him but he could limp about and swear and distort the poetry of the old masters and be savage and cynical he hated gleason ridiculed him in public and hailed him as a military malvolio see how he jets neath his anything but advancиd plumes he spouted as gleason came gallanting some of the garrison ladies down the line desperately hoping to make miss sanford jealous gleason couldnt for the life of him explain what blake meant but he knew there was sarcasm in it and hated him all the same it would be but a few days before both the wounded officers would be able to perform light duty there came a telegraphic inquiry as to that from way up at fort fetterman the colonel wanted to know and old whaling was pleased to send the response but it was a blow to gleason within fortyeight hours it brought other telegraphic orders from division headquarters to send lieutenant gleason at once to fort fetterman to join his regiment at the earliest possible moment there was visible rejoicing in the garrison gleason had a vehement interview with the post commander and galloped off to town where he spent much time telegraphing and awaiting replies then to wear off the tedium of the intervening hours he resorted to several haunts well known to the inhabitants of those days and did more or less betting on uncertain games and much more wrestling with an insidious enemy he was crazy drunk when lifted from the hack at his quarters late that night and his orders were to take stage for fetterman at three pm the following day captain webb returning from his kansas court would reach cheyenne at noon and go by same conveyance it was arranged that the two officers should be in readiness at the fort and the coach would drive through and pick them up chapter xvii a cowards deed mr ray was hobbling about his room blithe as a lark he had slept soundly awaked refreshed enjoyed his breakfast and the music of the band at guardmounting was rejoicing in the arrival of dandy who had been sent down from laramie and was now in a little paddock in the backyard of the quarters he and blake occupied in company he had spent an hour delightfully at mrs truscotts where the ladies were out taking the morning air and finally had come home to write to the mother at lexington who with all her pride in her boys achievements was still vastly worried she had written to the commanding officer in fact and begged particulars from him as her son was so averse to writing the colonel had shown the letter to gleason who happened as usual to be on hand and gleason had remarked well thats what i always told you youll get to know him after a while ray had written a joyous letter to her and a few jolly lines to sister nell whose last letter had perplexed him somewhat and then his work finished he had risen and was limping around with the aid of a stick singing lustily the old darkey campmeeting lines oh de elders on de road mos done trabbelin de elders on de road mos done trabbelin de elders on de road mos done er trabbelin ise gwine to carry my soul to de lawd when the door opened and in came blake what ho mercutio your bosoms lord sits lightly on his throne anyhow what you been drinking billy getting shot seems to agree with you faith lad ive had a joyous morn chaffing gleason and supervising

and her blind boys scandalled company i have forsworn you have my blessing billy but dost thou think because thou art virtuous there shall be no more cakes and ale avaunt ill hie me to metheglin and muldoons and off he went leaving ray half vexed half shaken with laughter it must have been one oclock when looking up the row as he sat basking in the sunshine he saw gleason come out of captain truscotts quarters and rapidly nearing him along the walk he had been idly looking over a newspaper and thinking intently over matters which he was beginning to find vastly interesting but something in gleasons appearance changed mr rays expression from that of the mingled contempt and indifference with which he generally met him into one of more active interest the big and bulky lieutenant lurched unmistakably as he walked his face was flushed his eyes red he was muttering angrily to himself and shot a quick but far from intelligent glance at ray as he passed now what on earth could have prompted him to go to truscotts looking like that thought ray i wonder if mrs truscott saw him she did not go driving presently there came a little knot of ladies down the row they stopped to speak to ray and he rose answering with smiling welcome and they on the sidewalk and he leaning against one of the pillars of the low wooden portico were in the midst of a lively chat when his own door opened and there came from within his quarters mrs truscotts soldier servant an old cavalryman whose infirmities had made him glad long since to exchange the functions of a trooper for those of general messenger bootblack and scullion on better pay and rations he had come in from the rear he held out a note mrs truscott said i was to find you at once sir pardon me ladies i will see what this is he said opening it leisurely with pleasant anticipations of an invitation for tea he read two lines the color left his face amaze consternation distress were all pictured there in an instant excuse me i must go to mrs truscott at once he said and went limping eagerly rapidly up the walk why what can she want asked one of the astonished ladies i cannot imagine dont you think we some of us ought to go and see if anything is the matter nonsense it is nothing where we would be of any service what makes me wonder is what she can want of mr ray what made him look so startled a pause didnt mrs turner say he was very attentive to her in arizona and that she threw him over for captain truscott tentatively it wasnt that at all promptly interrupted another with the positive conviction of womankind mrs wilkins told me all about it and i know it was another girl mr ray was in love with and no it was mrs somebody tanner whose husband was killed and mrs truscott did break an engagement with somebody i didnt know about that what i say is that mr ray was desperately in love with mrs truscott because and by this time all four were talking at once and the thread of conversation became involved but ray had hurried on what he read had indeed startled him come to me the moment you get this i am in fearful trouble g p t he knocked at the door and she herself opened it and led him into the parlor she was pale as death her eyes distended with misery every feature quivering every nerve trembling with fright and violent emotion she began madly walking up and down the little room wringing her hands shivering gasping for breath in heavens name what has happened oh i cannot tell you i cannot tell you it is too fearful oh mr ray mr ray but you must tell me mrs truscott try and control yourself is anything wrong with jack oh no no good god has there been an accident has anything happened to miss sanford no no no its only me she answered hysterically inaccurate in her wild wretchedness ill tell you it is that awful man mr gleason he has been here and rays face set like stone the words came through clinched teeth now he seized her hand released it as suddenly tell me instantly theres no time to lose he goes at three and then at last half sobbing half raging with indignation she managed to tell her story gleason had come in half an hour before and walking at once into the parlor had sent up word that he wished to see her she asked to be excused but he called up that it was a matter of the utmost importance and she came down he closed the parlor door stood between her and escape and then proceeded to accuse her of slights and wrongs to him and of interfering with his rights as a gentleman to pay his addresses to miss sanford of prejudicing her against him he accused her husband of treating him with disdain and then she saw he had been drinking heavily he with wild triumph told her she was in his power he had long suspected her she strove to check him and to call her servants for a wonder they werent at the keyhole but she was powerless against him then he went on to denounce her as a faithless wife and to accuse her of a vile correspondence with a soldier an enlisted man a sergeant formerly of her husbands troop he drew a letter from his pocket and with sneering emphasis read it aloud it was an ardent loveletter from wolf in which he raved of his love for her spoke of other letters he had written and reminded her of his happiness in past meetings and begged to be told when he could see her alone she was horrorstricken indignantly denied any knowledge of him whatever he simply sneered and told her he meant to take that letter to crush her husband with the first time he asserted any authority over him and to hold as a menace over her then she implored him as an officer as a gentleman to give it to her but he only added sneering insult ray could hardly wait till she had finished at first he blazed with wrath then that odd preternatural coolness and sangfroid seemed to steal over him he looked at his watch one thirty time enough then asked a quiet question or two had any one heard did any one else know not a soul whom could she tell whom could she call but him mrs stannard and marion being away dont worry a particle ill have him here on his knees if need be you say wolf was the signature do you know anywhy does he mean that goodlooking german and to his amaze she was blushing painfully yes mr ray and he was with us at the point and always coming to borrow books of jack but indeed he never wrote me nor i hush who but a blackguard would think it just sit here quietly ten minutes or so you shall have that letter if any one comes i think it would be best to keep quiet about this until later with that he went hobbling down the row there were the ladies and they accosted him to know if anything were wrong if they had not better go to mrs truscott et cжtera et cжtera but he answered with unaccustomed brilliancy and mendacity that he had a scare for nothing because he could not read her fine italian hand she was only getting some things ready to send to captain truscott by the stage to fetterman all the same he slipped into his room got his revolver gave a quiet twirl to the cylinder to see that all was working smoothly and the next minute without knocking banged into the front room of gleasons quarters finding that worthy sluicing his head and face with cold water at the washstand whos that he shouted turning half round to find ray standing less than ten feet away with a cocked sixshooter gleaming in his hand there was dead silence a moment then rays placid tones were heard sit down gleason gleason stood glaring at him an instant a ghastly pallor stealing over his face his rickety legs trembling beneath him do you hear sit down and though the words were slow deliberate cleancut there was a hissing prolongation of the one sibillant that gave the impression of the scapevalve of some pentup power that bore a ton to the square inch there was a blaze a glitter in the dark snapping eyes there was a pitiless contemptuous murderous set to the lips and jaw a fearful significance in the slowlyraising pistol hand and the pointing finger of the other limp as a wet rag cowering like a lashed cur terrified into speechlessness gleason dropped into the indicated chair if you attempt to move except at my bidding ill shoot you like a dog i want that letter what letter he whimpered in his effort to dodge the letter you were blackguard enough to steal and coward enough to threaten mrs truscott with where is it ray i swear i meant no harm it was all a a joke i didnt dream shed take it so seriously i picked it up in her yard and meant to give it shut up where is it i i havent got it now you lie bring it out or ill and again the rising pistol hand with dread suggestiveness supplied the ellipsis gleason began fumbling in the pocket of his waistcoat it was evident that he was on the verge of maudlin tears he shook and trembled and began protesting bah said ray the idea of showing a pistol to such a whelp of cowardice hand me the letter and with an impatient step forward he stood towering over the cringing shrinking pitiful object in the chair the nerveless hands presently drew forth a letter from an inner pocket this ray quickly seized glanced hurriedly over it stowed it in his blouse then walked to the door fancying him going gleasons drunken wits began to rally he half rose and with a face distorted with rage shook his fist and his high reedy querulous tenor could have been heard all over the house you think youve downed me but by god youll pay for this youll see if in one months time you dont bemoan every insult you put upon me and if she dont wish silence you whelp you drivelling cur dont you dare utter her name just what ill do about this infamous business i dont know yet a womans name is too sacred to be dragged into court even to rid the service of such a foul blot as you but now mark me by the god of heaven if you ever dare bring up this matter again to a single soul ill kill you as i would a mad dog and with one long look of concentrated wrath contempt and menace ray turned his back upon his abject enemy and left him gleasons orderly entering the room a minute after was told to hand him a tumbler and the whiskeybottle and with shaking hand the big subaltern tossed off a bumper while the man went on strapping and roping his trunks and fieldkit half an hour afterwards half sobered and partially restored he was able to say a brief word of farewell to the post commander a venomous word meantime stopping at his quarters a moment to return his revolver and wash his hands ray went up the row to truscotts he had not time to knock grace was waiting for his coming with an intensity of eagerness and anxiety and the moment she heard his step flew to the door and admitted him leading as before the way to the parlor mrs turner had meantime been apprised by some of her infantry friends that mrs truscott had sent a note to mr ray and also that there must be something queer going on mr ray had been much agitated at first and had hurried thither and heaven only knows the variety of conjectures propounded by the time ray was seen coming up the row again there were four ladies on mrs turners piazza who were vehemently interested in his next move they watched his going to truscotts but of course watching was perfectly justifiable in view of their anxiety about her did you see said mrs turner he didnt even knock she was waiting to let him in it was by no means an unfrequent thing for any one of the ladies of the garrison to receive a visit from some old and tried friend of hers and her husbands while the latter was in the field mrs turner never thought anything of having officers call day or evening though as a rule there was a sentiment against it and the majority of the ladies especially the elders thought it wrong for the young matrons to receive the visits of young officers at any time when the head of the house was far away now that there were only four young officers in garrison and more than a dozen ladies the feeling had strengthened to the extent of considerable talk it was therefore the unanimous view of the ladies on mrs turners piazza that in mrs truscotts receiving two visits from mr ray in one morning under circumstances provokingly mysterious there was something indecorous to say the least and unless they knew the why and the wherefore it was their intention to so declare indeed said mrs turner i think mrs truscott ought to be spoken to utterly oblivious of this most proper and virtuous espionage ray had returned to mrs truscott she looked at him with imploring eyes as they entered the parlor there is the letter he said do you want it or shall i burn it she shrank back as though recoiling from a loathsome touch oh no no burn it here is a match she cried springing to the mantel and then her overcharged heart gave way she threw herself upon the sofa burying her face in her hands sobbing like a child with relief and exhaustion ray touched the match to the paper had just fairly started the flame when laughing voices and quick footsteps were heard on the piazza the door flew open and all in a burst of sunshine and balmy air marion sanford saying oh come right in you havent a moment to spare and shell be so glad to see you whisked into the room followed by captain webb tableau chapter xviii desertion in that species of mental athletics known as jumping at conclusions mrs turner was an expert that she always hit the mark is something a regard for veracity will not permit us to assert indeed it was not often that her intellectual subtlety enabled her to extract from outward appearances the true inwardness of the various matters that entered the orbit of her observations all the same she was a born jumper and like the allen revolver immortalized by mark twain if she didnt always get what she went for she fetched something mrs turner could fetch a conclusion from everything she saw and was happy in her facility time and again her patient lord had ventured to point a moral from her repeated mistakes of judgment and to suggest less precipitancy in the future but to no good purpose mrs turners faith in the justice of her prognostications was sublime though not unusual it has been within the compass of our experience to meet and know undaunted women who day after day could with equal positiveness announce their theories as incontrovertible facts or flatly contradict the assertions of those whose very position enabled them to be well informed when mrs turner was confronted with the proof of her error and gently upbraided by the placid captain for being so positive in her affirmation or denial that pretty matron was wont to shrug her lovely shoulders and petulantly set aside the subject with the comprehensive excuse oh well i didnt know in vain had turner pointed out to her that the fact was selfevident that in view of that very fact she should have been less confident in the discussion and should be more guarded in the future his efforts were crowned with small success mrs turners beliefs were only too apt on all occasions to be heralded by her as undeniable facts she saw miss sanford and captain webb enter the truscotts soon after ray she saw captain webb come out almost immediately and go thence to the stannards next door while ray soon appeared and walked off homeward she saw mrs stannard come out with webb and while the latter turned to come and say goodby to her mrs stannard had gone at once into the truscotts is mrs truscott ill she immediately asked well a she seemed to be she was evidently a good deal cut up about something said webb who was slow of speech and not quick of intellect well what do you think it was what was she doing tell me captain im so worried about her she has been so unlike herself since mr truscott went away oh ah she was very pale and very a well tearful you know been crying i suppose and webb shifted uncomfortably he couldnt get over that picture exactly mrs truscott springing up from the sofa all tears ray standing there burning a letter all confusion still he believed it something susceptible of explanation and did not care to talk about it but that laramie stage would soon be along and mrs turner determined to make the best of her opportunities ray had never been one of her satellites and she never forgave too little admiration though it would be manifestly unfair to assert that she would have forgiven too much she knew that he had been quite devoted to mrs truscott in the days that succeeded the troublous times at sandy though the days were very brief and now it was her impulsive theory that mrs truscotts odd behavior and rays presence at the house were symptoms of a revival of that suspected flame she was trying to draw webb out when gleason looking black as a thundercloud and immensely melodramatic came in to say goodby to her as she stood on the piazza the stage came cracking in at the front gate at the moment and stopped below at gleasons quarters where the orderly began stowing in their light luggage have you said goodby to miss sanford and mrs truscott she asked with mischievous interest er no i understand mrs truscott is not well i saw her this morning a moment and promised to come round later but i think it best not to disturb them the stage lumbered up to the front and as it came mrs stannard reappeared and hurried up the walk her usually placid face showed evidence of deep emotion and barely repressed excitement captain webb will you say to the major that i will have a long letter to go to him by the very next mail and that i hope it will reach him without delay she looked squarely at gleason with her kind blue eyes blazing and never so much as recognized him by a nod i must return to mrs truscott who is far from well but tell captain truscott not to be alarmed about her goodby captain webb come back to us safe and sound another moment and the two officers were borne away and mrs turner went down to the truscotts determined to find out what was the trouble but came away dissatisfied there was some mystery and she could not solve it what did it portend that mrs stannard should have cut mr gleason dead later that afternoon just before sunset there was a pretty picture in front of truscotts quarters it had been a lovely day at the very end of july but the air was cool and bracing and many of the ladies seated on the long row of piazzas or strolling up and down the gravelled walk had found it necessary to wear their shawls or wraps the band was playing sweetly in the circular stand on the parade and a dozen little children were romping about the few patches of green turf or splashing the water in the narrow acequias the newlyplanted sprigs of trees looked like so many tentpoles stuck up on the edge of the diamond so far as verdure was concerned and the dingy brown of the barracks on the southern side had little that could attract the eye but far beyond across the creek valley lay the rolling expanse of open prairie far beyond that those glistening gleaming battlements of eternal snow standing against the colorado skies only three or four officers could be seen along the row only half a dozen soldiers in all the great garrison the recruits were all in at supper the officers and trained men were all far away to the north to the delight of the children mr rays orderly came up the road leading dandy and after they had crowded around and petted and lauded him while a new halter was being put on and his glistening coat touched up for the third time since his supper of oats dandy was slowly led on up the row stopping every few rods to be patted and admired by the ladies and at last reached truscotts house where ray went and knocked softly and miss sanford appeared together they walked to the gate and there they stood ray expatiating on the many good points of his pet and comrade miss sanford stroking the sorrels arching neck and velvet nozzle and looking volumes of adulation into his intelligent eyes dandy pawed and pricked up his ears and seemed proud and conscious as any human and would have purred like a kitten had he only known how so soft was the touch of her caressing hand so sweet was the praise of her gentle voice ray stood and watched her with delight in his eyes oh you beauty oh you dear dear fellow how i would prize you if you were mine do you dream what a hero you are i wonder both her white hands were holding his glossy head now and dandy stood there looking into her animated face as though he loved every feature in it or was it ray both of them could hardly keep their eyes off her an instant she was a puzzle to dandy she was an angel to his master he was hit twice was he not she asked and when he showed her the scars she mourned over them like a mother over a babys bumped forehead i declare mr ray is growing positively handsome said mrs stannard looking out of the window at the pretty group how delighted he is that miss sanford should make so much of dandy she added turning to mrs truscott who lay there very white and weary looking grace smiled i must creep up to the window and see she said and for a moment they gazed in silence he was bending down over her so bright and brave and gallant that the next thing the two ladies looked suddenly into each others face smiling suggestively just what i was thinking said mrs stannard laughing and there seemed no need to ask what the simultaneous thought could be then they looked out again oh said mrs truscott impatiently i wish she would keep away for down came mrs turner all smiles and white muslin to join them that woman could never understand that she could be de trop was mrs stannards reflection but it was characteristic of her that she gave the possibly disproportioned thought no utterance ray lifted his cap with his customary grace and courtesy but looked only moderately rejoiced at the coming of even so bewitching an addition to dandys circle of admirers possibly some years of experience at poker had given him such admirable control of all facial expression as to enable him to disguise the annoyance he really felt ray couldnt bear humbug in any form and when horses were the subjects of discussion he was fiercely intolerant of the wise looks and bookinspired remarks of the wouldbe authorities in the regiment to his cavalry nature the horse had an affiliation that was simply strong as a friendship nothing could shake rays conviction in the reasoning powers the love loyalty gratitude and devotion of the animal that from his babyhood he had looked upon as a companion almost as a confidant he had little faith in mrs turners voluble admiration of dandy to use his blue grass vernacular he didnt take any stock he called it stawk in that sort of gush he knew that there was only one fourlegged domestic animal of which mrs turner was more desperately afraid and that was a cow she made a ninny of herself when she went out to drive and the mere pricking up of the horses ears was to her mind premonitory symptom of a runaway and excuse for immediate demand to be set down on the open prairie and allowed to walk home as for riding she couldnt be induced to try to her a horse was a thing that kicked or bit or showed the whites of his eyes and set his ears back and switched his tail and gave other evidences of depraved moral nature and she would no more touch or approach one than she would a wildcat except when in so doing with an admiring audience she could become the central figure in an effective tableau ray wished her in jericho as she stood at arms length and touched dandy with the tips of her dainty fingers and began to speak of him as it equine sex was a matter beyond mrs turners consideration and with eminent discretion she compromised on it as a safe descriptive then old whaling came along with his better half and the lady stopped to see the now celebrated sorrel and when ray cordially addressed his post commander with the natural question what do you think of him colonel he was genuinely surprised at the embarrassed lifeless response the colonel looked away as he replied very pretty very pretty mr ray and then walked on as though he desired to keep aloof and mrs whaling announcing that she was going to see poor mrs muldoon who was living outside the gate moved on after her husband with hardly a glance for ray something strange in the colonels manner something constrained and distant in that of the adjutant had occurred to him once or twice before but he had given little thought to it now he felt that it could no longer be overlooked even mrs turner who knew that in the regiment from the colonel down almost everybody had a cordial word for ray and that now he was the idol of the hour even mrs turner looked after the colonel in amaze and then quickly at ray a light flashed over her busy intellect this was further confirmation of her theory the colonel too had heard of rays devotions to mrs truscott and was offended thereat but now the sunset call was sounding the band marched away and ray and his fair companion stood watching dandy who was being led back to his paddock a deep flush was on her cheek she too had noted the colonels cold and distant manner to ray she saw that he was stung by it but was trying to give no sign so long as they were together she had learned many things since her return from town she and mrs stannard knew all about the terrible affair of the morning and fully understood rays presence at the house and mrs truscotts agitation they had recalled many of gleasons bitter sneers and insinuations against ray and all three felt that unknown to him some covert influence was at work here at the post to do him injury and that his loyal services this day in mrs truscotts behalf had but intensified the hatred against him it was agreed among them that not one word should be breathed of the affair except what mrs stannard should write to the major mrs truscott was sure that jack would shoot mr gleason on sight the moment he was informed and mrs stannard thought it quite probable miss sanford was silent in this discussion but all agreed that ray must be warned that there was some plot against him it was mysteriously whispered among the ladies about the garrison knowing this and knowing that she could not well be the one to tell him marion sanford with her whole heart in her beautiful eyes stood there by his side as the sun went down she liked him for his frank manly ways she honored him for his loyalty she respected him for the lack of certain traits which every one had been so careful to ascribe to him as habitual she gloried in the daring the selfsacrifice the heroism of his conduct in the recent events on the campaign she felt personal gratitude deep and earnest for his invaluable service to grace to them all this day and just because she could not give utterance to him of any one of these emotions was it to be wondered at that as he turned towards her again and caught the earnest look in her swimming eyes rays heart gave one great bound i want you to ride him some day miss sanford i cannot yet will you and his voice was low and there was an odd tremor in it for ray ride dandy she said after an instants pause mr ray if he were my horse after what he has done after such a deed do you think i would let any one use him that would rule me out miss sanford he answered smiling you she had clasped her hands she was looking down nervously at the tip of her little boot her eyes were half suffused her face flushing then growing suddenly hot and cold by turns she knew his eyes were glowing upon her she knew there was no earthly excuse for such absurd sensations she knew that it was highly unconventional to experience any such difficulty of expression where acquaintance had been so brief but was there after all anything unwomanly in letting him see that she was proud of him of his friendship his daring had not every other woman gushed over him and called him splendid and some of them lovely while she had never yet dared speak of it at all he had simply laughed off their adulation but he was not laughing now she never saw such intensity in his face why this very silence was dangerous distracting if she she cared for him she could not be more nervous and shy with sudden effort she looked up in his face you why mr ray i never think of one without the other how could i tell you she broke forth impulsively how simply splendid i thought you both and now with flaming cheeks she turned and ran into the house leaving him all astir with delight at the gate and yet when he called that evening to inquire after mrs truscott and marion with mrs stannard received him in the parlor she was all animation selfpossession and mistress of the situation again even when mrs stannard found means to leave them alone ray could find no pretext for diverting the talk into the delicious channel in which it flowed at sunset perhaps after all it was only the glow of departing day like the throes of the dying dolphin lending hectic radiance to his colors that so dazzlingly bewilderingly beautifully tinged the current of her words and gave him glimpses of a heaven of hope his wildest dream had never pictured but mr ray had still a stern duty for that night having disposed of gleason during the afternoon he had sent for the soldier wolf but was told he would be on pass until tattoo until he had sifted the matter to the bottom he would not know how to proceed with regard to gleason charges of conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman courtmartial and publicity were not to be thought of as involving her name in such a scandal after what she had said of wolf his first theory that it was all a forgery of gleasons was abandoned he must see wolf obtain from him any similar letter he might have clearly point out to him the madness of his conduct and satisfy himself whether indeed wolf might not be insane immediately after tattoo therefore he had again despatched his orderly for the bandsman and in two minutes the latter appeared knocked and stood cap in hand within the door ray turned up the lamp and coolly surveyed his man the two stood a moment confronting each other in silence wolf was very pale and beads of sweat were starting on his brow but the blue eyes never flinched he had never served a day under the lieutenants command but he knew him well as all soldiers know the various officers of their regiments the verdict is rarely at fault he knew there was no trifling with the man before him he felt that no slight pretext had called him to his presence and the instant he set eyes on him he knew his secret was in his hands wolf said ray have you written any letters to mrs truscott since the one you left in her yard last week the question reads harshly it was spoken calmly without a vestige of menace or sneer yet the soldiers hands clinched as though in fierce convulsion his forehead seemed to wrinkle into one mass of corrugations he bowed his ghastly face in an agony of shame i ask in no anger let me tell you briefly what has happened i have no word to add to the reproach you feel that letter fell into the hands of a scoundrel he took it to mrs truscott this day and threatened her with full exposure accused her in fact of corresponding with you because you mentioned other letters oh my god my god kill me herr lieutenant kill me was the soldiers gasping cry and before ray could do aught to stay him he had plunged forward on his face and lay writhing on the painted floor tearing wildly at his hair calling down curses on himself on his mad love on the hand that penned the fatal letter on the hound who had carried it to that innocent that angel then on his knees with outstretched arms he looked up at ray who stood utterly astounded at his paroxysm of misery and despair his name lieutenant i implore i demand i demand his name sir i am not unworthy to ask it i was a gentleman in my country i am a gentleman how know you this where is he that has done this so foul wrong far away by this time be calm now i want the truth in this matter far away he sprang to his feet it is that devil it is that dog gleason he spied upon me it was he who found the letter ach gott where when did he dare threaten that that angel where is the letter the letter is all right he had to give it up it was this morning he threatened her and she is prostrate now for all answer he burst into a mad passion of tears never had ray witnessed such selfabasement never had he seen such awful remorse it was an hour nearly before he could calm him sufficiently to extract from him his story and it amounted practically to this he had killed an opponent in a duel over cards in dresden there was nothing for it but to leave instantly and to seek safety in america his rank was that of rittmeister in the hussars and he had nothing to do but enlist in the cavalry he was penniless and starving when he reached truscotts quarters and her face bending over him as he rallied from his swoon had haunted him day and night with its beauty its sympathy and tenderness she became the idol the goddess of his life he watched her day and night in his mad infatuation he dreamed of her as his own he wrote letter after letter to her as the sole means of giving vent to the wild passionate love which had turned his brain he destroyed them one after another he never by word or look or deed so far as he knew let her see aught of his hopeless love he never thought to let one of these letters fall from his hands yet whenever he was alone he wrote he had sung under her window because in his country everybody sang and played and it was no unusual attention for any gentleman to pay the compliment of a personal serenade still he had avoided as he thought all recognition until the night he found gleason creeping upon him at mention of that name his paroxysms broke forth afresh never never could he forgive himself for the fearful misery he had caused her never never would he forgive the hound who had so basely dealt with her he shall wipe out his foul crime in his hearts blood he swore and ray had to order silence he gave ray his word that never again would he be tempted to write a line he implored him to ask for him her forgiveness never again would he cross her path his grief broke forth afresh every few moments and he was weak as a child ray became really alarmed about him and going into the diningroom where he and blake were accustomed to take their bachelor sustenance he rummaged around in the dark for some brandy of late he had given up all use of stimulants and blake was down at the store it was some minutes before he found the decanter but when he returned the room was empty wolf had gone the next morning there was a ripple of excitement at the adjutants office a horse was missing from the band stables and a musician from the band barracks at retreat that evening it was definitely settled that sergeant wolf had deserted chapter xix in close arrest to use his own language life had suddenly become vested with new charms for mr blake he had found his conversational affinity for years said he i have been like pyramus peeking and scratching at a wall for thisbe only my thisbe was never there but pyramus blake had found his mate he swore and with huge delight he began devoting hours to chat with mrs whaling she was old enough to be his mother though she thought the fact was known to but few she was as prosaic as he was fanciful though it was her aim to appear at ease in all literary topics she knew little or nothing of music or the languages but it was her implicit conviction that those by whom she was surrounded knew less and she chiefly erred in assuming to know that of which they frankly confessed their ignorance aside from a consummate facility for blundering in french mrs whaling possessed illimitable powers of distortion of her mothertongue and this it was that so fascinated and enraptured blake on short acquaintance he rushed in one morning to tell mrs stannard that nothing but jealousy could have prompted her and the other ladies in concealing from him mrs whalings phenomenal gifts in this line and proclaiming her the sweetest sensation of his maturer years if we have failed thus far in pointing out some of the lingual peculiarities which had won for this estimable lady the title of mrs malaprop it was through the confidence we felt that so soon as she began to talk for herself our efforts would be rendered unnecessary overweening interest in other ladies has kept her somewhat in the background a fact that detracts at once from all hope of ever establishing the record of being faithfully historic since all who knew mrs whaling are aware that nobody could ever keep her in the background in any assemblage wherein she was permitted to speak for herself perhaps it was therein that lay one of her direst misfortunes but she knew it not poor lady and like too many of the rest of us could never realize what was and what was not best for her at the time will the day ever come when the author of this will not realize in mournful retrospect what an ass he made of himself the twelvemonth previous mrs whaling had never studied french but french was the language of courts and courtesy and it sounded well she was convinced to introduce an occasional phrase or quotation in her daily conversation and what she meant when she used a big word in her own language was as in the case of honest mr ballou a secret between herself and her maker mr blake had hobbled over to pay his respects soon after his arrival and was noticed shaking his head and muttering to himself in perplexity at odd hours of the day thereafter the next morning he was seen to explode as mrs whaling gravely announced among a circle of her friends that she considered miss sanford to be the most soidisant creature she had ever met and went on to explain for the benefit of those to whom her french was an impenetrable mystery fascinating or as they say seductive but when she soon thereafter referred to the generals magnanimity in not remanding to the guardhouse an inebriated soldier who had dropped and broken a valuable lamp because he knew it was only a lapsus linguж blake became her slave and hovered about her from morn till night in hopes of further revelations he was getting lots of fun out of life just now despite his aches and pains and was being chaffed extensively for replacing so readily the absent and lamented gleason the one thing that seemed to mar his happiness mrs truscott had been ailing for two or three days and the ladies were wont to stop at her door each morning to make inquiries and suggestions mrs stannard had virtually moved in next door and was with her at all times mr ray was a frequent visitor despite the fact that mrs truscott was unable to see him though he always asked for her and the garrison was arriving at the not unjustifiable inference that other attractions might draw him thither he was still too lame to walk or ride had no duties to perform and much time to devote to calling but beyond leaving his card at the commanding officers and paying a courteous visit to mrs turner and mrs wilkins he made no garrison calls at all for the hours he spent with mrs stannard and miss sanford could hardly be so termed he had been at the post a week and the adjutant and quartermaster of the little command had as yet failed to drop in and welcome him as is customary they had called on blake when ray was up the row but had not left their cards or inquired for his comrade blake thought it simply a piece of forgetfulness perhaps they had asked and he had forgotten but ray thought otherwise and still oddly enough did not seem to care he was happy in his day and life had a new strange sweet interest for him that despite his past ephemeral flames for one belle after another was seriously influencing his life and character blake wrote to his chums in the regiment that billy ray wasnt half the fun he used to be never knew a fellow lose all his old self so quick he has gone back on potations and poker and it hasnt improved him a whit there was another thing blake growled at ray was mixed up in some garrison mystery and wouldnt tell him anything about it he had pumped him so to speak because mrs turner kept nagging him for information and ray had only colored and stumbled painfully and finally burst forth with see here blake something has happened that i accidentally got mixed up in but its a thing a man cant tell of so dont ask me and blake could only surmise then too there was that desertion of wolfs ray knew something about it and then the colonel had asked him blake a pointblank question about rays habits which amazed him and set him to thinking then no mail was received from the regiment for four days and they were all anxious and so this bright august morning quite a party had gathered in front of truscotts for a little batch of letters had just arrived and they were discussing contents and comparing notes when mrs stannard came downstairs blithe and breezy as ever the ladies began their natural inquiries for mrs truscott she had enjoyed a good nights rest at times at least but had a severe nervous headache this morning this had prompted mrs turner to remark that nervous headaches were such trying things she could never control them except by liberal use of bromides mrs wilkins was of opinion that if ever she had one shed cut her head off before shed use the likes such stuff as that lapsing very nearly into the vernacular of her early days and mrs whaling calmly announced that nothing ever did her so much good as a warm embryocation whereat there was suppressed sensation on part of the ladies and convulsive throes by mr blake ray and miss sanford absorbed in converse on the weather were standing apart at the doorway and heard nothing of it guardmounting was over the band had just finished its morning programme of music and was going away when a sudden exclamation from mrs turner called all eyes to the form of the young post adjutant coming up the row why whats mr warner in full uniform for what can it mean full uniform had not been worn at the post for any duty since the command left for the front guardmounting was in undress as only half a dozen men were put on duty each day and the military reader can readily understand the sensation in the group as the white plumes of the young adjutant were seen there is only one duty which in the absence of courtsmartial and dressparades or the like will account for an adjutants appearing in full uniform at such an hour and he was coming straight toward them conversation ceased at once in the group at the gate ray and miss sanford standing at the doorway were still absorbed in their chat and saw and heard nothing of what was coming mrs stannard turned pale and trembled so that all could see it blake looked as he afterwards said six ways for sunday then as the officer neared him with attempted jocularity sang out the king has come to marshal us in all his armor drest and he has donned his snowwhite plume to put us in arrest whos your victim warner and then stopped short as warner brushed by saying in savage whisper shut up man and get ray away from this crowd quick i want him blake simply stared mrs stannard turned quickly and almost ran into the house mrs whaling lifted her eyes heavenward as though imploring divine mercy on the doomed one mrs turner flushed and looked wonderingly from one to the other mrs wilkins dropped her parasol and picked it up pretty much as though it were a shillelah and she meant to use it as such and then the group began to break up ray glancing over his shoulder to inquire the cause of the sudden cessation of talk caught sight of the snowy plume dancing on up the walk of blake standing in petrified and indignant silence and then of mrs stannards face her eyes filling with tears he recalled instantly her recent questions and halfuttered warnings and something told him the blow had come he gave one quick look at miss sanford their eyes met and hers too were full of trouble and something she could not express excuse me but i want to inquire what this means he said and bowing quietly he turned to the gate where blake still stood looking after warner who had halted farther up the row its you billy boy and damn me if i dont believe the world is mad ray stalked up the line fast as his halting gait would admit wonderment indignation bitterness were in his heart but he choked it all down and his eyes were fixed full upon the staffofficer who seeing him alone came rapidly back to meet him something of the old reckless dauntless manner reasserted itself as they reached speaking distance the adjutant was toying nervously with his swordknot despite all gleasons insinuations despite official papers that had been going to and fro he felt it impossible to believe the allegations against mr ray and his unbelief was never so pronounced as at this moment when they came together he had never seen it done before but instinctively by an impulse he could not restrain he raised his hand in salute as he spoke the brief official words mr ray you are hereby placed in close arrest by order of colonel whaling and ray with courteous return of the salute replied with almost smiling grace very well mr warner i presume you will give me prompt information as to the charges and facing about went slowly and deliberately to his quarters mrs stannard stood at the doorway until she saw him turn then taking miss sanfords hand drew her within the hall saying simply come what can it mean mrs stannard surely he will stop and tell us he cannot miss marion he must go direct to his quarters i will send mr blake at once to him they are going now together i shall go and find out all i can do not tell mrs truscott and without a word marion sanford went slowly up the stairs and to her room mrs stannard listened until she heard her close the door then hastened down the row in pursuit of mr blake ray waved his hand to her as he stepped inside the threshold and blake fuming with fury came back to meet her was there ever such an outrage it is something of gleasons doing of course but ray says he can stand it if g can and is disposed to laugh it off but theres something else im afraid have you heard anything nothing but vague rumors mr blake but enough to worry me there is some deeplaid plot or im fearfully mistaken gleason would never dare do it alone cant you telegraph to the regiment and have things stopped they are far above fetterman and can only be reached by courier webb and gleason went out with small escort last night so the despatches say by jove ill try it surely the colonel and stannard and wayne ought to be told wayne is still at laramie but he would come something must be done to block these lies whatever they are oh if luce were only where we could make him hear mr blake cant you find out from mr warner what the trouble is what the charges are of course i can it is some mere local mischief that fellow gleason has kicked up ill go just as soon as ive seen billy and go he did and would have gone straight into the old colonels office even had that veteran not called him in and when next mr blake appeared upon the walk the light had gone out of his face he went slowly reluctantly wretchedly back down the row he could not bear to carry the news to ray yet he had promised and in his hand was a copy of the charges and specifications preferred against his friend so far from being a mere local matter the arrest was ordered from division headquarters the court was already selected and the time fixed for its meeting long before sunset the whole garrison knew and with what additions and exaggerations who can say that lieutenant ray was to be tried by courtmartial for offences that reflected on the honor of the whole regiment and that accepting bribes and large sums of money from prominent contractors while on the horse board gambling with them and misappropriating public funds were the main allegations the charges were signed by a prominent staffofficer and gleasons name only appeared incidentally as a witness so did that of rallston rays brotherinlaw but there were several others blake laid the bulky paper before his friend with this word before you say aye or nay to any one of the charges in this batch of infamy i want to say to you ray that ill stake my commission on their utter falsity and he had said practically the same thing to the post commander that afternoon mr blake after a long talk with ray knocked at mrs stannards door and asked to see her a moment she came to him in dire anxiety long before this had mrs whaling been in to lament over the downfall of this unhappy young man and to expatiate on the gravity of the charges on mrs stannards making prompt and spirited expression of her utter disbelief in them the good lady had lifted her eyes in pathetic appeal to heaven that so mercifully enables us to bear the tribulations that befall our friends and groaned a veritable stiggins in skirts ah no she hoped she prayed of course it might prove false but the general the general said the array of witnesses was overwhelming and then his temptations and his past career she had been told he was addicted to the vices of drink and cards in their worst form ah no it was futile to hope she feared the worst and mrs stannard was wellnigh ready to bid her begone the old croaking raven as down in her inmost heart she termed her she was full of faith and loyalty but she was fearfully worried and blakes coming was a godsend how is he she asked astonished of course mad not a little but as full of pluck as ever what i want to see you about is this he forbids my telegraphing to have things stopped he wants a court wants to be tried the quicker the better says i can write to stannard or anybody but not to think of stopping proceedings all he seems to care for is this he fully expected to be well enough to travel in two weeks and then he wanted to join the regiment as fast as horse could take him all that is now impossible he has not said a word about gleason but i have sent a couple of telegrams from him that will make his brotherinlaw smart and have you telegraphed to fort fetterman im sure they would have a chance to send the news yes of course i did what i cant get over is this that much of this matter must have been reported through old whaling here by gleason and it has all been done in the dark the old rip never gave us a chance to refute any story that gleason would tell did you hear about rays message to him no when what was it instead of asking to see the commanding officer as the average officer does when put in arrest for a thing he is innocent of ray never mentioned him about an hour ago i met the colonel and he asked me how ray was behaving and was beginning something about not letting him drink when i could hold in no longer and told him flatly that ray hadnt taken as many drinks in a month as he had in a day you ought to have seen him he was struck all aback and stammered something about his having been led to suppose ray was doing a good deal of that sort of thing i replied that that wasnt the only thing he had been misinformed about by a jugful and he looked as though hed like to put me in arrest too the old slab he would too if he had the grit of his wife but he didnt he sent warner down just a moment ago to say that if mr ray desired to speak to him about the matter he would see him this evening as he desired to go to town on the morrow ray begged warner to sit down offered him a toddy or a glass of wine and finally as though it had suddenly occurred to him exclaimed oh do i want to see the colonel why really mr warner i know of nothing that well you might say this you know it isnt at all necessary that i should see him and i do not send this as a message but as the colonel appears to have furnished much of the information on these charges without reference to me i shall probably answer them in the same way without reference to him gad i never saw ray more placidly polite and hes always most full of fight at such times but even with such an old slab as whaling anything more impolitic than the conduct of these two cavalry subalterns could hardly have been imagined warner never told the colonel what ray said but of course had to say that ray expressed no desire to see him by the following morning the colonel was chafing over it a great deal and over the indignation expressed around the post at rays arrest he concluded that he wanted to see the young man himself and an opportunity unexpectedly occurred sergeant wolfs recent desertion was still a source of much subdued excitement and efforts had been made to capture him it had begun to leak around the garrison that he had been sent for the night of his departure by lieutenant ray and did not return to the band barracks until eleven oclock when he acted queer the post quartermaster was much exercised about the theft of one of the best horses from the band stable as he had become responsible for them in the absence of mr billings possibly ray could throw some light on the matter and to that officers surprise he was sent for at guardmounting his first idea was that his remarks to warner had been carried to the colonel and that he was to be overhauled for them his head was perhaps a trifle higher than usual therefore when he entered the office the first question sent the blood surging to his forehead and he almost staggered with surprise mr ray said the colonel abruptly do you know anything of the causes of wolfs desertion it was a moment before he could reply know of course he knew but it was a thing to be sacredly guarded he could not tell of that interview without betraying her without bringing grace truscotts name into the very snare that gleason had laid for it the colonel saw his hesitation and wheeled around in his chair mr warner looked up in surprise i say do you know anything of wolfs desertion of its causes of where he has probably gone repeated the colonel sharply i do not know where he has gone sir i have formed an opinion as to the cause of his desertion and what is it mr ray if it concerned me i would answer unhesitatingly colonel whaling as it is i cannot what possible reason can there be for silence sir i do not understand i cannot explain it now sir let me simply assure you that i never saw him until within the last few days that i had an interview with him the night of his desertion and that he has had some trouble of a personal and private nature other than that i can give no account of him this is most extraordinary mr ray how came you to know anything of his private history sir i decline to say sir by heavens mr ray do you realize that in addition to the other charges against you you are laying yourself open to those of abetting desertion possibly sir if so i can meet them before the proper tribunal you may go sir stop one moment i have telegraphed to sidney to denver and to laramie city to be on the lookout for him i demand to know whether you have an idea where he has gone that you can answer i have not colonel do you think of any place i have not mentioned where he would be apt to go ray turned whiter now but his eyes were unflinching i do but it is only conjecture what place sir fort fetterman fort fetterman thats simply absurd he would be recognized there with his horse and surely arrested very well sir then i know of no other and you still refuse to tell what your interview was about i shall always refuse that sir and therewith mr ray was remanded to his quarters verily there was some reason for blakes outburst when he came in after hearing warners brief description of the official interview which mrs whaling had given in lurid exaggeration to the garrison why hell is empty and all the devils are here chapter xx a cornered rat far away to the northwest this night close under the shoulders of the big horn mountains a regiment of cavalry has gone into bivouac after a days march through blistering sunglare and alkali hour after hour with strained aching eyes they have been watching the graduallynearing dome of cloud peak still glistening white though this is august around the blunt elbow of the mountains two days march away to the north they expect to find the gray fox and all his men eagerly awaiting their coming a courier from the front has brought them tidings that the indians are in force all over the country west of the cheetish group another courier has galloped after them from fetterman leaving there last night and he brings strange news during the long dusty burning day captain webb and mr gleason have joined the command and reported for duty to the disgust of the young second lieutenant commanding waynes troop in his absence the colonel directs mr gleason the senior lieutenant now for duty to assume command of it for the campaign captain truscott has no objections he prefers not to have mr gleason with his own troop and stannard is glad to get him out of his battalion very few men are glad to see gleason though nearly all the officers go to him for letters and news they bring a small packet of mail and on the way gleason has made himself very interesting to webb and has easily gathered from that simpleminded gentleman that there was an awkward tableau at truscotts when he went there to say goodby confidentially gleason had let him understand that he had seen only one of many symptoms that had given much food for talk at russell that to his gleasons bitter regret he feared mrs truscott had not been as discreet as she should with a fellow like ray who was well had webb heard anything of that horse board business etc it was so easy it is so easy mores the pity to say so very much in saying very little when the good name of man or woman is at stake long before they got to the regiment webb was convinced that he had seen very much more than he really did at russell and he had heard a volume of gossip that after all he could not have asserted was told him by gleason yet had been most deftly suggested gleason was deep he knew that they brought with them the mail of the last stage reaching fetterman for three days further news would not be apt to come by letter for a week by which time the regiment would probably be hotly engaged and he himself called back by telegraphic order as an important witness before the court this latter probability he mentioned to no one he meant to be grievously surprised and disgusted when the orders came recalling him and until then his cards had to be carefully played none of the ladies at russell who knew him at all had intrusted him with letters all theirs had gone by mail or by captain webb but when the mail was opened at fetterman gleason promptly offered to carry forward anything there might be for the officers of his regiment and on the way this was carefully assorted he had met stannard and truscott with beaming cordiality saying ah you well knew i would not come without letters from your better halves and fumbling in inner pockets as though they had been stored there ever since leaving russell it was not until late that afternoon that major stannard received from webb the message sent by his good wife and he was pondering in his mind what it could mean when at sunset truscott strolled over from his troop to see him gleason by this time was being very sociable with the colonel and mr billings have you anything from mrs stannard later than the letter you spoke of this afternoon major asked the captain whose face was somewhat anxious why yes truscott webb brought me a message that he said mrs stannard gave him at the last moment to the effect that she would have a long letter for me by next mail and to be sure and get it it seems a little odd my last is a pencilled note from mrs truscott written but a few moments before the stage started she says she sends it out to fetterman by the driver and i suppose our old striker easily got him to take it but she speaks of being far from well nervous etc and that mrs stannard is such a blessing to her so constantly with her i wish there were something more definite she writes three pages for the purpose of telling me not to be anxious and the very nervousness and tremulous style give me some cause for worry why in my letter mrs stannard speaks of mrs truscott as being so bright and well and of their having such good times together and being so charmed with miss sanford it hardly seems there could have been so sudden a change in one day but there had been as we know and a change as sudden was coming to the current of events in the harmonious th just after dark a courier on jaded horse came riding in from the south he brought telegraphic despatches to the colonel and one to major stannard the latter read his by the light of his camplantern gave a long whistle of amaze and disgust and sung out for truscott as he rolled from under his blankets the trumpets were just sounding tattoo and stannard and other officers had turned in early preparatory to the start at four in the morning while waiting for truscotts coming the major could see that at the colonels tent there was also excitement and a gathering of several officers he had not long to wait truscott joined him in a few moments i called you here because it was where we could talk unobserved what do you say to that and he handed him the despatch truscott read without a word and then stood there a moment earnestly thinking his lips firmly set a dark shadow settling on life forehead the message was as follows ray arrested horse board charges cooked up here by gleason court ordered from chicago all staff or infantry officers make gleason name authorities before regiment blake stannard had thrust his head forward and his hands into his breechespockets now isnt that simply damnable he asked you do not believe ray guilty do you was truscotts response no i dont though there was hesitating accent on the dont stannard hated to be thought unprepared for any trait in a fellowman good or bad what can the charges be ray told me he had neither gambled nor drank something has been received at the colonels billings was there opening and reading despatches when you called me and truscott nodded thither come on im going to see this thing through now said stannard and together they walked to headquarters the colonel wrapped in his overcoat was sitting up at the head of his campbed noting with a pencil a few memoranda while billings was reading aloud in a low voice some long despatches outside the tent were grouped half a dozen officers waiting for such news as the colonel might give beyond them were the scattered and smouldering fires the rude sheltertents of the men the white tops of the army wagons beyond these the dark outlines of the massive hills above them all the brilliant placid stars around them the hush of nature broken only by the drowsing swish and plash of rapid running waters the stir of the night wind in the scattered trees the stamp and snort of some startled troophorse the distant challenge of the night sentries something important had come and the group looked eagerly at stannard and truscott as they approached have you heard anything was the question ive got a despatch said stannard gruffly but i want to see the colonel before i speak of it then the colonels voice was heard that you stannard come in here and the major passed into the tent presently he came out took truscott by the arm and led him away no use talking to him tonight he has nothing but the official despatches and they look ugly for ray there are other things that occupy him now but what we want is to see gleason right off he is ordered to return at once and goes back in the morning come over in the second battalion a sentry pointed out gleasons tent stannard scratched and rattled at the flap no answer gleason he called no reply hes shamming sleep by gad growled the major between his teeth its only fifteen minutes since billings told him he was to start back at daybreak he wants to avoid us and has his flaps all tied inside ill have him out or bring his damned tent down about his ears and it was plain that stannard was getting excited an officer came through the gloom it was captain webb isnt this gleasons tent called the major certainly i left him there not half an hour ago replied the captain wake him up hes got to go back in the morning yes sir and thats just what i want to see him about hullo you there gleason there came from within a snort as of one suddenly awakened a sleepy yawn an imbecile oh ah er who is it its me stannard and i want you was the reply all the more forcible for being ungrammatic oh one minute major and ill be with you called the inmate as though overcome with sudden access of joy and presently he appeared half dressed see here gleason captain truscott and i have come to inquire what you know of the charges against mr ray you are to go back at once im told as witness against him there wont be a soul there of his regiment or his friends for we know well youre not one to speak for him by thunder what have you against him i do not think this a matter on which i should speak at all major stannard except to proper authority the court will hear the evidence in due season well i mean to hear something now mr gleason or by the eternal ill wake up the whole command to put the question what you make one believe is that you are seeking to ruin ray by getting him at a disadvantage with all his friends away captain truscott what do you say and then truscott spoke as usual he was master of himself and showed no vestige of temper the matter is very simple mr gleason you are believed to be the accuser of mr ray at a moment when it is certain the regiment is going to be so far away that its officers cannot be present at the court may not even be able to communicate with it if you decline to indicate what you know to major stannard and me who are his friends the immediate protest of the regiment against your conduct must go to headquarters with the request that the court be held until we can appear before it more than that in two days we will reach the general commanding the department do you fancy he will permit mr ray of all others to be brought to trial without a friend to appear for him gleason saw he was cornered what he hoped what he expected was to make his escape and get back before any one learned of the charges that hope was frustrated in his wrath and perplexity he resorted to the invariable device of the cowardly and the low he must divert their sympathy for ray into distrust of him and before he had fully considered his words they were spoken crafty insidious and calumniatory captain truscott you have spoken without threatening me and ill answer you all this time ive been striving not to see not to know mr rays offences but i was on the horse board you were not ask captain buxton tomorrow who and what rays associates were but let me say to you right here that i can no longer submit to seeing you deceived you call ray your friend no man can be a worse friend than he who sets a whole garrison talking about an absent comrades wife and the notes she writes him and who is discovered alone with her she in tears he burning a letter webb witnessed it ask him the last words were spoken with utmost haste with upraised hand with trembling lips for both truscott and stannard almost savagely sprang towards him as though to cram the words down his throat for an instant truscott stood glaring at him not daring to speak until he could resume his selfcommand but in that instant poor perturbed webb broke into speech oh come now gleason thats all an outrageous way of putting it you know of course i saw there was some little trouble mrs truscott had written to ray because she was all upset about something she was crying you know and ray might have just happened in never mind webb dont speak a word of course it is all easily explained no man on earth is more welcome at my home than ray and my wife is one of his warmest friends what i have to say is to you said truscott turning fully upon his subaltern if i needed one further proof to assure me that you were the lowest and most intriguing scoundrel that walks the earth you have given it this night gentlemen you are witness to my words and with that he walked away and i say mr gleason that if ever i lose a chance of showing you up in your true colors before this regiment may the lord forgive me were booked for the campaign now but if you dont appear before that court with credentials that would damn even an indian agent it wont be the fault of the th cavalry and i mean to start about it tonight and he did old stannard had a stormy interview with the colonel forthwith and stirred up bucketts the quartermaster and raymond and turner and merrill among the captains and even thought of rousing canker but concluded not to and they raked out their pencils and when the escort started back next morning with mr gleason the sergeant was intrusted with a batch of letters to various staffofficers setting forth in unequivocal terms gleasons reputation as opposed to rays brilliant and gallant if somewhat reckless record even the colonel inspired by stannards fiery eloquence sent a few lines to the general commanding the division expressing the desire in the regiment that there should be a suspension of proceedings against ray until they could get in from the campaign even billings turned to at stannards urging and wrote personally to ray and to the officer who was named as judgeadvocate of the court and everybody felt glad to be rid of gleason as he rode homeward in gloomy silence everybody felt that he would be powerless for harm little dreaming how ineffectual those letters would be as far as the present case against ray was concerned little dreaming how his going was but the means of coiling still more closely the folds of suspicion and dishonor around the gallant comrade whom all so gloried in for his summers work little dreaming of the days of doubt and darkness and tragedy that were to envelop those they left behind at russell little dreaming that from them and from friends at home there was coming utter isolation that before them lay days and weeks of toil and danger and privation of stirring fight of drooping spirits of hunger weakness ay starvation wounds and lonely death little dreaming that when next they reached a point where news from home could come to them onehalf their gallant horses would be gone broken down starved or shot to death many of their own number would have fallen by the way and that of the bold warlike array that rode buoyantly in among the welcoming comrades in the camp of the gray fox only a gaunt haggard tattered unkempt shadow would remain when eight long weeks thereafter there came to them the next sad news of ray chapter xxi rays troubles here we are billy whoop what did i tell you official communications disrupt bad grammar the chief sends back your letter wants it changed again i suppose its the old old story you can and you cant you will and you wont youll be damned if you do youll be damned if you dont ray took the paper with a hand that was hot and flushed for a week he had been in close confinement and that and a complication of annoyances and worries had combined to make him fretful then some grave anxieties were added to his troubles and then his quick impetuous nature had done the rest he had no coolheaded adviser in blake who had taken up the fight with him and now he was involved in an official tussle with the post authorities that added greatly to his fevered condition he was sore in body for the wound in his thigh was now beginning to trouble him again he was sore at heart for except the impolitic blake he did not seem to have a friend in the world there had come one or two kind little notes from the ladies up the row as they called the stannardtruscott household when they did not care to be more explicit but these had ceased and what was worse in his days of worry and trouble and heartsickness ray had sought comfort in an old solace that had done no great harm when he was living his vigorous outofdoor life but was playing the mischief with his judgment and general condition now that he was penned up in the narrow limits of his quarters very very anxious had mrs stannards face become very wistful and anxious too was miss sanfords and very sympathetic was mrs truscotts the first few days of his arrest they used to stroll down the line and make it a point to go there and chat with him on his piazza and this exasperated old whaling who was indignant that the cavalry ladies should make a martyr of their regimental culprit the third day of his arrest they were all seated there on the piazza while ray sat at his open window and hogan his orderly had led dandy around to the front and the pretty sorrel the light of his masters eyes until eclipsed by one before which even dandys paled its ineffectual fire was cropping the juicy herbage in the little grass plat in front of the piazza and being fed with loafsugar by delicate hands blake was sprawled over the railing limp and longlegged chatting with mrs truscott miss sanford was seated nearer the window where rays eager eyes seemed to chain her and mrs stannard was doing most of the talk for they seemed strangely silent it was a pleasant picture of loyalty and esprit de corps thought mr warner as he came down from the office but to old whaling coming home crabbed from the store where his post quartermaster had beaten him several games of pool it was a galling sight the ladies bowed in quiet modified courtesy there was no cordiality whatever in it blake straightened up and saluted his superior in a purely perfunctory style that had nothing of deference and little of respect in it and the colonel and his quartermaster both raised their caps in evident embarrassment they looked back at dandy after they had passed on a few rods and blake muttered now billy boy theyll be sending you a note to keep your horse out of your front yard hereafter but blake had undershot the mark that evening there came bad news rallston had been named as one of the principal witnesses and ray had telegraphed and written to his sister at omaha asking where he was his letter explained the situation he was in and though he would say nothing to accuse her husband he told her that one of the allegations was that he had accepted five hundred dollars from him as a bribe to induce him to pass certain horses the facts were these rallston had been among the first to welcome him to kansas city had taken him to his own rooms had been most cordial and kind had brought all manner of loving inquiries from sister nell and an invitation from her to visit them at omaha before his return ray did not and would not drink anything beyond a little wine at dinner nor could he be induced to touch a card at play though every evening some of rallstons friends were there playing poker and ray was a laughing and interested spectator in the course of two or three days rallston had grown very confidential and had finally most gracefully told ray that he had disliked to mention it until he felt he knew him well but that nelly had told him her brother had some outstanding debts he owed money to several different parties and it worried him they were dunning him all at the same time and he could only meet their claims successively now said rallston why not let me be your banker let me hand you the amount you owe these fellows pay em off at once and then youre a free man you can repay me when you choose and if you never do why its all right its nells present to you ive got several thousand dollars in the bank this moment that ive no use for and ray had thanked him from the bottom of his heart and accepted later there began to grow a breach rallston had quickly seen how keen an eye ray had for defects in horseflesh and had striven to get him to accept some horses he knew to be off color ray had firmly refused then later he asked ray to sign an i o u for the five hundred dollars which was done and the next thing he noticed rallston was consorting with gleason and when the board adjourned there was no rallston to say goodby ray went to omaha and saw his sister who was rejoiced to hear how generously her husband had behaved but ray was a trifle worried then at her repeated questions about him though nell was brave and buoyant as ever she was living at the hotel until his return and he did not return up to the time ray left for the regiment ray had written to him and received no reply now he had written to her asking where he was and then she broke down and told him she had not seen her husband for a month and had only an occasional line she needed money at that moment and knew not where to find him she thanked god they had no children this was one letter to cause ray bitter anxiety another came that he read with infinite surprise turned over the enclosure in his hand rose and looked through his bureaudrawer and then with a long whistle of consternation and perplexity shoved the note and enclosure into his pocket all that night he was restless and feverish the next morning brought a new trouble once let a fellow get in arrest and all the buzzing contents of pandoras box will be turned loose upon his unlucky head he had risen late could eat no breakfast and his wound was troubling him there came a knock at the door and the orderly with the commanding officers compliments was that horse of the lieutenants private or public property why public of course said ray but say to the colonel that each officer of the th cavalry has been allowed to use one horse for campaign purposes to be considered as his own blake had gone off somewhere it was too early for the ladies ray fretted and worried wondering what this new move could portend when he heard a row in the backyard and in came hogan full of fight and wrath theres a doughboy sergeant out there sir as says hes ordered to take dandy to the quartermasters stables an i told him to go to blazes an whin he shtepped by me an into the paddock an began untyin him i told him he had a right to shpake to you furrst an he said hed slap me into the gyardhouse if i gave him any lip and i turned the kay on him sir an here it is i locked em both in sir shure they couldnt take the lootenants horse without his knowin it sir ray took the key and hobbled out to his back door simply telling hogan to come with him he was thunderstruck at the idea of their taking dandy from him he never thought of that as a possibility dandy who seemed after that wild nightride to be part of himself go and open the door and tell the sergeant to come here said ray but the instant the sergeant was released he rushed out with fury in his eye fell upon hogan seized him by the collar and with rage in every word and expletive ordered him to go with him to the guardhouse swearing hed teach him to resist an officer in the discharge of his duty hogan clinched his fist and looked first as though he would knock the sergeant into the next yard which he was physically able to do but discipline prevailed he lifted neither hand nor voice but simply looked appealingly at his own officer as the sergeant marched him past ray called to the irate infantryman to hold on a moment he would explain but ray was in arrest and could give no orders the sergeant knew that for the time being he was virtually the superior he simply did not choose to hear the lieutenant but went on with his prisoner across the parade lodged him in the guardhouse then went to the quartermasters and reported that he had been violently resisted by private hogan locked up by him in the paddock with the horse and that as soon as he could get out he had arrested private hogan and confined him by your order sir the customary formula in such cases made and provided meantime dandy finding himself untied and the stabledoor open had ventured forth from the paddock while his master had hurried through the house to again fruitlessly call to the sergeant from the front door and as the sorrel sniffed the mountain breeze and felt the glow of the sunshine on his glistening coat all his love for a wild gallop had possessed him he trotted out on the triangle in rear of the houses looked triumphantly about him a second or two with his head high in air his nostrils quivering and his eyes dilating then with a joyous snort and two or three exuberant plunges with streaming mane and tail he tore away northward and went careering over the prairie miss sanford seated near her window in an armchair and a revery heard the thunder of hoofs and ran to see what it meant she stood some minutes watching dandy racing riderless over the springy turf before she knew that grace too was by her side gazing from the same window if billy ray could have seen those two faces when marion turned to her friend the quick hot flush on one the speaking eyes of both he would never have done what he did do turn back to his room with a bitter imprecation on his lips with anger and desolation in his heart and raising his hands in almost tragic gesture of impotent wrath as he glared around at the walls of his undeserved prison he heartily damned the fates that had consigned him to the unsympathizing limits of an infantry garrison he heartily included the colonel and quartermaster in his sweeping anathema and then oh ray ray it was so weak so pitifully weak he dragged forth the old demijohn filled and drank a bumper of rye hurled the goblet into flinders against the door and threw himself upon his bed in an ecstasy of pentup wrath and misery just as blake came tearing in to tell of dandys escapade yes it was wofully weak but as wofully human that the breach between the post authorities and the cavalry officers was widened by the days occurrences goes without saying blake went and asked for hogans release on the ground that as a cavalryman he had done perfectly right in refusing to let the horse go until he had seen his own officer but the colonel properly replied that that by no means justified or explained his locking up the sergeant and in plain language said that hogan should be tried forthwith blake then urged that dandy being a regimental horse should be returned to mr ray as the colonel well knew the circumstances that had endeared them to each other but the colonel replied that an officer in arrest had no use for a horse and that mr ray had no right to a public animal anyway again had the colonel law and right on his side then blake declared that the whole regiment would resent such an action and the colonel was punishing ray before he was even tried and the colonel who was meek as moses in the presence of his wife and who preferred peace to war when there was any chance of becoming personally involved but knew his strategical strength in this contest and was prepared to use it most properly pointedly and justifiably told mr blake that unless he too desired to figure as the accused before a courtmartial for insubordinate conduct he would mend his ways forthwith meantime to leave the office and blake went if blake had been wise as gleason he would have cultivated mrs whalings society instead of dropping her as he did in this critical state of affairs when the good lady called to see the ladies of the cavalry the next morning she referred with poignant sorrow to the fact that those two misguided young men were drowning their sorrows in the flowing bowl mrs stannard ventured a disclaimer but mrs whaling had her information straight from the quartermaster and was not to be downed mrs stannard wrote a few earnest words to mr ray making no mention of what she had just heard but begging him not to lose heart at having to part with dandy and saying they would all be down to see him the next afternoon and he must be sure and be ready to welcome them ray and blake had been drinking confusion to the doughboys together during the evening and the former was very feverish and excitable when the letter came he knew well that somebody had already been telling her of his weakness and it only angered him he wrote no answer until later in the day but when he did it was to say that while he would be glad to see them tomorrow as suggested he could not but feel disappointed that they had not come this very afternoon but as they had not come he and blake proceeded to get into more mischief it almost broke rays heart when that morning dandy was led past his window and presently he saw the post quartermaster a bulky youth of some forty summers climb on his back get a rein in each hand and with knees well hunched up and elbows braced settle himself according to his ideas of equestrianism in the big padded saddle as dandy felt a trifle fresh and chafed under the weight of the heavy rider and heavy dragoon bit he switched his tail and tossed his head being instantly rewarded by a fierce jerk on the huge curb and a shout of whoa there that stung him into amazed and suffering revolt and drove poor ray almost distracted dandys mouth was tender as a womans ray rode him with the veriest feather touch on the rein and to see his pet tortured by such ignorance was more than he could stand he flew to the door and shouted for gods sake man dont use that curb hell go all right if you give him his head but the infantryman only glared probably did not hear he was so busy trying to keep his seat and paying no attention to ray went alternately jerking and kicking up the row while dandy startled amazed tortured and highstrung backed and plunged and tugged at the bit a mother who sees her child abused by some ruffian of a big boy knows what ray suffered from that scene only to such and to the trooper who loves the horse who has borne him through charge after charge who has been his comrade on campaign after campaign shared wounds and danger and hunger and thirst with him will rays next move be conceivable he threw himself upon his bed buried his face in his arms and broke down utterly he and blake concocted between them later in the day a letter to the colonel expressive of their views as to dandys rights but the letter was so pointed a protest against their seizing a regimental horse for quasiquartermasters purposes and so deep a sarcasm on infantry horsemanship that it came back with a stinging reprimand even warner felt it a slur then blake tried another setting forth that as neither the commanding officer nor the quartermaster had been in saddle since the war of the rebellion if they had then the latter being a promotion from the ranks they could not be expected to know what they as cavalrymen were required to know that a horse of spirit was not to be ridden like a castiron mule but luckily for mr blakes chances for future usefulness the post surgeon dropped in just then and casting his eye over the screed coolly took and tore it up sent blake over to the hospital for the steward chatted pleasantly with ray while he dressed the wounded thigh pointed significantly to the demijohn saying theres where much of this fever comes from no more of it ray and then when blake came back took him out and gave him a rasping told him that his hotheadedness was only making matters worse for ray and that he must take things quietly he knew that ray hadnt been treated right about the horse but old whaling couldnt be expected to have any more sentiment on such matters than his stolid quartermaster and by fighting them he was simply doing harm in fact said the doctor ray is now in a very feverish and excitable state and if this continue i cannot say what will result so a more temperate letter was written and ray bowed to the yoke and meekly signed a civil explanation to the quartermaster of the horses character and the proper way of handling him but that worthy had meantime represented to the colonel that mr ray had come to his door and sworn at him when he mounted that morning and he would have no advice and so by direction of the commanding officer a communication was sent to mr ray to the effect that as he was no longer responsible for the care of the horse he would refrain from interference with or suggestions to the post quartermaster this was the letter that blake had brought in with a flourish and that morning all that day from eight am until late in the afternoon without water without his customary feed saddled and bridled poor dandy stood in the hot sun tied to a post in front of the quartermasters house in full view of rays front windows the quartermaster was too stiff and chafed after yesterdays experiences to attempt to mount today but he could worry the horse and madden ray by keeping him tied there switching the flies from his scarred flanks and wistfully neighing and pricking up his ears every time any one approached along the walk blake had gone to town early in the morning after giving that letter to ray hogan was in the guardhouse a prisoner ray was penned to the limits of his house in arrest he could only see and hear the suffering of his pet and not relieve him late in the day he called to a soldier going by and offered him a dollar to go to the horse and tie him to a post ten yards nearer where there was a little shade the soldier untied and was leading him away while dandy tripped gratefully after when the quartermasters hibernian accents were heard thundering an order to come back wid dthat harrse the soldier saluted and said mr ray had asked him just to move him into the shade and the officer damned the man for not knowing better then ray came to the door and asked the soldier to take dandy a bucket of water and as the man carried it and the horse pawed and whinnied at the welcome sight the quartermaster appeared on his piazza and shouted in wrath to the soldier not to interfere again or hed have him in the lockup and poor dandy like an equine tantalus was robbed of the needed fluid ray could bear no more he kept one foot inside the doorway as his arrest demanded but leaning far out with blazing eyes and clinching fist he hurled his challenge at the quartermaster in a voice that rang along the row like the to arms of the trumpets you cowardly brute ill horsewhip you before the whole garrison the moment im free the surgeon heard it and came hurrying to him mrs turner heard it and feared poor mr ray must have been taking too much the colonel heard it far up the row and incorporated it in the additional charge and specifications he was drawing up against mr ray but the ladies up the row were busy dressing to come down according to promise and see him and they did not hear ah no nine out of ten of those who read this may say it was all improbable impossible or if true that there was nothing but drink to explain poor rays frantic outburst but ask any cavalryman who deserves the name and we will rest the defence with him the ladies came as mrs stannard had promised and with anxious face the doctor met them at the gate mr ray was in no condition to see any one that night mrs stannard returned with the doctor to his bedside ray was delirious in a raging fever chapter xxii a shot at midnight while as has been said no further news of affairs at russell reached the regiment before they plunged into the thick of the campaign and were soon cut off from all communication there were still three or four days in which the officers could talk over matters and write their letters to be sent back from the intrenched camp at goose creek by the first party that was numerically strong enough to undertake the journey the colonel had been furnished a brief synopsis of the charges against ray and stannard swore with a mighty oath when he read them that from beginning to end the whole thing was made up by gleason and that other scoundrel rallston the officers came together and stannard told what he knew of rallstons shadowy record in the past and one by one gleasons hints sneers and slurs about ray were dragged to light and exploded there were men sitting around the colonels tent a hardy bushwhacking set of frontiersmen they all looked who for very shame wished themselves away cankers cheeks burned as he recalled how often he had permitted gleason to defame ray crane and wilkins hung their heads and tugged at their stubby beards and looked uncomfortable for the whole tenor of talk was an enthusiastic and vehement vote of confidence in the kentuckian knowing him to be hotheaded and rash there was great anxiety about him and one impulsive fellow suggested that they all sign a letter to him expressing their belief in his innocence and their confidence in his cause this would not do said the colonel it was tantamount to insubordination individually they were at liberty to write but it must not be done as a regiment and so it resulted that only two or three wrote to him and one of these was canker stannard was not fully satisfied it was agreed that at the very first opportunity they should have another general talk and the officers had then gone to their various tents to send what might be the last messages home they were to march over against the rosebud at dawn and it was only a few miles gallop across the divide where custer and his gallant men lay at their shallow graves most of them by this time disinterred by prowling wolves or vengeful indians truscott too had written to ray and it was not easy he had written to grace a long letter and that was harder still three days had elapsed since gleasons explosive announcement of that strange tableau at his home he had disdained to listen to explanation or to further statement he would not condescend to ask webb a single question but he had called him aside that morning and said a quiet word should you ever need a solution of what may have seemed a mystery to you webb in what you mention having seen mrs truscott and my friend ray i mean you have simply to remember that the news of that massacre over yonder has unnerved every woman in the army and that mrs truscott is not now in a condition to bear any shock i had asked ray to go regularly to my house he was incapable of doubting her he would not doubt ray and yet and yet there was something about the matter he did not like she had written to him three pages that afternoon after it all occurred and had mentioned nothing of rays being there nothing of her having been agitated during his visit nothing at all of it and yet such a scene had occurred he could account for there being a scene but he could not reconcile himself to her utter silence upon the subject in his letter to ray he of course said nothing of it in his letter to his wife he gently lovingly pointed out to her that it was not right that he should be told by strangers of her being seen sobbing upon the sofa when alone with mr ray and that she should make no allusion to a matter that had struck them as so extraordinary could he have taken her in his strong arms and used just those words in speaking of it with all the grace of love and trust and tenderness accenting every syllable she would never have mistaken the mood in which he wrote but who that loves has not marked the wide difference between such words written and spoken when the letter came it cut grace to the heart and it was the last letter to reach her in one whole month the next had to come way around by the yellowstone was it likely that in that intervening month she should care to see much of ray all over the northwest that column went marching and chasing after the now scattered bands of crazy horse and sitting bull always on the trail always pushing ahead from the tongue to the rosebud then over to the powder then up to the yellowstone then while miles went across after the fleeing uncapapas and their wily old rascal of a leader the gray fox gave his ragged followers a few days in which to bait their horses and patch their boots and breeches then on he led them after the ogallallas and brulйs far across the little missouri over to heart river where rations gave out then down due south by compass through flooding rain heading for the black hills two weeks march away it was summer sunshine when they cut loose from tents and baggage at goose creek with ten days rations and the clothes they had on it was freezing by night before they saw those tents and wagons again down in the southern hills where they came dragging in late in september having lived for days on the flesh of their slaughtered horses and in all these weeks of marching and suffering and fighting no line had reached stannard or truscott or anybody from the wives at home there were sore and anxious hearts among them but those at home were sorer still it was the second week in august when those last letters came from the th to russell it was the second week in september before they heard from them at the bivouac on the yellowstone it was the second week in october before the next news came the hurried letters brought down from the black hills and telling of their homeward coming it was the last week in october as they rode bronzed and bearded and gaunt and thin herding in the disarmed bands of red cloud that the orders were received returning them to winter quarters far down along the union pacific nearly ten days march to the south and meantime meantime how very much had happened at russell it was the twelfth day of mr rays arrest and the sixth of his sharp illness that mr gleason arrived at the post and went to report to the commanding officer mrs truscott and miss sanford seated on their piazza saw him alight at his quarters from the stage and immediately went in and closed their door mrs stannard had been with them awhile the evening previous ray was entirely out of danger and was sitting up again but very quiet and weak gleason it seems had taken a roundabout way on his return and had stopped two days at fort laramie from which post he did considerable telegraphing the mail coming direct from fetterman brought those letters which were sent by the sergeant three days ahead of him and not a lady in the cavalry quarters at russell except perhaps mrs wilkins would now receive him mrs stannard met him on the walk soon after his arrival and passed him with a mere inclination of the head and the coldest possible mention of his name but she saw he was thin and haggard and very anxiouslooking he was closeted with the post commander a long time and came out looking worse old whaling was swearing mad over a letter from stannard and one from the commanding officer of the th plainly telling him that if he had been induced to take steps against mr ray by any representations of mr gleason he would find himself heavily involved and now gleason plainly wanted to crawfish and to declare that whaling had used as facts what he had only suggested as possibilities whaling was also notified that they proposed to ask the department commander to have proceedings against ray suspended until the return of the regiment from the campaign and meantime here was the young gentleman sick on his hands at the post and that blundering bulletheaded quartermaster of his had got him involved in another row mr blake had made an application to department headquarters for a board of officers to appraise the value of one public horse which he lieutenant blake desired to purchase had written to a staff friend at omaha a graphic description of dandys and rays devotion to each other and the decree of divorce which was passed by colonel whalings order the quartermaster had meantime had dandy out in the sun for two more days tied to the post and had been notified by mr blake that if he ever spoke to him except in the line of duty he would kick him and things were in almost as eruptive a state at russell in this blessed month of august of the centennial year as they had been at old sandy during the pelham rйgime only only who could this time say it was a woman at the bottom of it and yet was it not gleasons unrequited attentions to our heroine that prompted much of the trouble fie on it for a foul suggestion is woman to be held responsible for a row because more than one man falls in love with her and yet again she who has been so studiously kept in the background all these dreary chapters has been coming to the fore on her own account in plain cavalry language miss sanford has twice taken the bit in her teeth and bolted gleason once discovered anent the clubroom that she had a temper mrs turner was the next to arrive at this conclusion it was the day after mr rays illness began mrs whaling was paying an evening visit mrs turner had dropped in as she often did where the ladies were apt to gather and despite mrs truscotts polite and modest expression of her disagreement with mrs whalings views that amiable lady persisted in descanting upon mr rays intemperate language and conduct and repeatedly intimating that it was all due to intemperate drink the general had said so and that settled it miss sanford sat with blazing eyes and cheeks that flushed redder and redder she was biting her lip and tapping the carpet with the toe of her slipper mrs whaling was called away by some household demand before she had fairly finished her homily and then mrs turner who had narrowly watched these symptoms determined to test the depth of miss sanfords views upon the subject the revelation might be of interest it does seem a pity that mr ray should have done so much to ruin his fine record does it not miss sanford ruin it mrs turner pardon me but you speak of it as though you believed in his guilt as though you thought him culpable if i were a lady of the th i should glory in the name he had made for it and be defending not abusing him and with the mien of a queen of tragedy she swished out of the room to cool her fevered cheeks upon the piazza well gasped mrs turner if i had supposed she cared for him i wouldnt have suggested such a thing an instant it is not a question of her caring for him as you say mrs turner spoke up mrs truscott with unusual spirit he is my husbands warmest friend were all proud of him all indignant at his treatment and your language is simply incomprehensible just didnt mrs turner tell that interview with variations all over the garrison within twentyfour hours she had incentive enough the ladies flocked to hear it and one absurd maiden saw fit the next evening to simper her congratulations to miss sanford on her engagement but by that time marion had recovered her selfcontrol she met mrs turner as though nothing of an unusual nature had occurred she laughingly even sweetly thanked the damsel and told her she was engaged to no one but in another way she had come out like a heroine she loved horses as has been said she had wept in secret over mrs stannards description of dandys seizure and she was vehement with indignation at the subsequent treatment of mr rays pet and comrade no one ever saw marion sanford so excited about anything before said grace she could not refrain from going to the door every little while to see if dandy were still tied there in front of the quartermasters and she would have gone to that functionary himself and implored him to send the horse back to the stable only she could not trust herself to speak but the second day she could stand it no longer she boldly assailed colonel whaling pointed out to him that for two days poor dandy had been kept there in the hot sun tortured by flies and begged him to exert his authority and stop it it made the quartermaster rabid he knew somebody must have been interfering but that night the colonel told him he must take better care of the sorrel who was looking badly already and ordered him to be returned to the corral for a day or two but this very night as dandy was being led away she heard blake say to mrs truscott id give anything to buy him and give him to ray could you buy him she exclaimed all flushing eagerness why yes if i had an unmortgaged cent miss sanford he said with a nervous laugh she rose her eyes and cheeks aflame and stood before them almost trembling while her hands worked nervously then do it mr blake dont let him suffer another minute buy him for me no matter what he costs and then you give him to mr ray i i mean every word of it you can have the money this instant the check at least grace sprang up and threw her arms around her neck you darling how i wish i could do it was all she could say but miss sanford was simply paying no attention to her she was waiting to hear from mr blake who was too much astounded to speak that evening it was all settled that blake should make immediate application to purchase and he went home spouting shakespeare by the page perfectly enraptured with this new and unsuspected trait in marion and perfectly satisfied that it was not for him the paper went in and preceded by blakes personal letter to the staffofficer was forwarded to omaha with an unfavorable endorsement the post quartermaster had said that except the band horses there were none there that were not needed by the quartermasters service and daily in use all the same the order was promptly issued and came back in four days with the detail of colonel whaling the post surgeon and mr warner gleason was not named a singular thing since he was the only cavalry officer except blake now for duty at the post and they had begun officer of the day work but the very day the board met ray was out on his piazza taking the air with extended limits and rejoicing in the letters that had just come to him from the fellows at the front the same mail had brought mrs truscott that letter from jack which sent her to her room in misery and towards evening mrs stannard came down to see him awhile and hear his letters and tell him of her own mr gleason passed out of his quarters girt with sabre he was officer of the day and walked over towards the guardhouse across the parade blake had gone up the row he wanted to give them a chance for a quiet talk for rays heart was full of gratitude to the majors noble wife she had nursed him like a mother in his delirium and illness she had nursed him as she had other fellows when they were down and they none of them forgot it as blake passed number and glanced back towards the rear windows he saw a sight that to use the words he often affected gave him pause standing cap in hand at the back of the house was the soldier hogan a flush of mingled delight and surprise on his face and his mouth expanded in a grin of embarrassed ecstasy in front of him was miss sanford daintily dressed as usual holding out her hand she caught sight of blake pressed something into hogans hand and sprang quickly back can she be sending ray a note was his first thought he concluded not to go in just then but went on his way that night hogan was unusually conversational around the house he was plainly exhilarated he came to the room where the two officers were seated and stumbled over mr blakes boots what on earth do you want hogan asked ray looking up from his paper and pipe i was wanting to clane the lootenants pistol sir an it isnt in the holster you neednt clean it tonight said ray coloring i want it what the dickens do you want it for tonight said blake let him have it it hasnt been cleaned for a month never mind hogan not tonight could i be gone for a couple of hours sir if theres nothing else the lootenant wants oh yes go ahead i shall not need you until morning would the lootenant take care of this for me said hogan holding out two twentydollar bills i might lose it if i tuk too much dont take too much then you sinner where did you get this money sir shure the lootenant mustnt blow on me said hogan with rapture in his eyes and a glibness born of poteen on his tongue but that courtmartial was the makin of me fortune sir shure not only did the lootenant an misther blake give me a fine charactther and ten dollars to boot but the moment do i get out of the gyardhouse mrs thruscott sends flanigan for me an when i get there shure its the young leddy as wants to see me youre a good soldier mr hogan says she and youre true to dandy you are faix i am maam says i an long life to him and the man that rides him says i shure its hes the soldier maam and the boss rider of the regiment too i know it mr hogan says she all ablushin like an im proud of ye for bein so thrue to him in his throuble says she faix an the men would murther me miss if i wasnt says i and so they would begorra and thin says she now how much did they punish you on that court says she tin dollars blind an sivin days on the in the gyardhouse maam says i an says she heres twinty for the tin they robbed ye of and five for every day they kep ye from yer masther an dandy an begorra lootenant she ran in the house before iver i could shpake another wurrud go it mickey free shouted blake roaring with laughter ray had grown redder and redder as the irishman told his tale and at last laughing to cover his confusion bade him begone that night was still and beautiful too excited by the events of the day to think of sleep marion sanford was awake long after midnight there was no moon but the skies were cloudless and a summer breeze played with the curtains of her open window far down by the stables she heard the call of the sentry at halfpast twelve oclock a few minutes later there was a sharp sudden report as of a pistol somewhere down the row then as she sprang to the window she heard a stifled cry then all was silence again unless was it fancy she felt rather than heard a running footfall excited startled she hastily threw on a wrapper and shawl and ran in to grace who was sleeping quietly as before looking out on the parade she could hear men running rapidly over from the guardhouse something terrible had happened she now felt sure then a man was heard speeding up the walk towards the commanding officers she could see him as he darted by and listened intently he banged at the colonels door and then presently more men came hurrying by still she did not like to call she feared to awaken or shock grace but in another minute as a member of the guard ran by mrs stannards clear voice floated out on the night air what is the matter corporal lieutenant gleasons murdered maam shot dead in his room good heavens who could have done it i dont leastwise maam they they say twas lieutenant ray chapter xxiii in closer toils a coroners inquest was in session at russell and in the benighted regions of the eastern states where the functions of that worthy public officer are mainly exercised in connection with the demnition moist remains of the found drowned or the attenuated skeletons of the starved there can be but faint conception of the divinity which doth hedge a coroner in a frontier city where people as a rule die with their boots on perhaps it was a proper consideration of the relative importance of the two offices which had induced mr perkins to decline with thanks the nomination of territorial delegate to congress and to intimate through the columns of the blizzard that he sought no higher office at the hands of the people than that in which to the best of his humble ability he had already served two terms as the emoluments of the coronership were dependent entirely upon the number of inquests held during the year the position in an ohio town of five thousand inhabitants would hardly have taken precedence over a seat in the house of representatives but a lively frontier city the supply centre of all the stock mining and trading enterprises to the north of the railway a town that had been the division terminus since the road was built and was the recognized metropolis of the plains well that was different somehow said mr perkinss friends and as his gleanings had been double those he would have received in congress that is in the way of salary mr perkins had wisely decided that so long as business was brisk he preferred the exaltation of holding the most lucrative position in the gift of his fellowcitizens his decision had been a disappointment to other aspirants for not only pecuniarily was the office of first importance but in the very nature of his functions the coroner acquired in the eyes of all men a mysterious interest and influence beside which the governor of the territory the mayor and even the chief of the fire department felt themselves dwarfed into insignificance for four years mr perkins had been a busy man he dispensed far more patronage than the delegate to congress as he was constantly besieged by a class of impecunious patriots to put em on the next one a stranger arriving by train and seeing a man shot down in front of some one of the gamblingsaloons would have been perplexed to account for the rush of the crowd in one direction instead of scattering till the shooting was over and then concentrating to stare at the victim it was a race for the coroner and a place on the jury was the customary reward of the winner too much precipitancy in some such cases resulting in the discovery by mr perkins on arriving at the scene that the corpse was humorously waiting for him to set up the drinks had resulted in the establishment by him of a system of fines in the event of similar false alarms but as has been said the coroner had reigned for several years as the wealthiest the most envied and admired of the public officials he had invested in mines and real estate had become a moneylender and capitalist and for some time considered himself on the high road to fortune when the discovery of gold in the black hills caused a sudden hegira thither of ninetenths of the shooting element and the summer of found mr perkins a changed and embittered man cheyenne aint what it used to be he would regretfully say as entire weeks would elapse without a fatal termination of a row fellers who used to shoot on sight only sit around and jaw now its gettin slow as any dd onehorse town east of the mississippi and in the general gloom of the situation mr perkins had more than once regretted that he had not gone to congress it was with a thrill of renewed hope therefore that he heard the loud knocking at his door before dawn and descending received with illconcealed gratification the message of the commanding officer at fort russell that his services were needed there at once an officer had been shot to death in his bedroom it was one thing to air his importance before an admiring audience of townspeople but this this was something bordering on bliss for the time being he could sit in judgment on the words and deeds of those military satraps at the fort perkins had bundled a jury of his chums into carriages and started out across the prairie before the smoke from the morning gun had fairly died away by the time the men had finished breakfast the jury and the reporters were at their work and an awestricken group stood silently at the gate of the little brown cottage wherein death had set his seal during the watches of the night it was in the back room of the first floor that the jury had assembled there on the narrow bed lay the mortal remains of the officer whose deathcry had startled the garrison so short a time before men and women had spoken with bated breath with dread and horror on their faces with heavy load at heart many had not slept at all since the news flew round the garrison at one oclock it was shocking to think of mr gleason as murdered but that he should have been murdered in cold blood without a word of altercation and murdered by an officer of his own regiment one so brave so gifted so popular as ray was simply horrible and yet who that heard the evidence being given slowly reluctantly painfully before that jury could arrive at any other conclusion even before the jury came sentries with fixed bayonet were stationed at rays bedroom door and no one was allowed to go in or out except by order of the commanding officer the colonel had not gone to bed since being aroused the moment the post surgeon had announced that gleason was stone dead the body was lifted to the bed lieutenant warner was placed in charge of the room with orders to see that nothing was touched or removed and the colonel began an immediate investigation the sergeant of the guard who with one or two men had been out searching the rear yards had handed the colonel on his arrival a silvermounted pistol smith wessons of handsome make and finish with every chamber loaded but one he had picked it up just by the back gate on the guard were engraved in monogram the letters w p r and as the colonel held it up private hogan who had been assisting in raising the body to the bed gave one quick look at it exclaimed oh holy mother and hurried from the room he was sternly called back and came white and trembling do you know that pistol sir whose is it hogan wrung his hands and looked miserably around answer at once its its the lootenants sir what lieutenant misther ray sir oh god forgive me sobbed poor hogan and covering his face with his hands he burst into tears where is mr ray demanded the colonel in a voice that trembled despite his strong effort at selfcontrol he was here sir when i came said the sergeant of the guard he was kneeling over the body and told me to hurry out on the prairie the murderer had run that way mr ray is in his quarters colonel i took him there just before you came said blake entering at the moment and blakes face was white as death who was here besides mr ray asked the colonel of the sergeant not a soul sir the body lay there on its face where the blood is on the floor and mr ray was kneeling beside it trying to turn it over i thought i was standing in front of the company quarters just over here sir when the shot was fired and i heard the yell i ran hard as i could straight here and it wasnt half a minute and you saw no one else at all no one sir the lieutenant said the man as did it rushed out on the prairie between the hospital and the surgeons and it was dark sir and no use looking coming back i picked up the pistol right by the gate stay here all of you said the colonel mr blake i want you and in another moment blake went silently up the row the colonels orders were that he should guard his comrade until relieved by the officer of the day with his sentries but the coroners jury had investigated still further the web of circumstantial evidence that had enveloped ray by eight oclock that august morning was simply appalling it summed up about as follows the sergeant of the guard had been making the rounds of the ordnance and commissary storehouses and heard voices out on the prairie as of men coming from town listening he recognized those of hogan and shea the latter being lieutenant gleasons orderly they were apparently coming from the direction of the house on the hill as the resort out by the little prairie lake previously described was termed and as they were not boisterous at all though evidently merry he had not gone towards them but entering the main gate he turned to the left to go to the guardhouse and was opposite the second set of company quarters when he heard voices at lieutenant gleasons excited but unintelligible then the shot a scream and he ran full tilt not more than two hundred yards into the house and through the little hall to the back room where a light was burning there lay lieutenant gleason on his face with his head to the back door which was open while lieutenant ray was kneeling between the body and the back door all he said was quick the man who did it ran out on the prairie past the doctors and the sergeant had pursued but returned in a moment or two having seen nobody but hogan and shea who came running back with him shea went for the doctor and hogan to call lieutenant blake the corporal of the guard then arrived with two men they sent one for the colonel lieutenant ray again told them to hunt the murderer but they found nothing but the pistol when they returned the second time the colonel and surgeon were there but mr ray was gone sheas testimony was sensational hogan had come to him about tattoo and proposed that they should go out and have a quiet time at the house on the hill he had plenty of money and had already been drinking a little shea went but fearing hogan would take too much and get into more trouble had persuaded him to start for home about they came across the prairie and were talking pretty loud heard no pistolshot or cry saw or heard no one except the sergeant though they had come through the gap between the hospital and surgeons quarters shea said that he had been mr gleasons striker soldierservant for two years knew his character and habits well and knew there was trouble between him and mr ray questioned as to particulars shea went on to say that there had been a terrible row between them the day mr gleason started for fetterman he didnt know what it was about but had overheard some of the language from the back kitchen and the last thing lieutenant ray had said was if ever you breathe a word of this to a soul or something like that ill shoot you like a dog he was sure of the last words and he thought then he wouldnt like to be in mr gleasons place sheas words produced a marked effect but no more so than did hogans whom grief and liquor had made somewhat maudlin like every irishman in the regiment he thought the world of ray and it cut him to the heart to have to testify against him but he recognized the pistol at once as the lieutenants and the fact was dragged out of him that before tattoo the previous evening he had gone to get it and clean it and found it was not in the holster he asked the lieutenant for it and was refused i want it was what the lieutenant had said mr blake very calm and very white was brought in next and faced the impressive coroner and his jury he corroborated hogans statement as to rays language about the pistol said that he had gone to bed upstairs at eleven oclock leaving ray reading in the room below and knew nothing more of the affair until called by hogan when he had run to mr gleasons quarters and after a moment had taken ray home and insisted on his going to bed the lieutenant was just recovering from a severe illness was weak and unstrung and the affair threatened to bring on a relapse there had been an open breach between the two officers for over two years and of late he knew not how it had widened the deceased frequently maligned lieutenant ray and the latter never spoke of him without aversion questioned as to his knowledge of anything that occurred between them on the day of gleasons departure he said he knew nothing ray had refused to talk on the subject the surgeon had given the necessary medical testimony as to cause a gunshot wound penetrating the heart and causing almost instant death the post commander told of the charges against lieutenant ray and of the fact that the deceased was a principal witness indeed an accuser and that seemed all that was necessary the jury desired to hear what mr ray had to say and they questioned the doctor as to his ability to see them the surgeon had replied with professional gravity that so far as he was concerned he thought his patient should not be disturbed but that the gentleman himself had insisted that no obstacle should be thrown in their way if they felt disposed to examine him mr ray was cool as a cucumber though fully aware by this time of the fearful array of evidence against him blake flew back to his bedside as soon as he heard that the coroner had decided to question him and with tears in his eyes implored him to say nothing but ray had smiled faintly and held out a warning hand ive never hidden a word or deed of my life blake and what has to be hidden now is for anothers sake not mine time enough for lawyers when the case comes to trial a coroners jury can only express an opinion i could not rest easy now without the vindication of a full trial and so the coroner and his jury filed solemnly in rays voice was placid and his eyes steadfast and true he was courtesy itself to the members of the jury and all patience even under the insinuations of the coroner that made blake furious his story was briefly that he had strolled out to his rear gate to walk up and down in the yard a few minutes before retiring he did not say to gaze at a certain window up the row being in arrest he was permitted to go no farther and just after the sentrys call of halfpast twelve he was startled by hearing excited voices apparently in the rear room of the quarters two doors away then a shot and a scream he had hurried thither and at the back gate of gleasons quarters a man rushed past him on tiptoe and at full speed ray had caught his arm an instant but was thrown roughly aside and the fugitive had fled like a deer through the open space between the hospital and surgeons quarters he himself was weak from recent illness and unable to pursue but hurried into the back door of gleasons quarters which was open through the kitchen and there lying on his face in the back room was the deceased dressed in shirt and trousers apparently even then dead the sergeant came almost immediately and soon mr blake who presently reminded him that he was in arrest and had no right to be in any quarters but his own and took him home questioned as to enmity with the deceased he said he had long disliked him and that of late the feeling had become intensified questioned as to the affair of the day on which the deceased had left the post he admitted there had been a violent scene and that he had threatened him he also admitted that the pistol was his but that it had not been in his possession since the day the deceased left the post questioned as to the cause of his quarrel and some further matters he spoke very quietly as follows these are matters gentlemen that cannot influence your decision no statement of mine can well counteract the chain of circumstances in this case i cannot tell you where my pistol was and i must decline to say one word at present of the cause of my late quarrel with the deceased in this he was firm and what other verdict could they arrive at the deceased came to his death by a gunshot wound inflicted with murderous intent and to the best of their belief by the hand of william p ray a lieutenant in the th regiment of cavalry u s army when they were gone to their deliberation and ray was alone with his friend he called for a scrap of notepaper thought earnestly a few moments and then rapidly wrote in pencil a few lines blake he said take this to mrs truscott and give it to her personally there will probably be no answer if you cannot see her ask for miss sanford they were all in the parlor mrs stannard mrs truscott and miss sanford when he reached the house three sadder faces he had never seen the first question was as to the verdict of the coroners jury blake shook his head it can only be one thing indeed was not that what mrs whaling had been there to tell them already with a simply maddening array of embellishments mrs stannards blue eyes were red with weeping and mrs truscott looked as though she had wept for hours indeed she had been long before the shot was fired marion sanford alone was quiet and composed her eyes were clear as ever though deep dark rings had formed beneath them and her soft lips were set in constant effort to repress emotion blake briefly told them how calm and brave ray was how he had refused to explain about the pistol or to give any particulars of his quarrel with gleason merely saying it had been of long standing there were many things that he blake must attend to at once and so if they would excuse him he wished to see mrs truscott a moment and she followed him to the piazza falteringly ray told me to give this note to no one but you mrs truscott and i inferred that he wished you only to see it said he to his surprise she drew back her hand her lips began to quiver her eyes to refill she made no effort to take it he looked at her wonderingly mr blake i i cannot take it i cannot explain and then abruptly turning she rushed into the house and up the stairs poor blake stood one moment in dire perplexity and then went back she wouldnt take it billy she said she couldnt but d n me if i can fathom it rays eyes grew stony every vestige of color left his face he covered it with his thin white hands and the man who had braved death and torture to save his comrades who had borne uncomplainingly resolutely patiently the trying ordeal of his examination by a gang of suspicious men who had suffered in silence the ignominy of a criminal charge rather than drag to light a defence that might involve a womans name now quivered and shuddered and turned to the wall with one low moan of agony cut to the heart by the fragile hand he would have died to shield chapter xxiv the grasp of the law to a man of mr blakes temperament the next few days were hard to bear he was worried half to death and yet when mrs turner saw an opportunity and with a suggestive glance at his lean legs sympathetically inquired if he wasnt afraid hed lose all his flesh he was fully able to appreciate the feminine dexterity and malice of the allusion his quick wit could have suggested a deserved repartee but even in his misery blake would say no wounding word to a lady of the regiment he had good reason to take very little comfort in her however as an exponent of the regimental feeling on which the th had prided itself mrs turner was far too voluble on the subject of the awful disgrace that had been brought on their good name by this fearful tragedy and while she hoped and prayed mr ray might be innocent it was evident that she was far from believing it a possibility just now her time was taken up with mrs whaling and the infantry officers for there was a blockade at number the ladies had twice asked to be excused when mrs whaling and mrs turner called mrs truscott was feeling unable to see any one said the servant but mrs stannard was with her but blake had expected nothing better of mrs turner and attached little importance to her opinion what had stung him to the quick was the sight of rays suffering when that note came back to him refused he was amazed at mrs truscott for to his masculine mind and to rays worn and wearied senses only one construction of her conduct was apparent she believed him guilty and shrank from his note as she would from his bloodstained hand of that desolate night neither he nor ray could ever be brought to speak thereafter blake sat for hours by the bedside of his stricken friend listening in helpless misery and wrath to the occasional changing of the sentries and watching as a sorrowing mother might watch rays wordless suffering most of the night he lay with his face buried in his arms but blake could see by the clinching hand the shudders that often shook his frame the constant nervous tapping of his foot beneath the coverlet that he was wide awake alive to all his sorrows the doctor had come and prescribed sedatives and promised to come again if he did not sleep ray had silently taken the medicine and for one instant blake had caught sight of the face that was now dear to him as any brothers he threw himself on his knees and tried to draw the hands away as ray once again turned to the wall for gods sake billy he wellnigh sobbed dont turn from me so there aint a man in all the th could believe it of you what need you care for what a nervous woman thinks but ray only pressed his hand a moment and simply said ill come round all right after a while dont worry old fellow but he hadnt come round at midnight blake decided he must have a drink and he offered ray some whiskey thinking to benefit him in some way ray heard and said nothing but put out his hand and gently pushed it away shaking his head and this capped the climax of blakes perplexity at one oclock seeing that ray was still wide awake he had decided to go and fetch the doctor he was fearful of the effect of this long mental strain but ray seemed to divine his thoughts and in a voice so soft and patient as to melt blakes raging into tears he begged him not to disturb any one ive got you blake what do i want of a doctor along towards morning blake dragged in his buffalorobes and spreading them on the floor by the bedside soon dropped into a sleep of utter exhaustion when he awoke ray was standing at the window cleanly shaved dressed in his newest and neatest undress uniform and listening calmly to mr warner who in a voice plainly showing his agitation was saying something that brought blake to his feet with a single bound a warrant had been issued as the natural result of the inquest the officers of the law had come out from town and it was the commanding officers order that he be turned over to the custody of the civil authorities blake would have burst into a fury of invective and denunciation but rays hand restrained him still weak from his unhealed wound from recent illness from mental agitation and sleeplessness blake thought he never saw ray so brave so strong as when he made his reply it was my expectation to see the commanding officer this morning mr warner as my dress indicates since he remands me to the charge of the civil authorities what i had to say to him must be said to them i shall be ready as soon as i can change to civilian dress and so with only blake to help stow away the few books and papers he desired to lock in his trunk for even faithful hogan had been forbidden to enter the room ray quietly made his preparations and in a few minutes stood arrayed in a business suit that had been made for him years before and was decidedly out of fashion a carriage had driven to his door and two heavilybuilt men were lounging at the gate blake wild with nervousness and wrath was making slow progress with his dressing and ray took from him the little handbag he was bunglingly striving to pack ill do this blake you go on with your dressing of course i understand you mean to go in with me but now let me say a word i have had plenty of time to think and this is just what i want what i must have nothing short of a full trial can satisfy me now and as for being handed over to the civil authorities well is it any worse than what i have had to bear here by heaven but therell come a day of reckoning for that coldblooded soulless bowelless old block in the headquarters office just think of the kicking hell get when the th comes home but ray what im worried about is this bail you know you cant stay there in jail and i dont know any of these local plutocrats ive thought of all that you are to ask no one if i were out on bail i would have to come back here and in all the world there is no spot where i have known such misery i prefer the jail at cheyenne to such freedom as this has been at russell in a few days my sister will reach me and then well see now hurry i want to get away before guardmounting in a few minutes blake was ready and ray told him to call in the officers they entered the room and the first one as he did so by an instinct which he could not himself explain took off his hat as he caught sight of ray standing quietly at the window his followers though evidently unused to such a display followed suit the leader began to read his warrant but ray raised his hand and smilingly checked him never mind it my friend it is all in due form no doubt you brought handcuffs i suppose and the man was already fumbling in his left pocket for them ray went on in the same quiet tone you wont need them so keep them in your pocket i am glad to go with you now if you are ready and the officer who like every man in cheyenne had heard all about the night ride that saved waynes command and respected the young feller that made it was glad to find an awkward question put out of his way he had reddened with embarrassment but was grateful to ray for taking the trouble off his mind as they left the house and poor hogan looking over the banisters upstairs broke into an irish wail of grief and the corporal of the guard instinctively brought his left hand up to the shoulder in a salute that made his musket ring a casual observer would have said that mr ray was showing his visitors to their carriage the door shut with a snap the horses started with a crack of the whip and in another moment the silent quartette were whirled away through the east gate before anybody up the row was fully aware of what was going on meantime there had been a night of misery elsewhere in the garrison mrs stannard had asked permission of the officer of the day to go to ray with the doctor at nine oclock the officer of the day said he would go and see the colonel and let her know he went but did not return at ten oclock mrs stannard wrote a note to the colonel and that punctilious soldier replied through his adjutant at halfpast ten he was very sorry but for several reasons he was compelled to refuse all applications to see mr ray until the morrow mrs stannard in her indignation could hardly find words to thank mr warner for the courtesy he personally displayed in the matter she sent a servant to the corporal of the guard to ask him to say to mr blake that she desired earnestly to see him a moment the corporal said he would as soon as he had posted the next sentry but he forgot it until long after eleven owing to an excitement over in the band quarters and then blake thought it best to wait until morning and so it happened that one woman whose heart was full of faith in and sympathy for ray was balked of her desire to send him full assurance of her thought for him she could not sleep however and at midnight walked alone down the row and asked the soldier at the gate to give this little note for ray to the sentinel within but the man came sadly and respectfully back the sentry dare not pass it in it was against his orders she looked wistfully at the dim light showing through the curtains of the front room but turned wearily away a dim light was burning too in mrs truscotts room up the row and she tapped softly at the door thinking that like herself they might be still awake but no answer came and at last she went to her own lonely quarters oh how she longed for her brave blunt outspoken luce that night he could find a way of helping ray and would do it despite all the official trammels that the post commander could devise she was sick at heart but next door lay a woman whose unrest was greater still whose trouble seemed more than she could bear mrs truscott had arrived at the conclusion before ten oclock that night that she was the most miserable woman on the face of the globe jacks letter arriving the day previous was as kind as well expressed and as thoughtful a screed as ever mortal husband penned but being like other husbands only mortal he had failed to bring about the exact effect which was intended whether this was his fault or hers could not be determined entirely by an inspection of a copy of the letter since letters may be read with a thousand different inflections and the most passionate heartoffering be made to sound like a torrent of sarcasm perhaps it is neither here nor there whose fault it was grace read the letter with burning selfreproach it was the second time he had had reason to find fault with her true she had acted as she supposed for the best and after consultation with mrs stannard mrs stannards letter was to go by the next mail and explain the whole thing to the major who if he deemed advisable would carry everything to truscott but as we have seen that explanatory letter had never reached the regiment it with bags full of other letters was lying in the wagons at goose creek while the th was on the chase away to the yellowstone and grace had the misery of believing that jacks last thought of her as he rode off to battle was that she had had some sentimental scene with ray had been surprised in the midst of it and had concealed it from him she had spent a distracted afternoon had written jack page after page in which amid tears and kisses she had recorded her determination never to let another man see her alone an instant never to receive a note of any kind from ray or anybody else never to speak to a man if she could help it she hated them all all but one whom she had wronged and deceived and whom she adored and worshipped now and heaven only knows what all she felt comforted somehow when she had slipped that letter into the box at the adjutants office late that night and had gone so soundly asleep that she might not have known of the murder until morning but for marion and then that next afternoon that very next afternoon after she had written all her impulsive wifelike loving promises to jack what should come but a note from ray to be delivered privately to her let any young wife of less than a years disenchantment put herself in mrs truscotts place and say what she would have done of course dear madam i hear you say vous autres she neednt have made such a fool of herself she might have explained or something i quite agree with you that is what all of us think who have survived the delirium of the honeymoon that mielle de la luneacy which all of us must encounter as our children do the measles but you see mrs truscott was not yet through with it and what is more i have heard you remark on several occasions that she was an awfully weak sort of a heroine and would make jack wretched yet bless your womanly hearts i never pretended that she was a zenobia or a jeanne la pucelle or a susan b anthony she was absurd if you will but she was utterly in love with her husband as mrs turner said and thought far more of him than the rest of mankind put together which is more than some of you can say though im bound to admit that she had better reason than most of you placens uxor mea frankly included she had rushed upstairs for a fresh burst of tears and presently marion all love and sympathy came to see her and the result of that interview complicated matters in a way that baffles description so far from upholding her course miss sanford had looked first grave then frightened then indignant in plain words she told her that at such a time when the man who had saved her life saved her honor showed himself her best friend her husbands best friend stood charged with a foul crime of which she well knew him to be guiltless and had sent her a simple note that could have no possible purpose other than to say that now at last he might to save his own name have to tell of gleasons fiendish conduct towards her to refuse it to send it back oh grace grace you dont mean you could have done that oh it was monstrous it was shameful and marion sanford had rushed into her own room banged yes banged the door locked it put a chair against it would have moved the washstand up against it but her strength gave out and she hurled herself upon the bed in a tempest of passionate tears ah well even now ten years after it is no easy thing to write or tell of those days it was part of our purpose to go around the garrison and show how other people looked at the matter but it may be as well to say that except blake warner and the surgeon every officer thought ray guilty so too did most of the men except over in the band quarters where there was the excitement that night it was caused by the snare drummer a pugnacious young celt who burst in upon his comrades at eleven oclock with a loud defiance of doughboy justice and an oath that he knowd the man as shot gleason and suspicioned ray and hed have him at the gallows yet reporters and special correspondents had been at the fort interviewing everybody who would talk and after the manner of their kind making the dumb speak in a way that would put to the blush the miracles of holy writ there seemed but one theory among those in authority that ray was guilty this was duly heralded to an eager public and the evening extra and the morning journals in columns of detail had prepared all minds for the culprits coming a crowd that blocked the street had gathered in front of the building in which were located the offices of the marshal the sheriff and other legal magnates and rays pale sad face looked out upon a host of curious eyes in which his own brave and unflinching caught not one gleam of sympathy deadwood dick a ruffian who had murdered a soldier for his money went in through that doorway a fortnight before amid many shouts of encouragement and the buoyant reflection that no local jury had yet found a verdict of guilty against a citizen of wyoming where the offence committed was against the peace or property of uncle sam but a jury that would triumphantly acquit the selfstyled scourge of sandy bottom on the ground of temporary insanity would be apt to look less leniently upon one of those swells at the fort had there been a man to raise the а la lanterne of rejoicing democracy had not the murdered man been himself one of the official class blake and his revolver would probably have stood alone between the accused and lynching as it was but for the one faithful comrade of all who had loved and believed in him realizing it all yet calm sad and selfpossessed ray stood at the bar of justice practically friendless it was early when mrs stannard came down from her room after an almost sleepless night first call for guardmounting was just sounding as she stepped out on the piazza and noted little knots of men here and there all gazing intently towards the east gate where the dust as of a recently passing vehicle was settling back to earth she opened mrs truscotts door and saw marion sanford slowly descending the stairs her face very white and wan out in the diningroom could be heard voluble voices weeping and irish expletives of mingled wrath and grief and then with eyes dilating with horror with streaming hair with pallid lips and a ghastly look in her white face grace truscott clad in a morning wrapper came rushing through the little parlor into the hall gave one glance at her girl friend and then stretching forth her arms she cried oh maidie maidie its all my doing they theyve cacarried him off to jail and then prone upon the stairs she threw herself burying her face from sight of all chapter xxv whose gauntlet the duty of assorting the papers and caring for the property of the late officer had devolved upon lieutenant warner telegrams from relatives in the distant east had requested that the remains be sent thither by express for burial and only a few hours after the accused murderer was taken into custody the body of the victim of the midnight assassination had been turned over to the undertaker in town for necessary preparations the garrison seemed still paralyzed by the shock and except the sentries at the storehouses and stables there was little appearance of military duty going on guardmounting was conducted without music and the customary drills of the recruits were out of sight it was an atmosphere of gloom that pervaded the garrison and only one of its ladies had been seen on the promenade for two days mrs whaling like some human fungus seemed to thrive in the palllike depth of the social darkness and depression she circled from house to house and swooped down upon the inmates flapping and croaking the old story of woe and foreboding or what was welcome in comparison some new tale of further entanglement for ray judging from that righteous ladys conversation there seemed no doubt that she and the omnipotent judge had settled it between them just when he was to be hanged she was one of the first to receive and to enlighten with her views a serious young man who came from denver with a letter to the commanding officer and brought with him a prominent and rising attorney from cheyenne these gentlemen seemed a trifle disconcerted at the fact that the few questions they addressed to the colonel were promptly answered by his wife and when one of them finally looked at the other and remarked that it was time to go and examine the premises and the effects the bearer of the letter not unnaturally hesitated and coughed dubiously he did not know whether to ask permission of the officer or the lady they declined her invitation to have a cup of tea and some luncheon saying they had dined in town and the colonel said he would walk down with them only mr warner had been allowed in the quarters since the inquest they had gone but a few steps along the walk when a hack drove up and mr blake catching sight of them from its interior shouted to the driver sprang out and stiffly saluting the commanding officer handed the lawyer a batch of telegraphic despatches and taking the little man from denver to one side said a few words to him in a whisper then turned and was walking away when the colonel concluded it time to assert himself mr blake he called sir said blake facing him but coming no nearer you appear to have been in town sir had you permission to leave the post i did not think to ask sir as the only friend mr ray appeared to have in this garrison i went with him to jail you will think hereafter and not presume to go without my consent then i take this opportunity to ask permission colonel i desire to return to my friend this afternoon in ten minutes in fact the post regulations sir require that such applications should be made at my office between nine and ten am i am not disposed to consider them at other times especially where gentlemen absent themselves without authority and he turned majestically away am i to understand colonel that you refuse me permission to return to mr ray in such an emergency as this choked blake i will consider it sir i will take it into ahem consideration when i have finished other matters now gentlemen we will proceed and so having established the fact that after all he was the post commander and laid the ghost of their lingering doubt colonel whaling led on down the row with the duly reassured civilians and blake too much saddened by recent events to feel the wrath that at other times would have overpowered him contented himself with glaring after his chief a moment ejaculating the bloodless old mummy and then turning on his heel he went to his lonely quarters the lawyer read the despatches handed them to his denver friend pointing significantly to a clause in one of them and the colonel felt himself omitted from their confidences the sentry at the door of the quarters lately occupied by mr gleason presented arms to the post commander and looked inquiringly at the civilians you may admit these two gentlemen he said and pass them in and out but no one else except the adjutant is he here now mr warners voice from within answered yes and the party entered the adjutant was seated at a table in the front room with a pile of envelopes and letters before him he rose as they entered mr warner said the colonel this gentleman is sent here from denver under telegraphic request from department headquarters they failed to notify me of such intention he added in a tone of official grievance but i presume it is all right he is a member of the mountain detective force and desires to make full inspection of the premises i presume you can confer with him and with mr a green he lingered a moment as though in expectation of an invitation to remain but none came blake meantime had been searching about rays room he ransacked through an old valise that lay under the campbed tossing diaries scouting books itineraries rough field maps and sketches out on the floor until he came to a package marked mem receipts this he glanced through gave it a satisfied slap and stowed it in a portable writingdesk replaced in the valise the disturbed items and then went on packing some changes of underclothing and linen in rays little trunk twice he called for hogan but the shouts were unanswered he went to the door to summon the hackdriver to take the trunk and the man said that a lady had just stepped down to ask if he would come up there to number eleven when he could find time looking thither he saw mrs stannard at the open door of truscotts quarters and went at once her voice trembled so that she could hardly ask for ray he is just what those who know him would expect him to be mrs stannard calm and resolute i never saw a man appear to better advantage than he did before the officials there in town i never knew how much there was in him until today mr green tendered his legal services and had a short talk with him and hes out here now so is a detective from denver and colonel rand will get here from department headquarters tomorrow oh we shant be without friends though it did look mighty like it at first but what about bail mr blake how soon can he will he return here he desires no bail mrs stannard jail is preferable to fort russell so far as his treatment is concerned he said indignantly you seem to be the only friend he has mrs stannard flushed and lowered her voice did you explain to him or rather did he ask why mrs truscott could not receive his letter what was there to explain what was there to ask he broke forth in wrath only one explanation was possible and of course i would not speak of it what could any one think but that she believed him guilty and would have no communication with him that was a shot that told before mrs stannard could reply there was a rustle of skirts and a stifled sob within the hallway a rush of light footsteps up the stairs but the door opened and marion sanford appeared blake started to see how white and wan and sad she looked but she came straight to him goodmorning mr blake we were coming out to see you as you spoke mrs truscott and i we do not wonder that you and mr ray should feel as you do but that was all a piteous mistake about that letter last night she held forth her soft white hand shake hands mr blake it wasnt at all what you thought it was a very very different reason and he will forgive when he knows you brought a note from him last night will you take this to him from me let me run in and see mrs truscott a moment said mrs stannard at this juncture and hurried into the hall leaving them alone on the piazza blake noted the dark circles under her pleading eyes he saw plainly the evidences of anxiety and sorrow he could not but see that despite the resolution of her words and manner her voice was tremulous and the brave eyes that looked unflinchingly into his were filling with tears she could not repress he recalled all her enthusiasm in that still uncompleted purchase of dandy in her munificence to hogan he knew well that no matter how he might have misjudged mrs truscotts motives he had no right or reason whatever in letting himself think that this brave glorious loyal girl could have been shaken one instant in her faith in his friend why even ray had checked him sternly when during the night he had once burst forth in an impetuous tirade against the worthlessness of a womans faith and now he could have kicked himself had it been anatomically possible even for his marvellous length and loosejointedness of leg in default thereof he would have dropped on his knee but somebody several somebodies watched the interesting interview from a distance he bowed over the extended hand as a courtier might over that of a queen he wished he dare kiss it on the same on any basis but he took it warmly forgive me for every word miss sanford but ive been sore tried of late i would be less apt to forgive you if you did not resent every suspicion of mr ray it is too late to undo last nights wretched work or the misery it caused us i have tried to explain it all for mrs truscott but what i want now is to know what he needs is it money or influence or anything tell me truly mr blake i want to know all you can tell me you shall know before i tell another soul as yet forgive me again this will supply his greatest need and holding up her note he turned quickly away she was blushing now crimson but there was something she had to know and so recalled him has anything new been discovered have any steps been taken towards finding the murderer mr green the lawyer whom we have consulted has had an interview with ray and he has a clue now of some kind that is being investigated and you know whom he suspects he has not told me miss sanford and something that occurred recently in the garrison had set me to asking him questions which he declined to answer another matter entirely i saw he had reasons for keeping it to himself mr blake have you still that note he sent last night no he burned that this morning has he said nothing nothing to indicate whom he suspects not to me as yet we have had too much to attend to perhaps but it is plainly something he hates to allude to look mr blake they are calling you down the row you will come back and tell us what it is yes and at once warner and mr green were indeed calling him among the letters in the breastpocket of gleasons blouse were three signed rallston they were reading them with eager interest when the little detective from denver sauntered in from the rear room this a gauntlet lieutenant was lying with some other things on top of the bureau were you going to pack it in the trunk yes why well a single righthand glove wont be of much use to the relatives of the deceased especially an old worn one like this wheres the mate i dont remember seeing one well you soldiers dont generally keep one glove without the other where was this before you put it with the things i picked it off the floor near the head of the bed and there wasnt another thereabouts i saw none the detective went back to his work and the officers with mr green to the letters when they had read them through to the end blake arose you will admit mr warner that i have excellent reason for asking and expecting permission to rejoin my incarcerated friend now said he with sarcastic emphasis if that doesnt knock the courtmartial charges cold as a wedge what will i never fully believed mr ray guilty of those charges blake and you know it i must see the colonel of course and show him these letters pardon me mr warner said the lawyer tell him of them if you see fit but as mr rays legal adviser i do not propose to let such important evidence for the defence fall into the hands of the prosecution warner flushed hotly i do not refer to you my dear sir but to your commanding officer who is understood to have worked up the case against my client and will naturally feel chagrined to find what liars his witnesses were human nature sir human nature no warner i dont mean you either in that case that is said blake all excitement over the late discoveries but these are ours and by gad we mean to hold them whoop fiat justitia rue it whalings go and tell your distinguished chief that i will be pleased to know whether he has considered my application yet here hold on warner d n it all man im unpardonable for mixing you and him up in the matter forgive me but im all unstrung these last few days if you fellows only knew ray as we do there wouldnt have been this trouble and they shook hands and warner went off to see his chief and had a quick conversation with him that brought the blood to the usually colorless face of the wellpreserved veteran the colonel arose hastily and said he would go with them he wanted to see those letters and he did and looked strangely perturbed as they were read to him and then blake again preferred his request for permission to visit town and to remain all night the colonel hemmed and hawed these papers of course had an important bearing on the case as it originally stood before the courtmartial as ordered but matters had changed materially mr ray is now on trial for his life you see and before he was only on trial for a only for his honor put in blake at the instant very true colonel only for his honor and we have a singular fashion in our regiment of looking upon the one as quite as important as the other the colonel was wrathy he was essentially what is called an office soldier he had regulations and papers at his fingers ends his whole army existence had been spent in the preservation of his health and the cultivation of the peaceful branches of his art no one ever heard of his shooting riding hunting or taking a risk of any kind his habits were methodical as those of the office clock and his one dissipation was the billiardtable his theory of success was founded on common sense take care of your health avoid dissipation shun any and all danger volunteer for nothing do only what you are compelled to do shift all possible work on somebody elses shoulders preserve a purely negative record and you are bound to rise to the highest grades in the army it must be admitted that the laws of promotion are admirably calculated to foster just such a line of argument and that whalings head was level now though wrathy at blake he saw at once that he had been egregiously deceived as to the evidence to be given by rallston on the pending court it was better policy to avoid all that might look like persecution of ray or rays friends he gave a moment of thought to the matter and then said you may go mr blake because i desire you and your regiment to understand that i have no wish to obtrude my ideas of discipline upon you at such a time at any other i would not have overlooked your misconduct at any other time sir it probably would not have occurred said blake still hotly but the entrance of the detective put an end to the talk he still carried the gauntlet in his hand there is no mate to this in that room what is more this glove never belonged to lieutenant gleason it is four sizes too small for him what officer or soldier ever wore one like that he asked it was a worn and reinsoiled gauntlet originally of white washleather finely stitched in silk and with a cuff or gauntlet heavily stiffened with leather inside and this cuff instead of being joined was slashed from wrist to end on the under side and three little buttons and straps were used to fasten it snugly to the arm after being slipped over the hand it was utterly unlike any gauntlet in use in the united states cavalry at the time it was utterly unlike those for sale in the stores of cheyenne blake examined it curiously but could remember none that resembled it leaving the others examining the glove he walked up the row mrs stannard and marion both came down the mere sight of his face brought eagerness and hope into their eyes it was to be observed at this juncture that mrs stannards arm was around that slender waist the symptom has no significance of course among schoolgirls or womanhood in general but it meant a good deal where either one of these women was concerned and blake knew it what wouldnt i give if the major were only here he exclaimed impetuously there are three letters from rallston there with a lot of others showing clearly what a conspiracy had been worked up against ray by that by gleason the last one was written in denver only two days before only three days ago and it shows that he had completely gone back on gleason and accuses him of all manner of blackguardly work he had some conscience after all for he swears he never thought gleason would use what he told him to get ray into trouble he was mad because ray wouldnt pass his horses oh it breaks up the whole business green thinks he should be secured at once and is going to have the detectives after him the moment we can telegraph whew excuse me ladies but im warm and blake leaned limply against the railing and mopped his brow mr blake have you eaten a thing today asked mrs stannard do come in and let me get you a sandwich and a glass of wine not a morsel i want to hurry back to town to hug billy im only waiting for green he tells me that everything can be arranged so that ray shall stay where i left him in a comfortable room in the jailors home instead of where that old bag of skin and bones thought hed get him and he vengefully shook his fist at the colonel who was returning homeward to tell his wife the wonderful tidings of the discoveries in gleasons pockets mrs stannard had not smiled for two entire days but blakes reviving spirits and the welcome news combined to bring back the sunshine to her tired face marion too though listening in silence to what was said clung closer to her friend and looked up with thanksgiving in her eyes just then the lawyer and the little detective came talking earnestly together up the row and naturally all three studied their looks and gestures with eager attention that little denverite is on a scent said blake in a low tone he has been hunting high and low for a mate to a peculiar gauntlet that was found there he says gleason could never have owned it a gauntlet what was it like asked miss sanford with a start like nothing we wear that i ever saw its old and worn but was a handsome glove once mr blake i i want to see it ask him if i may and she stepped eagerly forward her blue eyes dilating her whole frame tremulous blake sprang from the railing and was by the detectives side in three long strides at the whispered words he spoke both the lawyer and the detective glanced quickly and keenly at the ladies the former took off his hat to them the latter seemed to hesitate for a moment then stepping forward he courteously bowed took the gauntlet from an inner pocket and handed it to her the instant she caught sight of it she shuddered and shrank though an eager triumphant light shot into her eyes then as though by an effort she overcame the horror and repugnance that had seized her took it as she might a frog or worm between thumb and forefinger and darted into the house leaving all but mrs stannard petrified with amaze never fear said mrs stannard i know where she has taken it she will be back in a moment up the stairs she flew and into the front room where mrs truscott sat by the window in a low rockingchair grace truscott look at this dont touch it look at those fastenings those buttons who was the only person you ever saw wear a glove like that sergeant wolf marion where how but she was gone like a flash down the stairs again her feet twinkling like magic out in the free air among them all her heart bounding her blue eyes blazing her color vivid brilliant take it she cried take it the man who murdered him the man who wore that glove was wolf the deserter chapter xxvi revelations when colonel rand arrived from omaha the next afternoon and blake met him at the depot he found that there was less for him to do than he imagined he had known ray well for many years of his army life had served with him in arizona and was one of his stanchest friends he was wild with enthusiasm when truscotts despatch was received telling of waynes rescue and rays heroic conduct and he was furious over the tidings that his gallant friend had been placed in arrest on charges that had not been investigated at department headquarters or by anybody who could represent rays interests even before the telegrams came in from the regiment protesting against rays trial in their absence he had started for kansas city armed with a copy of the charges and specifications had easily determined that the civilians cited as witnesses were men who really knew little or nothing but had only a vague hearsay idea of matters which vigorous crossquestioning developed that they had mainly derived from letters or talks of gleasons or had got from rallston himself who said they was riled because he couldnt play off a lot of brokendown mustangs for sound horses on that board no one could swear that he had seen ray drink no one could swear he had played any game for any stake no one could testify to a single act of his that was in the faintest degree unofficerlike or unbecoming a gentleman indeed even the cads with whom gleason consorted seemed to have become inspired with contempt and rand went back to omaha satisfied that the charges were all conspiracy but rallston had kept out of his way he could not reach him no one knew where he was some went so far as to say he was ashamed of having been mixed up with gleason in such a low piece of business even mrs rallston at omaha could tell nothing of her husbands whereabouts and was in great distress over the letters from her brother announcing the trouble in which he was enveloped all on account of rallstons rascality as she felt though he would not say then came the fearful news that gleason was murdered by her brother and the next day she had sold one of the beautiful solitaires that rallston had given her in the days when he was a dashing wooer and on the same train with colonel rand she hastened to cheyenne blake was presented to her as she alighted from the cars and conducted her to the parlor of the hotel where in few words he told them of the discovery of rallstons letters in the dead mans pockets and of wolfs gauntlet in the dead mans room the detectives had urged that nothing should be revealed in this last matter as every effort was now being made to capture the exsergeant and that little man from denver had already a reply from his chief saying that rallston was there and could be produced at any time poor mrs rallston she winced at the professional technicalities but wrote a hurried despatch care of the rocky mountain detective agency enjoining him to come to them at once breathing no word of reproach or blame but telling him that his letters were now in rays hands and they felt that he bitterly regretted the part he had taken in connection with gleason he must come and exonerate her brother from the charge of accepting a bribe to which he was assigned as the sole witness there was a further conference that need not be detailed colonel rand desired first to see some of the prominent business men whom he knew as he proposed to have ray bailed out instanter no matter what that young gentlemans wishes might be and blake giving her his arm escorted mrs rallston through the bustling streets until they reached the jail even then there was a little knot of hangerson watching with wolfish curiosity every comer the officials touched their hats to blake and his veiled companion and looked admiringly at her tall graceful form already something was beginning to whisper that justice had been blinder than ever had been groping painfully in the dark and had nabbed the wrong man mr perkins and his jury had been basely and ungratefully alluded to as a batch of leather heads and it behooved the sheriffs and others to look to the buttered side of their bread lest it too should fall in the municipal mud blake felt her trembling as they passed through the office into a long and dimlylighted hall courage mrs rallston he whispered we are going to lose him you and i but its to a very different captivity oh hes gone this time past all saving just wait till you see her and before she could ask one question in her wonderment a door was opened there was a fond welcoming cry of nell and for the first time in all her life so far as ray could tell the sister fell forward fainting into his arms blake assisted in carrying her to the sofa brought a glass of water and then as she began to revive he silently withdrew and left them together later that afternoon colonel rand mr green and blake had a quiet consultation with the prisoner the matter of bail said rand was already settled on his representations half a dozen prominent citizens had signified their willingness to act mr green stated that he had received advice of other offers at which blake was seen to give him a kick under the table whereon their papers were spread there was really nothing to prevent the arrangement being made this evening so that he might not have to pass another night under the jail roof but ray was firm he would not return to russell in arrest he would not accept his release until it could be freedom he was treated courteously and considerately by the sheriffs people was allowed this comfortable room instead of a cell and he resolutely refused all offer of bail so long as there remained a pretext for the continuance of his arrest on other charges rand himself who had been accustomed to his quick impetuous ways for years could hardly recognize in the ray of today the reckless devilmaycare laughing fellow of two years ago he seemed utterly changed he was years older in manner grave patient tolerant of the opinions of those about him but doubly tenacious of his own and surprisingly capable of demonstrating their justice it has simply come to this colonel i stand charged at division headquarters of crimes that if proven would dismiss me from the service the death of the principal witness is the worst mishap that could have befallen me it leaves me unvindicated because now we cannot impeach his testimony because now my enemies can say that had he lived the result might have been different i urge i claim that i must be tried and blake here is my witness that i have said so from the very first nothing but a trial can clear me fully of the infamous charges you hold there and no friend of mine will delay it an instant so far from postponing that court i say hasten it let it sit at once i am ready today any day to meet and refute the charges i need no friend from the regiment from anywhere i shall not draw on my field record for a cents worth of consideration the case must be tried on its merits i do not believe a witness need be called for the defence but until vindicated i protest against any step that may send me back to russell answer as to that and then we will come to this matter of my situation here and rand agreed with him that the court should meet forthwith and that telegrams should be sent at once to division headquarters urging that no postponement be granted the despatch was written and blake took it to the office then ray went on with his talk and now colonel i have waited for your coming that in your presence i might refer to two points that as mr green has said bore heavily against me with the coroners jury and would have to be met should the case come to trial until it come to trial there are one or two matters which i will not explain simply because they concern others more than they do me as you have seen suspicion is already pointing to sergeant wolf i have connected him with the murder from the first the detective has ascertained beyond doubt that that was his glove that a horse was tied at the northeast corner of the hospital yard about the time of the occurrence and that a bandsman the drummer is almost certain that my pistol which did the work was in the sergeants possession the night he deserted i know it was this note will prove it and he produced from an envelope bearing the laramie city postmark and addressed to him at russell a sheet of notepaper on which without date or signature was written i had to take your pistol time was everything the enclosed twenty dollars will pay compare that writing he continued with dozens of specimens to be found in the office at russell and that will settle it now the jury could not understand why i refused to let hogan have my pistol that night it was because i knew it was gone and i did not wish any one else to know it the colonel could not understand why i would not tell the cause of wolfs desertion i did not wish any one to know everybody i presume wanted to know how i explained away the presence of my pistol at the scene and that was another thing i wanted kept in the dark until until released from a promise that involved the peace of one whom i was bound to protect mrs rallstons eyes were dilating to twice their usual size as soon as notified of the decision of that jury i wrote saying that it might soon be necessary to save my honor to reveal what i had kept so sacred no answer came until until last night full and free release from my promise but i believe that all may be kept sacred still you will understand that i am prepared to explain these matters should the case come to trial but not before even as he was speaking there came a knock at the door a telegram for mr green the lawyer opened and read it thought earnestly a moment and then left the room saying he would soon return it was getting dark and ray lighted the oil lamp that stood upon its bracket rand was watching his every movement and had been quietly jotting some memoranda of his statements as the young cavalryman returned to his seat by his sisters side and took her hand in his the colonel remarked ray i thought i knew you pretty well all these years but i believe im only just beginning to get acquainted with you blake said you had astonished him but your capacity for taking things coolly is an unexpected trait to more than one i fancy now im going to take mrs rallston over to the hotel for tea and then we are coming back tell blake i want him to apply to his post commander for a seven days leave tonight ill send it out and see that he gets it if you wont go back to russell he must be here with you ah here he comes now wheres green was the exclamation that greeted their ears as blake bolted in all excitement i want him quick billy theyve got that man wolf and he wants to see you or somebody hes pretty near gone and fought like a tiger they say where is he asked rand springing to his feet just out here at the edge of town in a blackguardly sort of dive its my belief theyve kept him there hid ever since the night of the murder come we must have green and the sheriff i know ray can go with us therell be a carriage in a minute let me escort you to the hotel mrs rallston said rand then i can go with them this means confirmation of our theory and the end of our troubles he said reassuringly ray very pale and very quiet kissed her goodnight and saw her to the hall promising to send for her as soon as was possible then as for a moment he was left alone he took from an inner pocket a crumpled little note that blake had brought him the previous evening read it lingeringly though with eyes that softened and glowed with a light that no one yet had seen and when he had finished he stood there gazing at the signature and the few words with which the note was concluded believe me dear mr ray she never for an instant thought you guilty and now goodnight i shall pray god to watch over and cheer you need i tell you that your trouble has made me only the more loyally your friend marion sanford oh ray ray here was strength and cheer and comfort for twenty men no wonder you could bear the slings and arrows of your outrageous fortune with that charming endorsement no wonder people thought you changed what would people think or rather what would they say if they knew of that letter and its very comforting conclusion what will be said of our heroine marion when these damaging particulars are brought to light what would the girls at madame reichards have said though they knew she had a romantic streak in her and was a worshipper of heroes what will the cold and unsympathetic and critical reader remark of the unmaidenly lack of reserve which prompted those last few lines what will marion herself say when she hears of them as thus ruthlessly dragged to the bar of public opinion poor marion her cheeks will redden her eyes flash and suffuse her heart beat like a triphammer her white teeth set her soft lips will firmly close she will be annoyed she may admit that in cold blood under any other circumstances she would never have so committed herself and that nothing but the thought of the wrongs and sorrows and sufferings that had been heaped one after another upon the undeserving head of that luckiest of young kentuckians would ever have betrayed her into such an outburst of sentiment she may admit what indeed was the truth that she wrote the whole thing after a vehement interview with grace at a time when she thought she saw her gallant friend dragged off to jail believing he had been denied by those whom he was actually suffering to shield she may say that had there been time she would have less pointedly worded the closing sentence but of one thing you may be certain once and for all she said just what she thought and now against the opinion of the whole world if need be she will stand by those words through thick and thin she will never retract and as for ray he gazed upon them as he might upon a heaveninspired message from a better world he bowed his head and kissed reverently humbly prayerfully the sweet and thrilling words and then and then he bent his knee and bowed his head and with deeper reverence with humility such as he had never known before with a prayer that came from the depths of his loyal heart he thanked god for the infinite blessing that had come to him through the darkness of his bitter trials he rose calm strengthened steadfast as he heard the rapidlyapproaching footsteps of his friends less than half an hour thereafter a little group sat in silence around a rude bed in a darkened room outside sullen and scowling two roughlooking men the owners of the establishment were guarded by the officers of the law while within ray blake mr green the sheriff and an officer of the territorial court were listening to the dying deposition of the saxon soldier wolf the physicians had declared it impossible for him to live another day late on the night of the murder three men returning townwards from the house on the hill had come suddenly upon a gray horse dragging a man by the stirrup they picked the man up and carried him into the gamblinghouse at the edge of town where they laid him upon this bed noting the u s on the shoulder of the horse and his cavalry equipments they sent him away in charge of one of their number and proceeded to search the pockets of the still insensible soldier who was clad in comparatively new ranchmans clothing and who wore a gauntlet on his left hand he had revived for a moment was told that he was among friends and had nothing to fear he said his horse had stumbled into an acequia in the darkness and fallen on him and now he wanted to get up they assured him no horse was there that finding him insensible they had carried him to this place where he was all right if he kept quiet and wolf soon realized that he was in a notorious dive where soldiers were often drugged and robbed of their money he was locked in that night and though suffering intensely from internal injuries he strove to make his escape the next morning people in the neighborhood heard appalling cries and uproar but such things had often happened there before in the drunken fights that took place and not until this day had it leaked out in some way that there was a man there dying from injuries received partly in a runaway and partly in a fight in the house the police made a raid and there discovered the very man for whom the detectives and the military were searching high and low his first words were to ask for lieutenant ray then for a physician and a lawyer and now his story was almost done ray was fully utterly exonerated in brief it was about as follows he was mad with rage at the treatment he had received at the hands of lieutenant gleason and at a deed of his which he would not detail lieutenant ray knew and that was enough he himself had only one thought to follow at once on the trail to find him alone if possible and to compel him to fight him as gentlemen fought а outrance in the old country he took rays pistol and after getting some papers and some clothing he needed from the band barracks he went to the stables raised the shutter and crept into the window of the stall which held his horse led him noiselessly out over the earthen floor to the rear entrance which was easily opened from the inside and long before dawn was on the road to fetterman in pursuit of the stage he had no fear of ranch people betraying him as a deserter they knew nothing but what he was carrying despatches he had received plenty of money but a short time before through friends in dresden he hoped to secure fresh horses and overtake the stage before it reached a ranch where they stopped for meals several hours south of fetterman his plan was wild and impracticable enough to throw doubts on his sanity but he only thought of revenge he said he was determined to waylay gleason and force him to fight but his plan failed his horse gave out long before he could get another he left him at a cattle ranch finally and went ahead on a borrowed plug but to no purpose gleason reached fetterman ahead of him and by the time he neared there he knew that his desertion had been telegraphed still he thought to follow as a scout or teamster and bought rough canvas and woolen clothing hung around the neighborhood but avoided all soldiers learned of gleasons going with webb and actually crossed the platte and followed on their trail until he met him coming back at the head of the little escort keeping his eager lookout far ahead he had easily hidden himself and his horse where he could watch them as they went by and had recognized his victim turned on his tracks and once more trailed him back had lost him and followed the wrong buckboard from fetterman and had gone towards rock creek before he found out that gleason went by way of fort laramie a countryman going in to laramie city had taken some days previous the note with its enclosure to ray he could not steal he said and at last having recovered his horse he returned by night to cheyenne easily learned of lieutenant gleasons presence at russell and that very night rode out across the prairie tied his gray to a post near the northeast corner of the hospital enclosure and stole to gleasons backyard not for an instant had he ever flinched in his purpose he knew the lieutenant was officer of the day and that he would be out to visit his sentries after midnight but it occurred to him he would have no weapon but the sabre and he meant to offer him fair fight a light was burning in the rear room he peeped through the blinds and saw him undressing as though to go to bed he could wait no longer he opened the kitchen door which shea had left unlocked entered the house and rapped at gleasons door the lieutenant supposed it to be shea probably and opened it himself behold the man you have outraged i said i give you one instant only to get your pistol we fight here to the death he sprang back still facing me he was livid with fear he called for help help he ordered me to leave he was a craven and would not fight he called louder and then i fired he gave a scream and fell towards me on his face i had hurled my gauntlet at him as i challenged but there was no time to pick it up i turned and fled some one seized me at the back gate but i hurled him aside and ran on tiptoe to my horse i heard voices coming but no one could hear me i led my horse some distance then mounted and galloped madly this way near town he stumbled fell and rolled on me and i knew no more till i heard them say he was dead and that the herr lieutenant had killed him then i strove to escape and we had a fearful fight they overcame and drugged me i think but again i came to and begged to be let to see you they keep me for the reward perhaps but they see me dying and the police come at last in the solemn hush of the darkened room far from the land where he had been known and loved where doubtless his gifts had been valued and his life until wrecked by that duel was honored the saxon soldier lay breathing his last mad or sane there was no one there to rightly judge the one trait that shone to the end was the strong love of the profession which he could have adorned so well his glazing eyes looked wistfully into rays pale face his tremulous hand sought that of the young officer who knelt there by his side in faint broken accents he spoke his last earthly plea i was a gentleman once herr lieutenant i am soldier even now you are the soldier the men all love may i not take your hand chapter xxvii vindicated life at russell had lost for the time being so much of its customary gayety as to warrant mrs turners discontented descriptive of poky with all but three or four officers absent on campaign without even letters or news from them with mr gleasons tragic fate and mr rays romantic and mysterious connection therewith there was too much of solemn and shudderinspiring element in the daily talk to render conversation at all cheerful all sorts of odd things had happened since the death of that deserter wolf and mrs turner was at her wits end to make her conclusions fit together she had by no means ceased to jump that saltatory satisfaction at least remained to her but she missed the mark so often as to seriously impair for a while at least her confidence in her theories and nothing but a series of serious shocks could have achieved that result she too had her sorrows poor lady for her regimental companions in number eleven had shunned her society to such an extent as to set the whole garrison talking about it though it took very little to accomplish that to begin with mrs truscott rarely went out at all and had denied herself to visitors on many occasions mrs stannard and marion were all the companions she cared to see much of though to mrs turners incredulous wrath mrs wilkins was admitted on the very days when she herself had called and penetrated no farther than the parlor mrs wilkins had enjoyed we use the term advisedly a furious quarrel with the wife of the commanding officer and had driven that exemplary and forgiving woman from the field in utter dismay there had been no love lost between them from the first but mrs wilkins had hotly resented mrs whalings lamentations over rays prospective conviction and his undeniable guilt and had given the venerable black silk a dusting the very day that ray was carried off to prison then came the electrifying intelligence that wolfs dying confession had completely exonerated ray and both mrs whaling and mrs turner had flown to mrs stannard to assure her that neither one of them could have believed in his guilt had it not been for the other mrs whaling was positive that she had never spoken of him except in the love and charity she would have used towards her own son and nothing but mrs turners accounts of his wildness and dissipation would have shaken her faith in him for a moment she had always admired his frank and fearless character and so had the general who was heartbroken to think he had been so outrageously imposed upon by rays enemies mrs turner vowed that she had really loved mr ray like a brother but that mrs whaling had told her of the positive evidence the general had against him and so what could she think mrs stannard listened to both with uncompromising and decidedly chilling silence and each withdrew discomfited colonel rand spent much of the morning after wolfs revelation in overhauling papers with colonel whaling but his visit to the ladies at number eleven was of unusual length and cordiality he left only in time to see ray and blake a few moments in town before taking the eastern train it had been mrs stannards intention to drive thither to call on mrs rallston but she was too late mr greens telegraphic message from denver had warned him that rallston was delirious with fever and after the rapturous interview between brother and sister that followed upon his return from wolfs bedside ray had gently broken the news to her of her husbands illness and before the coming of train time on the following day rand had obtained telegraphic authority for him to escort her to and remain with her in denver his release by the civil authorities would have had about it something of the nature of an ovation when at noon on that day the full details of wolfs confession were spread upon the records but by ingeniously circulating the story that he would return to the fort at sunset blake managed to throw the public off the track his arrest was suspended by the telegram from division headquarters rand was ordered to come thither at once with his documentary proofs of the falsity of the charges against ray and the latter went quietly off to denver with a ten days leave conducting his sister to her husbands bedside he saw no one at russell before going but we have reason to believe that the plethoric missive he sent to mrs stannard derived much of its bulk from an enclosure that was not meant for her eyes at all and blake went back to russell to the lionizing he deserved but the gloom at the garrison was dispelled perforce by the arrival of troop after troop company after company from east west and south fast as cars could carry them all bound for the black hills to meet and support crook who was reported fighting his way southward through unknown regions and unknown numbers of the red men nothing had been heard even by telegraph from the th from any source whatever since the steamer came down to bismarck with sick and wounded and the news that they had pushed out again for the little missouri country the last of august and here it was beyond mid september a whole regiment of cavalry encamped for a day or two on the prairie then marched northward natty artillerymen from san francisco dropped in to pay their respects on their way to the hills not a day passed without the arrival of strange officers scores of men and squadrons of horses russell had suddenly blossomed into first rank as a great supply depot and in all the excitement of greeting the newcomers and sending messages and missives to the dear ones at the front the pall of tragedy was lifted from the post gleason and wolf were alike wellnigh forgotten and then with sudden thrill the news tore through the post and flashed over the wires in every direction that a courier had ridden down from the northern limits of the hills bringing despatches from crook and announcing that though half starved ragged and practically dismounted the followers of the gray fox had reached the belle fourche and would soon be able to push on to the agencies they had dashed upon the sioux villages at slim buttes capturing hundreds of their fat ponies and greedily eating many of them that very night had found the lodges crammed with the spoil of the custer battle had killed several warriors and burned every ounce of indian stores or provisions they could not use and had two days ringing spirited fighting with crazy horse and his charging hosts among the fog wreaths and dripping crags of those strange picturesque upheavals then burying their dead and bringing away their wounded they were once more within reach of supplies though it might be weeks before they could come home another battle and we not there was blakes sympathetic despatch to ray at denver but now the last seemed to be recorded another week and letters might be expected another fortnight and it was known that all the forces were concentrating at red cloud to disarm the disaffected bands near the agencies and then blake and ray too had both sped northward again to join their regiment rays affairs had been summarily settled in this wise rallstons illness had been severe and ray and nell had been constantly at his side when the fever broke and consciousness returned and the patient realized where he was and who were his nurses the mans remorse and shame were something pitiable of him as an impartial historian it is difficult to write since long association with stannard had forcibly impressed his views as to rallstons character perhaps we were as reluctant to hear of his subsequent behavior and to believe in his contrition as mrs whaling with all her meek and lowly piety was to conceive of rays innocence of the various charges laid at his door but in the absence of proof to the contrary we simply place before the patient reader nellie ray rallstons own statement that her husband emerged from that trying illness a very different man that he humbly begged wills forgiveness and hers and that when he was well enough to be moved home he had grown so fond of will that he could not bear to have him out of his sight and that he was rejoiced when orders came for will to go to chicago as it enabled him to travel with them as far as omaha but you must remember we feel bound to say that she was of that loyal loving kentucky nature singularly like her brother for that matter that having once given itself in its entirety to the service of lover or friend is apt to stick to it through thick and thin we may be pardoned we worldlings for doubting as yet the depth and sincerity of rallstons repentance when the devil was ill the devil a saint would be etc you know the application but for the time being mrs rallston went home happier than she had been for ages and ray went on to division headquarters at chicago wondering what on earth was up now he was still on leave still clamoring to be tried that he might be cleared of those charges and allowed to rejoin his regiment his wound had healed though he was still thin and worn and he could not bear to think that there might be any more fighting for the dear old th and he not there but rand had taken rallstons letters and some other papers with him to chicago as directed and the commanding general had seen in less than no time what an outrageous case had been built up against a young officer whose record up to date had been one that appealed to all his sympathies ever since that daring night ride ray had been an object of the liveliest interest to the general himself the cavalry leader par excellence of his day and when rand laid before him all the papers in the case there was an eruption that made the rafters ring but when it came to cooling down and acting on the case much as the general might think ray deserved a triumphant vindication at the hands of a court there were a dozen things to make it impracticable to begin with the court had been ordered before it looked so black for crooks command and the black hills settlers and all those infantry officers who were on the original detail were now plodding up to red cloud the division was wellnigh stripped of everything but staffofficers and if a court did meet what a scoring it might give old whaling and to his own staffofficer who took all that hearsay talk down around leavenworth and never gave rays friends a chance it ended in the generals impetuously directing that the court be dissolved and that ray be ordered there posthaste ill vindicate him he said and he did rays pale anxious face turned all sorts of colors when the general jumped up from his chair and griped his hand like a vise and looked into his brave young eyes and said things to him that filled them with tears and his soul with confusion ray had no words but his heart was full of a delight that none but soldiers know and the lionizing he got that day at division headquarters would have spoiled many another fellow the general could indeed vindicate him he showed him the draft of the letters sent to the regiment and asked with a smile if he didnt think that would do as well as the not guilty of a court and that evening ray took the westward train so as to stop over in omaha one night and see nell and then hurry on by the union pacific to cheyenne his heart was bounding with hope with pride with gratitude and joy but through it all there was a sense of something strange and new to him that tempered every feeling of exultation he had been tried as by fire and humbled softened chastened by the fierceness of the flame even bitterness and resentment seemed expelled from his soul ray was a changed a graver man all that was truthful gallant loyal in his nature was there yet but the recklessness of the past was gone many letters had come to him in the few days he had spent at denver by rallstons sickbed and while mrs stannard had frequently written to tell him how they all were and the colonel sent a courteouslyworded expression of his regret at the credence he had given to the statements of a brother officer and what he termed the misunderstandings of the summer ray was most touched at warners solid and earnest appeal to be regarded as a friend and not as one of the opposition he answered promptly and cordially everything mr warner wrote with a single exception the young adjutant was requested by colonel whaling to put in a word or two for the hibernian quartermaster whom blake had cut dead and who was perturbed in spirit over the prospect of being otherwise lacerated when ray got back warner thought that the colonel or the quartermaster himself should make the proper amende in this case but the latter was a poor hand at epistolary expression and the former had long been a pronounced adherent of that divine right of commanding officers which makes the adjutant the transmitter and medium of all correspondence involving matters of delicate or diplomatic import if the result be successful all right it was written by direction of colonel so and so and is presumably his own wording if it fail then anybody can see that failure is due solely to the clumsy and blockheaded manipulation of the adjutant mr warner conveyed a hope that the quartermaster might be included in the general amnesty but to this ray made no response he drew the line at those who had been unkind to dandy and now he was hurrying back to russell to conduct a large body of recruits and horses up to the hills to meet the regiment and a party of young officers had joined many of them graduates of that very years class at the point young fellows whom mrs truscott had known well but a few months previous when they wore the gray under jacks tuition at squadron drill and ridinghall work their regiments being in the field on active campaign they abandoned much of the leave of absence due them and hastened to report for duty their services were most needed in getting the recruits into shape and here they were at russell enthusiastic at the prospect of seeing captain truscott again devoting themselves to the ladies at his army home and eager to a man to see and know ray whose name was on every lip whom every man of them envied and who would arrive at noon on the morrow mrs stannards piazza was the scene of a levee this lovely sunshiny autumn afternoon she was there with miss sanford and mrs truscott who was reclining in a comfortable wicker chair and vastly enjoying the sunshine the bracing air and above all the merry chat of these young troopers and envying them their northward march would they not be with jack in a fortnight half a dozen of the boys were flocking around the ladies and blake was there sprawling over the railing as was his wont and convulsing the assemblage every now and then with his outrageous travesties and declamatory outbursts blake was in the wildest possible spirits he was bubbling over with fun and the milk of human kindness except for that poor devil of a quartermaster at whom he scowled diabolically whenever they met he had forgiven mrs turner who was quick to see where the gang had gathered that afternoon and was early on hand to lure the new victims already she was making a deep impression on mr corry who was gazetted to her husbands troop and was fetching him farther into the meshes with every glance of her eyes and then came mrs whaling whom blake hastened to meet and with elaborate genuflexions to usher into the circle where she was speedily seated and regaling the company with her views on the chances of the campaign it being the ardent desire of every cavalry lady in garrison that the th should be ordered thither for winter quarters mrs whaling was full of information which the general had received from confidential sources going to prove that a great infantry post was to be established there which he would command while the cavalry remained in the hills until spring blake noted the silence among the young officers and the anxious look in mrs truscotts face mrs stannard had long since ceased to be influenced by mrs whalings statements and he determined on a diversion he felt morally certain that the only confidential communication the veteran post commander had received from any superior in a week was the stinging rap from division headquarters anent the bungle he had made in rays affair and on general principles he felt that he couldnt let an opportunity slip oh come now mrs whaling dont crush all the hopes we had of spending the winter with you here lady you are the cruellest she alive if you will lead us to believe such ill report and here we were all rejoicing that ray comes tomorrow oh mr ray to be sure and how delightful it is to think that he has justified all our confidence in him he returns like a the bayard of old the chevalier sans peur et et sans culotte suggested blake ah yes thanks mr blake as though i could have forgotten it for a moment quite like the chevalier sans peur et sans culotte such a knightly fellow as he always was oh lord yes all nightly especially when the luck ran his way now mr blake how you distort my meaning madame you do me wrong notorious wrong i did but echo the words you spake a week agone you marvel at my meaning nay then tis not less strange and weird than the tongue in which you tell of his perfections less bizarre if you will have french mr blake you tilt at windmills gad thats neat quoth he sotto voce i never said anything about a bazaar though that reminds me that every one of you gentlemen should go to town and do something for the church before you leave the fair has been going on two days now and not one of you has spent a cent there and they so need an organ mrs whaling tell them to have jarleys waxworks and youll be mrs jarley or mrs partington ill be john or ike i dont care which and their fortunes made said blake shaking with laughter so too was mrs stannard behind the palmleaf fan which concealed at least her face miss sanford biting her lips looked reproachfully at blake and mrs truscott hid her face in her hands now mr blake protested mrs turner you never have been in town to church since your coming here and its shocking the way you officers neglect it im sure ive offered to drive you in with me a dozen times true fair lady but those eminently safe animals of yours take an hour to traverse the intermediate league i have to get up too early but mr ray went once though to be sure miss sanford and mrs stannard brought that about oh yes and came home sold he never would have gone only he heard that the text was to be from the sermon on the mount and he thought it was some new wrinkle in cavalry tactics mr blake you are simply outrageous wretch shocking and a volley of like exclamations greeted this outburst mrs stannard rose from her chair and shook her fan at him you shall not teach so irreverent a doctrine here mr ray went gladly and was far more devout and reverential in church than some of the ladies any man could be devout sitting next to miss sanford he persisted but seeing no sign of levity in her face and that her blue eyes were bent upon him in pity rather than anger he abruptly changed his tone to one of melodramatic gravity lady clara vere de vere i cannot stand and face thy frown im not appreciated i must betake myself to other fields ladies when i get in a gale it takes something sterner than feminine rebuke to stop me ill away and see mrs wilkins she likes it if aught ive said to wound thee he continued bowing with hand on his heart in front of miss sanford remember miss de vere in the words of your favorite tennyson the cold upon your old stone gates is not more lyin to you than i did you ever know such a rattlepate exclaimed mrs turner as the long legs went striding down the row and the young officers sat gazing after him in wonderment never replied mrs stannard and yet he has as true a heart and as tender a nature as almost any man i know there was no fun in him while mr ray was in trouble and no more devoted and loyal friend could he find i like mr blake and always have liked him but mrs whaling shook her head no rightprincipled young man could speak so lightly of sacred things ah here comes the orderly with the mail and as she spoke the trim young soldier entered the gate carrying his budget of letters mrs whaling stretched forth her hand to take the packet please maam said he i left yours at the colonels and my orders is not to give the others to anybody but them as they belongs to i will distribute them here orderly she replied with a superior smile as i know all these ladies and gentlemen and you do not she was determined to see who received letters and from whom if a possible thing and she carried her point most of them were for the officers nothing came as yet from the regiment mrs truscott received two or three letters from the east which were not handed her until the selfappointed postmistress had scrutinized the superscriptions so too she inspected the bills and billets that came to the young subs and two letters for miss sanford one from new york the other addressed in a bold vigorous hand was from headquarters division of the missouri chicago at this through all her autumn tresses falsely brown she shot sidelong daggers indeed as she passed it with significant smile i thought hed write even though tomorrow would bring him here himself she said and miss sanford bit her lip and colored far more in indignation than in confusion but rallying like the little heroine she was and bent now on baffling the schemes of the wily interloper she quickly leaned forward and took the letter glanced brightly at mrs stannard and exclaimed with all the delight and naпvetй of genuine surprise why it is for me mrs stannard now you shall not see a line of it for you would not show me yours and then with provoking coolness while grace gasped in admiration and astonishment marion opened and read with beaming smile her letter from ray the only one he had time to write in chicago it was very brief yet when twas finished she wished with all her heart she could escape to her own room and read it once again all by herself it was the first letter in the least like it she ever received it made her pulses bound and it put her mettle to the test to turn at once to conversation with the one youth who had received no letter it made her long for stablecall to sound that she might be alone and read it again and again and yet it was very very simple and direct the trumpets rang their signal soon enough the young cavalrymen doffed their caps and scurried away mrs stannard smiling knowingly said she would take a walk with mrs turner and then the two school friends were left alone maidie what does he say let me read it quietly grace dear i couldnt there she had not seen him since sending that very very outspoken letter the afternoon after he was taken to cheyenne and the letter he had written in answer to that was full of gratitude for her faith in him full of assurance that with such words as those to cheer him he would bear his further trials as became a man but until fully vindicated of every charge he would not return to russell and could not hope to see her but once freed from the odium of any and every allegation affecting his integrity he should come to thank her in person for the strength and comfort her beautiful letter had given him and now he was coming he could not wait for his own arrival since he had to stop over one day the instant he left the colonels presence he had asked for a desk in the aidedecamps room had penned a few hasty lines to her first of all had hurried with them to the rock island depot only a few squares away that they might catch the mail just starting and she she who had proved so gallantly her faith in him be the first to know of his complete vindication ray never wrote such a letter in his life before only thirty minutes before the westward mail starts and this moment i have come unnerved and weak from the presence of the general with the fullest vindication man could ask in the first glow of thoughtfulness my thoughts turn instantly to you may god bless you for the words that came to bless me in my darkest hours may he teach me to show you i can never tell it the infinite value of your words to me may he so guide my future that henceforth my life shall prove worthy the trust you placed in me until it has in some measure so redeemed the past i may not say more only this you before all the world i desire to know of my acquittal of every allegation tomorrow i shall hope to see you before we march for i shall go at once to the regiment there may be little opportunity for words even if i dared trust myself to speak last time in laughing talk it was agreed that i should wear your colors but now even your will would be powerless to prevent me for my heart and soul are pledged to them forever william p ray nor did he mean to say more when writing that letter he meant that she he did not care who else should know that the thought of her friendship and faith had been his mainstay in the troubles which had so suddenly involved his life and wellnigh wrecked him he wanted her to know and he did not care who knew that from this time forth he was her knight sworn to her service and bound to her by a tie he could not break if he would seldom as they had met there had been from the first a halo of romance about their association and she had come to be even before he could realize it the one fair woman in whom was centred the fealty and devotion of his loyal nature he dare not hope he would not expect that one like her could so soon so unsought unwooed have learned to look upon him as anything more than a friend whose loyalty to grace her one intimate and whose friendship for mrs stannard had conspired to make him an object of interest in their daily talk with the humility of true manhood he well knew that his name clouded with the recklessness and debts of his past life was not one that he dare lay at her feet but this too he knew and knew well and would have faced the world to own it as fearlessly as he faced a foe he loved her and as yet could ask nothing in return and yet when blake met him at the station next day and they drove rapidly out over the hard prairie roads and he saw again the white peaks in the south and the sunlight dancing over the distant slopes and the flag waving aloft over the dingy brown buildings of the post and his heart beat with eager joy at thought of seeing her again of touching that soft white hand and looking down into the depths of her clear truthful eyes and studying the face that lovely always had grown exquisite in beauty to him he wondered how he could meet her how he could speak to her and control the longing to implore her to overlook his past life with its follies and its sins and let him prove to her how strong and steadfast he could be if she would but bid him hope and then he set his teeth and tossed his head the old raylike gesture and vowed that without a single word of hope she should see how the faith of one fair woman had changed his whole life he could hardly answer blakes eager enthusiastic talk he could hardly hear what he was saying until he caught the words tomorrow morning four hundred recruits five hundred horses and you go in command so soon then and yet twas what he had prayed for he was eager to see the dear old regiment again he knew well how many faces of officers and men would light up in welcome at his coming in all the misery of the past month he had almost forgotten that in july he was with them at the front how very far away that night ride seemed the ride that waynes and truscotts fellows at least had not forgotten it made him think of dandy and he questioned eagerly if dandy were still there still there you bet he is billy hogans heart will break if you dont say first thing that he looks better than he ever did in his life why how is it that hogan has him again i dont understand why you cant go without a horse man and as commanding officer of the whole crowd you would be entitled to your choice i thought youd rather have dandy and so said you can take another if you want to there are lots of them and beauties now were to go to mrs stannards for dinner at once shall we stop and knock off the dust they were whirling in at the fort gate the gate through which he had last driven a prisoner in the grasp of the law the broad parade was covered with squads of recruits drilling busily and with knots of young officers who looked eagerly at blake and the darkeyed young gentleman in gray by his side along the row were many of the ladies of the garrison and romping children all of whom nodded and smiled and waved their hands as they flashed by quick billy said blake between his set teeth out with you and into the house unless you want to be snared by mrs turner oh by the lord here she comes and mrs whaling too scoot and ray sprang from the light wagon and lifting his hat in salute to the ladies who were hastening down the walk he darted into the house into the cool darkened rooms which he had last seen when there was not a spark of comfort of hope or love in a world of black despair and now here was hogan all joy and welcome and delight there lay the swell undress uniform his cap and gloves and little walking switch all in readiness on the bed and not until he became accustomed to the dim light after the glare of the wyoming sun and the mists of emotion had begun to clear away could he see that hogans bluegray eyes were wet and that he was ready to break down again with sheer ecstasy ray laughed the real old joyous ringing laugh again as he gripped the faithful irishmans hand why hogan old fellow its good to see you again and so dandy is here too is he he is sir and its he thatll be glad to have you on his back again oh murther did the lootenant tell ye how he dumped the quarthermasther in the creek he didnt come billy no time to lose mrs stannards waiting for you she had early dinner as theres to be a farewell hop tonight and ive seen the colonel and you neednt report until afterwards come man called blake hurrying in and so hogans ecstasies were cut short and in a few moments more mrs stannards beaming face welcomed them at the door and both her hands were cordially clasping rays and yet somehow drawing him in and passing him along into the little parlor while she herself remained volubly chatting with blake who did not pass the portals with any rapidity at all ray never could realize much less explain it but in another moment he was standing in the little parlor and marion sanford lovely in her grace and beauty lovely in her shyly welcoming smile lovely in the soft flush that had mantled her bonny face was slowly rising from her chair to welcome him all she said was mr ray as with trembling hands he quickly seized the cool white plump little member that was half extended to greet him and he could not speak he knew not what to say or do he longed for the first time in his life to kneel at a womans feet and press her hand to his lips but that would be an unwarrantable demonstration in these conventional days he simply bowed low held it one lingering moment in both his she must have felt their eager trembling and then without the kiss for which his soul was longing reluctantly let it go and looked once into her eyes miss marion i cannot tell you how glad i am to see you lowtoned heartfelt eager they were all he dare say he meant to be true to his resolve and to prove his worth and his gratitude by something better than words and for once at least in his gallant debonair life ray was mute and at a loss in a womans presence he was indeed conquered heart and soul a delightful dinner they had that little partie carrйe mrs truscott had declined because she said one more woman would spoil it all and she wanted to write to jack and then ray had to go and see the colonel and have a long talk with him about the big command he was to take north on the morrow and to shake hands gravely with the embarrassed veteran and cordially and gladly with warner and to welcome the dozen handsome soldierly enthusiastic young graduates who came in a body to call and pay their respects and tell their young commander how their recruit companies were doing and then there were a host of other affairs to attend to and an inspection of all the five hundred horses that were to bear them northward in the morning and afterwards the four hundred recruits who were to go to the cavalry regiments with him and then came retreat parade and the solemn dinner with the colonel and his amiable better half a dinner which seemed interminable but which was as much a duty as attending rollcall and so it was late when he could get into fulldress uniform and go over to the hop and see her once again warner lucky devil was to be her escort and the young officers would have taken every dance but for the waltz he found courage to ask for at dinner how he rebelled at the idea of having to escort mrs whaling still it was all part of his selfimposed penance thought he with a grave quiet smile as hogan was helping him to dress and the strains of the dance music came floating witchingly over the parade he had only time to see dandy one moment to pet and fondle him and praise his beautiful condition to hogans delight and then just as tattoo was sounding there came into the room the quartermasters clerk with some papers for his signature what are these he asked in surprise requisition for forage for one private horse the property of first lieutenant william p ray th cavalry why man i own no horse thems the quartermasters orders sir lieutenant blake got permission to buy the horse its dandy sir but he said as how it was yours and youd sign the papers directly you got back the forage was issued on that understanding shure its all thrue sir said hogan dandy was bought last week sir and i thought as how mr blake had told you ray said no word more his eyes were filling he signed the papers finished dressing in silence escorted mrs whaling with entire civility and never heard a word she said though she talked volubly every inch of the way and once at the hoproom and he could break loose from mrs turner who seized him to upbraid him for not stopping to speak to her and to tell him she had saved three dances expressly for him and she had such a host of things she wanted to tell him and she had been hearing such a host of things about him etc etc he found blake and caught him by the sleeve no dodging now blakey who bought dandy who gave him to me well dang it i did havent i a right to no old man and forgive my saying it you and i cannot afford such presents what was he appraised at oh they fixed it low because he was to be yours you know i got him for two hundred but blake you hadnt ten dollars when i went away i know full well how much i owe you in this matter bless you old man but the truth now you can afford to tell me when i say i must know before it comes to saying goodnight to her what had miss sanford to do with it everything billy chapter xxviii the colors entwine she was talking brightly with a knot of half a dozen young officers all clamoring for extras when soft and sweet the strains of immortellen that loveliest of gungls waltzes floated on the air and ray stood there before her my waltz miss sanford can i claim you in face of such an array of aspirants she rested her hand on his arm nodding blithely to the group and calling laughingly back to them as he led her away then she noticed how silent he was and for the first time looked up in his face you have not been dancing mr ray no miss marion and it was a piece of selfishness in me to ask this i have not danced since coming back from the cheyenne and yet i could not go without one shall we try will he ever forget her as she looked that night how gloriously deep and soft and tender were her eyes how wavy and rippling her hair how exquisite the delicate tints of her complexion how rich how lovely the warmth of her parted lips her dress seemed as airy as fair as her own quiet grace for the life of him he could not describe it but it was the first time he had seen her in evening attire and marion sanfords neck and shoulders and arms were perfect fair and white and round and lovelier than an angels thought ray as his glowing eyes looked down in rapture upon her she had glanced up in his face as he spoke but his eyes met hers with such uncontrollable worship in their gaze that she could not face them his arm twined lightly about her waist and without a further word they swung away in the long gliding measure that seemed so perfectly in accord with the spirit of the dreamy music she danced lightly as a fairy guided as he would have said with the faintest touch of the rein and he forgot the stiffness of the wounded thigh and everything else but that to the music of all others he fancied most surely the leader had an unusual fit of inspiration that night he was dancing at last with the girl whose beauty enthralled his every sense whose loyalty to him in all his troubles had won his undying gratitude and whom he loved humbly tis true yet thrillingly passionately he never saw that all over the ballroom curious eyes were watching eagerly hers were downcast while his were fixed almost in adoration on her face sweeter softer dreamier rose and fell the exquisite strains will he ever forget the immortellen soft ripples of her hair were drifting close to his lips their delicate fragrance stole over his senses like a spell he felt the light pressure of her tiny hand upon his arm and envied the dead gold of his shoulderknot when once as they reversed and a quick turn was necessary to avoid collision with a bulkier couple her flushing cheek had rested one instant upon it he could not speak a lump rose in his throat and his heart beat wildly what could it mean what could it mean this strange thing blake had confessed to him she she had bought dandy to give to him he must find words to thank her but how could he without betraying all such silence could not last even in the thrilling instant of an avowal the woman does not live who so far forgets herself as to be insensible to the gaze of lookerson totally ignorant of the extent of his knowledge since she had charged blake that it was all to be kept a profound secret thinking only of the necessity of breaking that treacherous betraying silence she summoned her courage and looking up one instant she made some laughing allusion to the fact that mrs turner would never forgive him if he left without dancing with her and indeed he must dance with miss whaling since he had dined there that evening i will try i will do anything you ask or suggest only miss marion we march at eight tomorrow morning come with me to the gallery one minute i must speak to you so after all she had only precipitated matters he had ceased waltzing directly opposite one of the open doors and without waiting for reply with the quick decision that so marked him at times he led her speechless from the room snatching up a cavalry cape from a chair and this as they stepped out on the low wooden piazza he threw over her shoulders several other couples were promenading slowly up and down or gazing in at the dancers he led her rapidly past all these until they came to the end of the platform and there with the moonlight shining full on his eager features ray turned and faced his fate she knew he was trembling she knew his voice was low and broken and husky his words had been hardly audible to her in the hoproom but his emotion any woman could see oh how white and cold and still the distant mountains shone in the pallid light oh how silent peaceful deserted the faraway slopes and ridges over the prairie oh how faint and far and glimmering were the night lights of the stars dimmed into nothingness by the broad brilliant overwhelming radiance of the queen of heaven oh how sweet luring lovelighting were those witching waltz strains floating out upon the breathless air oh how warm and close was the pressure of his strong arm as it held her hand upon his beating heart knowing well knowing what must be coming powerless even if determined to check him she bowed her sweet face and the young soldiers surging love words broke low tremulous but irresistible upon her listening ears god knows i meant to hide as yet until my life could have shown the influence you and your blessed faith have had god knows i meant to have striven to show myself worthy before coming to say what now i cannot restrain but tonight the truth came out that to you i owe my pet my dandy no let me speak he went on impetuously as for one instant she raised her head as though to check him he had seized her hand too and held it down there under the folds of that happy cavalry cape i ask nothing i know ive no right to hope or expect anything as yet you have blessed me infinitely beyond my deserts already but now i could not go i could not go without giving you to do with as you will the only thing on earth i have to offer my heart marion oh my darling my darling dont shrink from me listen sweet one there can be no wrong no shame in your knowing that i love you love you beyond any power of mine to tell you were i to go now after all you have done for me and hide all this simply because i did not and could not hope you would return it yet i would hang my head in shame the man who loves as i do must tell it no matter what the answer be and then there was a moments silence through which she could plainly hear the loud beating of his heart in which she could not find words to speak and yet there lay her hand in his since it was powerless to check him have i startled you marion he whispered low did you not read much of this in my letter she looked bravely up in his eyes her own were full of unshed tears her sweet face was lovely in the pale moonlight and as once more she saw the worship in his eyes the flush of joy pride of what else could it be again mantled her soft cheeks she made no effort to withdraw her hand i have no right to be startled mr ray i could not but see something of this all in your letter though that might have been attributed to a very unnecessary gratitude but i would not have you think anything like like this due to me because of my interest in all that has taken place this summer we all thought mrs stannard and grace and i that you had been most outrageously wronged and it did seem as though everything had turned against you and i made mr blake buy dandy because that seemed the only way to save him too from being abused i couldnt bear it oh mr ray the letter did not half prepare me for all this i have liked you i do like you better than any man i know she said and now her swimming eyes were fixed full on his and his lips were quivering in their eagerness to kiss away the tears but he drew her no closer that in itself is more than i had a right to hope that in itself nerves me to tell you this i go back to my duty with a stimulus and to my temptations with a safeguard i never knew before i never have been worthy your faintest thought much less your love mr ray dont say that i know well that no man who has been such a friend of mrs stannards such a friend to captain truscott and grace could be what you paint yourself oh dont think dont think for an instant i undervalue the gift you you shall not speak of yourself that way do you think any woman who deserves a thought could fail to glory in such a name as you have won oh mr ray mr ray i hardly realize that it is possible that you care for me you so brave and loyal and daring his eyes were blazing with a rapture he could not control it was so infinitely sweet to hear her praise you make me hope in spite of yourself marion he murmured with trembling eagerness oh think look way down into your heart and see if you cannot find one little germ of love for me one that i may teach to grow try my darling try ah heaven am i mad tonight and now her head was drooping again and her heart beating she felt that since it had come she could not bid him go comfortless only within the last day or two she whispered have i been thinking that that ive been wondering how i dared write to you as i did when you were in cheyenne wondering whether if dandy were not yours today i could find courage to say what i did to mr blake does that tell you anything mr ray marion marion oh my darling let me see your face she struggled one instant she even hid it upon his breast and the helmet cords made their mark upon her blushing forehead but quickly he took her face between his strong trembling hands gently but firmly raised it until his eyes could drink in every lovely feature though the fringed lids still hid from him the eyes he longed to see marion sweet one maidie with all my life and strength i love you have you not one little word for me what must i say she murmured at last still shrouding her eyes say will i think i love you just a little no answer only beating hearts only quickdrawn breath only the distant call of the sentry halfpast eleven oclock only the dying strains of the immortellen wafting out through the open casements try maidie he whispered eagerly try before the call comes back to the guardhouse try before the last notes of that sweet waltz die away for good and all try sweet love will i think i do a moments pause then then will i i know i do and the strong straining arms clasped about her under that blessed cavalry cape and the bonny face was hidden on his breast and rays trembling lips were raining passionate kisses on that softly rippling bang just as the last thrill of the immortellen dreamed away and the rich ringing soldierly voice of the sentry on number one echoed far out over the moonlit prairie the soldier watchcry alls well what a gem of a morning was the morrow when they rode away northward after the command had filed out of the garrison led by the band on their placid grays and the ladies all along the row had waved their goodbyes and kissed their dainty white hands and the children had hurrahed and shouted and rushed out among the horses hoofs in their eagerness to have one more farewell shake of the hand from some favorite officer or man and two or three dames and damsels had stolen away to the back rooms upstairs marion sanford stood with teardimmed eyes at the window gazing far out over the prairie at the long blue column disappearing in the dust over the divide by her side stood grace truscott twining her arms around that slender waist and clinging to her with a new and sweeter sympathy who who was the cynic that wrote that even as she stood at the altar plighting her troth to the husband she had chosen no woman yet forgave the man whom having rejected she knew to have consoled himself with another grace never for a moment admitted that ray had been her lover in arizona he had been devoted to her always for jacks sake but there were those who thought that only a little encouragement would have tumbled mr ray over head and heels in love with her in those queer old days but all that was past there was no doubt that mr ray was desperately deeply in love now and that two women in that garrison mrs stannard and mrs truscott knew it well and rejoiced that his love was requited but late as it was ray had had a very happy yet earnest talk with marion on their return from the hop he told her plainly that he had a term of probation to serve and that not until he had freed himself from his burden of debt and furnished his quarters so that he might not be utterly ashamed to welcome her to such a roof as even frontier cottages afforded he would not ask her to be his wife he would not ask her to consider herself even engaged to him he had no right he said to speak to her of his love much less to plead for hers but that was irresistible twas done long engagements are fearful strains and our social license of questionings renders them wellnigh intolerable to men and women who naturally shrink from speaking of matters which are to them so sacred ray declared that she should not be harassed by any such torturing talk and prying and questioning as that which has to be undergone by almost every girl whom civilized society fancies to be engaged she could never doubt him for an instant he felt assured and he well he couldnt begin to realize his blessed fortune at all so she must excuse his incredulity but he declared he would leave her utterly untrammelled there should not even be an understanding he would not ask her to accept his classring all he had to offer but write to her he would grace and mrs stannard should know if she saw fit and truscott but no one else at russell then if she came to her senses when she went back to new york and her friends the zabriskies in november and met some fellow worthy her acceptance why but here a little white hand was laid firmly upon his lips he said no more but compromised by kissing it rapturously but he and dandy too had come to say goodby before marching and dandys coat shone like silk and he arched his pretty neck and looked at her with his soft brown eyes as though he wanted to tell her he knew all about it as indeed he did had not ray gone into the stable early that morning while he was crunching his oats and whispered it all and ever so much more into that sensitive ear a famous confidant was dandy on the long march that followed for ray used to bend down on his neck and talk about her to him time and again to the wonderment of his sub ray breakfasted at mrs stannards the morning of the start and when he came away and it was time to mount he wore in the buttonhole of his scoutingshirt a single daisy marions own flower and a tiny speck of darkblue ribbon the yellow facings of the cavalry were linked with the sanford blue and wasnt blake in a gale that morning rattling with nonsense and misquotation and eagerness to be off he strode from gallery to gallery with his mexican spurs clattering at his heels he had bought in town a little china matchsafe which he gravely presented to mrs whaling as a slight addition to the collection of what she termed her brickabraw he implored mrs turner to sing to him just once for singing was a doubtful accomplishment of hers and she had already good reason to know that he had paraphrased one of her songs because of her defective enunciation into some day some day some day i shall meat chew and she never forgave ridicule he declared he meant to kiss mrs wilkins goodby and dared mrs stannard to come down and see him do it but when it was really time to ride to the head of his troop of recruits he bowed to miss sanford with a knowing look in his eye and bent low over her hand love sought is good but given unsought is better and yet fair lady you fail to see the overpowering advantages of accepting mine in the language of schillerschoppenhausen ich habe geliebt und gelebt which being interpreted means ive loved and got left fare ye well and away he rode bestriding his horse like a pair of bent dividers on a broad grin and ray though pale from recent illness and confinement and lack of the old open air life never had he looked so full of hope and buoyancy and life as after one thrilling little squeeze of her hand he swung into saddle doffed his broadbrimmed hat to all and went bounding away to take his place in front of the long mounted line that awaited his coming then his voice rang out clear and firm and true and with the daisy nestling in his breast he galloped to the head of column duty loyalty and hope were leading on before two long weeks of marching it took to carry them to the romantic valley in the black hills where the old th so eagerly awaited them and meantime letters were flying to and fro ray meant to bring his new riders and new horses in perfect trim to their regiments and so made short marches and constant inspection of his stock heavens what a gloom had settled over the regiment that miserable day when one of their number having ridden into deadwood came back with a several days old cheyenne paper giving the fearful details of gleasons death and rays probable guilt it was three days more before they met the mailstage fairly laden down with bags of letters for them stannard had been almost sick truscott sad silent but incredulous there had been a difference between him and billings for the latter was inclined to believe the story true and truscott said that he was prepared to hear this from other men in the regiment but not from him eager as lovers and husbands to get their mail every man had dropped the letter he happened to be reading when young hunter searching a later cheyenne paper set up a whoop that made the pinecrested heights echo again and again then waving his paper and dancing like a madman the youngster yelled at the top of his voice rays innocent rays acquitted twas a deserter wolf who did it hes confessed now crane by heaven swallow your words whooop officers and men the whole regiment sprang to their feet and came tearing to the spot and such a scene of handshaking and shouting and jubilee the black hills never knew before or since it was easy enough for the officers to hurry back to their letters from wives and children or sweethearts but for hours the men kept up their hurrah ray had been their hero for years and the affair of the july fight of waynes command had simply intensified the feeling naturally the letters bearing the postmarks of latest dates were those first opened fancy the faces of stannard and truscott as they read letter by letter backward through that summers record turner looked as sad and anxious as ever almost the first one he opened said if you have not already seen and read those that precede this please burn them without reading i was mistaken and turner well knew that when his wife got so far as to admit that she had been mistaken it meant that in some way she had been playing the mischief he never read therefore all her graphic details of rays mysterious flirtation with mrs truscott or of the thrilling evidence in mrs turners possession of his guilt a good fellow was turner a loyal soldier and husband who loved his pretty and capricious better half and deserved a still better one that night when the first keen frosts of october made the campfires doubly welcome old stannard and jack went off among the pines and built a little blaze all by themselves and there talked gravely over the strange events of the summer now so fully set before them in those volumes from russell all wolfs wild infatuation all gleasons cunning malice and ah de mortuis nil nisi bonum may god forgive him all rays loyal and devoted services and his cruel suffering and wrongs what wonder was it that for days the regiment could talk of nothing but ray what wonder that they could not fathom the secret of the tie that made stannard and truscott inseparable now what wonder that those two officers obtained permission to ride forward a days march and meet ray and his command and that when they came upon him cantering gayly up through buffalo gap he hardly knew them so gaunt worn and ragged were they they hardly knew him so radiant was the halo of hope and love around his once devilmaycare face so earnest so grave yet so joyous had become his once flippant reckless mien yet in their very greeting ray well knew that deep and faithful as had been the old trust there was new born from the harsh ordeal of this strange sad summer a friendship firmer deeper than ever earthly menace could shake a trust and loyalty that was registered in heaven not one word for hours was interchanged between jack and ray as to that scene in which he carried to grace the letter gleason had stolen or found together with blake occasionally injecting his rattling comments they talked over all the sea of troubles through which he had passed and together they would have mourned it all anew but for ray no major no jack i see well that it was all for the best god knows i have been ten times rewarded for anything i may have suffered then there was a lesson i had to learn and did learn that there are hundreds of people who think that when a man drinks at all there is no crime that may not properly be lodged at his door it has been a hard siege but every hour has been inestimable in result and in reward but before they rolled in their blankets that night truscott looked him in the eyes one moment then held out his hand is it necessary for me to say how i value what you did and bore for grace and me billy not a word jack then came the march to meet the regiment the royal ringing welcome a day devoted to lionizing ray greeting the new officers choosing horses assigning recruits to companies and then a dash down the cheyenne a weeks ride in the glad october sunshine and one brilliant evening as they returned heading in toward the agencies there met them the courier with despatches and letters and rays heart went bounding up into his throat as four dainty envelopes all addressed in the same hand were lifted up to him as he sat on dandy and then jack truscott came riding quickly to his side his eyes glowing though wet with emotion his lips compressed yet a world of joy and gratitude shining in his face ray looked up eagerly and their hands clasped i have a son billy and all is well thank god and then came the day when with the long skirmish lines deployed far as eye could see the th with the comrade battalions of the other regiments that had shared the rigors of the yellowstone campaign of came sweeping over the open prairies from the north and whirling in ahead of them the sullen scowling blanketed bands of old machpealota herding them up the valley of the white river towards the agency and penning them between the glistening crags of dancers butte and the barrier bluffs on the other side while mackenzies troopers trim and fresh in their natty garrison dress rounded them up from the south and west and by night the work of disarming and dismounting the silent indians was begun new forces were all there ready to take the field against the hordes of cheyennes still lurking in the mountains but for the th the campaign of the centennial year was virtually over a few days of rest and jubilee and greeting of old and new friends among the regiments there assembled and then they turned their horses heads southward gave one backward look at the valley where they turned the tables on the cheyennes where wayne had so nearly sacrificed his whole command where ray had run the gauntlet of death by torture to save them where truscotts night dash to the rescue had brought him charging just in time and over the rolling prairies they marched to seek far to the south their winter homes thither had ray and truscott already gone the summers work was done the campaign was ended and there came by telegraph from cheyenne a notification that lieutenant ray would be needed as a witness on the trial of the owners of that gamblingden in which the soldier wolf had been done to death the gray fox was sending in his ambulance and a staffofficer at that very moment he sent for ray to bid him goodby and offer him the welcome lift and just as truscott was writing some hurried lines to grace cheering her with the news that in two weeks he could reach her the colonel laid a quiet hand upon his shoulder an unusual demonstration and one that meant a good deal and said it has occurred to the general that you might like to go ahead with ray captain he appreciates the circumstances under which you hurried to join us and thinks that now mrs truscott is entitled to claim you so mr billings will send your orders after you by mail he did not say that he had himself gone to the general to ask this indulgence for truscott but so it happened that long before sundown the three old comrades truscott ray and mr bright of the staff were whirling ahead towards laramie and that the precious inmates of number eleven at russell were electrified by the news that jack and will jack and will would be there ten days ahead of the anticipated time a blessed ten days they were grace and baby truscott were in readiness to welcome paterfamilias long before mrs stannard like sister anne on the watchtower reported the cloud of dust that told of the coming of the laramie stage and when that grimy vehicle finally drew up at the gate and two eager warriors sprang out maybe there were not dozens of watching eyes along the row there was maid marion down the walk with a troop of the garrison children flocking about her and mrs stannard by special arrangement and request was awaiting them on the piazza and when jack after very brief and hearty greeting was passed on into the house and up the stairs and into the hands of that awesome potentate in petticoats before whom from the moment of their entry into this world of troubles all men must bow in helpless submission the monthly nurse and the bronzed and bearded and somewhat haggard soldier meekly surrendered himself into her custody and was ushered by her into a little room where he was bidden to make himself as civilized as possible in appearance lest his warworn guise should shock mamma and frighten baby into convulsions he obeyed in silence nay even with propitiatory smiles and gestures ay lay down your arms and bend the suppliant knee sheathe your useless sword and hush to soothing whisper the voice that thundered in command a week agone hide away with noiseless hand the heavy boot and clinking spur off with belt and buckle and scratching shoulderstrap and don your softest dressinggown and creakless slipper submit to search for pins and needles you never carried promise you will only talk just so much and stay only just so long and will sit only just in such a place and wont attempt to agitate her for we must still be very very careful and at last you are admitted and you kneel by the white bed and hear the rapturous ecstasy of welcome in her faint voice and read of her sacred martyrdom in the white cheek and fragile hand and glory in the pride and joy of that wondering wonderful motherlook in the great deep lustrous eyes and kiss again the warm sweet lips that are heavens nectar to the thirst of yours and then and then there is revealed to you that little wrinkled ruddy head all folds and puckers and creases all the redder and uglier for contrast with the snowy bosom in which it twists and burrows and those expressionless saucerblue liquid blinking little eyes and tiny upturned nose and puckering gurgling querulous mouth all that is visible from the folds of the white blanket worn as only indian and baby can wear one and you are bidden to declare that he is the very very image of you bless his honeyed lips and then you must take him one minute nurse must let her see jack with his baby boy in his arms and though fearful you assent and with reverent prayerful gratitude you receive your firstborn to your heart and thank god for the infinite mercy that has brought her the sweet young wife and mother through her deadly peril and then you would kiss the helpless staring blinking little blanketframed face but at first touch of those bristling moustaches a powerful spasm has convulsed the tiny features and a vehement plaintive wailing protest bursts from the contorted lips and then your son and heir is snatched away and you stand like convicted felon while nursey dandles and tosses and condoles and condones and cuddles well well well did it nearly fighten its pessus pessus life out with its horrid awful uggy beard well it never never sall aden never no nursey wouldnt let it thats it jack sit down and make the best of it your reign as lord and master is over and done with lo baby is king and mrs muggins is his prime minister but down in the pretty parlor the returning soldier is still master of the situation thank heaven for the beneficence which surrounds the birth of love with the supervisory ministration of no meddling old woman were it otherwise the ancient and honorable profession of which mrs sairy gamp is the faithful exponent would never have been called into being ray and mrs stannard were exchanging rapturous so glad to see yous and shaking hands and giving and receiving news about all manner of people while marion sanford was still some distance down the row with the romping group of youngsters and chatting briskly with mrs wilkins and some of the infantry ladies for all the world as though ray were nowhere within a thousand miles she wanted to keep faith with the children she said and they made too much noise for babys slumbers when playing about the house of course she looked as did the other ladies all eagerness to see the returning officers and was quite prepared to parry all thrusts which were certain to come all the deft insinuations which people are so practised in giving under certain suspected circumstances of course that moonlit interview the night of the hop had been seen by more than one and told to more than a dozen though ray had kept between her and the couples that happened to be on the gallery and so concealed the sweet dйnouement and his subsequent devotions that night to mrs turner and to miss whaling had completely bewildered them for her sake he had written the matter should be so managed as to subject her to as little questioning as possible it was already arranged that she would be returning eastward about the time the regiment got fairly settled in winter quarters already the infantry were packing up and shipping their goods and chattels to their new posts and it was just barely possible that with a little dissembling and apparent indifference the train of talk might be thrown from the track mrs stannards blue eyes danced merrily as she welcomed ray and they gave one quick glance towards her that he might know where she was and it was then arranged that he was to return to the house with certain letters as soon as he could unpack his valise and change his dress by that time too miss sanford was recalled by a message from grace and so when ray reappeared and the servant ushered him into the cool darkened little parlor and scurried away to the kitchen to exchange confidences with cook he had seen and spoken to all the ladies of the regiment and given them news of their lords and had not yet exchanged one word with the lady of his love for a moment he stood there looking around at the familiar and dainty objects in the room which he had pictured in his minds eye a million times in that brief month at the piano closed and unused of late at the pictures and statuettes and the quaint little odds and ends in the way of whatnots bookstands tables and chairs at the broad and inviting lounge with its beautiful covering and soft pillows and the bearskin rugs at the foot at the rich silk and bamboo screen of japanese handiwork that kept the chilling draught from the piano or worktable when the ladies were there and was big enough to form a complete enclosure about them their corral he had termed it and was that her footstep on the floor above no too heavy and slow the maid had just gone up with the mail besides her room her room was now on the groundfloor off the diningroom why didnt she come she must know how hard all this assumed indifference was to bear she must know how eager he was to look once more into her sweet blue eyes and read their shy welcome she must know how his arms longed to enfold her his eyes were growing more accustomed to the curtained light and he could see his own reflection in the mirror between the windows and noted with natural satisfaction how bronzed and serviceable he was looking again and then he thought it would be a good plan to draw that screen across the end of the piano and hide behind it and watch her as she came in before rushing forth to well wait a moment would she be quite prepared for so rapturous a greeting as he longed to give her eyes and lips and arms and breast were yearning for her but would she not be abashed at such a demonstration it would serve her right for keeping him waiting and he took hold of the screen to draw it towards him and the screen unaccountably resisted he dropped on his knee to loosen the foot from a supposed catch in the heavy rug and gave a stronger pull and away it came and there like lady teazle only all sweet smiles and welcome and blushes and shy delight a lovely winsome picture of loving womanhood crouched bonny maid marion maidie oh you darling you delight and his arms were about her in an instant he sprang to his feet and despite attempted resistance and retreat she was clasped to his heart and held there held there close and strong held there so firmly that she could not get away and so in default of other hidingplace her face was buried on his breast and well she had to put her arms somewhere when does a woman look so like a stick as when her own arms hang straight down by her side while a lovers are twining about her if you need confirmation of this startling theory mademoiselle simply take one look at that otherwise delightful picture at last alone observe the ardor of the loverhusband note the unresponsive droopiness of the charmingly attired bride and defend the straightupanddown hang of that useless arm if you can she might at least take the stiffness or limpness out of it by simply placing the little hand on his shoulder and that is just what marion did until until he himself seized and drew it around his neck the question as to how he should greet her had somehow solved itself at last he raised her head she was indistinctly murmuring something pardon me miss blueeyes but to whom did you speak to you i said that if all the same to you i would like to look at you and what did i hear you call me i said mr ray mr ray are you aware of the fact that mr ray is quite a thing of the past very very far in the past he added with deep and earnest feeling in place of the playful tone of the previous words i have been ray or mr ray or billy ray and that scamp ray many a long year only one woman on earth called me always by the one name i strove to teach you maidie and that was mother am i not yet will to you a moments silence a moments hesitation and then with blushing cheeks and beaming eyes bravely loyally comes the answer yes in every thought in every moment only it was not quite so easy to say and now if i forgive you will you tell me since you have had the look you demanded just what it was you wanted to see in such a suntanned specimen what is there to warrant such flattering notice maidie mine she was looking up at him with such a halo of hope and love and pride and trust shining about her exquisite face she stood there with one soft little hand resting on his shoulder while the other shyly plucked at the tiny knot of darkblue ribbon on his breast the ribbon that had fastened her daisy to his scoutingshirt he had relaxed the pressure of his arms but they still enfolded her and he looked the picture of brave young manhood blessed with the sweetest knowledge earth can give two big tears seemed starting from the blue depths of those shining eyes he bent fondly towards her what is it sweet one tell me i had been thinking of all you had written me of your past and of all your troubles and wrongs this summer and wondering wondering how any one could think of the loyalty you had always shown to those you loved how any one could look into your eyes and say you would ever disappoint my faith chapter xxix a cavalry wedding and now the th were all in from the field and the wives and families of those officers who were there to be stationed were arriving by every train and the post was all bustle and confusion and rejoicing some changes had occurred as had been predicted by the colonel but many of our old friends and several of later date were ensconced within the homely walls and preparing for the combined rigors and comforts of a wyoming winter in garrison here again were old stannard and his loyal radiant wife here were the turners and raymonds and webbs and waynes and truscotts and heaths and freemans and others of whom we have not heard and stanch old bucketts the sorely badgered but imperturbable quartermaster and billings the peppery adjutant and mrs billings whom their nextdoor neighbor mr blake epitomized forthwith to the ladys vehement indignation as billings and cooings and mr and mrs wilkins and the little wilkinses and a raft of youngsters as the junior bachelor officers were termed and with blake was his sworn friend and ally billy ray now the senior lieutenant of the regiment life was gayety to all but him for marion the light of his very existence had returned to the east for ten days before the arrival of the regiment russell was paradise there were long joyous exquisite interviews in the dear little parlor at the truscotts there were rides and drives over the boundless prairie there were plannings and promises and i fear for once in his life ray felt no great joy in the arrival of the old regiment for on that day major taylors family went east for the winter and under their escort miss sanford departed bright and gay as was the winter that followed to all the ladies and most of the officers there was one fellow at least to whom hops and dinners and germans had faint attraction routine duty at a cavalry post soon palls on the most enthusiastic the endless round of rollcalls stables both morning and evening of drills and guardmount boards of survey and garrison courts recitations and riflepractice all serve to keep up constant demands on time and attention there is just one thing that will throw about them all a halo of romance and interest the presence at the garrison of the girl you love and when such a blessing has once been enjoyed and then is suddenly taken away the utter blank is beyond description only to a few has it happened that the love of their lives has been found in garrison and only they will quite realize what life at russell became to ray after marion sanford went east he had greatly changed as every one saw not that he was less buoyant and brave but that he was far more thoughtful grave and earnest he was exact and punctilious in the performance of every military duty was always ready to bear a hand at the entertainments and parties but the haunts where he had once reigned supreme knew him no more the post trader was heard regretfully to remark that ray wasnt half the man he expected to find him and there were rattlepates among the youngsters in the regiment to whom rays reformation was a source of outspoken regret if thats the effect of getting all over in love said mr hunter i dont want any of it in mine poker too languished as a popular pastime the demand for morning cocktails had unaccountably fallen off the barkeeper would fall asleep at the clubroom from sheer lack of employment during the afternoons and early evenings for many of the married ladies had brought maiden relatives as friends to spend the winter with them and half a dozen new romances were starting and the colonel had his eye on some of the old habituйs of the store and wilkins and crane and one or two other formerly reliable patrons were kept too busy to spend time or money at that once seductive retreat and with the injustice of embittered human nature it was their wont to ascribe it all to rays backsliding a matter of which that young gentleman was for some time in ignorance he spent his offduty hours in writing or reading or long chats with truscott and romps with baby jack he always dined with them on sunday and was in and out between their house the stannards and saints rest as blake had named the bachelor ranch which he and ray occupied in partnership at all hours of the day or evening he was properly attentive at the colonels and called frequently upon the young ladies visiting the waynes and heaths and billings mrs turner never would have young ladies with her they were too distracting and of course he was subjected to incessant queries about miss sanford it was too absurd to deny the engagement said the garrison for everybody knew he wrote regularly and she answered nevertheless ray truscott stannard and of course mrs truscott and mrs stannard denied that any engagement existed ray and marion had quietly decided as has been indicated that there should be none until until he could offer her a little army home but denials only stimulated the womenfolk into hazarding ingenious questions and suggestions and the men to various conjectures more or less woodenheaded at first it was theorized that he had proposed and been rejected that was disposed of by her frequent letters then that she had him on probation and would marry him if he could keep clear of the old temptations a year two years or so unless some fellow came along meantime and swept her off bets were hazarded on the different events and there was no end of talk about it and ray was the object of much sentimental interest among the ladies one thing however was clearly observable they the ladies with the confiding caressing insinuating and delicious impertinence of the sex could and would hazard their suggestions to him in person and were laughingly parried but if any one among the men were ass enough to suppose that all the old ray had vanished he had only just to attempt to be jocularly familiar or inquisitive with him on that or a kindred subject and get a kentucky kick as blake called rays snubs that would make him red in the face for a week poor crane was the victim of the final experiment and it was his last attempt to be facetious for many a weary month it was a snapping december morning one of the advent sundays truscott was officer of the day and ray had escorted mrs truscott to church in town and it so happened that a number of officers were in the clubroom for the colonel and billings had gone away to north platte on a courtmartial and the major did not care to haul in on the reins while the chief was absent and looking out on the wintry prairie as they came driving into the garrison there was some little sly comment thoroughly goodnatured over the metamorphosis which a year had made in ray when suddenly the door opened and he bounded in give me a flask of good brandy muldoon our driver is almost frozen of course there was a ripple of laughing chaff over the unchristian spirit which prompted people to search the scriptures in such weather and freeze the helpless victims of their piety the drivers all this ray parried in his old jaunty way his white teeth gleaming and his eyes twinkling with merriment over some unusually good hit but as ill luck would have it mr crane had been up too late or too early or both and had managed to drink more than was prudent he had always smarted under the scoring ray had given him in arizona and he saw or murkily thought he saw a chance to say a stinging thing the barkeeper had just wrapped the flask in paper and was handing it to ray when crane thickly began makes a heap of difference in a man this gettin spooney dont it year ago ray would have sneered at fellows going to church an now hes doin it self next thing by george hell be havin ligious scruples bout goin indianfighting there were sharp sudden growls of shut up you idiot choke him off somebody but all too late ray heard every word of it and his eyes blazed in an instant every man saw the coming storm and there was an awkward rising from chairs and gathering about crane as though to hustle him out of the room for a moment ray stood there quivering with wrath seemingly making strong effort at selfcontrol then with the old ring and snap to every word he first sent the barkeeper out of the room telling him to take the flask at once to his quarters then turned quickly on crane who was stupidly shuffling at a pack of cards this is the third time mr crane that you have made it necessary for me to bring you up with a round turn you intimate that a year ago i would have sneered at a mans going to church never sir in my whole life has man or woman boy or girl heard from my lips one word of ridicule or disrespect for religious faith or religious observances you are in no condition today to appreciate what i say perhaps so you may have until tomorrow for complete apology and retraction but this much you can understand sir if you fancy for one instant that religions scruples or any other kind will interfere with my fighting now or at any time you are most damnably mistaken sir as you will find as soon as you are sober enough to receive a message and with that he turned and left the room the next morning blake was out with a note as everybody knew would be the result and poor crane tied a wet towel around his head and sent for wilkins and heath and others and they all told him the same thing he had made an outrageous ass of himself and had best write a full apology and he did it was the church militant said blake that billy joined and it was evident enough that the chip was still there on rays shoulder even marion sanfords sunny head had not displaced it and then came a time in the spring when rays letters began to be very frequent and rallstons big fist sprawled in on all manner of envelopes from all manner of iowa and nebraska hotels he was doing a lively business in the horse and cattle trade again had quit gambling said rumor and mrs rallston was with him now on all his journeyings and looking marvellously well and happy and along in april blake and ray were doing all they knew how with mrs stannards assistance to make their quarters habitable for ladys use and rallston and nell came and paid them a visit of an entire week and went away enraptured with the regiment rallston was ill at ease at first but his wifes grace and beauty the fact that she was rays sister and that mrs stannard and mrs truscott became devoted to her from the start and that old stannard and truscott took rallston under their protecting wings and showed him around as though there had never been a flaw in his record all these things and his natural good nature combined to make him popular among the officers and the night before they left he had the whole crowd in at a stag party in town whereat there was much conviviality and good feeling and the next thing whispered about the garrison was that ray had an interest in the business for when billings wanted a new horse and could find none just to suit him in the stables he sought rays advice as he always did in such matters the cloud between them had long since drifted away but not until billings had made a clean breast of it and ray told him to wait a few days and the horse to suit him would be there and he could take his own time in paying for him too he did by the way and when may came and with it orders for a summer camp rays old troop took the field without him another vacancy had occurred and rallston sent three baskets of champagne from omaha that all might drink the health of the new captain whose troop was down the road at sidney verily fortune was smiling on the gallant fellow on whom she had seemed to frown even the course of true love was defying all previous record and had run with exceptional smoothness barring the one fearful task of having to write to her father his courtship had been sweet and unimpeded as all its first surroundings had been bitter and now free hopeful redeemed what was there to wait for why not claim his bride and a long leave of absence and take her with him to see the dear old mother in kentucky the engagement is at last announced wrote grace to truscott who was scouting over the big horn and the wedding will be some time this summer was it not odd that you and he should each have received promotion just before marrying little did dear maidie and i ever dream in the old days at madame reichards that we were to marry captains of cavalry in the same regiment oh jack why didnt i have a military wedding marion says that the entire community is so shocked at the idea of her accepting an unknown army officer that she has determined to have a brilliant affair of it and mr sanford says that she shall have everything she wants that money can buy and they say he is rolling in wealth now his wife has been behaving like an angel ever since marions return and much to the zabriskies disappointment the reception will be at the sanfords and she will be married from there and the whole clan will be gathered to see it and there will be eight bridesmaids three of whom were our classmates at school and of course the wedding itself will be in the old cathedral church and all the officers there in full dress and the band from governors island oh jack cant we go back and do it all over again marion says there is only one thing to mar her happiness she cannot have cavalry officers for groomsmen because almost all mr captain rays there i go making the same blunder that used to exasperate me so in mrs turner last year she would speak of you as mister long after you were captain only i knew she did it on purpose captain rays friends are in the field and cannot be spared but mr blake is to be best man and there will be plenty of other officers marion says that at first her father looked very very solemn at the idea of her falling in love with a cavalry officer and could not be reconciled to it but one evening he came home late from new york he had been at a dinner at the union club and there was introduced to general s who sat next him and in some way he asked about mr ray and the general said there wasnt a braver man or finer officer in the cavalry and spoke of him in such a glowing way that mr sanford came home radiant well excepting my jack the general was right and jacks answer was that he thought it would be an excellent plan for mrs grace to take baby jack and a two months leave and go east and exhibit her glory and delight to grandpapa and grandmamma and see marion married mrs stannard was to start by june why not go with her the california mining venture his old arizona investment would fully warrant the extravagance many a woman will refrain from attending the gayest of balls because her strephon cannot be there but where is the woman who can resist a wedding grace went as a matter of course what pen can describe the sensation that had shaken society to its foundation when it began to leak out that the lovely miss sanford eldest daughter of the honorable blank sanford plutocrat was going to marry an army officer this then was the reason why swains from philadelphia and new york had sighed in vain all that winter ever since november she had been the acknowledged belle frank joyous radiant gracious winning a woman all men worshipped and all women envied i wish i could find something in her to criticise was the despairing summary of a wouldbe rival she is so courteous so considerate so generous so hopelessly regardful of everybody elses rights and feelings i dont think shes a radiant beauty you cannot but see defects in her features but who ever saw a more winning face i dont wonder everybody old and young is simply fascinated by her i watched her there all last evening when they had that little party she was surrounded every moment she was having the best kind of time but her eyes were everywhere watching to see that everybody was entertained and no sooner was a woman left alone for an instant than she was by her side with a gracious word or a man it is so everywhere she goes now who on earth can this officer be whats an officer like anyhow it was no isolated opinion marion sanford was a marked woman in general society a woman who reigned queenlike over every heart but among the circle of her relatives the uncles and aunts and cousins who lived within the sphere of her attractions she was held to be little less than the angels it made it all the harder for ray since everybody was eager to see what manner of man it was that had won so peerless a pearl from their midst it was loyalty to him pride in him love for him more than anything else that made her choose a military wedding that all at home might see something of the brighter side of army life and the social attractions of the men who were his chosen comrades and at last it comes a day of cloudless sunshine of soft and balmy air heralding a moonlit evening that could have served for the midsummer nights dream and inspired the melodies of mendelssohn and the massive walls of a great cathedral church are silvered by the rays without and pierced by the brilliant flood of colored light shining from within carriage after carriage rolls up through the dense throng of curious but silent spectators and discharges its load of richlydressed occupants through the carpeted canvasroofed lane of belted police through the massive portals of the church past the welcoming masters of ceremonies two society swells who know everybody and where everybody is to be seated and by them are presented to one of half a dozen stalwart young officers in all the glitter of shoulderknots helmetcords aiguillettes sabres and belts and these martial ushers receive the wondering ladies on their arms and escort them with much ceremony to the designated pews wherein they are deposited with the precision of military bows and the escort returns forthwith clanking down the aisle followed by curious eyes carriage after carriage arrives party after party is ushered in with the same unerring ease just as the staffofficers conduct detachments to their assigned positions no break no confusion and the good people of the peaceloving metropolis to whom army matters have long been a dark and uninviting mystery begin to admit that there are some points worth noting in a military wedding and then society begins to recognize each other with nods and smiles and fluttering fans and to look about and take mental inventory of the marvellous changes in the vast interior verily marion sanfords circle of friends and relatives has effected transformation here back of the congregation the organloft is concealed from view by ornamental screenwork and an arborlike arrangement of vines and leaves from which the gilded pipes and gothic spires shoot up into the vaulted ceiling but no one knows who or what may be there concealed towards the altar the church is a bower of beauty immediately in front of the chancel rail and facing inward towards the centre aisle are the elevated seats of the choristers with the pulpit and lectern on opposite sides and at the outer edge of the choirstalls the pulpit and lectern themselves are a creamy mass of daisies marions own flower while between them stretches a light trelliswork half concealing half disclosing the choirstalls beyond twined with smilax and thickly studded with white roses and carnations over the centre aisle this trellis takes the form of an exquisite floral arch spanning the steps to the choirlevel and the broad aisle beyond all the pillars are twined with smilax all the chancel rail is similarly decked while roses carnations and snowballs are everywhere each side of the altar is ornamented by tall pyramidal groups of palms and tropical plants while the upper portion of the church is filled here and there and everywhere with foliage and blossoms a great marriagebell of carnations hangs over the altar steps the altar itself is one mass of daisies the air is heavy with perfume and now as eight oclock approaches rich with soft exquisite melody that comes floating from an unseen orchestra in the loft every now and then there is unusual flutter and curiosity as the ushers stride up the aisle with comrades in full uniform who with their wives are army guests and they are escorted to the seats just back of the choristers among the relatives and nearest friends where they are placed half facing the crowded assemblage and are at once the object of hundreds of curious eyes there are the bald head and red face of old colonel pelham and the majestic proportions of his muchbetterhalf who as scion of all the de ruyters is quite at home confronting the social battery and mrs stannard with her happy blue eyes and noble bearing and mrs truscott exquisitely dressed and an object of no little admiration among observers of both sexes old stannard fidgets at the unaccustomed harness of full uniform and kicks impatiently at his sabre wishing himself out on the arizona deserts again but defiantly determined to hold his own and glare the people down men of the artillery and engineers too are ushered into their seats and then everybody seems to be settled it lacks but two minutes of eight by the watch and a military wedding must be of all things on time suppressed excitement can be heard without the doors leading into the vestibule are closed everybody is staring back at the church entrance and still the sacristy door remains firmly shut surely tis time for the groom and his best man to appear there one minute of eight and no sign who in all that crowd could dream that ray and blake have vainly stormed the vestry door and found it locked by some unaccountable error the sexton has barred their entrance as well as that of the intrusive uninvited whom he meant to exclude what on earth shall we do billy quoth blake i can heave a brick through the window and crawl in after it it will ruin our uniforms but well get there on time back to the front says ray pardonably white and tremulous we can scurry up the sideaisle its our only chance now so back they go and the next instant the vestibule door opens just a few inches the congregation rises to a woman and two slimbuilt fellows in full cavalry uniform the long yellow plumes of their carried helmets floating behind them and their sabres clattering hasten up to the head of the church just as the tower clock booms the first stroke of eight organ orchestra and ringing voices burst into triumphant melody the vestibule doors fly open and headed by the crucifer and his sacred emblem the white surpliced choristers come thronging up the centre aisle while the whole congregation turns and faces them as wedding congregations will and the lofty rafters ring with the exultant strains hark hark my soul angelic songs are swelling slowly reverently they move up through the broad lane flanked by eager faces the choristers are followed by the brilliant party of ushers soldier and civilian the grayhaired father and his handsome wife then come the fair bridesmaids two and two all in fleecy silk and bearing dainty bouquets of daisies tied with the cavalry colors while between the last two sister and cousin and as though led by them veiled and with downcast eyes a matchless picture of sweet womanly grace and beauty is marion the choristers file to their places the father with the lady of his name halts at the archway stepping to one side that the ushers and bridesmaids may move on to the altar which they encircle right and left ray pale and white but with eager light in his handsome dark eyes steps quickly down with blake close at his heels and bowing low meets his fair bride at the arch then turns and faces the two whiterobed clergymen who come forward from the chancel leaving the venerable bishop at the holy altar the swelling hymn has ceased and in its place low sweet witching strains of music float through the vaulted sanctuary a hush as of intense expectation falls upon the listening throng and the deep voice of the rector is heard in the solemn opening exhortation reverently discreetly advisedly soberly and in the fear of god is it fancy or as that neveranswered challenge comes if any man can show just cause why they may not lawfully be joined together does ray throw back his head with something of that same old semidefiant gesture that as much as pays it wouldnt be a safe thing for any man to try and then another voice is heard feeble tremulous with years ay with deep emotion it is that of the revered old soldier of the cross whose lips long years before propounded the same solemn query to her sainted mother who under that same roof received this child a smiling babygirl into the congregation of christs flock and signed her with the sign of the cross who led her a sweet maiden to the altar there beyond to renew the solemn promise and vow that was there made in her name from whose hands she had on bended knee so often received the consecrated elements whose aging accents had trembled in grief and sympathy even as they uttered the words of solace blessed are the dead who die in the lord and whose consolation was sweetest to her in the bitter days when that blessed mother died no wonder ray can feel that she is trembling from head to foot and that his i will is firm and strong as he looks squarely into the eyes of the venerable priest and honors him for the gathering tears he sees there no wonder his own turn proudly fondly down on her as her soft hand is placed in his nervous palm and blake sets his teeth to repel the gasp of delight with which he hears the clearcut enunciation of every word of his solemn troth for the life of him he cannot help thinking how many a time he has heard that voice in the wild days on the frontier in indian battle or in garrison debate and marked the same ring of determination when he was deeply moved by gad but he means it i never knew him when he didnt mean every word he said he gasps to himself and then tis her turn and clear belllike yet silvery soft her sweet voice repeats the trembling words of her old pastor and all over the great church men and women hold their breath and listen with eager ear and eyes grow moist and throats grow lumpy and some who love her dearly can hardly restrain a flood of tears for never for an instant from the first word to the last do her eyes glorious in their trust and faith exquisite in hope and love and tenderness falter from their fond loyal gaze up into his there is uncontrollable recourse to handkerchiefs a rustle and sensation throughout the crowded ranks of society as the last solemn word of her troth is spoken and blake thanks heaven that the organ tones grow perceptibly louder and more triumphant and so does ray who would gladly balk that awful hurdle on which so many a poor fellow has floundered with all my worldly goods i thee endow but he holds gallantly to the ring he hardly knows that they are following the whiterobed clergy forward to the altar now and that there it is the bishops voice that greets them but despite the helmet and sabre that hang twixt him and her he is close by her side and ere he knows it is kneeling there at the chancel rail and listening to the grandest sweetest benediction in all the eloquent ritual of the church and then and then he has risen and is gazing into the humid eyes of his wife oh with what triumph and joy the mingled tones of organ and orchestra burst into the exultant music of the wedding march how the lights dance and whirl how overpowering is the perfume of rose hyacinth and carnation he has blindly shaken hands with some one but marion takes his arm and together they meet the thronging sea of faces and step blithely down the surpliced lane of choristers down the archway stairs down the broad and carpeted aisle between the batteries of smiles and tears and after them comes blake towering beside the first bridesmaid come all the other damsels on the arms of their attendant cavaliers and carriage doors are banging and there is a merry chime resounding through the moonlit street and away they drive to the handsome old home with all its windows ablaze with light and grounds with colored lanterns and there in the great baywindow they take their stand with the circling ranks of lovely bridesmaids and gallant groomsmen about them and have time to note the lavish and beautiful decorations for here as at church flowers are everywhere and banks of daisies with the r s monogram in carnations the crossed sabres of the th cavalry guidons and the stars and stripes all tell of the work of loving hands and hearts and such a picture as she makes as she stands there by his side when when was marion half so lovely her rippling hair her lustrous eyes her pure complexion her beaming blissful smile her winsome charm of manner that none could ever quite describe none could ever imitate her dress must i tell of that true madam i bow in all meekness no wedding description could be even tolerable as you say that ignored the bridal toilet why therein too marion shone forth in one of her quaintest most original guises such a struggle as she had had with madam finnegan that autocrat of metropolitan modistes i will be no conventional bride she declared orange flowers she would not wear but her veil was fastened by her own flower exquisite daisies in silver and gold filigree work and the dress madam vowed it would ruin her prestige that it was unheard of impossible that no bridal dress could be made lownecked and sleeveless but marion well knew the beauty of her neck and arms and ray had begged it should be so madam protested but in vain the lowcut sleeveless corsage fitted closely to the lines of the lovely figure and gleamed with pearl embroidered lace while the front of the skirt was trimmed en tablier with the same and a profusion of rich pointlace fell on either side from the waist to the bottom of the skirt soft rich creamy satin was the material falling in long straight ample folds from the waist to the end of the train neither pearls nor diamonds would she wear not a gem is in her ears her one decoration is an exquisite daisychain or necklace a dainty and delicate piece of handiwork in gold and silver and this is rays present to his bride of the hundreds invited to the church only relatives closest friends and the army people are bidden to the reception at the sanfords the army represent rays kindred for the loving old mother had been growing too feeble of late to venture on the journey and she had decided to await their coming to her at lexington and nellie rallston who longed to be present gave it up when her husband decided that his business would not permit him to be so far away at such a time but as compensation he told her to compute every dollar she thought the journey with all incidentals would have cost them and to double it and send to chicago for the loveliest present the money would buy as her own gift to billys wife as for himself he had already chosen his present the prettiest kentucky saddlehorse that ever woman rode it was his way of expressing his appreciation of what she had done for dandy and so it happened that in the big room upstairs where the presents are shown to the limited few who are bidden to the reception nells beautiful bracelets are flanked by two photographs counterfeit presentments of a most shapely and knowinglooking little steed yet unnamed with mr rallstons congratulations and best wishes there is no describing the many costly and beautiful gifts from the great circle of friends relatives and schoolmates papas too is of eminent solidity though flimsy paper is the medium but there are some that cannot be passed over without remark there is significance in them one is a worn iron horseshoe framed and set in gold backed with velvet and surrounding an oval miniature of a horse and rider the horse is the lithelimbed sorrel dandy the rider in the broadbrimmed hat the blue scoutingshirt and indian leggings is ray touch a spring at the base of the frame and the front flies open and reveals that this is but the enclosure for within nestles an exquisite little swiss watch and chain of daintiest workmanship with the monogram m s in diamonds the horseshoe bears this inscription from the officers and men of waynes squadron th u s cavalry in grateful remembrance of a deed of heroism which renders sacred to them the name of ray and there is a letter from wayne which says the shoe is one of the four your gallant husband stripped from dandys feet the night he braved death to bring us rescue the other three are not to be had for love or money my wife and children have one of them the two companies that composed the command have each another framed and inscribed over the first sergeants door marion had no present she was so eager every one should see as this then there is a wonderful clock of curious workmanship with a musical chime of bells that is going to prove something of a white elephant in moving from one post to another out on the frontier but marion vows it shall never be left behind it comes from the men of the captains own troop many of whom served under him in arizona and theres a letter signed by the whole company from the first sergeant down to private zwinge in which they send their loyalty and duty to the bride of the bravest officer and kindest friend soldier ever had and marion shows this to grace with blithe happy laughter now talk to me about your jack she says ah well smiles and tears are intermingled as they must be even in the marriage feast there are so many there to whom the bride recalls the gentle winsome mother only never was seen on that young mothers face even in her maiden days such peace and joy as is in the brides tonight there is no long lingering over the reception society will be invited to some formal affairs of that kind when the happy couple return from their brief weddingtour and only a few magnates from abroad have to be shaken hands with the immediate weddingparty are soon seated twenty of them at the great table in the diningroom while all the guests are scattered about at little quartette affairs around the broad halls and conservatory and the orchestra plays sweet strains from their perch on the enclosed piazza and busy waiters fly to and fro and soon the champagnecorks are popping and the rooms are ringing with mirth and merriment and ray and marion seated side by side at the head of the broad table are bombarded with toasts and congratulations and the laughter and applause grow incessant as the bridesmaids and groomsmen exchange the poetic mottos in the favors they find at their places and no bridesmaid seems quite able to properly affix the little gold sabre that is nestling in the folds of her napkin it takes a soldiers practised hand to fasten them in those dainty india silks and every groomsman swears that no one but a woman can ever properly adjust the daisy which as a scarfpin is his reward for the evenings services and some inspired fellowcitizen gracefully proposes the health of the hostess and an eminent statesman present ponderously does likewise for the bride although it was the fixed determination that there should be no formal speechmaking but mr sanford happily comes to the rescue in a few remarks of unaccustomed humor in which he sets the room in a roar by expressing his satisfaction at having married off one encumbrance his modified rapture in the reflection that there were still two or three in the way of daughters and nieces whom he felt bound to similarly dispose of his comfort in the sight of half a dozen such likely young officers as those present and his hope that they wouldnt fool away their time this dispels anything like formality and the next thing there is a health to the army and shouts for blake he finds his long legs slowly and comes to the scratch infinitely puzzled as to how he is to worry through but all is merriment by this time and fun and laughter reward his feeblest shots he is understood to begin somewhat as follows you ought not to expect me to respond for the army i cant speak for the ladies thereof because they never gave me a chance to practise oh slander and i cant drink for the men because they insist on doing it for themselves another libel in fact after being here five days as the guest of our hospitable friends at the club im wondering how any one ever could see anything to drink to in the army life there is a fearful grind in the lofty and inspired language of canon kingsley if not cannon he was at least a big gun in ecclesiastical circles oh it is a life in which men must shirk and women must sweep loud protestations indeed if it were not for the ladies god bless them we would have nothing but fighting in the field and stagnation at home but whenever they get to running things their way it it is just the reverse shame no wretch he vainly strives to rally under the fire of imprecation but it is too late the groomsmen are denouncing him as he deserves to be as a slanderer and recreant mr ferris and mr waring spring to their feet to implore the assembly to reject any and all such statements as the emanations of an embittered oftrejected and subtle perjured false disloyal man and poor blake who really wanted to wind up with an apostrophe to the crowning excellences of the bride is driven to cover a victim of his vicious propensity for burlesque he has created illimitable merriment however and is to be infinitely congratulated on getting off so easily and then the bridecake is cut and eager is the excitement over the search for the prophetic ring and the blushing bridesmaid who gets it has plainly made a deep impression on the young artilleryman who is seated next her and is accused of already wearing his colors in her cheeks and then comes the dance and the crashcovered floors are speedily alive with twinkling feet and the brides own set in the lanciers is surrounded by a throng of eager lookerson and rays color has come back to his bronzed cheeks and he has looked so well so infinitely happy so proud and radiant all the evening and yet so grave withal so quiet and selfrestrained all men speak of the earnest feeling that is evident in his acceptance of the showered congratulations and the army comrades who have been long separated from him wonder at the change that has come over the fellow they once called rattling ray and marion heavens blessings never lighted a more exquisite face than is hers tonight she is simply radiant simply irresistible for the girls hang about her to repeat their congratulations again and again to win another kiss to hear the winning gracious accents of the voice that has so long charmed and enthralled them old and young rich and poor big and little those kinsfolk schoolmates and neighbors especially the little ones who were her scholars in the sundayschool flock about her watch her with fascinated eyes and for every one she has sweet and gracious words and beaming smiles she holds them to the last the children troop about her as she is led away to change her bridaldress for the journey tis approaching midnight and the owl train leaves within the hour and they hang about the stairways waiting for her reappearance and hover in mysterious fascination about captain ray as he comes in his travelling suit of mufti and wonder why he should discard his uniform and sword and the carriage is now at the door and great store of rice and old slippers are got in readiness and presently down the broad stairway she comes metamorphosed as to raiment but radiant winsome as ever and they seize upon her and bear her off bodily into the great parlor and throng about her and pull her this way that way every way and kiss and maul and squeeze and rumple and never seem to exhaust her infinite patience or their own extravagant capacity but at last they begin to surge towards the doorway and the bridesmaids hover in circle for the closing ceremony and she tosses her bouquet to the ceiling amid shouts and scurry and marvel of marvels it is captured by her of the rosy cheeks and dancing eyes who has already secured the ring and fascinated the artilleryman and they reach the door and ray has squeezed out to the steps and some of the emotional cousins have retreated sobbing to deserted nooks and corners about the house and at last she comes forth and springs lightly down the stairs and the rice rattles after her along the broad walk and the groomsmen line the gateway and usher her into the carriage and stand there ready to volley them with old slippers and ray is just about springing in beside her when down comes blake with his sevenleague strides bearing a sobbing little sunnyhaired maiden of seven in his arms hold on he shouts this is my little sweetheart and she shant be left out in the cold and marion leans from the carriage and ray stands to one side as the weeping little one holds out her arms oh miss ma wion i havent had one kiss they all cwowded so and i was the only one and her sobs break forth afresh my own little kitten she cries as the child is seized and folded to her heart how could i have come away without seeing my baby scholar and the mite is hugged and kissed and comforted and sent back to blakes strong arms rapturous because she has had queen marions last embrace and then ray springs to her side and the door slams and the horses plunge and away they drive amid a shower of blessings and old slippers and they have gone a block before she notes his silence and turning sees that his eyes are closed that a tear is glistening on his bronzed cheek will husband she whispers lovingly tenderly halfreproachfully what is it and her little hand steals into his for a moment there is no reply his arm is quickly thrown around her and she is drawn close to his breast his lips are pressed to her forehead but he utters no word at last she hears the answer my darling i am wondering what i ever did to deserve one moment of your love i am wondering what man could deserve you and i was praying gods guidance that i might never disappoint your trust it is many a long year since that bright summer men have come and men have gone vows have been made and vows and hearts together have been broken and yet some lives though into each some rain must fall have been full of sunshine only the other day there came eastward a letter from a proud young matron still young despite the cares incidental to the possession of a lively brood among whom there seems no higher ambition than to emulate the exploits of a certain master sandy ray who is in pristine knickerbockers and perennial mischief jack says writes this proud mamma that with all his pranks that blessed little rascal is his father all over fearless truthful and generous and captain ray fairly idolizes him my jack junior is a head taller and nearly two years older but the two are inseparable and it is a sight to see them going off scouting on their indian ponies as for marion i believe she is the happiest woman in the army well mrs truscott ought to know and this goes far towards substantiation of truscotts theory that marions faith was given to a man who was loyal in every fibre of his being tender as he was brave steadfast as he was loving and he loves her as such a woman deserves to be loved tenderly faithfully and to the end
