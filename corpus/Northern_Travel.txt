northern travel entered according to act of congress in the year by g p putnam in the clerks office of the district court for the southern district of new york preface this book requires no further words of introduction than those with which i have prefaced former volumes that my object in travel is neither scientific statistical nor politicoeconomical but simply artistic pictorial if possible panoramic i have attempted to draw with a hand which i hope has acquired a little steadiness from long practice the people and the scenery of northern europe to colour my sketches with the tints of the originals and to invest each one with its native and characteristic atmosphere in order to do this i have adopted as in other countries a simple rule to live as near as possible the life of the people among whom i travel the history of sweden and norway their forms of government commerce productive industry political condition geology botany and agriculture can be found in other works and i have only touched upon such subjects where it was necessary to give completeness to my pictures i have endeavoured to give photographs instead of diagrams or tables of figures and desire only that the untravelled reader who is interested in the countries i visit may find that he is able to see them by the aid of my eyes bayard taylor london november contents page chapter i a winter voyage on the

voyage on the baltic we went on board the little iron swedish propeller carl johan at lьbeck on the morning of december ad having previously taken our passage for stockholm what was our dismay after climbing over hills of freight on deck and creeping down a narrow companionway to find the cabin stowed full of bales of wool and barrels of butter there was a little pantry adjoining it with a friendly stewardess therein who in answer to my inquiries assured us that we would probably be placed in a hut after further search i found the captain who was superintending the loading of more freight and who also stated that he would put us into a hut let me see the hut then i demanded and we were a little relieved when we found it to be a stateroom containing two of the narrowest of bunks there was another hut opposite occupied by two more passengers all that the steamer could carry and all we had except a short deckpassenger who disappeared at the commencement of the voyage and was not seen again until its close the day was clear and cold the low hills around lьbeck were covered with snow and the trave was already frozen over we left at noon slowly breaking our way down the narrow and winding river which gradually widened and became clearer of ice as we approached the baltic when we reached travemьnde it was snowing fast and a murky chaos beyond the sandy bar concealed the baltic the town is a long row of houses fronting the water there were few inhabitants to be seen for the bathing guests had long since flown and all watering places have a funereal air after the season is over our fellowpassenger a jovial pole insisted on going ashore to drink a last glass of bavarian beer before leaving germany but the beverage had been so rarely called for that it had grown sharp and sour and we hurried back unsatisfied a space about six feet square had been cleared out among the butterkegs in the cabin and we sat down to dinner by candlelight at three oclock swedish customs already appeared in a preliminary decanter of lemoncolored brandy a thimbleful of which was taken with a piece of bread and sausage before the soup appeared the taste of the liquor was sweet unctuous and not agreeable our party consisted of the captain the chief officer who was his brotherinlaw the pole who was a secondcousin of kosciusko and had a name consisting of eight consonants and two vowels a grave young swede with a fresh norse complexion and our two selves the steward hildebrand and the silent stewardess marie were our attendants and purveyors the ships officers were rather slow and opaque and the swede sublimely selfpossessed and indifferent but the pole who had been condemned to death at cracow and afterwards invented cheap gas was one of the jolliest fellows alive his german was full of funny mistakes but he rattled away with as much assurance as if it had been his native tongue before dinner was over we were all perfectly well acquainted with each other night had already set in on the baltic nothing was to be seen but snow the deck was heaped with freight the storm blew in our teeth and the steamer deeply laden moved slowly and labouriously so we stretched ourselves on the narrow bunks in our hut and preserved a delicate regard for our equilibrium even in sleep in the morning the steep cliffs of mцen a danish island were visible on our left we looked for rьgen the last stronghold of the worship of odin in the middle ages but a raw mist rolled down upon the sea and left us advancing blindly as before the wind was strong and cold blowing the vapory watersmoke in long trails across the surface of the waves it was not long however before some dim white gleams through the mist were pointed out as the shores of sweden and the carl johan slackened her speed to a snails pace snuffing at headland after headland like a dog off the scent in order to find her way into ystad a lift of the fog favored us at last and we ran into the little harbor i walked the contracted hurricane deck at three oclock with the sunset already flushing the west looked on the town and land and thought of my friend dr kane the mercury had fallen to a foot of snow covered the houseroofs the low undulating hills all wore the same monotonous nocolor and the yellowhaired people on the pier were buttoned up close mittened and furcapped the captain telegraphed to calmar our next port and received an answer that the sound was full of ice and the harbor frozen up a customhouse officer who took supper with us on board informed us of the loss of the steamship umeе which was cut through by the ice near sundsvall and sunk drowning fifteen persons a pleasant prospect for our further voyage and the pole would have willingly landed at ystad if he could have found a conveyance to get beyond it we had twelve tons of coal to take on board and the work proceeded so slowly that we caught another snowstorm so thick and blinding that we dared not venture out of the harbor on the third morning nevertheless we were again at sea having passed bornholm and were heading for the southern end of the island of oland about noon as we were sitting huddled around the cabin stove the steamer suddenly stopped there was a hurried movement of feet overhead a cry and we rushed on deck one of the sailors was in the act of throwing overboard a life buoy it is the pole was our first exclamation no no said hildebrand with a distressed face it is the cabinboy a sprightly handsome fellow of fourteen there he was struggling in the icy water looking toward the steamer which was every moment more distant two men were in the little boat which had just been run down from the davits but it seemed an eternity until their oars were shipped and they pulled away on their errand of life or death we urged the mate to put the steamer about but he passively refused the boy still swam but the boat was not yet halfway and headed too much to the left there was no tiller and the men could only guess at their course we guided them by signs watching the boys head now a mere speck seen at intervals under the lowering sky he struggled gallantly the boat drew nearer and one of the men stood up and looked around we watched with breathless suspense for the reappearance of the brave young swimmer but we watched in vain poor boy who can know what was the agony of those ten minutes while the icy waves gradually benumbed and dragged down the young life that struggled with such desperate energy to keep its place in the world the men sat down and rowed back bringing only his cap which they had found floating on the sea ah said hildebrand with tears in his eyes i did not want to take him this voyage but his mother begged me so hard that i could not refuse and this is the end we had a melancholy party in the cabin that afternoon the painful impression made by this catastrophe was heightened by the knowledge that it might have been prevented the steamer amidships was filled up to her rail with coal and the boy was thrown overboard by a sudden lurch while walking upon it immediately afterwards lines were rove along the stanchions to prevent the same thing happening again the few feet of deck upon which we could walk were slippery with ice and we kept below smoking gloomily and saying little another violent snowstorm came on from the north but in the afternoon we caught sight of some rocks off carlscrona and made the light on oland in the evening the wind had been blowing so freshly that our captain suspected calmar sound might be clear and determined to try the passage we felt our way slowly through the intricate sandbanks in the midst of fog and snow until after midnight when only six miles from calmar we were stopped by fields of drift ice and had to put back again the fourth morning dawned cold and splendidly clear when i went on deck we were rounding the southern point of oland through long belts of floating ice the low chalk cliffs were covered with snow and looked bleak and desolate enough the wind now came out of the west enabling us to carry the foresail so that we made eight or nine knots in spite of our overloaded condition braisted and i walked the deck all day enjoying the keen wind and clear faint sunshine of the north in the afternoon however it blew half a gale with flurries of mingled rain and snow the sea rose and the steamer lumbered as she was could not be steered on her course but had to be conned to keep off the strain the hatches were closed and an occasional sea broke over the bows we sat below in the dark huts the pole leaning against the bulkhead silently awaiting his fate as he afterwards confessed i had faith enough in the timidity of our captain not to feel the least alarm and true enough two hours had not elapsed before we layto under the lee of the northern end of oland the pole then sat down bathed from head to foot in a cold sweat and would have landed immediately had it been possible the swede was as inexpressive as ever with the same halfsmile on his fair serious face i was glad to find that our captain did not intend to lose the wind but would start again in an hour or two we had a quieter night than could have been anticipated followed by a brilliant morning such good progress had been made that at sunrise the lighthouse on the rocks of landsort was visible and the jagged masses of that archipelago of cloven isles which extends all the way to torneе began to stud the sea the water became smoother as we ran into the sound between landsort and the outer isles a long line of bleak black rocks crusted with snow stretched before us beside the lighthouse at their southern extremity there were two red framehouses and a telegraph station a boat manned by eight hardy sailors came off with a pilot who informed us that stockholm was closed with ice and that the other steamers had been obliged to stop at the little port of dalarц thirty miles distant so for dalarц we headed threading the channels of the scattering islands which gradually became higher and more picturesque with clumps of dark fir crowning their snowy slopes the midday sun hung low on the horizon throwing a pale yellow light over the wild northern scenery but there was life in the cold air and i did not ask for summer we passed the deserted fortress of dalarц a square stone structure which has long since outlived its purpose on the summit of a rock in the sound behind it opened a quiet bay held in a projecting arm of the mainland near the extremity of which appeared our port a village of about fifty houses scattered along the abrupt shore the darkred buildings stood out distinctly against the white background two steamers and half a dozen sailing crafts were moored below them about as many individuals were moving quietly about and for all the life and animation we could see we might have been in kamtchatka as our voyage terminated here our first business was to find means of getting to stockholm by land our fellowpassengers proposed that we should join company and engage five horses and three sleds for ourselves and luggage the swede willingly undertook to negotiate for us and set about the work with his usual impassive semicheerfulness the landlord of the only inn in the place promised to have everything ready by six oclock the next morning and our captain who was to go on the same evening took notices of our wants to be served at the two intervening poststations on the road we then visited the customhouse a cabin about ten feet square and asked to have our luggage examined no answered the official we have no authority to examine anything you must wait until we send to stockholm this was at least a new experience we were greatly vexed and annoyed but at length by dint of explanations and entreaties prevailed upon the man to attempt an examination our trunks were brought ashore and if ever a man did his duty conscientiously it was this same swedish official every article was taken out and separately inspected with an honest patience which i could not but admire nothing was found contraband however we had the pleasure of repacking and were then pulled back to the carl johan in a profuse sweat despite the intense cold chapter ii stockholm preparations for the north on the following morning we arose at five went ashore in the darkness and after waiting an hour succeeded in getting our teams together the horses were small but spirited the sleds rudely put together but strong and not uncomfortable and the drivers peasants of the neighborhood patient and goodhumoured climbing the steep bank we were out of the village in two minutes crossed an open common and entered the forests of fir and pine the sleighing was superb and our little nags carried us merrily along at the usual travelling rate of one swedish mile nearly seven english per hour enveloped from head to foot in our fur robes we did not feel the sharp air and in comparing our sensations decided that the temperature was about what was our surprise on reaching the poststation at learning that it was actually below zero slowly almost imperceptibly the darkness decreased but the morning was cloudy and there was little appearance of daybreak before nine oclock in the early twilight we were startled by the appearance of a ball of meteoric fire nearly as large as the moon and of a soft white lustre which moved in a horizontal line from east to west and disappeared without a sound i was charmed by the forest scenery through which we passed the pine spruce and fir trees of the greatest variety of form were completely coated with frozen snow and stood as immovable as forests of bronze incrusted with silver the delicate twigs of the weeping birch resembled sprays of crystal of a thousand airy and exquisite patterns there was no wind except in the open glades between the woods where the frozen lakes spread out like meadow intervals as we approached the first station there were signs of cultivation fields inclosed with stake fences low red houses low barns and scanty patches of garden land we occasionally met peasants with their sleds hardy redfaced fellows and women solid enough to outweigh their bulk in pigiron the poststation was a cottage in the little hamlet of berga we drove into the yard and while sleds and horses were being changed partook of some boiled milk and tough ryebread the only things to be had but both good of their kind the travellers room was carpeted and comfortable and the people seemed poor only because of their few wants our new sleds were worse than the former and so were our horses but we came to the second station in time and found we must make still another arrangement the luggage was sent ahead on a large sled while each pair of us seated in a one horse cutter followed after it driving ourselves swedish horses are stopped by a whistle and encouraged by a smacking of the lips which i found impossible to learn at once and they considerately gave us no whips we had now a broad beaten road and the many teams we met and passed gave evidence of our approach to stockholm the country too gently undulating all the way was more thickly settled and appeared to be under tolerable cultivation about one in the afternoon we climbed a rising slope and from its brow looked down upon stockholm the sky was darkgray and lowering the hills were covered with snow and the roofs of the city resembled a multitude of tents out of which rose half a dozen dark spires on either side were arms of the mдlar lake white frozen plains snow was already in the air and presently we looked through a screen of heavy flakes on the dark weird wintry picture the impression was perfect of its kind and i shall not soon forget it we had passed through the southern suburb and were descending to the lake when one of our shafts snapped off resigning the cutter to the charge of a stout maiden who acted as postillion braisted and i climbed upon the luggage and in this wise shaggy with snowy fur passed through the city before the house of nobles and the kings palace and over the northern bridge and around the northern suburb and i know not where else to the great astonishment of everybody we met until our stupid driver found out where he was to go then we took leave of the pole who had engaged horses to norrkцping and looked utterly disconsolate at parting but the grave swede showed his kind heart at last for neglecting his home from which he had been absent seven years he accompanied us to an hotel engaged rooms and saw us safely housed we remained in stockholm a week engaged in making preparations for our journey to the north during this time we were very comfortably quartered in kahns hotel the only one in the capital where one can get both rooms and meals the weather changed so entirely as completely to destroy our first impressions and make the north which we were seeking once more as distant as when we left germany the day after our arrival a thaw set in which cleared away every particle of snow and ice opened the harbor freed the mдlar lake and gave the white hills around the city their autumnal colors of brown and darkgreen a dense fog obscured the brief daylight the air was close damp and oppressive everybody coughed and snuffled and the airtight rooms so comfortable in cold weather became insufferable my blood stagnated my spirits descended as the mercury rose and i grew all impatience to have zero and a beaten snowtrack again we had more difficulty in preparing for this journey than i anticipated not so much in the way of procuring the necessary articles as the necessary information on the subject i was not able to find a man who had made the journey in winter or who could tell me what to expect and what to do the mention of my plan excited very general surprise but the people were too polished and courteous to say outright that i was a fool though i dont doubt that many of them thought so even the maps are only minute enough for the traveller as far as torneе and the only special maps of lapland i could get dated from the government it is true has commenced the publication of a very admirable map of the kingdom in provinces but these do not as yet extend beyond jemteland about lat north neither is there any work to be had except some botanical and geological publications which of course contain but little practical information the english and german handbooks for sweden are next to useless north of stockholm the principal assurances were that we should suffer greatly from cold that we should take along a supply of provisions for nothing was to be had and that we must expect to endure hardships and privations of all kinds this prospect was not at all alarming for i remembered that i had heard much worse accounts of ethiopia while making similar preparations in cairo and have learned that all such bugbears cease to exist when they are boldly faced our outfit therefore was restricted to some coffee sugar salt gunpowder lucifermatches lead shot and slugs four bottles of cognac for cases of extremity a sword a butcherknife hammer screwdriver nails rope and twine all contained in a box about eighteen inches square a single valise held our stock of clothing books writing and drawing materials and each of us carried in addition a doublebarrelled musket we made negotiations for the purchase of a handsome norrland sleigh numbers of which come to stockholm at this season laden with wildfowl but the thaw prevented our making a bargain the preparation of the requisite funds however was a work of some time in this i was assisted by mr mostrцm an excellent valetdeplace whom i hereby recommend to all travellers when after three or four days labour and diplomacy he brought me the money i thought i had suddenly come in possession of an immense fortune there were hundreds of banknotes and thousands of silver pieces of all sizes swedish paper silver and copper norwegian notes and dollars danish marks and russian gold roubles and copecks the value belied the quantity and the vast pile melted away so fast that i was soon relieved of my pleasant delusion our equipment should have been made in germany for singularly enough stockholm is not half so well provided with furs and articles of winter clothing as hamburg or leipsic besides everything is about fifty per cent dearer here we were already provided with ample fur robes i with one of gray bearskin and braisted with yellow fox to these we added caps of seaotter mittens of dogskin lined with the fur of the arctic hare knitted devils caps woollen sashes of great length for winding around the body and after long search leather russian boots lined with sheepskin and reaching halfway up the thigh when rigged out in this costume my diameter was about equal to half my height and i found locomotion rather cumbrous while braisted whose stature is some seven inches shorter waddled along like an animated cottonbale everything being at last arranged so far as our limited information made it possible for a two months journey we engaged places in a diligence which runs as far as gefle miles north of stockholm there we hoped to find snow and a colder climate one of my first steps had been to engage a swedish teacher and by dint of taking double lessons every day i flattered myself that i had made sufficient progress in the language to travel without an interpreter the most inconvenient and expensive of persons to be sure a week is very little for a new language but to one who speaks english and german swedish is already half acquired chapter iii first experiences of northern travel the diligence was a compact little vehicle carrying four persons but we two were so burdened with our guns sword moneybag fieldglass overboots and twofathomlong sashes that we found the space allotted to us small enough we started at eight oclock and had not gone a hundred yards before we discovered that the most important part of our outfit the maps had been left behind it was too late to return and we were obliged to content ourselves with the hope of supplying them at upsala or gefle we rolled by twilight through the northern suburb the morning was sharp and cold and the roads which had been muddy and cut up the day before were frozen terribly hard and rough our fellowpassengers were two swedes an unprepossessing young fellow who spoke a few words of english and a silent old gentleman we did not derive much advantage from their society and i busied myself with observing the country through which we passed a mile or two past handsome countryseats and some cemeteries brought us into the region of forests the pines were tall and picturesque in their forms and the grassy meadows between them entirely clear of snow were wonderfully green for the season during the first stage we passed some inlets of the baltic highly picturesque with their irregular wooded shores they had all been frozen over during the night we were surprised to see on a southern hillside four peasants at work ploughing how they got their shares through the frozen sod unless the soil was remarkably dry and sandy was more than i could imagine we noticed occasionally a large manorhouse with its dependent outbuildings and its avenue of clipped beeches or lindens looking grand and luxurious in the midst of the cold dark fields here and there were patches of wheat which the early snow had kept green and the grass in the damp hollows was still bright yet it was the th of december and we were almost in lat n the houses were mostly onestory wooden cottages of a dull red color with red roofs in connection with the blackgreen of the pine and fir woods they gave the country a singularly sombre aspect there was little variation in the scenery all the way to upsala in some places the soil appeared to be rich and under good cultivation here the red villages were more frequent and squat churchtowers showed themselves in the distance in other places we had but the rough hills or rather knobs of gray gneiss whose masses were covered with yellow moss and the straggling fir forests we met but few country teams on the road nobody was to be seen about the houses and the land seemed to be asleep or desolated even at noon when the sun came out fairly he was low on the horizon and gave but an eclipsed light which was more cheerless than complete darkness the sun set about three oclock but we had a long splendid twilight a flush of orange rose and ambergreen worthy of a mediterranean heaven two hours afterwards the lights of upsala appeared and we drove under the imposing front of the old palace through clean streets over the upsala river and finally stopped at the door of a courtyard here we were instantly hailed by some young fellows who inquired if we did not want rooms the place did not appear to be an inn but as the silent old gentleman got out and went in i judged it best to follow his example and the diligence drove off with our baggage we were right after all a rosy handsome goodhumored landlady appeared promised to furnish us with beds and a supper to wake us betimes and give us coffee before leaving the old gentleman kindly put on his coat and accompanied us to a bookstore on the public square where i found akrells map of northern sweden and thus partially replaced our loss he sat awhile in our room trying to converse but i made little headway on learning that we were bound for torneе he asked are you going to buy lumber no i answered we are merely going to see the country he laughed long and heartily at such an absurd idea got up in a hurry and went to bed without saying another word we had a supper of various kinds of sausage tough rye bread and a bowl of milk followed by excellent beds a thing which you are sure to find everywhere in sweden we drove off again at halfpast six in the morning moon light with a temperature of zero two or three miles from the town we passed the mounds of old upsala the graves of odin thor and freja rising boldly against the first glimmerings of daylight the landscape was broad dark and silent the woods and fields confusedly blended together and only the sepulchres of the ancient gods broke the level line of the horizon i could readily have believed in them at that hour passing over the broad rich plain of upsala we entered a gently undulating country richer and better cultivated than the district we had traversed the previous day it was splendidly wooded with thick fir forests floored with bright green moss some of the views toward the north and west were really fine from their extent though seen in the faded light and long shadows of the low northern sun in the afternoon we passed a large white church with four little towers at the corners standing in the midst of a village of low red stables in which the country people shelter their horses while attending service there must have been fifty or sixty of these buildings arranged in regular streets in most of the swedish country churches the belfry stands apart a squat square tower painted red with a black upper story and is sometimes larger than the church itself the houses of the peasants are veritable western shanties except in color and compactness no wind finds a cranny to enter and the roofs of thick thatch kept down by long horizontal poles have an air of warmth and comfort the stables are banked with earth up to the hayloft and the cattle enter their subterranean stalls through sloping doorways like those of the egyptian tombs notwithstanding we made good progress through the day it was dark long before we reached the bridge over the dal elv and of the famous cascades we saw only a sloping white glimmer between dark masses of forest and heard the noise of the broken waters at elfkarleby we were allowed twenty minutes for dinner boiled salmon and beefsteak both bad i slept after this until aroused by the old swede as we entered gefle we drove across a broad bridge looked over vessels frozen into the inlet of the gulf passed a large public square and entered the yard of the diligence office a boy in waiting conducted us to a private house where furnished rooms were to be had and here we obtained tea comfortable beds and the attendance of a rosy servantgirl who spoke intelligible swedish my first care the next morning was to engage horses and send off my fцrbud papers we were now to travel by skjuts pronounced shoos or post taking new horses at each station on the road the fцrbud tickets are simply orders for horses to be ready at an appointed time and are sent in advance to all the stations on the road either by mail or by a special messenger without this precaution i was told we might be subjected to considerable delay this mode of travelling is peculiar to sweden and norway it has been in existence for three or four centuries and though gradually improved and systematized with the lapse of time it is still sufficiently complex and inconvenient to a traveller coming from the railroad world professor retzius had referred me to the botanist hartman in case of need but i determined to commence by helping myself i had a little difficulty at first the people are unused to speaking with foreigners and if you ask them to talk slowly they invariably rattle away twice as fast as before i went into a variety shop on the public square and asked where i could engage horses for sundsvall after making myself understood as i supposed the clerk handed me some new bridles by dint of blundering i gradually circumscribed the range of my inquiries and finally came to a focus at the right place having ordered horses at six the next morning and despatched the fцrbud tickets by the afternoons mail i felt that i had made a good beginning and we set out to make the tour of gefle this is a town of eight or ten thousand inhabitants with a considerable shipping interest and a naval school it is a pretty place well built and with a neat substantial air the houses are mostly two stories high white and with spacious courts in the rear the country around is low but rolling and finely clothed with dark forests of fir and pine it was a superb day gloriously clear with a south wind bracing and not too cold and a soft pale lustre from the cloudless sun but such a day sunrise melting into sunset without a noon a long morning twilight a low slant sun shining on the housetops for an hour or so and the evening twilight at three in the afternoon nothing seemed real in this strange dying light nothing but my ignorance of swedish whenever i tried to talk in the afternoon we called on the magister hartman whom we found poring over his plants he spoke english tolerably and having made a journey through lapland from torneе to the lyngen fjord was able to give us some information about the country he encouraged us in the belief that we should find the journey more rapid and easy in winter than in summer he said the swedes feared the north and few of them ever made a winter journey thither but nothing could stop the americans and the english from going anywhere he also comforted us with the assurance that we should find snow only six swedish forty english miles further north lat n the th of december and no snow yet in the streets we met an organgrinder playing the marseillaise there was no mistaking the jetblack hair the golden complexion and the brilliant eyes of the player siete italiano i asked sicuro he answered joyously e lei anche ah he said in answer to my questions io non amo questo paese и freddo ed oscuro non si gagna niente ma in italia si vive my friend ziegler had already assured me one should see the north but not after the south well we shall see but i confess that twenty degrees below zero would have chilled me less than the sight of that italian we were at the inn punctually at six in the morning but our horses were not ready the hеllkarl or ostler after hearing my remonstrances went on splitting wood and as i did not know enough of swedish to scold with any profit i was obliged to remain wrathful and silent he insisted on my writing something i could not understand what in the postbook so i copied the affidavit of a preceding traveller and signed my name to it which seemed to answer the purpose after more than half an hour two rough twowheeled carts were gotten ready and the farmers to whom they belonged packed themselves and our luggage into one leaving us to drive the other we mounted rolled ourselves in our furs thrust our feet into the hay and rattled out of gefle in the frosty moonlight such was our first experience of travelling by skjuts the road went northward into dark forests over the same undulating yet monotonous country as before the ground was rough and hard and our progress slow so that we did not reach the end of the first station miles until nine oclock as we drove into the posthouse three other travellers who had the start of us and consequently the first right to horses drove away i was dismayed to find that my fцrbud had not been received but the ostler informed me that by paying twelve skillings extra i could have horses at once while the new carts were getting ready the postman wrapped in wolfskin and with a face reddened by the wind came up and handed out my fцrbud ticket such was our first experience of fцrbud on the next station the peasant who was ahead with our luggage left the main road and took a rough track through the woods presently we came to a large inlet of the bothnian gulf frozen solid from shore to shore and upon this we boldly struck out the ice was nearly a foot thick and as solid as marble so we drove for at least four miles and finally came to land on the opposite side near a sawmill at the next posthouse we found our predecessors just setting off again in sleds the landlord informed us that he had only received my fцrbud an hour previous and according to law was allowed three hours to get ready his second instalment of horses the first being exhausted there was no help for it we therefore comforted ourselves with breakfast at one oclock we set out again in low norrland sleds but there was little snow at first and we were obliged to walk the first few miles the station was a long one twenty english miles and our horses not the most promising coming upon solid snow at last we travelled rather more swiftly but with more risk the sleds although so low rest upon narrow runners and the shafts are attached by a hook upon which they turn in all directions so that the sled sways from side to side entirely independent of them in going off the main road to get a little more snow on a side track i discovered this fact by overturning the sled and pitching braisted and myself out on our heads there were lakes on either side and we made many miles on the hard ice which split with a dull sound under us long after dark we reached the next station strеtjдra and found our horses in readiness we started again by the gleam of a flashing aurora going through forests and fields in the uncertain light blindly following our leader braisted and i driving by turns and already much fatigued after a long time we descended a steep hill to the ljusne river the water foamed and thundered under the bridge and i could barely see that it fell in a series of rapids over the rocks at mo myskie which we reached at eight oclock our horses had been ready four hours which gave us a dollar banco vдntapenningar waiting money to pay the landlord a sturdy jolly fellow with grizzly hair and a prosperous abdomen asked if we were french and i addressed him in that language he answered in english on finding that we were americans on his saying that he had learned english in tripoli i addressed him in arabic his eyes flashed he burst into a roaring laugh of the profoundest delight and at once answered in the majestic gutturals of the orient allah akhbar he cried i have been waiting twenty years for some one to speak to me in arabic and you are the first he afterwards changed to italian which he spoke perfectly well and preferred to any foreign language we were detained half an hour by his delight and went off forgetting to pay for a bottle of beer the price of which i sent back by the skjutsbonde or postillion this skjutsbonde was a stupid fellow who took us a long circuitous road in order to save time we hurried along in the darkness constantly crying out kцr pе drive on and narrowly missing a hundred overturns it was eleven at night before we reached the inn at kungsgеrden where fortunately the people were awake and the pleasant old landlady soon had our horses ready we had yet sixteen english miles to bro our lodgingplace where we should have arrived by eight oclock i hardly know how to describe the journey we were half asleep tired out nearly frozen mercury below zero and dashed along at haphazard through vast dark forests up hill and down following the sleepy boy who drove ahead with our baggage a dozen times the sled swaying from side to side like a pendulum tilted hung in suspense a second and then righted itself again the boy fell back on the hay and slept until braisted creeping up behind startled him with terrific yells in his ears away then dashed the horse down steep declivities across open cultivated valleys and into the woods again after midnight the moon rose and the cold was intenser than ever the boy having fallen asleep again the horse took advantage of it to run off at full speed we following at the same rate sometimes losing sight of him and uncertain of our way until after a chase of a few miles we found the boy getting his reins out from under the runners finally after two in the morning we reached bro here we had ordered a warm room beds and supper by fцrbud but found neither a sleepy stupid girl who had just got up to wait on a captain who had arrived before us and was going on told us there was nothing to be had we must eat if we have to eat you i said savagely for we were chilled through and fierce with hunger but i might as well have tried to hurry the venus de medici at last we got some cold sausage a fire and two couches on which we lay down without undressing and slept i had scarcely closed my eyes it seemed when the girl who was to call us at halfpast five oclock came into the room is it halfpast five i asked oh yes she coolly answered its much more we were obliged to hurry off at once to avoid paying so much waiting money at sunrise we passed hudiksvall a pretty town at the head of a deep bay in which several vessels were frozen up for the winter there were some handsome country houses in the vicinity better cultivation more taste in building and a few apple and cherry orchards the mercury was still at zero but we suffered less from the cold than the day previous and began to enjoy our mode of travel the horses were ready at all the stations on our arrival and we were not delayed in changing there was now plenty of snow and the roads were splendid the country undulating with beautiful deep valleys separated by high wooded hills and rising to bold ridges in the interior the houses were larger and better than we had yet seen so were the people and there was a general air of progress and welldoing in fact both country and population improved in appearance as we went northward the night set in very dark and cold threatening snow we had an elephant of a horse which kicked up his heels and frisked like an awkward bullpup dashed down the hills like an avalanche and carried us forward at a rapid rate we coiled ourselves up in the hay kept warm and trusted our safety to providence for it was impossible to see the road and we could barely distinguish the other sled a dark speck before us the old horse soon exhausted his enthusiasm braisted lost the whip and the zealous boy ahead stopped every now and then to hurry us on the aurora gleamed but faintly through the clouds we were nearly overcome with sleep and fatigue but took turns in arousing and amusing each other the sled vibrated continually from side to side and finally went over spilling ourselves and our guns into a snowbank the horse stopped and waited for us and then went on until the shafts came off toward ten oclock the lights of sundsvall appeared and we soon afterwards drove into the yard of the inn having made one hundred and fiftyfive miles in two days we were wretchedly tired and hungry as bears but found room in an adjoining house and succeeded in getting a supper of reindeer steak i fell asleep in my chair before my pipe was halffinished and awoke the next morning to a sense of real fatigue i had had enough of travelling by fцrbud chapter iv a sleigh ride through norrland sundsvall is a pretty little town of two or three thousand inhabitants situated at the head of a broad and magnificent bay it is the eastern terminus of the only postroad across the mountains to trondhjem drontheim in norway which passes through the extensive province of jemteland it is consequently a lively and bustling place and has a considerable coasting trade the day after our arrival was marketday and hundreds of the norrlanders thronged the streets and public square they were all fresh strong coarse honest healthy people the men with long yellow hair large noses and blue eyes the women with the rosiest of checks and the fullest development of body and limb many of the latter wore basques or jackets of sheepskin with the wool inside striped petticoats and bright red stockings the men were dressed in shaggy sheepskin coats or garments of reindeer skin with the hair outward there was a vast collection of low norrland sleds laden with butter cheese hay and wild game and drawn by the rough and tough little horses of the country here was still plenty of life and animation although we were already so far north that the sun did not shine upon sundsvall the whole day being hidden by a low hill to the south the snowy ridges on the north however wore a bright roseate blush from his rays from ten until two we called upon a merchant of the place to whom i had a letter of introduction he was almost the only man i met before undertaking the journey who encouraged me to push on the people in stockholm said he know nothing about northern sweden he advised me to give up travelling by fцrbud to purchase a couple of sleds and take our chance of finding horses we would have no trouble in making from forty to fifty english miles per day on returning to the inn i made the landlord understand what we wanted but could not understand him in return at this juncture came in a handsome fellow with a cosmopolitan air whom braisted recognised by certain invisible signs as the mate of a ship and who explained the matter in very good english i purchased two plain but light and strongly made sleds for rigs about which seemed very cheap but i afterwards learned that i paid much more than the current price on repacking our effects we found that everything liquid was frozen even a camphorated mixture which had been carefully wrapped in flannel the cold therefore must have been much more severe than we supposed our supplies also were considerably damaged the lantern broken a powderflask cracked and the salt shot nails wadding c mixed together in beautiful confusion everything was stowed in one of the sleds which was driven by the postilion the other contained only our two selves we were off the next morning as the first streaks of dawn appeared in the sky the roads about sundsvall were very much cut up and even before getting out of the town we were pitched over head and ears into a snowbank we climbed slowly up and darted headlong down the ridges which descend from the west toward the bothnian gulf dividing its tributary rivers and toward sunrise came to a broad bay completely frozen over and turned into a snowy plain with some difficulty the skjutsbonde made me understand that a shorter road led across the ice to the second poststation fjдl avoiding one change of horses the way was rough enough at first over heaped blocks of ice but became smoother where the wind had full sweep and had cleared the water before it froze our road was marked out by a double row of young firtrees planted in the ice the bay was completely landlocked embraced by a bold sweep of wooded hills with rich populous valleys between before us three or four miles across lay the little port of wifstawarf where several vessels among them a ship of three or four hundred tuns were frozen in for the winter we crossed ascended a long hill and drove on through fir woods to fjдl a little hamlet with a large inn here we got breakfast and though it may be in bad taste to speak of what one eats the breakfast was in such good taste that i cannot pass over it without lingering to enjoy in memory its wonderful aroma besides if it be true as some shockingly gross persons assert that the belly is a more important district of the human economy than the brain a good meal deserves chronicling no less than an exalted impression certain it is that strong digestive are to be preferred to strong thinking powers better live unknown than die of dyspepsia this was our first country meal in norrland of whose fare the stockholmers have a horror yet that stately capital never furnished a better we had beefsteak and onions delicious bloodpuddings the tenderest of pancakes no omelette soufflйe could be more fragile with ruby raspberry jam and a bottle of genuine english porter if you think the bill of fare too heavy and solid take a drive of fifteen miles in the regions of zero and then let your delicate stomach decide in a picturesque dell near fjдl we crossed the rapid indal river which comes down from the mountains of norway the country was wild and broken with occasional superb views over frozen arms of the gulf and the deep rich valleys stretching inland leaving hernцsand the capital of the province a few miles to our right we kept the main northern road slowly advancing from station to station with old and tired horses there was a snowstorm in the afternoon after which the sky came out splendidly clear and gorgeous with the long northern twilight in the silence of the hour and the deepening shadows of the forest through which we drove it was startling to hear all at once the sound of voices singing a solemn hymn my first idea was that some of those fanatical dissenters of norrland who meet as once the scotch covenanters among the hills were having a refreshing winter meeting in the woods but on proceeding further we found that the choristers were a company of peasants returning from market with their empty sleds it was already dark at four oclock and our last horses were so slow that the postilion a handsome lively boy whose pride was a little touched by my remonstrances failed in spite of all his efforts to bring us to the station before seven we stopped at weda on the angermann river the largest stream in northern sweden angermannland the country which it drains is said to be a very wild and beautiful region where some traces of the old original asiatic type which peopled scandinavia are yet to be traced in the features of its secluded population at weda we found excellent quarters a neat quiet oldfashioned little servantgirl of twelve or fourteen took charge of us and attended to all our wants with the greatest assiduity we had a good supper a small but neat room clean beds and coffee in the morning beside a plentiful provision for breakfast on the way for a sum equal to seventyfive cents we left at halfpast seven the waning moon hanging on the horizon and the first almost imperceptible signs of the morning twilight in the east the angermann river which is here a mile broad was frozen and our road led directly across its surface the wind blew down it across the snowcovered ice making our faces tingle with premonitory signs of freezing as the mercury was a little below zero my hands were chilled inside the fur mittens and i was obliged to rub my nose frequently to prevent it from being nipped the day was raw and chilly and the temperature rose very little although the hills occasionally sheltered us from the wind the scenery also grew darker and wilder as we advanced the firtrees were shorter and stunted and of a dark greenishbrown which at a little distance appeared completely black nothing could exceed the bleak inhospitable character of these landscapes the inlets of the bothnian gulf were hard snowcovered plains inclosed by bold rugged headlands covered with inkblack forests the more distant ridges faded into a dull indigo hue flecked with patches of ghastly white under the lowering sullen shortlived daylight our road was much rougher than hitherto we climbed long ridges only to descend by as steep declivities on the northern side to cross the bed of an inland stream and then ascend again the valleys however were inhabited and apparently well cultivated for the houses were large and comfortable and the people had a thrifty prosperous and satisfied air beside the farmhouses were immense racks twenty feet high for the purpose of drying flax and grain and at the stations the people offered for sale very fine and beautiful linen of their own manufacture this is the staple production of norrland where the short summers are frequently insufficient to mature the grain crops the inns were all comfortable buildings with very fair accommodations for travellers we had bad luck with horses this day however two or three travellers having been in advance and had the pick on one stage our baggagesled was driven by a poike of not more than ten years old a darling fellow with a face as round fresh and sweet as a damask rose the bluest of eyes and a cloud of silky golden hair his successor was a tall lazy lout who stopped so frequently to talk with the drivers of sleds behind us that we lost all patience drove past and pushed ahead in the darkness trusting our horse to find the way his horse followed leaving him in the lurch and we gave him a longwinded chase astern before we allowed him to overtake us this so exasperated him that we had no trouble the rest of the way mem if you wish to travel with speed make your postilion angry at hцrnдs they gave us a supper of ale and cold pigs feet admirable beds and were only deficient in the matter of water for washing we awoke with headaches on account of gas from the tight russian stove the temperature at starting was below zero colder than either of us had ever before known we were a little curious at first to know how we should endure it but to our delight found ourselves quite warm and comfortable the air was still dry and delicious to inhale my nose occasionally required friction and my beard and moustache became a solid mass of ice frozen together so that i could scarcely open my mouth and firmly fastened to my fur collar we travelled fortynine miles and were twelve hours on the way yet felt no inconvenience from the temperature by this time it was almost wholly a journey by night dawn and twilight for full day there was none the sun rose at ten and set at two we skimmed along over the black firclothed hills and across the pleasant little valleys in the long gray slowlygathering daybreak then heavy snowclouds hid half the brief day and the long long dusky evening glow settled into night the sleighing was superb the snow pure as ivory hard as marble and beautifully crisp and smooth our sleds glided over it without effort the runners making music as they flew with every day the country grew wilder blacker and more rugged with no change in the general character of the scenery in the afternoon we passed the frontier of norrland and entered the province of west bothnia there are fewer horses at the stations as we go north but also fewer travellers and we were not often detained thus far we had no difficulty my scanty stock of swedish went a great way and i began to understand with more facility even the broad norrland dialect the people of this region are noble specimens of the physical man tall broadshouldered largelimbed ruddy and powerful and they are mated with women who i venture to say do not even suspect the existence of a nervous system the natural consequences of such health are morality and honesty to say nothing of the quantities of rosy and robust children which bless every household if health and virtue cannot secure happiness nothing can and these norrlanders appear to be a thoroughly happy and contented race we had occasional reason to complain of their slowness but then why should they be fast it is rather we who should moderate our speed braisted however did not accept such a philosophy charles xii was the boy to manage the swedes said he to me one day he always kept them in a hurry we reached lefwar our restingplace for the night in good condition notwithstanding the below and felt much colder in the house after stripping off our furs than out of doors with them on they gave us a supper consisting of smцrgеs buttergoose the swedish prelude to a meal consisting usually of bread butter pickled anchovies and caviar flavored with garlic sausages potatoes and milk and made for us sumptuous beds of the snowiest and sweetest linen when we rose next morning it was snowing about an inch had fallen during the night and the mercury had risen to below zero we drove along in the dusky halftwilight toward angesjц over low broad hills covered with forests of stunted birch and fir the scenery continued the same and there is no use in repeating the description except to say that the land became more cold and barren and there seemed to be few things cultivated except flax barley and potatoes still the same ridges sweeping down to the gulf on one hand the same frozen bays and inlets on the other and villages at intervals of eight or ten miles each with its great solid church low red belfry and deserted encampment of red frame stables before reaching the second station we looked from a wooded height over the open expanse of the gulf a plain of snowcovered ice stretching eastward as far as the eye could reach the day gradually became still and cold until the temperature reached again and we became comfortable in the same proportion the afternoon twilight splendid with its hues of amber rose and saffron died away so gradually that it seemed scarcely to fade at all lighting our path for at least three hours after sunset our postilions were all boys ruddy hardy young fellows of fourteen or fifteen who drove well and sang incessantly in spite of the cold they talked much with us but to little purpose as i found it very difficult to understand the humming dialect they spoke each as he received his drickpenningar drinkmoney or gratuity at the end of the station expressed his thanks by shaking hands with us this is a universal custom throughout the north of sweden it is a part of the simple natural habits of the people and though it seemed rather odd at first to be shaking hands with everybody from the landlord down to the cook and the ostler we soon came to take it as a matter of course the frank unaffected way in which the hand was offered oftener made the custom a pleasant one at stocksjц we decided to push on to a station beyond umeе called innertafle and took our horses accordingly the direct road however was unused on account of the drifts so we went around through umeе after all we had nearly a swedish mile and it was just dark when we descended to the umeе river across whose solid surface we drove and up a steep bank into the town we stopped a few moments in the little public square which was crowded with people many of whom had already commenced their christmas sprees the shops were lighted and the little town looked very gay and lively passing through we kept down the left bank of the river for a little distance and then struck into the woods it was night by this time all at once the boy stopped mounted a snowbank whirled around three or four times and said something to me which i could not understand whats the matter i asked is not this the road to innertafle i dont know i think not he said dont you know the way then i asked again no he yelled in reply whirled around several times more and then drove on presently we overtook a pedestrian to whom he turned for advice and who willingly acted as guide for the sake of a ride away we went again but the snow was so spotless that it was impossible to see the track braisted and i ran upon a snowbank were overturned and dragged some little distance but we righted ourselves again and soon afterwards reached our destination in the little inn the guests room lay behind the large family kitchen through which we were obliged to pass we were seized with a shivering fit on stripping off our furs and it seemed scarcely possible to get warm again this was followed by such intense drowsiness that we were obliged to lie down and sleep an hour before supper after the cold weather set in we were attacked with this drowsy fit every day toward evening and were obliged to take turns in arousing and stimulating each other this we generally accomplished by singing from greenlands icy mountains and other appropriate melodies at innertafle we were attended by a tall landlady a staid quiet almost grim person who paid most deliberate heed to our wants after a delay of more than two hours she furnished us with a supper consisting of some kind of fresh fish with a sauce composed of milk sugar and onions followed by gryngrцt a warm mush of mixed rice and barley eaten with milk such was our fare on christmas eve but hunger is the best sauce and our dishes were plentifully seasoned with it chapter v progress northwards a storm we arose betimes on christmas morn but the grim and deliberate landlady detained us an hour in preparing our coffee i was in the yard about five minutes wearing only my cloth overcoat and no gloves and found the air truly sharp and nipping but not painfully severe presently braisted came running in with the thermometer exclaiming with a yell of triumph thirty by jupiter of reaumur equal to below zero of fahrenheit we were delighted with this sign of our approach to the arctic circle the horses were at last ready we muffled up carefully and set out the dawn was just streaking the east the sky was crystalclear and not a breath of air stirring my beard was soon a solid mass of ice from the moisture of my breath and my nose required constant friction the day previous the ice which had gathered on my fur collar lay against my face so long that the flesh began to freeze over my cheekbones and thereafter i was obliged to be particularly cautious as it grew lighter we were surprised to find that our postilion was a girl she had a heavy sheepskin over her knees a muff for her hands and a shawl around her head leaving only the eyes visible thus accoutred she drove on merrily and except that the red of her cheeks became scarlet and purple showed no signs of the weather as we approached sцrmjцle the first station we again had a broad view of the frozen bothnian gulf over which hovered a low cloud of white icesmoke looking down into the snowy valley of sцrmjцle we saw the straight pillars of smoke rising from the houses high into the air not spreading but gradually breaking off into solid masses which sank again and filled the hollow almost concealing the houses only the white handsome church with its tall spire seated on a mound rose above this pale blue film and shone softly in the growing flush of day we ordered horses at once after drinking a bowl of hot milk flavored with cinnamon this is the favourite winter drink of the people sometimes with the addition of brandy but the finkel or common brandy of sweden is a detestable beverage resembling a mixture of turpentine train oil and bad molasses and we took the milk unmixed which admirably assisted in keeping up the animal heat the mercury by this time had fallen to below zero we were surprised and delighted to find that we stood the cold so easily and prided ourselves not a little on our powers of endurance our feet gradually became benumbed but by walking up the hills we prevented the circulation from coming to a standstill the cold however played some grotesque pranks with us my beard moustache cap and fur collar were soon one undivided lump of ice our eyelashes became snowwhite and heavy with frost and it required constant motion to keep them from freezing together we saw everything through visors barred with ivory our eyebrows and hair were as hoary as those of an octogenarian and our cheeks a mixture of crimson and orange so that we were scarcely recognizable by each other every one we met had snowwhite locks no matter how youthful the face and whatever was the colour of our horses at starting we always drove milkwhite steeds at the close of the post the irritation of our nostrils occasioned the greatest inconvenience and as the handkerchiefs froze instantly it soon became a matter of pain and difficulty to use them you might as well attempt to blow your nose with a poplar chip we could not bare our hands a minute without feeling an iron grasp of cold which seemed to squeeze the flesh like a vice and turn the very blood to ice in other respects we were warm and jolly and i have rarely been in higher spirits the air was exquisitely sweet and pure and i could open my mouth as far as its icy grating permitted and inhale full draughts into the lungs with a delicious sensation of refreshment and exhilaration i had not expected to find such freedom of respiration in so low a temperature some descriptions of severe cold in canada and siberia which i have read state that at such times the air occasions a tingling smarting sensation in the throat and lungs but i experienced nothing of the kind this was arctic travel at last by odin it was glorious the smooth firm road crisp and pure as alabaster over which our sleighrunners talked with the rippling musical murmur of summer brooks the sparkling breathless firmament the gorgeous rosy flush of morning slowly deepening until the orange disc of the sun cut the horizon the golden blaze of the tops of the bronze firs the glittering of the glassy birches the long dreary sweep of the landscape the icy nectar of the perfect air the tingling of the roused blood in every vein all alert to guard the outposts of life against the besieging cold it was superb the natives themselves spoke of the cold as being unusually severe and we congratulated ourselves all the more on our easy endurance of it had we judged only by our own sensations we should not have believed the temperature to be nearly so low the sun rose a little after ten and i have never seen anything finer than the spectacle which we then saw for the first time but which was afterwards almost daily repeated the illumination of the forests and snowfields in his level orange beams for even at midday he was not more than eight degrees above the horizon the tops of the trees only were touched still and solid as iron and covered with sparkling frostcrystals their trunks were changed to blazing gold and their foliage to a fiery orangebrown the delicate purple sprays of the birch coated with ice glittered like wands of topaz and amethyst and the slopes of virgin snow stretching towards the sun shone with the fairest saffron gleams there is nothing equal to this in the south nothing so transcendently rich dazzling and glorious italian dawns and twilights cannot surpass those we saw every day not like the former fading rapidly into the ashen hues of dusk but lingering for hour after hour with scarce a decrease of splendour strange that nature should repeat these lovely aerial effects in such widely different zones and seasons i thought to find in the winter landscapes of the far north a sublimity of death and desolation a wild dark dreary monotony of expression but i had in reality the constant enjoyment of the rarest the tenderest the most enchanting beauty the people one meets along the road harmonise with these unexpected impressions they are clear eyed and rosy as the morning straight and strong as the fir saplings in their forests and simple honest and unsophisticated beyond any class of men i have ever seen they are no milksops either under the serenity of those blue eyes and smooth fair faces burns the old berserker rage not easily kindled but terrible as the lightning when once loosed i would like to take all the young men north of sundsvall says braisted put them into kansas tell them her history and then let them act for themselves the cold in clime are cold in blood sings byron but they are only cold through superior selfcontrol and freedom from perverted passions better is the assertion of tennyson that bright and fierce and fickle is the south and dark and true and tender is the north there are tender hearts in the breasts of these northern men and women albeit they are as undemonstrative as the english or we americans for that matter it is exhilarating to see such people whose digestion is sound whose nerves are tough as whipcord whose blood runs in a strong full stream whose impulses are perfectly natural who are good without knowing it and who are happy without trying to be so where shall we find such among our restless communities at home we made two swedish miles by noon and then took a breakfast of fried reindeer meat and pancakes of which we ate enormously to keep up a good supply of fuel braisted and i consumed about a pound of butter between us shriek not young ladies at our vulgar appetites you who sip a spoonful of icecream or trifle with a diminutive meringue in company but make amends on cold ham and pickles in the pantry after you go home i shall tell the truth though it disgust you this intense cold begets a necessity for fat and with the necessity comes the taste a wise provision of nature the consciousness now dawned upon me that i might be able to relish trainoil and tallowcandles before we had done with lapland i had tough work at each station to get my head out of my wrappings which were united with my beard and hair in one solid lump the cold increased instead of diminishing and by the time we reached gumboda at dusk it was below zero here we found a company of finns travelling southward who had engaged five horses obliging us to wait a couple of hours we had already made forty miles and were satisfied with our performance so we stopped for the night when the thermometer was brought in the mercury was frozen and on unmuffling i found the end of my nose seared as if with a hot iron the inn was capital we had a warm carpeted room beds of clean lavendered linen and all civilised appliances in the evening we sat down to a christmas dinner of sausages potatoes pancakes raspberry jam and a bottle of barclay and perkins best porter in which we drank the health of all dear relatives and friends in the two hemispheres and this was in west bothnia where we had been told in stockholm that we should starve at bedtime braisted took out the thermometer again and soon brought it in with the mercury frozen below all the numbers on the scale in the morning the landlord came in and questioned us in order to satisfy his curiosity he took us for norwegians and was quite surprised to find out our real character we had also been taken for finns russians and danes since leaving stockholm i suppose you intend to buy lumber said the landlord no said i we travel merely for the pleasure of it ja sooo he exclaimed in a tone of the greatest surprise and incredulity he asked if it was necessary that we should travel in such cold weather and seemed reluctant to let us go the mercury showed below zero when we started but the sky was cloudy with a raw wind from the northwest we did not feel the same hard griping cold as the day previous but a more penetrating chill the same character of scenery continued but with a more bleak and barren aspect and the population became more scanty the cloudy sky took away what little green there was in the firtrees and they gloomed as black as styx on either side of our road the air was terribly raw and biting as it blew across the hollows and open plains i did not cover my face but kept up such a lively friction on my nose to prevent it from freezing that in the evening i found the skin quite worn away at daglцsten the third station we stopped an hour for breakfast it was a povertystricken place and we could only get some fishroes and salt meat the people were all halfidiots even to the postilion who drove us we had some daylight for the fourth station did the fifth by twilight and the sixth in darkness the cold was so keen that our postilions made good time and we reached sunnanе on the skellefteе river miles soon after six oclock here we were lodged in a large barnlike room so cold that we were obliged to put on our overcoats and sit against the stove i began to be troubled with a pain in my jaw from an unsound tooth the commencement of a martyrdom from which i suffered for many days afterwards the existence of nerves in ones teeth has always seemed to me a superfluous provision of nature and i should have been well satisfied if she had omitted them in my case the handmaiden called us soon after five oclock and brought us coffee while we were still in bed this is the general custom here in the north and is another point of contact with the south the sky was overcast with raw violent wind mercury below zero we felt the cold very keenly much more so than on christmas day the wind blew full in our teeth and penetrated even beneath our furs on setting out we crossed the skellefteе river by a wooden bridge beyond which we saw rising duskily in the uncertain twilight a beautiful dome and lantern crowning a white temple built in the form of a greek cross it was the parish church of skellefteе who could have expected to find such an edifice here on the borders of lapland the village about it contains many large and handsome houses this is one of the principal points of trade and intercourse between the coast and the interior the weather became worse as we advanced traversing the low broad hills through wastes of dark pine forests the wind cut like a sharp sword in passing the hollows and the drifting snow began to fill the tracks we were full two hours in making the ten miles to frostkage and the day seemed scarcely nearer at hand the leaden lowering sky gave out no light the forests were black and cold the snow a dusky grey such horribly dismal scenery i have rarely beheld we warmed ourselves as well as we could and started anew having for postilions two rosy boys who sang the whole way and played all sorts of mad antics with each other to keep from freezing at the next station we drank large quantities of hot milk flavored with butter sugar and cinnamon and then pushed on with another chubby hopomythumb as guide and driver the storm grew worse and worse the wind blew fiercely over the low hills loaded with particles of snow as fine as the point of a needle and as hard as crystal which struck full on our eyeballs and stung them so that we could scarcely see i had great difficulty in keeping my face from freezing and my companion found his cheek touched by the time we reached abyn it blew a hurricane and we were compelled to stop it was already dusk and our cosy little room was doubly pleasant by contrast with the wild weather outside our cheerful landlady with her fresh complexion and splendid teeth was very kind and attentive and i got on very well in conversation notwithstanding her broad dialect she was much astonished at my asking for a bucket of cold water for bathing why said she i always thought that if a person put his feet into cold water in winter he would die immediately however she supplied it and was a little surprised to find me none the worse in the morning i passed a terrible night from the pain in my face and was little comforted on rising by the assurance that much snow had fallen the mercury had risen to zero and the wind still blew although not so furiously as on the previous day we therefore determined to set out and try to reach piteе the landladys son a tall young viking with yellow locks hanging on his shoulders acted as postilion and took the lead we started at nine and found it heavy enough at first it was barely light enough to see our way and we floundered slowly along through deep drifts for a mile when we met the snowplows after which our road became easier these plows are wooden frames shaped somewhat like the bow of a ship in fact i have seen very fair clipper models among them about fifteen feet long by ten feet wide at the base and so light that if the snow is not too deep one horse can manage them the farmers along the road are obliged to turn out at six oclock in the morning whenever the snow falls or drifts and open a passage for travellers thus in spite of the rigorous winter communication is never interrupted and the snowroad at last from frequent plowing becomes the finest sleighing track in the world the wind blew so violently however that the furrows were soon filled up and even the track of the baggagesled fifty yards in advance was covered there was one hollow where the drifts of loose snow were five or six feet deep and here we were obliged to get out and struggle across sinking to our loins at every step it is astonishing how soon one becomes hardened to the cold although the mercury stood at zero with a violent storm we rode with our faces fully exposed frostbites and all and even drove with bare hands without the least discomfort but of the scenery we saw this day i can give no description there was nothing but long drifts and waves of spotless snow some dim dark spectral firtrees on either hand and beyond that a wild chaos of storm the snow came fast and blinding beating full in our teeth it was impossible to see the fine particles so stung our eyeballs that we could not look ahead my eyelashes were loaded with snow which immediately turned to ice and froze the lids together unless i kept them in constant motion the storm hummed and buzzed through the black forests we were all alone on the road or even the pious swedes would not turn out to church on such a day it was terribly sublime and desolate and i enjoyed it amazingly we kept warm although there was a crust of ice a quarter of an inch thick on our cheeks and the ice in our beards prevented us from opening our mouths at one oclock we reached the second station gefre unrecognisable by our nearest friends our eyelashes were weighed down with heavy fringes of frozen snow there were icicles an inch long hanging to the eaves of our moustaches and the handkerchiefs which wrapped our faces were frozen fast to the flesh the skin was rather improved by this treatment but it took us a great while to thaw out at gefre we got some salt meat and hot milk and then started on our long stage of fifteen miles to piteе the wind had moderated somewhat but the snow still fell fast and thick we were again blinded and frozen up more firmly than ever cheeks and all so that our eyes and lips were the only features to be seen after plunging along for more than two hours through dreary woods we came upon the estuary of the piteе river where our course was marked out by young firtrees planted in the ice the world became a blank there was snow around above and below and but for these marks a man might have driven at random until he froze for three miles or more we rode over the solid gulf and then took the woods on the opposite shore the way seemed almost endless our feet grew painfully cold our eyes smarted from the beating of the fine snow and my swollen jaw tortured me incessantly finally lights appeared ahead through the darkness but another half hour elapsed before we saw houses on both sides of us there was a street at last then a large mansion and to our great joy the skjutsbonde turned into the courtyard of an inn chapter vi journey from piteе to haparanda my jaw was so painful on reaching piteе that i tossed about in torment the whole night utterly unable to sleep the long northern night seemed as if it would never come to an end and i arose in the morning much more fatigued and exhausted than when i lay down it was below zero and the storm still blowing but the cold seemed to relieve my face a little and so we set out the roads were heavy but a little broken and still led over hills and through interminable forests of mingled fir and pine in the dark imperfect day i took but little note of the scenery but was so drowsy and overcome that braisted at last filled the long baggagesled with hay and sat at the rear so that i could lie stretched out with my head upon his lap here in spite of the cold and wind i lay in a warm stupid halfsleep it was dark when we reached ersnдs whence we had twelve miles to old luleе with tired horses heavy roads and a lazy driver i lay down again dozed as usual and tried to forget my torments so passed three hours the night had long set in with a clear sky below zero and a sharp wind blowing all at once an exclamation from braisted aroused me i opened my eyes as i lay in his lap looked upward and saw a narrow belt or scarf of silver fire stretching directly across the zenith with its loose frayed ends slowly swaying to and fro down the slopes of the sky presently it began to waver bending back and forth sometimes slowly sometimes with a quick springing motion as if testing its elasticity now it took the shape of a bow now undulated into hogarths line of beauty brightening and fading in its sinuous motion and finally formed a shepherds crook the end of which suddenly began to separate and fall off as if driven by a strong wind until the whole belt shot away in long drifting lines of fiery snow it then gathered again into a dozen dancing fragments which alternately advanced and retreated shot hither and thither against and across each other blazed out in yellow and rosy gleams or paled again playing a thousand fantastic pranks as if guided by some wild whim we lay silent with upturned faces watching this wonderful spectacle suddenly the scattered lights ran together as by a common impulse joined their bright ends twisted them through each other and fell in a broad luminous curtain straight downward through the air until its fringed hem swung apparently but a few yards over our heads this phenomenon was so unexpected and startling that for a moment i thought our faces would be touched by the skirts of the glorious auroral drapery it did not follow the spheric curve of the firmament but hung plumb from the zenith falling apparently millions of leagues through the air its folds gathered together among the stars and its embroidery of flame sweeping the earth and shedding a pale unearthly radiance over the wastes of snow a moment afterwards and it was again drawn up parted waved its flambeaux and shot its lances hither and thither advancing and retreating as before anything so strange so capricious so wonderful so gloriously beautiful i scarcely hope to see again by this time we came upon the broad luleе river and were half an hour traversing its frozen surface still watching the snow above us which gradually became fainter and less active finally we reached the opposite shore drove up a long slope through a large village of stables and past the imposing church of old luleе to the inn it was now nearly eight oclock very cold and i was thoroughly exhausted but the inn was already full of travellers and there was no place to lay our heads the landlord a sublimely indifferent swede coolly advised us to go on to persц ten miles distant i told him i had not slept for two nights but he merely shrugged his shoulders repeated his advice and offered to furnish horses at once to get us off it was a long cold dreary ride and i was in a state of semiconsciousness the whole time we reached persц about eleven found the house full of travellers but procured two small beds in a small room with another man in it and went to sleep without supper i was so thoroughly worn out that i got about three hours rest in spite of my pain we took coffee in bed at seven and started for rеnbyn on the rеneе river the day was lowering temperature below zero the country was low slightly undulating with occasional wide views to the north over the inlets of the gulf and vast wide tracts of forest the settlements were still as frequent as ever but there was little apparent cultivation except flax rеnbyn is a large village with a stately church the people were putting up booths for a fair a fair in the open air in lat n with the mercury freezing which explained the increased travel on the road we kept on to hvitе for breakfast thus getting north of the latitude of torneе thence our road turned eastward at right angles around the head of the bothnian gulf much snow had fallen but the road had been ploughed and we had a tolerable track except when passing sleds which sometimes gave us an overturn we now had uninterrupted forest scenery between the stations and such scenery it is almost impossible to paint the glory of those winter forests every tree laden with the purest snow resembles a gothic fountain of bronze covered with frozen spray through which only suggestive glimpses of its delicate tracery can be obtained from every rise we looked over thousands of such mimic fountains shooting low or high from their pavements of ivory and alabaster it was an enchanted wilderness white silent gleaming and filled with inexhaustible forms of beauty to what shall i liken those glimpses under the boughs into the depths of the forest where the snow destroyed all perspective and brought the remotest fairy nooks and coverts too lovely and fragile to seem cold into the glittering foreground wonderful glorious i could only exclaim in breathless admiration once by the roadside we saw an arctic ptarmigan as white as the snow with ruby eyes that sparkled like jewels as he moved slowly and silently along not frightened in the least the sun set a little after one oclock and we pushed on to reach the kalix river the same evening at the last station we got a boy postilion and two lazy horses and were three hours and a half on the road with a temperature of below zero my feet became like ice which increased the pain in my face and i began to feel faint and sick with so much suffering and loss of rest the boy aggravated us so much by his laziness that braisted ran ahead and cuffed his ears after which he made better speed after a drive through interminable woods we came upon the banks of the kalix which were steep and fringed with splendid firs then came the village of mеnsbyn where thank heaven we got something to eat a warm room and a bed while we were at supper two travellers arrived one of whom a wellmade richlydressed young fellow was ushered into our room he was a brukpatron ironmaster so the servant informed us and from his superfine broadcloth rings and the immense anchorchain which attached him to his watch appeared to be doing a thriving business he had the norse bloom on his face a dignified nose and english whiskers flanking his smoothlyshaven chin his air was flushed and happy he was not exactly drunk but comfortably within that gay and cheerful vestibule beyond which lies the chamber of horrors he listened to our conversation for some time and finally addressed me in imperfect english this led to mutual communications and a declaration of our character and object in travel nothing of which would he believe nobody can possibly come here for pleasure said he i know better you have a secret political mission our amusement at this only strengthened him in his suspicions nevertheless he called for a bottle of port wine which when it came turned out to be bad malaga and insisted on drinking a welcome you are in latitude north said he on the kalix where no american has ever been before and i shall call my friend to give a skеl to your country we have been to the church where my friend is stationed with that he went out and soon returned with a short stout broad faced largeheaded man of forty or thereabouts his manner was perfectly wellbred and selfpossessed and i took him to be a clergyman especially as the ironmaster addressed him as brother horton now said he welcome to north and prosperity to free america are you for buchanan or fremont brother horton kept a watchful eye upon his young friend but cheerfully joined in the sentiment i gave in return skеl to sweden and the swedish people and hoped to get rid of our jolly acquaintance but he was not to be shaken off you dont know me he said and i dont know you but you are something more than you seem to be you are a political character just then braisted came in with the thermometer and announced of cold reaumur thousand devils exclaimed brother horton and now i was convinced that he was not a clergyman what a thermometer how cold it makes the weather would you part with it if i were to give you money in return i declined stating that it was impossible for us to procure so cold a thermometer in the north and we wanted to have as low a temperature as could be obtained this seemed to puzzle the ironmaster who studied awhile upon it and then returned to the subject of my political mission i suppose you speak french said he it is necessary in diplomacy i can speak it also which he began to do in a bungling way i answered in the same language but he soon gave up the attempt and tried german i changed also and finding that he had exhausted his philology of which he was rather proud especially as brother horton knew nothing but swedish determined to have a little fun of course you know italian said i it is more musical than german and forthwith addressed him in that language he reluctantly confessed his ignorance oh well i continued spanish is equally agreeable to me and took up that tongue before he could reply his face grew more and more blank and bewildered the oriental languages are doubtless familiar to you i persisted i have had no practice in arabic for some time and overwhelmed him with egyptian salutations i then tried him with hindustanee which exhausted my stock but concluded by giving him the choice of malay tartar or thibetan come come said brother horton taking his arm as he stood staring and perplexed the horses are ready with some difficulty he was persuaded to leave after shaking hands with us and exclaiming many times you are a very seldom man when we awoke the temperature had risen to above zero with a tremendous snowstorm blowing as we were preparing to set out a covered sled drove in from the north with two swedish naval officers whose vessel had been frozen in at cronstadt and who had been obliged to return home through finland up the eastern coast of the bothnian gulf the captain who spoke excellent english informed me that they were in about the same latitude as we on christmas day on the opposite side of the gulf and had experienced the same degree of cold both of them had their noses severely frozen we were two hours and a half in travelling to the first station seven miles as the snow was falling in blinding quantities and the road was not yet ploughed out all the pedestrians we met were on runners but even with their snow skates five feet long they sank deep enough to make their progress very slow and toilsome by the time we reached nдsby my face was very much swollen and inflamed and as it was impossible to make the next stage by daylight we wisely determined to stop there the wind blew a hurricane the hard snowcrystals lashed the windows and made a gray chaos of all outofdoors but we had a warm cosy carpeted room within a capital dinner in the afternoon and a bottle of genuine london porter with our evening pipe so we passed the last day of a d grateful to god for all the blessings which the year had brought us and for the comfort and shelter we enjoyed in that polar wilderness of storm and snow on new years morning it blew less and the temperature was comparatively mild so although the road was very heavy we started again nдsby is the last swedish station the finnish frontier which is an abrupt separation of races and tongues being at the northwestern corner of the bothnian gulf in spite of the constant intercourse which now exists between norrland and the narrow strip of finnish soil which remains to sweden there has been no perceptible assimilation of the two races at nдsby all is pure swedish at sдngis twelve miles distant everything is finnish the blue eyes and fair hair the lengthened oval of the face and slim straight form disappear you see instead square faces dark eyes low foreheads and something of an oriental fire and warmth in the movements the language is totally dissimilar and even the costume though of the same general fashion presents many noticeable points of difference the women wear handkerchiefs of some bright color bound over the forehead and under the chin very similar to those worn by the armenian women in asia minor on first coming among them the finns impressed me as a less frank and open hearted but more original and picturesque race than the swedes it is exceedingly curious and interesting to find such a flavour of the orient on the borders of the frigid zone the roads were very bad and our drivers and horses provokingly slow but we determined to push on to haparanda the same night i needed rest and medical aid my jaw by this time being so swollen that i had great difficulty in eating a state of things which threatened to diminish my supply of fuel and render me sensitive to the cold we reached nickala the last station at seven oclock beyond this the road was frightfully deep in places we could scarcely make any headway and were frequently overturned headlong into the drifts the driver was a finn who did not understand a word of swedish and all our urging was of no avail we went on and on in the moonlight over arms of the gulf through forests and then over ice again a flat monotonous country with the same dull features repeated again and again at halfpast nine a large white church announced our approach to haparanda and soon afterwards we drove up to the inn which was full of newyear carousers the landlord gave us quarters in the same room with an old norrlander who was very drunk and annoyed us not a little until we got into bed and pretended to sleep it was pretence nearly the whole night on my part for my torture was still kept up the next morning i called upon dr wretholm the physician of the place not without some misgivings but his prescription of a poultice of mallow leaves a sudorific and an opiate restored my confidence and i cheerfully resigned myself to a rest of two or three days before proceeding further northward chapter vii crossing the arctic circle i was obliged to remain three days in haparanda applying poultices gargles and liniments according to the doctors instructions as my swedish was scarcely sufficient for the comprehension of prescriptions or medical technicalities in general a written programme of my treatment was furnished to fredrika the servantmaid who was properly impressed with the responsibility thereby devolving upon her fredrika no doubt thought that my life was in her hands and nothing could exceed the energy with which she undertook its preservation punctually to the minute appeared the prescribed application and if she perceived or suspected any dereliction on my part it was sure to be reported to the doctor at his next visit i had the taste of camomile and mallows in my mouth from morning till night the skin of my jaw blistered under the scorching of ammonia but the final result was that i was cured as the doctor and fredrika had determined this goodhearted girl was a genuine specimen of the northern swedish female of medium height plump but not stout with a rather slender waist and expansive hips and a foot which stepped firmly and nimbly at the same time she was as cheerful a body as one could wish to see her hair was of that silky blonde so common in sweden her eyes a clear pale blue her nose straight and well formed her cheeks of the delicate pink of a wildrose leaf and her teeth so white regular and perfect that i am sure they would make her fortune in america always cheerful kind and active she had nevertheless a hard life of it she was alike cook chambermaid and hostler and had a cross mistress to boot she made our fires in the morning darkness and brought us our early coffee while we yet lay in bed in accordance with the luxurious habits of the arctic zone then until the last drunken guest was silent towards midnight there was no respite from labour although suffering from a distressing cough she had the outdoor as well as the indoor duties to discharge and we saw her in a sheepskin jacket harnessing horses in a temperature below zero the reward of such a service was possibly about eight american dollars a year when on leaving i gave her about as much as one of our hotel servants would expect for answering a question the poor girl was overwhelmed with gratitude and even the stern landlady was so impressed by my generosity that she insisted on lending us a sheepskin for our feet saying we were good men there is something exceedingly primitive and unsophisticated in the manners of these northern people a straightforward honesty which takes the honesty of others for granted a latent kindness and goodwill which may at first be overlooked because it is not demonstrative and a total unconsciousness of what is called in highly civilised circles propriety the very freedom of manners which in some countries might denote laxity of morals is here the evident stamp of their purity the thought has often recurred to me which is the most truly pure and virginal nature the fastidious american girl who blushes at the sight of a pair of boots outside a gentlemans bedroom door and who requires that certain unoffending parts of the body and articles of clothing should be designated by delicately circumlocutious terms or the simpleminded swedish women who come into our bedrooms with coffee and make our fires while we get up and dress coming and going during all the various stages of the toilet with the frankest unconsciousness of impropriety this is modesty in its healthy and natural development not in those morbid forms which suggest an imagination ever on the alert for prurient images nothing has confirmed my impression of the virtue of the northern swedes more than this fact and i have rarely felt more respect for woman or more faith in the inherent purity of her nature we had snug quarters in haparanda and our detention was therefore by no means irksome a large room carpeted protected from the outer cold by double windows and heated by an immense russian stove was allotted to us we had two beds one of which became a broad sofa during the day a backgammon table the ordinary appliances for washing and besides a number of engravings on the walls our window commanded a full view of torneе and the icetrack across the river where hundreds of persons daily passed to and fro the eastern window showed us the arctic dawn growing and brightening through its wonderful gradations of color for four hours when the pale orange sun appeared above the distant houses to slide along their roofs for two hours and then dip again we had plentiful meals consisting mostly of reindeer meat with a sauce of swedish cranberries potatoes which had been frozen but were still palatable salmon roes soft bread in addition to the black shingles of fladbrцd english porter and excellent umeе beer in fact in no country inn of the united states could we have been more comfortable for the best which the place afforded during four days with a small provision for the journey we paid about seven dollars the day before our departure i endeavored to obtain some information concerning the road to lapland but was disappointed the landlord ascertained that there were skjuts or relays of posthorses as far as muonioniska english miles but beyond this i could only learn that the people were all finnish spoke no swedish were miserably poor and could give us nothing to eat i was told that a certain official personage at the apothecarys shop spoke german and hastened thither but the official a darkeyed olivefaced finn could not understand my first question the people even seemed entirely ignorant of the geography of the country beyond upper torneе or matarengi forty miles off the doctors wife a buxom motherly lady who seemed to feel quite an interest in our undertaking and was as kind and obliging as such women always are procured for us a supply of fladbrцd made of rye and delightfully crisp and hard and this was the substance of our preparations reindeer mittens were not to be found nor a reindeer skin to cover our feet so we relied as before on plenty of hay and my scotch plaid we might perhaps have had better success in torneе but i knew no one there who would be likely to assist us and we did not even visit the old place we had taken the precaution of getting the russian visй together with a small stock of roubles at stockholm but found that it was quite unnecessary no passport is required for entering torneе or travelling on the russian side of the frontier trusting to luck which is about the best plan after all we started from haparanda at noon on the th of january the day was magnificent the sky cloudless and resplendent as polished steel and the mercury below zero the sun scarcely more than the breadth of his disc above the horizon shed a faint orange light over the broad level snowplains and the bluishwhite hemisphere of the bothnian gulf visible beyond torneе the air was perfectly still and exquisitely cold and bracing despite the sharp grip it took upon my nose and ears these arctic days short as they are have a majesty of their own a splendor subdued though it be a breadth and permanence of hue imparted alike to the sky and to the snowy earth as if tinted glass was held before your eyes i find myself at a loss how to describe these effects or the impression they produce upon the travellers mood certainly it is the very reverse of that depression which accompanies the polar night and which even the absence of any real daylight might be considered sufficient to produce our road was well beaten but narrow and we had great difficulty in passing the many hay and wood teams which met us on account of the depth of the loose snow on either side we had several violent overturns at such times one of which occasioned us the loss of our beloved pipe a loss which rendered braisted disconsolate for the rest of the day we had but one between us and the bereavement was not slight soon after leaving haparanda we passed a small white obelisk with the words russian frontier upon it the town of torneе across the frozen river looked really imposing with the sharp roof and tall spire of its old church rising above the line of low red buildings campbell i remember says cold as the rocks on torneos hoary brow with the same disregard of geography which makes him grow palm trees along the susquehanna river there was torneе but i looked in vain for the hoary brow not a hill within sight nor a rock within a circuit of ten miles but one unvarying level like the western shore of the adriatic formed by the deposits of the rivers and the retrocession of the sea our road led up the left bank of the river both sides of which were studded with neat little villages the country was well cleared and cultivated and appeared so populous and flourishing that i could scarcely realise in what part of the world we were the sun set at a quarter past one but for two hours the whole southern heaven was superb in its hues of rose and orange the sheepskin lent us by our landlady kept our feet warm and we only felt the cold in our faces my nose especially which having lost a coat of skin was very fresh and tender requiring unusual care at three oclock when we reached kuckula the first station the northern sky was one broad flush of the purest violet melting into lilac at the zenith where it met the fiery skirts of sunset we refreshed ourselves with hot milk and pushed ahead with better horses at four oclock it was bright moonlight with the stillest air we got on bravely over the level beaten road and in two hours reached korpikylд a large new inn where we found very tolerable accommodations our beds were heaps of reindeer skins a frightfully ugly finnish girl who knew a few words of swedish prepared us a supper of tough meat potatoes and ale everything was now pure finnish and the first question of the girl hvarifrеn kommar du where dost thou come from showed an ignorance of the commonest swedish form of address she awoke us with a cup of coffee in the morning and negotiated for us the purchase of a reindeer skin which we procured for something less than a dollar the husbonde housepeasant as the landlord is called here made no charge for our entertainment but said we might give what we pleased i offered at a venture a sum equal to about fifty cents whereupon he sent the girl to say that he thanked us most heartily the next day was a day to be remembered such a glory of twilight splendors for six full hours was beyond all the charms of daylight in any zone we started at seven with a temperature of below zero still keeping up the left bank of the torneе the country now rose into bold hills and the features of the scenery became broad and majestic the northern sky was again pure violet and a pale red tinge from the dawn rested on the tops of the snowy hills the prevailing color of the sky slowly brightened into lilac then into pink then rose color which again gave way to a flood of splendid orange when the sun appeared every change of color affected the tone of the landscape the woods so wrapped in snow that not a single green needle was to be seen took by turns the hues of the sky and seemed to give out rather than to reflect the opalescent lustre of the morning the sunshine brightened instead of dispelling these effects at noon the suns disc was not more than above the horizon throwing a level golden light on the hills the north before us was as blue as the mediterranean and the vault of heaven overhead canopied us with pink every object was glorified and transfigured in the magic glow at the first station we got some hot milk with raw salmon shingle bread and frozen butter our horses were good and we drove merrily along up the frozen torneе the roads were filled with people going to church probably to celebrate some religious anniversary fresh ruddy faces had they firm features strong frames and resolute carriage but the most of them were positively ugly and by contrast with the frank swedes their expression was furtive and sinister near pдckilд we passed a fine old church of red brick with a very handsome belfry at niemis we changed horses in ten minutes and hastened on up the bed of the torneе to matarengi where we should reach the arctic circle the hills rose higher with fine sweeping outlines and the river was still half a mile broad a plain of solid snow with the track marked out by bushes we kept a sharp lookout for the mountain of avasaxa one of the stations of celsius maupertius and the french academicians who came here in to make observations determining the exact form of the earth through this mountain it is said the arctic circle passes though our maps were neither sufficiently minute nor correct to determine the point we took it for granted however as a mile one way or the other could make but little difference and as matarengi lies due west of avasaxa across the river we decided to stop there and take dinner on the arctic circle the increase of villages on both banks with the appearance of a large church denoted our approach to matarengi and we saw at once that the tall gentlyrounded isolated hill opposite now blazing with golden snow could be none other than avasaxa here we were at last entering the arctic zone in the dead of winter the realization of a dream which had often flashed across my mind when lounging under the tropical palms so natural is it for one extreme to suggest the opposite i took our bearings with a compassring as we drove forward and as the summit of avasaxa bore due east we both gave a shout which startled our postilion and notably quickened the gait of our horses it was impossible to toss our caps for they were not only tied upon our heads but frozen fast to our beards so here we were at last in the true dominions of winter a mild ruler he had been to us thus far but he proved a despot before we were done with him soon afterwards we drove into the inn at matarengi which was full of country people who had come to attend church the landlord a sallow wateryeyed finn who knew a few words of swedish gave us a room in an adjoining house and furnished a dinner of boiled fish and barley mush to which was added a bottle labelled dry madeira brought from haparanda for the occasion at a shop adjoining braisted found a serviceable pipe so that nothing was wanting to complete our jubilee we swallowed the memory of all who were dear to us in the dubious beverage inaugurated our arctic pipe which we proposed to take home as a souvenir of the place and set forward in the most cheery mood our road now crossed the river and kept up the russian side to a place with the charming name of torakankorwa the afternoon twilight was even more wonderful than that of the forenoon there were broad bands of purple pure crimson and intense yellow all fusing together into fiery orange at the south while the north became a semivault of pink then lilac and then the softest violet the dazzling arctic hills participated in this play of colors which did not fade as in the south but stayed and stayed as if god wished to compensate by this twilight glory for the loss of the day nothing in italy nothing in the tropics equals the magnificence of the polar skies the twilight gave place to a moonlight scarcely less brilliant our road was hardly broken leading through deep snow sometimes on the river sometimes through close little glens hedged in with firs drooping with snow fairy arctic solitudes white silent and mysterious by seven oclock we reached a station called juoxengi the place was wholly finnish and the landlord who did not understand a word of swedish endeavoured to make us go on to the next station we pointed to the beds and quietly carried in our baggage i made the usual signs for eating which speedily procured us a pail of sour milk bread and butter and two immense tin drinking horns of sweet milk the people seemed a little afraid of us and kept away our postilion was a silly fellow who could not understand whether his money was correct in the course of our stenographic conversation i learned that cax signified two when i gave him his drinkmoney he said ketox and on going out the door hьweste so that i at least discovered the finnish for thank you and goodbye this however was not sufficient to order horses the next morning we were likewise in a state of delightful uncertainty as to our future progress but this very uncertainty gave a zest to our situation and it would have been difficult to find two jollier men with frozen noses chapter viii adventures among the finns we drank so much milk for want of more solid food at juoxengi that in spite of sound sleep under our sheepskin blankets we both awoke with headaches in the morning the finnish landlord gave me to understand by holding up his forefinger and pronouncing the word ьx that i was to pay one rigsdaler about cents for our entertainment and was overcome with grateful surprise when i added a trifle more we got underway by six oclock when the night was just at its darkest and it was next to impossible to discern any track on the spotless snow trusting to good luck to escape overturning we followed in the wake of the skjutsbonde who had mounted our baggage sled upon one of the country sledges and rode perched upon his lofty seat our horses were tolerable but we had eighteen miles to pello the next station which we reached about ten oclock our road was mostly upon the torneе river sometimes taking to the woods on either side to cut off bends the morn was hours in dawning with the same splendid transitions of colour the forests were indescribable in their silence whiteness and wonderful variety of snowy adornment the weeping birches leaned over the road and formed white fringed arches the firs wore mantles of ermine and ruffs and tippets of the softest swans down snow wind and frost had worked the most marvellous transformations in the forms of the forest here were kneeling nuns with their arms hanging listlessly by their sides and the white cowls falling over their faces there lay a warriors helmet lace curtains torn and ragged hung from the points of little gothic spires caverns lined with sparry incrustations silver palmleaves doors loopholes arches and arcades were thrown together in a fantastic confusion and mingled with the more decided forms of the larger trees which even were trees but in form so completely were they wrapped in their dazzling disguise it was an enchanted land where you hardly dared to breathe lest a breath might break the spell there was still little change in the features of the country except that it became wilder and more rugged and the settlements poorer and further apart there were low hills on either side wildernesses of birch and fir and floors of level snow over the rivers and marshes on approaching pello we saw our first reindeer standing beside a hut he was a large handsome animal his master who wore a fur dress we of course set down for a lapp at the inn a skinny old hag who knew a dozen words of swedish got us some bread milk and raw frozen salmon which with the aid of a great deal of butter sufficed us for a meal our next stage was to kardis sixteen miles which we made in four hours while in the midst of a forest on the swedish side we fell in with a herd of reindeer attended by halfadozen lapps they came tramping along through the snow about fifty in number including a dozen which ran loose the others were harnessed to pulks the canoeshaped reindeer sledges many of which were filled with stores and baggage the lapps were rather goodlooking young fellows with a bright coppery orange complexion and were by no means so illfavoured short and stunted as i had imagined one of them was indeed really handsome with his laughing eyes sparkling teeth and a slender black moustache we were obliged to wait a quarterofanhour while the herd passed and then took to the river again the effect of sunset on the snow was marvellous the spotless mounds and drifts far and near being stained with soft rose colour until they resembled nothing so much as heaps of strawberry ice at kardis the people sent for an interpreter who was a young man entirely blind he helped us to get our horses although we were detained an hour as only one horse is kept in readiness at these stations and the neighbourhood must be scoured to procure another i employed the time in learning a few finnish words the whole travellingstock in fact on which i made the journey to muonioniska that the reader may see how few words of a strange language will enable him to travel as well as to give a sample of finnish i

afternoon moonlight the horses were slow so were the two skjutsbonder to whom i cried in vain ayт perli braisted with difficulty restrained his inclination to cuff their ears hour after hour went by and we grew more and more hungry wrathful and impatient about eight oclock they stopped below a house on the russian side pitched some hay to the horses climbed the bank and summoned us to follow we made our way with some difficulty through the snow and entered the hut which proved to be the abode of a cooper at least the occupant a rough shaggy dirty orson of a fellow was seated upon the floor making a tub by the light of the fire the joists overhead were piled with seasoned wood and long bundles of thin dry fir which is used for torches during the winter darkness there was neither chair nor table in the hut but a low bench ran around the walls and a rough bedstead was built against one corner two buckets of sour milk with a wooden ladle stood beside the door this beverage appears to be generally used by the finns for quenching thirst instead of water our postilions were sitting silently upon the bench and we followed their example lit our pipes and puffed away while the cooper after the first glance went on with his work and the other members of his family clustered together in the dusky corner behind the fireplace were equally silent half an hour passed and the spirit moved no one to open his mouth i judged at last that the horses had been baited sufficiently silently showed my watch to the postilions who with ourselves got up and went away without a word having been said to mar the quaint drollery of the incident while at haparanda we had been recommended to stop at kingis bruk at the junction of the torneе and muonio there we were told you can get everything you want there is a fine house good beds and plenty to eat and drink our blind interpreter at kardis repeated this advice dont go on to kexisvara the next station said he stop at kengis where everything is good toward kengis then this oasis in the arctic desolation our souls yearned we drove on until ten oclock in the brilliant moonlight and mild delicious air for the temperature had actually risen to above zero before a break in the hills announced the junction of the two rivers there was a large house on the top of a hill on our left and to our great joy the postilions drove directly up to it is this kengis i asked but their answers i could not understand and they had already unharnessed their horses there was a light in the house and we caught a glimpse of a womans face at the window as we drove up but the light was immediately extinguished and everything became silent i knocked at the door which was partly open but no one came i then pushed a heavy log of wood which was leaning against it from the inside fell with a noise which reverberated through the house i waited awhile and then groping my way along a passage to the door of the room which had been lighted knocked loudly after a little delay the door was opened by a young man who ushered me into a warm comfortable room and then quietly stared at me as if to ask what i wanted we are travellers and strangers said i and wish to stop for the night this is not an inn he answered it is the residence of the patron of the iron works i may here remark that it is the general custom in sweden in remote districts for travellers to call without ceremony upon the parson magistrate or any other prominent man in a village and claim his hospitality in spite of this doubtful reception considering that our horses were already stabled and the station three or four miles further i remarked again but perhaps we may be allowed to remain here until morning i will ask he replied left the room and soon returned with an affirmative answer we had a large handsomely furnished room with a sofa and curtained bed into which we tumbled as soon as the servantgirl in compliance with a hint of mine had brought up some bread milk and cheese we had a cup of coffee in the morning and were preparing to leave when the patron appeared he was a short stout intelligent swede who greeted us courteously and after a little conversation urged us to stay until after breakfast we were too hungry to need much persuasion and indeed the table set with tjдde or capercailie one of the finest game birds in the world potatoes cranberries and whipped cream accompanied with excellent umeе ale and concluded with coffee surpassed anything we had sat down to for many a day the patron gave me considerable information about the country and quieted a little anxiety i was beginning to feel by assuring me that we should find posthorses all the way to muonioniska still ninetyfive miles distant he informed me that we had already got beyond the daylight as the sun had not yet risen at kengis this however was in consequence of a hill to the southward as we afterwards found that the sun was again above the horizon we laid in fuel enough to last us through the day and then took leave of our host who invited us to visit him on our return crossing the torneе an hours drive over the hills brought us to the village of kexisvara where we were obliged to wait some time for our horses at the inn there was a well forty feet deep with the longest sweeppole i ever saw the landlady and her two sisters were pleasant bodies and sociably inclined if we could have talked to them they were all spinning tow their wheels purring like pleased lionesses the suns disc came in sight at a quarter past eleven and at noon his lower limb just touched the horizon the sky was of a splendid saffron hue which changed into a burning brassy yellow our horses promised little for speed when we set out and their harness being ill adapted to our sleds increased the difficulty instead of hames there were wide wooden yokes the ends of which passed through mortices in the ends of the shafts and were fastened with pins while as there was no bellybands the yokes rose on going down hill bringing our sleds upon the horses heels the finnish sleds have excessively long shafts in order to prevent this our road all day was upon the muonio river the main branch of the torneе and the boundary between sweden and russia above the junction there had been a violent wind during the night and the track was completely filled up the torneе and muonio are both very swift rivers abounding in dangerous rapids but during the winter rapids and all they are solid as granite from their sources to the bothnian gulf we plunged along slowly hour after hour more than half the time clinging to one side or the other to prevent our sled from overturning and yet it upset at least a dozen times during the day the scenery was without change low black fir forests on either hand with the decorative snow blown off them no villages or signs of life except the deserted huts of the woodcutters nor did we meet but one sled during the whole day here and there on the banks were sharp canoelike boats twenty or thirty feet long turned bottom upward the sky was overcast shutting out the glorious coloring of the past days the sun set before one oclock and the dull twilight deepened apace into night nothing could be more cheerless and dismal we smoked and talked a little with much silence between and i began to think that one more such day would disgust me with the arctic zone it was four oclock and our horses were beginning to stagger when we reached a little village called jokijalka on the russian side the postilion stopped at a house or rather a quadrangle of huts which he made me comprehend was an inn adding that it was polаn and belikor a fearfully unintelligible distance to the next one we entered and found promise enough in the thin sallow sandyhaired and most obsequious landlord and a whole herd of rosy children to decide us to stop we were ushered into the milkroom which was warm and carpeted and had a single narrow bed i employed my vocabulary with good effect the quickwitted children helping me out and in due time we got a supper of fried mutton bread butter and hot milk the children came in every few minutes to stare at our writing an operation which they probably never saw before they would stand in silent curiosity for half an hour at a time then suddenly rush out and enjoy a relief of shouts and laughter on the outside since leaving matarengi we had been regarded at all the stations with much wonder not always unmixed with mistrust whether this was simply a manifestation of the dislike which the finns have for the swedes for whom they probably took us or of other suspicions on their part we could not decide after a time one of the neighbors who had been sent for on account of his knowing a very few words of swedish was ushered into the room through him i ordered horses and ascertained that the next station kihlangi was three and a half swedish miles distant but there was a place on the russian side one mile off where we could change horses we had finished writing and were sitting by the stove consulting how we should arrange the bed so as to avoid contact with the dirty coverlet when the man returned and told us we must go into another house we crossed the yard to the opposite building where to our great surprise we were ushered into a warm room with two good beds which had clean though coarse sheets a table lookingglass and a bit of carpet on the floor the whole male household congregated to see us take possession and ascertain whether our wants were supplied i slept luxuriously until awakened by the sound of our landlord bringing in wood to light the fire he no sooner saw that my eyes were open than he snatched off his cap and threw it upon the floor moving about with as much awe and silence as if it were the emperors bedroom his daughter brought us excellent coffee betimes we washed our faces with our tumblers of drinking water and got under way by halfpast six the temperature had changed again in the night being below zero but the sky was clear and the morning moonlight superb by this time we were so far north that the moon did not set at all but wheeled around the sky sinking to within eight degrees of the horizon at noonday our road led across the river past the church of kolare and through a stretch of the swedish forests back to the river again to our great surprise the wind had not blown here the snow still hung heavy on the trees and the road was well beaten at the russian posthouse we found only a woman with the usual troop of children the eldest of whom a boy of sixteen was splitting fir to make torches i called out hevorste horses to which he made a deliberate answer and went on with his work after some consultation with the old woman a younger boy was sent off somewhere and we sat down to await the result i called for meat milk bread and butter which procured us in course of time a pitcher of cold milk some bread made of ground barley straw horribly hard and tough and a lump of sour frozen butter there was some putrid fish in a wooden bowl on which the family had breakfasted while an immense pot of sour milk butter broken bread and straw meal hanging over the fire contained their dinner this was testimony enough to the accounts we had heard in stockholm of the years famine in finland and we seemed likely to participate in it i chewed the straw bread vigorously for an hour and succeeded in swallowing enough to fill my stomach though not enough to satisfy my hunger the younger children occupied themselves in peeling off the soft inner bark of the fir which they ate ravenously they were handsome fairskinned youngsters but not so rosy and beautiful as those of the norrland swedes we were obliged to wait more than two hours before the horses arrived thus losing a large part of our daylight the postilions fastened our sleds behind their own large sledges with flat runners which got through the snow more easily than ours we lay down in the sledge stretched ourselves at full length upon a bed of hay covered our feet with the deerskin and set off we had gone about a swedish mile when the postilions stopped to feed the horses before a house on the russian side there was nobody within but some coals among the ashes on the hearth showed that it had been used apparently as a place of rest and shelter a tall powerful finn who was travelling alone was there smoking his pipe we all sat down and did likewise in the bare dark hut there were the three finns in complete dresses of reindeer skin and ourselves swaddled from head to foot with only a small segment of scarlet face visible between our frosted furs and icy beards it was a true arctic picture as seen by the pale dawn which glimmered on the wastes of snow outside we had a poor horse which soon showed signs of breaking down especially when we again entered a belt of country where the wind had blown the trees were clear and the track filled up at halfpast eleven we saw the light of the sun on the tops of the hills and at noon about half his disc was visible the cold was intense my hands became so stiff and benumbed that i had great difficulty in preventing them from freezing and my companions feet almost lost all feeling it was well for us that we were frequently obliged to walk to aid the horse the country was a wilderness of mournful and dismal scenery low hills and woods stripped bare of snow the dark firs hung with black crapelike moss alternating with morasses our finnish postilions were pleasant cheerful fellows who insisted on our riding when there was the least prospect of a road near a solitary hut the only one on the road we met a man driving a reindeer after this we lost all signs of our way except the almost obliterated track of his pulk the snow was deeper than ever and our horses were ready to drop at every step we had been five hours on the road the driver said kihlangi was ьx verst distant and at three finally we arrived we appreciated rather better what we had endured when we found that the temperature was below zero i at once ordered horses and a strapping young fellow was sent off in a bad humor to get them we found it impossible however to procure milk or anything to eat and as the cold was not to be borne else we were obliged to resort to a bottle of cognac and our haparanda bread the old woman sat by the fire smoking and gave not the least attention to our demands i paid our postilions in norwegian orts which they laid upon a chair and counted with the assistance of the whole family after the reckoning was finished they asked me what the value of each piece was which gave rise to a second general computation there was apparently more than they had expected for they both made me a formal address of thanks and took my hand seeing that i had produced a good effect i repeated my demand for milk the old woman refused but the men interfered in my behalf she went out and presently returned with a bowl full which she heated for us by this time our horses had arrived and one of our new postilions prepared himself for the journey by stripping to the loins and putting on a clean shirt he was splendidly built with clean firm muscle a white glossy skin and no superfluity of flesh he then donned a reindeer of pцsk leggings and boots and we started again it was nearly five oclock and superb moonlight this time they mounted our sleds upon their own sledges so that we rode much higher than usual our way lay up the muonio river the track was entirely snowed up and we had to break a new one guided by the firtrees stuck in the ice the snow was full three feet deep and whenever the sledge got a little off the old road the runners cut in so that we could scarcely move the milk and cognac had warmed us tolerably and we did not suffer much from the intense cold my nose however had been rubbed raw and i was obliged to tie a handkerchief across my face to protect it while journeying along in this way the sledge suddenly tilted over and we were flung head foremost into the snow our drivers righted the sledge we shook ourselves and got in again but had not gone ten yards before the same thing happened again this was no joke on such a night but we took it goodhumouredly to the relief of the finns who seemed to expect a scolding very soon we went over a third time and then a fourth after which they kept near us and held on when there was any danger i became very drowsy and struggled with all my force to keep awake for sleeping was too hazardous braisted kept his senses about him by singing for our encouragement the mariners hymn fear not but trust in providence wherever thou mayst be thus hour after hour passed away fortunately we had good strong horses which walked fast and steadily the scenery was always the same low wooded hills on either side of the winding snowy plain of the river we had made up our minds not to reach parkajoki before midnight but at halfpast ten our track left the river mounted the swedish bank and very soon brought us to a quadrangle of low huts having the appearance of an inn i could scarcely believe my eyes when we stopped before the door is this parkajoki i asked ja answered the postilion braisted and i sprang out instantly hugged each other in delight and rushed into the warm inn the thermometer still showed and we prided ourselves a little on having travelled for seventeen hours in such a cold with so little food to keep up our animal heat the landlord a young man with a bristly beard of three weeks growth showed us into the milk room where there was a bed of reindeer skins his wife brought us some fresh hay a quilt and a sheepskin coverlet and we soon forgot both our hunger and our frozen blood in the morning coffee was brought to us and as nothing else was to be had we drank four cups apiece the landlord asked half a rigs cents for our entertainment and was overcome with gratitude when i gave him double the sum we had the same sledges as the previous night but new postilions and excellent horses the temperature had risen to below zero with a cloudy sky and a light snow falling we got off at eight oclock found a track partly broken and went on at a merry trot up the river we took sometimes one bank and sometimes the other until after passing the rapid of eyanpaika which was frozen solid although large masses of transparent ice lay piled like rocks on either side we kept the swedish bank we were in excellent spirits in the hope of reaching muonioniska before dark but the steady trot of our horses brought us out of the woods by noon and we saw before us the long scattering village a mile or two distant across the river to our left on a gentle slope stood a red twostory building surrounded by outhouses with a few humbler habitations in its vicinity this was muoniovara on the swedish side the end of our finnish journey chapter ix life in lapland as we drove up to the red twostory house a short man with dark whiskers and a commercial air came forward to meet us i accosted him in swedish asking him whether the house was an inn he replied in the negative adding that the only inn was in muonioniska on the russian side a mile or more distant i then asked for the residence of mr wolley the english naturalist whose name had been mentioned to me by prof retzius and the botanist hartman he thereupon called to some one across the court and presently appeared a tall slender man dressed in the universal gray suit which travelling englishmen wear from the equator to the poles he came up with extended hand on hearing his own language a few words sufficed for explanation and he devoted himself to our interests with the cordiality of an old acquaintance he lived with the swede herr forstrцm who was the merchant of the place but the wife of the latter had just been confined and there was no room in his house mr wolley proposed at first to send to the inn in muonioniska and engage a room but afterwards arranged with a norsk carpenter who lived on the hill above to give us quarters in his house so that we might be near enough to take our meals together nothing could have suited us better we took possession at once and then descended the hill to a dinner i had ventured to hint at our famished condition of capercailie cranberries soft bread whipped cream and a glass of genuine port warmed and comforted by such luxurious fare we climbed the hill to the carpenters house in the dreary arctic twilight in the most cheerful and contented frame of mind was this indeed lapland did we indeed stand already in the dark heart of the polar winter yes there was no doubt of it the imagination could scarcely conceive a more desolate picture than that upon which we gazed the plain of sombre snow beyond which the black huts of the village were faintly discernible the stunted woods and bleak hills which night and the raw snow clouds had half obscured and yonder furclad figure gliding silently along beside his reindeer yet even here where man seemed to have settled out of pure spite against nature were comfort and hospitality and kindness we entered the carpenters house lit our candles and pipes and sat down to enjoy at ease the unusual feeling of shelter and of home the building was of squared firlogs with black moss stuffed in the crevices making it very warm and substantial our room contained a loom two tables two beds with linen of voluptuous softness and cleanness an iron stove the first we had seen in sweden and the usual washing apparatus besides a piece of carpet on the floor what more could any man desire the carpenter herr knoblock spoke some german his son ludwig mr wolleys servant also looked after our needs and the daughter a fair blooming girl of about nineteen brought us coffee before we were out of bed and kept our fire in order why lapland was a very sybaris in comparison with what i had expected mr wolley proposed to us another luxury in the shape of a vapourbath as herr forstrцm had one of those bathinghouses which are universal in finland it was a little wooden building without windows a finnish servantgirl who had been for some time engaged in getting it in readiness opened the door for us the interior was very hot and moist like an oriental bathinghall in the centre was a pile of hot stones covered with birch boughs the leaves of which gave out an agreeable smell and a large tub of water the floor was strewn with straw and under the roof was a platform extending across one end of the building this was covered with soft hay and reached by means of a ladder for the purpose of getting the full effect of the steam some stools and a bench for our clothes completed the arrangements there was also in one corner a pitcher of water standing in a little heap of snow to keep it cool the servantgirl came in after us and mr w quietly proceeded to undress informing us that the girl was bathingmaster and would do the usual scrubbing and shampooing this it seems is the general practice in finland and is but another example of the unembarrassed habits of the people in this part of the world the poorer families go into their bathingrooms together father mother and children and take turns in polishing each others backs it would have been ridiculous to have shown any hesitation under the circumstances in fact an indignity to the honest simplehearted virtuous girl and so we deliberately undressed also when at last we stood like our first parents in paradise naked and not ashamed she handed us bunches of birchtwigs with the leaves on the use of which was suggested by the leaf of sculpture we mounted to the platform and lay down upon our backs whereupon she increased the temperature by throwing water upon the hot stones until the heat was rather oppressive and we began to sweat profusely she then took up a bunch of birchtwigs which had been dipped in hot water and switched us smartly from head to foot when we had become thoroughly parboiled and lax we descended to the floor seated ourselves upon the stools and were scrubbed with soap as thoroughly as propriety permitted the girl was an admirable bather the result of long practice in the business she finished by pouring hot water over us and then drying us with warm towels the finns frequently go out and roll in the snow during the progress of the bath i ventured so far as to go out and stand a few seconds in the open air the mercury was at zero and the effect of the cold on my heated skin was delightfully refreshing i dressed in a violent perspiration and then ran across to herr forstrцms house where tea was already waiting for us here we found the lдnsman or magistrate of the russian district opposite a herr brаxen who was decorated with the order of stanislaus for his services in finland during the recent war he was a tall darkhaired man with a restless light in his deepset eyes and a gentleman in his demeanor he entered into our plans with interest and the evening was spent in consultation concerning them finally it was decided that herr forstrцm should send a messenger up the river to palajoki forty miles off to engage lapps and reindeer to take us across the mountains to kautokeino in norway as the messenger would be absent three or four days we had a comfortable prospect of rest before us and i went to bed with a light heart to wake to the sixth birthday i have passed in strange lands in the morning i went with mr wolley to call upon a finn one of whose children was suffering from inflamed eyes or snowthalmia as it might be called the family were prolific as usual children of all sizes with a regular gradation of a year between the father a short shockheaded fellow sat in one corner the mother who like ninetenths of all the matrons we had seen between lapland and stockholm gave promise of additional humanity greeted us with a comical dipping courtesy a sudden relaxing and stiffening again of the muscles of the knees which might be introduced as a novelty into our fashionable circles the boys eyes were terribly bloodshot and the lids swollen but a solution of nitrate of silver which mr w applied relieved him greatly in the course of a day or two we took occasion to visit the stable where half a dozen cows lay in darkness in their warm stalls on one side with two bulls and some sheep on the other there was a fire in one corner over which hung a great kettle filled with a mixture of boiled hay and reindeer moss upon this they are fed while the sheep must content themselves with bunches of birch willow and aspen twigs gathered with the leaves on the hay is strong and coarse but nourishing and the reindeer moss a delicate white lichen contains a glutinous ingredient which probably increases the secretion of milk the stable as well as forstrцms which we afterwards inspected was kept in good order it was floored with a gutter past each row of stalls to carry off the manure the cows were handsome white animals in very good condition mr wolley sent for his reindeer in the course of the morning in order to give us a lesson in driving after lunch accordingly we prepared ourselves for the new sensation i put on a poesk of reindeer skin and my furlined russian boots ludwig took a pulk also to assist us in case of need these pulks are shaped very much like a canoe they are about five feet long one foot deep and eighteen inches wide with a sharp bow and a square stern you sit upright against the sternboard with your legs stretched out in the bottom the deers harness consists only of a collar of reindeer skin around the neck with a rope at the bottom which passes under the belly between the legs and is fastened to the bow of the pulk he is driven by a single rein attached to the base of the left horn and passing over the back to the right hand of the driver who thrusts his thumb into a loop at the end and takes several turns around his wrist the rein is held rather slack in order that it may be thrown over to the right side when it slips to the left which it is very apt to do i seated myself took proper hold of the rein and awaited the signal to start my deer was a strong swift animal who had just shed his horns ludwig set off first my deer gave a startling leap dashed around the corner of the house and made down the hill i tried to catch the breath which had been jerked out of me and to keep my balance as the pulk swaying from side to side bounced over the snow it was too late a swift presentiment of the catastrophe flashed across my mind but i was powerless to avert it in another second i found myself rolling in the loose snow with the pulk bottom upward beside me the deer who was attached to my arm was standing still facing me with an expression of stupid surprise but no sympathy on his face i got up shook myself righted the pulk and commenced again off we went like the wind down the hill the snow flying in my face and blinding me my pulk made tremendous leaps bounding from side to side until the whirlwind suddenly subsiding i found myself off the road deep overhead in the snow choked and blinded and with small snowdrifts in my pockets sleeves and bosom my beard and eyebrows became instantly a white solid mass and my face began to tingle from its snowbath but on looking back i saw as white a beard suddenly emerge from a drift followed by the stout body of braisted who was gathering himself up after his third shipwreck we took a fresh start i narrowly missing another overturn as we descended the slope below the house but on reaching the level of the muonio i found no difficulty in keeping my balance and began to enjoy the exercise my deer struck out passed the others and soon i was alone on the track in the grey arctic twilight gliding noiselessly and swiftly over the snow with the low huts of muonioniska dimly seen in the distance before me i had my first true experience of lapland travelling it was delightfully novel and exhilarating i thought of afraja and the song of kulnasatz my reindeer and bryants arctic lover and whatever else there is of polar poetry urged my deer with shouts and never once looked behind me until i had climbed the opposite shore and reached the village my companions were then nowhere to be seen i waited some time before they arrived braisteds deer having become fractious and run back with him to the house his crimson face shone out from its white frame of icy hair as he shouted to me there is nothing equal to this except riding behind a right whale when he drives to windward with every man trimming the boat and the spray flying over your bows we now turned northward through the village flying around many sharp corners but this i found comparatively easy work but for the snow i had taken in which now began to melt i got on finely in spite of the falling flakes which beat in our faces von buch in his journey through lapland in speaks of muonioniska as a village with an inn where they have silver spoons we stopped at a house which mr wolley stated was the very building but it proved to be a more recent structure on the site of the old inn the people looked at us with curiosity on hearing we were americans they had heard the name of america but did not seem to know exactly where it was on leaving the house we had to descend the steep bank of the river i put out my feet to steady the pulk and thereby ploughed a cataract of fine snow into my face completely blinding me the pulk gave a flying leap from the steepest pitch flung me out and the deer eager to make for home dragged me by the arm for about twenty yards before i could arrest him this was the worst upset of all and far from pleasant although the temperature was only zero i reached home again without further mishap flushed excited soaked with melted snow and confident of my ability to drive reindeer with a little more practice during the first three days the weather was raw dark and lowering with a temperature varying from above to below zero on the morning of the th however the sky finally cleared with a cold south wind and we saw for the first time the range of snowy mountains in the east the view from our hill before so dismally bleak and dark became broad and beautiful now that there was a little light to see it by beyond the snowy floor of the lake and the river muonio stretched the scattering huts of muonioniska with the church overlooking them and the round white peak of ollastyntre rising above his belt of black woods to the south further to the east extended alternate streaks of dark forest and frozen marsh for eighteen miles to the foot of the mountain range of palastyntre which stood like a line of colossal snowdrifts against the soft violet sky their sides touched by the rosilygolden beams of the invisible sun this and the valley of the torneе at avasaxa are two of the finest views in lapland i employed part of my time in making some sketches of characteristic faces mr wolley finding that i wished to procure good types of the finns and lapps kindly assisted me his residence of three years in muoniovara enabling him to know who were the most marked and peculiar personages ludwig was despatched to procure an old fellow by the name of niemi a finn who promised to comply with my wishes but his ignorance made him suspicious and it was necessary to send again i know what travellers are said he and what a habit they have of getting peoples skulls to carry home with them even if they are arrested for it they are so rich they always buy over the judges who knows but they might try to kill me for the sake of my skull after much persuasion he was finally induced to come and seeing that ludwig supposed he was still afraid he said with great energy i have made up my mind to go even if a shower of knives should fall from heaven he was seventythree years old though he did not appear to be over sixty his hair being thick and black his frame erect and sturdy and his colour crimson rather than pale his eyebrows were jetblack and bushy his eyes large and deep set his nose strong and prominent and the corners of his long mouth drawn down in a settled curve expressing a melancholy grimness the high cheekbones square brow and muscular jaw belonged to the true finnish type he held perfectly still while i drew scarcely moving a muscle of his face and i succeeded in getting a portrait which everybody recognised i gave him a piece of money with which he was greatly delighted and after a cup of coffee in herr knoblocks kitchen he went home quite proud and satisfied they do not at all look like dangerous persons said he to the carpenter perhaps they do not collect skulls i wish they spoke our language that i might ask them how people live in their country america is a very large wild place i know all about it and the discovery of it i was not there myself at the time but jenis lampi who lives in kittila was one of the crew of the ship and he told me how it happened jenis lampi said they were going to throw the captain overboard but he persuaded them to give him three days and on the third day they found it now i should like to know whether these people who come from that country have laws as we have and whether they live as comfortably so saying isaaki anderinpoika niemi departed no sooner had he gone than the old lapp woman elsa who had been sent for drove up in her pulk behind a fast reindeer she was in complete lapp costume a blue cloth gown with wide sleeves trimmed with scarlet and a curious pearshaped cap of the same material upon her head she sat upon the floor on a deerskin and employed herself in twisting reindeer sinews which she rolled upon her cheek with the palm of her hand while i was sketching her it was already dark and i was obliged to work by candle light but i succeeded in catching the halfinsane witchlike expression of her face when i took the candle to examine her features more closely she cried out look at me o son of man she said that i had great powers and was capable of doing everything since i had come so far and could make an image of her upon paper she asked whether we were married saying we could hardly travel so much if we were yet she thought it much better to be married and stay at home i gave her a rigsdaler which she took with joyful surprise saying what am i to get my coffee and tobacco and be paid too thanks o son of man for your great goodness she chuckled very much over the drawing saying that the dress was exactly right in the afternoon we took another reindeer drive to muonioniska paying a visit to pastor fali the clergyman whom we had met at forstrцms this time i succeeded very well making the trip without a single overturn though with several mishaps mr wolley lost the way and we drove about at random for some time my deer became restive and whirled me around in the snow filling my pulk it was so dark that we could scarcely see and without knowing the ground one could not tell where the ups and down were the pastor received us courteously treated us to coffee and pipes and conversed with us for some time he had not as he said a swedish tongue and i found it difficult to understand him on our way back braisteds and ludwigs deers ran together with mine and while going at full speed bs jumped into my pulk i tried in vain either to stop or drive on faster he trampled me so violently that i was obliged to throw myself out to escape his hoofs fortunately the animals are not heavy enough to do any serious harm we reached forstrцms in season for a dinner of fat reindeer steak cranberries and a confect of the arctic raspberry after an absence of three days salomon the messenger who had been sent up the river to engage reindeer for us returned having gone sixty miles before he could procure them he engaged seven which arrived the next evening in the charge of a tall handsome finn who was to be our conductor we had in the meantime supplied ourselves with reindeer poesks such as the lapps wear our own furs being impracticable for pulk travelling reindeer mittens and boas of squirrel tails strung on reindeer sinews the carpenters second son anton a lad of fifteen was engaged to accompany us as an interpreter chapter x a reindeer journey across lapland we left muoniovara at noon on the th fully prepared for a three days journey across the wilds of lapland we were about to traverse the barren elevated tableland which divides the waters of the bothnian gulf from those of the northern ocean a dreary unfriendly region inhabited only by a few wandering lapps even without the prevalence of famine we should have had difficulty in procuring food from them so we supplied ourselves with a saddle of reindeer six loaves of rye bread sugar and a can of coffee the carpenter lent us a cup and saucer and anton who felt all the responsibility of a boy who is employed for the first time stowed everything away nicely in the broad baggage pulk we found it impossible to procure lapp leggings and shoes at muoniovara but our russian boots proved an admirable substitute the poesk of reindeer skin is the warmest covering for the body which could be devised it is drawn over the head like a shirt fitting closely around the neck and wrists where it is generally trimmed with ermine and reaching halfway below the knee a thick woollen sash wrapped first around the neck the ends then twisted together down to the waist where they are passed tightly around the body and tied in front not only increases the warmth and convenience of the garment but gives it a highly picturesque air our seaotter caps turned down so as to cover the ears and forehead were fastened upon our heads with crimson handkerchiefs and our boas of black and red squirrel tails passed thrice around the neck reached to the tips of our noses over our dogskin mittens we drew gauntlets of reindeer skin with which it was difficult to pick up or take hold of anything but as the deers rein is twisted around ones wrist their clumsiness does not interfere with the facility of driving it would seem impossible for even arctic cold to penetrate through such defences and yet it did herr forstrцm prepared us for the journey by a good breakfast of reindeers marrow a justly celebrated lapland delicacy and we set out with a splendidly clear sky and a cold of below zero the muonio valley was superb towards sunrise with a pale creamy saffron light on the snow the forests on the tops of the hills burning like jagged masses of rough opal and the distant range of palastyntre bathed in pink light with pure sapphire shadows on its northern slopes these arctic illuminations are transcendent nothing can equal them and neither pen nor pencil can describe them we passed through muonioniska and kept up the russian side over an undulating wooded country the road was quite good but my deer in spite of his size and apparent strength was a lazy beast and gave me much trouble i was obliged to get out of the pulk frequently and punch him in the flanks taking my chance to tumble in headlong as he sprang forward again i soon became disgusted with reindeer travelling especially when after we had been on the road two hours and it was nearly dark we reached upper muonioniska only eight miles we there took the river again and made better progress to kyrkessuando the first station where we stopped an hour to feed the deer here there was a very good little inn with a bed for travellers we had seven reindeer two of which ran loose so that we could change occasionally on the road i insisted on changing mine at once and received in return a smaller animal which made up in spirit what he lacked in strength our conductor was a tall handsome finn with blue eyes and a bright rosy complexion his name was isaac but he was better known by his nickname of pitka isaaki or long isaac he was a slow goodhumoured prudent careful fellow and probably served our purpose as well as anybody we could have found anton however who made his first journey with us was invaluable his father had some misgivings on account of his timidity but he was so ambitious to give satisfaction that we found him forward enough i have already described the country through which we passed as it was merely a continuation of the scenery below muonioniska low wooded hills white plains and everywhere snow snow snow silence and death the cold increased to below zero obliging me to bury my nose in my boa and to keep up a vigorous exercise of my toes to prevent them from freezing as it is impossible to cover ones boots in a pulk the night was calm clear and starry but after an hour a bank of auroral light gradually arose in the north and formed a broad arch which threw its lustre over the snow and lighted up our path almost stationary at first a restless motion after a time agitated the gleaming bow it shot out broad streamers of yellow fire gathered them in and launched them forth again like the hammer of thor which always returned to his hand after striking the blow for which it had been hurled the most wonderful appearance however was an immense square curtain which fell from all the central part of the arch the celestial sceneshifters were rather clumsy for they allowed one end to fall lower than the other so that it overlapped and doubled back upon itself in a broad fold here it hung for probably half an hour slowly swinging to and fro as if moved by a gentle wind what new spectacle was in secret preparation behind it we did not learn for it was hauled up so bunglingly that the whole arch broke and fell in leaving merely a pile of luminous ruins under the polar star hungry and nearly frozen we reached palajoki at halfpast nine and were at once ushered into the guests room a little hut separated from the main building here barring an inch of ice on the windows and numerous windy cracks in the floor we felt a little comfort before an immense fire kindled in the open chimney our provisions were already adamantine the meat was transformed into red finland granite and the bread into micaslate anton and the old finnish landlady the mother of many sons immediately commenced the work of thawing and cooking while i by the light of fir torches took the portrait of a darkhaired blackeyed oliveskinned bignosed thicklipped youth who gave his name as eric johan sombasi when our meal of meat bread and coffee had been despatched the old woman made a bed of reindeer skins for us in one corner covered with a coarse sheet a quilt and a sheepskin blanket she then took her station near the door where several of the sons were already standing and all appeared to be waiting in silent curiosity to see us retire we undressed with genuine finnish freedom of manner deliberately enough for them to understand the peculiarities of our apparel and they never took their eyes from us until we were stowed away for the night in our warm nest it was snowing and blowing when we arose long isaac had gone to the woods after the reindeer and we employed the delay in making a breakfast off the leavings of our supper crossing the muonio at starting we entered the russian territory and drove up the bed of the palajok a tributary stream which comes down from the north the sky became clearer as the dawn increased the road was tolerably broken and we sped merrily along the windings of the river under its tall banks fringed with fir trees which loaded with snow shone brilliantly white against the rosy sky the temperature was below zero which felt unpleasantly warm by contrast with the previous evening after a time we left the river and entered a rolling upland alternate thickets of fir and birch and wastes of frozen marsh where our path was almost obliterated after more than two hours travel we came upon a large lake at the further end of which on the southern side of a hill was the little hamlet of suontajдrvi here we stopped to bait the deer braisteds and mine being nearly fagged out we entered one of the huts where a pleasant woman was taking charge of a yearold baby there was no fire on the hearth and the wind whistled through the open cracks of the floor long isaac and the woman saluted each other by placing their right arms around each others waists which is the universal manner of greeting in finland they only shake hands as a token of thanks for a favour we started again at noon taking our way across a wilderness of lakes and snowcovered marshes dotted with stunted birchthickets the road had entirely disappeared but eric of palajoki who accompanied us as an extra guide went ahead with a strong reindeer and piloted us the sagacity with which these animals find the track under a smooth covering of loose snow is wonderful they follow it by the feet of course but with the utmost ease and rapidity often while going at full speed i was struck by the sinuous mazy character of our course even where the ground was level and could only account for it by the supposition that the first track over the light snow had followed the smoothest and firmest ridges of the marshes our progress was now slow and toilsome and it was not long before my deer gave up entirely long isaac seeing that a change must be made finally decided to give me a wild powerful animal which he had not yet ventured to intrust to either of us the deer was harnessed to my pulk the rein carefully secured around my wrist and long isaac let go his hold a wicked toss of the antlers and a prodigious jump followed and the animal rushed full tilt upon braisted who was next before me striking him violently upon the back the more i endeavored to rein him in the more he plunged and tore now dashing against the led deer now hurling me over the baggage pulk and now leaping off the track into bottomless beds of loose snow long isaac at last shouted to me to go ahead and follow eric who was about half a mile in advance a few furious plunges carried me past our little caravan with my pulk full of snow and my face likewise now lowering his neck and thrusting out his head with open mouth and glaring eyes the deer set off at the top of his speed away i went like a lance shot out from the auroral armoury the pulk slid over the snow with the swiftness of a fish through the water a torrent of snowspray poured into my lap and showered against my face until i was completely blinded eric was overtaken so quickly that he had no time to give me the track and as i was not in a condition to see or hear anything the deer with the stupidity of his race sprang directly upon him trampled him down and dragged me and my pulk over him we came to a stand in the deep snow while eric shook himself and started again my deer now turned and made for the caravan but i succeeded in pulling his head around when he charged a second time upon eric who threw himself out of his pulk to escape my strength was fast giving way when we came to a ridge of deep loose snow in which the animals sank above their bellies and up which they could hardly drag us my deer was so exhausted when we reached the top that i had no further difficulty in controlling him before us stretched a trackless plain bounded by a low mountain ridge eric set off at a fast trot winding hither and thither as his deer followed the invisible path i kept close behind him white as a polar bear but glowing like a volcano under my furs the temperature was below zero and i could have wished it ten degrees colder my deer although his first savage strength was spent was still full of spirit and i began to enjoy this mode of travel we soon entered the hills which were covered with thickets of frozen birch with here and there a tall scotch fir completely robed in snow the sun which had showed about half his disc at noon was now dipping under the horizon and a pure orange glow lighted up the dazzling masses of the crystal woods all was silverclear far and near shining as if by its own light with an indescribable radiance we had struck upon a wellbeaten track on entering the hills and flew swiftly along through this silent splendour this jewelled solitude under the crimson and violet mode of the sky here was true northern romance here was poetry beyond all the sagas and eddas that ever were written we passed three lapps with heavy haysleds drawn by a reindeer apiece and after a time issued from the woods upon a range of hills entirely bare and white before us was the miserable hamlet of lappajдrvi on the western side of the barren mountain of lippavara which is the highest in this part of lapland having an altitude of feet above the sea i have rarely seen anything quite so bleak and godforsaken as this village a few low black huts in a desert of snow that was all we drove up to a sort of stationhouse where an old whiteheaded finn received me kindly beat the snow off my poesk with a birch broom and hung my boa near the fire to dry there was a wild fiercelooking lapp in the room who spoke some norwegian and at once asked who and what i was his head was covered with a mop of bright brown hair his eyes were dark blue and gleamed like polished steel and the flushed crimson of his face was set off by the strong bristles of a beard of three weeks growth there was something savage and ferocious in his air as he sat with his clenched fists planted upon his knees and a heavy knife in a wooden scabbard hanging from his belt when our caravan arrived i transferred him to my sketchbook he gave me his name as ole olsen thore and i found he was a character well known throughout the country long isaac proposed waiting until midnight for moonrise as it was already dark and there was no track beyond lippajдrvi this seemed prudent and we therefore with the old womans help set about boiling our meat thawing bread and making coffee it was necessary to eat even beyond what appetite demanded on account of the long distances between the stations drowsiness followed repletion as a matter of course and they gave us a bed of skins in an innerroom here however some other members of the family were gathered around the fire and kept up an incessant chattering while a young married couple who lay in one corner bestowed their endearments on each other so that we had but little benefit of our rest at midnight all was ready and we set out long isaac had engaged a guide and procured fresh deer in place of those which were fatigued there was a thick fog which the moon scarcely brightened but the temperature had risen to zero and was as mild as a may morning for the first time in many days our beards did not freeze we pursued our way in complete silence our little caravan in single file presented a strange shadowy mysterious appearance as it followed the winding path dimly seen through the mist first on this side and then on that not a sound being heard except the crunching of ones own pulk over the snow my reindeer and myself seemed to be the only living things and we were pursuing the phantoms of other travellers and other deer who had long ago perished in the wilderness it was impossible to see more than a hundred yards some short stunted birches in their spectral coating of snow grew along the low ridges of the deep loose snow which separated the marshes but nothing else interrupted the monotony of the endless grey ocean through which we went floundering apparently at haphazard how our guides found the way was beyond my comprehension for i could discover no distinguishable landmarks after two hours or more we struck upon a cluster of huts called palajдrvi seven miles from lippajдrvi which proved that we were on the right track the fog now became thicker than ever we were upon the watershed between the bothnian gulf and the northern ocean about feet above the sea the birches became mere shrubs dotting the low mounds which here and there arose out of the ocean of snow the pulks all ran in the same track and made a single furrow so that our gunwales were generally below the sealevel the snow was packed so tight however that we rarely shipped any two hours passed and i was at length roused from a halfsleep by the evidence of our having lost the way long isaac and the guide stopped and consulted every few minutes striking sometimes in one direction and sometimes in another but without any result we ran over ridges of heavy hard tussocks blown bare of snow which pitched our pulks right and left just as i have bumped over the coral reefs of loochoo in a ships cutter then followed deep beds of snowdrifts which tasked the utmost strength of our deer low birch thickets and hard ridges again over which we plunged in the wildest way possible after wandering about for a considerable time we suddenly heard the barking of a dog at some distance on our left following the welcome sound we reached a scrubby ridge where we were saluted with a whole chorus of dogs and soon saw the dark cone of a lapp tent long isaac aroused the inmates and the shrill cry of a baby proclaimed that there was life and love even here presently a clumsy form enveloped in skins waddled out and entered into conversation with our men i proposed at once to engage a lapp to guide us as far as eitajдrvi which they informed us was two norwegian fourteen english miles farther the man agreed but must first go off to the woods for his deer which would detain us two hours he put on his snowskates and started and i set about turning the delay to profit by making acquaintance with the inmates of the tents we had now reached the middle of the village the lean wolfish dogs were yelling on all sides and the people began to bestir themselves streams of sparks issued from the open tops of the tents and very soon we stood as if in the midst of a group of volcanic cones the lapps readily gave us permission to enter we lifted the hanging door of reindeer hide crept in stumbling over a confused mixture of dogs and deerskins until we found room to sit down two middleaged women dressed in poesks like the men were kindling a fire between some large stones in the centre but the air inside was still as cold as outside the damp birch sticks gave out a thick smoke which almost stifled us and for half an hour we could scarcely see or breathe the women did not appear to be incommoded in the least but i noticed that their eyes were considerably inflamed after a time our company was increased by the arrival of two stout ruddy girls of about seventeen and a child of two years old which already wore a complete reindeer costume they were all very friendly and hospitable in their demeanour towards us for conversation was scarcely possible the interior of the tent was hung with choice bits of deers hide from the inside of the flanks and shoulders designed apparently for mittens long isaac at once commenced bargaining for some of them which he finally purchased the money was deposited in a rather heavy bag of coin which one of the women drew forth from under a pile of skins our caps and russian boots excited their curiosity and they examined them with the greatest minuteness these women were neither remarkably small nor remarkably ugly as the lapps are generally represented the groundtone of their complexion was rather tawny to be sure but there was a glowing red on their cheeks and their eyes were a dark bluishgrey their voices were agreeable and the language a branch of the finnish had none of that barbaric harshness common to the tongues of nomadic tribes these favorable features nevertheless were far from reconciling me to the idea of a trial of lapp life when i saw the filth the poverty and discomfort in which they lived i decided that the present experience was allsufficient roasting on one side and freezing on the other with smarting eyes and asphyxiated lungs i soon forgot whatever there was of the picturesque in my situation and thought only of the return of our lapp guide the women at last cleared away several dogs and made room for us to lie down a more tolerable position in our case though how a whole family with innumerable dogs stow themselves in the compass of a circle eight feet in diameter still remains a mystery the lapp returned with his reindeer within the allotted time and we took our leave of the encampment a strong south wind had arisen but did not dissipate the fog and for two hours we had a renewal of our past experiences in thumping over hard ridges and ploughing through seas of snow our track was singularly devious sometimes doubling directly back upon itself without any apparent cause at last when a faint presentiment of dawn began to glimmer through the fog the lapp halted and announced that he had lost the way bidding us remain where we were he struck off into the snow and was soon lost to sight scarcely a quarter of an hour had elapsed however before we heard his cries at a considerable distance following as we best could across a plain nearly a mile in diameter we found him at last in a narrow dell between two hills the ground now sloped rapidly northward and i saw that we had crossed the watershed and that the plain behind us must be the lake jedeckejaure which according to von buch is feet above the sea on emerging from the dell we found a gentle slope before us covered with hard ice down which our pulks flew like the wind this brought us to another lake followed by a similar slope and so we descended the icy terraces until in a little more than an hour some covered haystacks gave evidence of human habitation and we drew up at the huts of eitajдrvi in norway an old man who had been watching our approach immediately climbed upon the roof and removed a board from the chimney after which he ushered us into a bare cold room and kindled a roaring fire on the hearth anton unpacked our provisions and our hunger was so desperate after fasting for twenty hours that we could scarcely wait for the bread to thaw and the coffee to boil we set out again at noon down the frozen bed of a stream which drains the lakes but had not proceeded far before both deers and pulks began to break through the ice probably on account of springs under it after being almost swamped we managed to get up the steep snowbank and took to the plain again making our own road over ridge and through hollow the caravan was soon stopped that the pulks might be turned bottom upwards and the ice scraped off which like the barnacles on a ships hull impeded their progress through the snow the broad plain we were traversing stretched away to the north without a break or spot of color to relieve its ghastly whiteness but toward the southwest where the sunset of an unrisen sun spread its roseate glow through the mist arose some low mounds covered with drooping birches which shone against the soft mellow splendor like sprays of silver embroidered on rosecolored satin our course for about fifteen miles lay alternately upon the stream where the ice was sufficiently strong and the wild plain two or three lapp tents on the bank exhibited the usual amount of children and dogs but we did not think it worth while to extend the circle of our acquaintance in that direction at five oclock after it had long been dark we reached half a dozen huts called siepe two norwegian miles from kautokeino long isaac wished to stop here for the night but we resolutely set ourselves against him the principal hut was filthy crowded with lapps and filled with a disagreeable smell from the warm wet poesks hanging on the rafters in one corner lay the carcases of two deercalves which had been killed by wolves a long bench a table and a rude frame covered with deerskins and serving as a bed comprised all the furniture the usual buckets of sour milk with wooden ladles stood by the door no one appeared to have any particular occupation if we except the hosts wife who was engaged with an infant in reindeer breeches we smoked and deliberated while the deers ate their balls of moss and the result was that a stout yellowhaired lapp youngster was engaged to pilot us to kautokeino siepe stands on a steep bank down which our track led to the stream again as the caravan set off my deer which had behaved very well through the day suddenly became fractious sprang off the track whirled himself around on his hind legs as if on a pivot and turned the pulk completely over burying me in the snow now i had come from muoniovara more than a hundred miles without being once overturned and was ambitious to make the whole journey with equal success i therefore picked myself up highly disconcerted and started afresh the very same thing happened a second and a third time and i dont think i shall be considered unreasonable for becoming furiously angry i should certainly have committed cervicide had any weapon been at hand i seized the animal by the horns shook cuffed and kicked him but all to no purpose long isaac who was passing in his pulk made some remark which anton with all the gravity and conscientiousness of his new position of interpreter immediately translated long isaac says he shouted that the deer will go well enough if you knew how to drive him long isaac may go to the devil was i am sorry to say my profane reply which anton at once translated to him seating myself in the pulk again i gave the deer the rein and for a time kept him to the top of his speed following the lapp who drove rapidly down the windings of the stream it was quite dark but our road was now somewhat broken and for three hours our caravan swiftly and silently sped on its way then some scattered lights appeared in the distance our tired deers leaped forward with fresher spirit and soon brought us to the low wooden huts of kautokeino we had travelled upwards of sixty miles since leaving lippajдrvi breaking our own road through deep snow for a great part of the way during this time our deers had not been changed i cannot but respect the provoking animals after such a feat chapter xi kautokeino a day without a sun while in dresden my friend ziegler had transferred to me a letter of introduction from herr berger a merchant of hammerfest to his housekeeper in kautokeino such a transfer might be considered a great stretch of etiquette in those enlightened regions of the world where hospitality requires certificates of character but in a benighted country like lapland there was no danger of very fine distinctions being drawn and ziegler judged that the house which was to have been placed at his disposal had he made the journey would as readily open its doors to me at muoniovara i learned that berger himself was now in kautokeino so that i needed only to present him with his own letter we arrived so late however that i directed long isaac to take us to the inn until morning he seemed reluctant to do this and i could not fathom the reason of his hesitation until i had entered the hovel to which we were conducted a single room filled with smoke from a fire of damp birch sticks was crammed with lapps of all sizes and of both sexes there was scarcely room to spread a deerskin on the floor while the smell exhaled from their greasy garments and their unwashed bodies was absolutely stifling i have travelled too much to be particularly nice in my choice of lodgings but in this instance i instantly retreated determined to lie on the snow under my overturned pulk rather than pass the night among such bedfellows we drove on for a short distance and drew up before a large substantial loghouse which long isaac informed me was the residence of the lдnsman or magistrate of the district i knocked at the door and inquired of the norwegian servant girl who opened it where herr berger lived presently appeared a stout ruddy gentleman no less than herr berger himself who addressed me in fluent english a few words sufficed to explain everything and in ten minutes our effects were deposited in the guests room of the lдnsmans house and ourselves stripped of our polar hides were seated on a sofa in a warm carpeted room with a bountiful suppertable before us blessed be civilisation was my inward ejaculation blessed be that yearning for comfort in man which has led to the invention of beds of sofas and easy chairs which has suggested cleanliness of body and of habitation and which has developed the noble art of cooking the dreary and perilous wastes over which we had passed were forgotten with hearts warmed in both senses and stomachs which reacted gratefully upon our hearts we sank that night into a paradise of snowy linen which sent a consciousness of pleasure even into the oblivion of sleep the lдnsman herr lie a tall handsome man of twentythree was a native of altengaard and spoke tolerable english with him and herr berger we found a third person a theological student stationed at kautokeino to learn the lapp tongue pastor hvoslef the clergyman was the only other norwegian resident the village separated from the northern ocean by the barren uninhabited ranges of the kiцlen mountains and from the finnish settlements on the muonio by the swampy tablelands we had traversed is one of the wildest and most forlorn places in all lapland occupying as it does the centre of a large district over which the lapps range with their reindeer herds during the summer it is nevertheless a place of some importance both for trade and for the education organization and proper control of the barelyreclaimed inhabitants a church was first built here by charles xi of sweden in although in the course of subsequent boundary adjustments the district was made over to norway half a century afterwards some families of finns settled here but they appear to have gradually mixed with the lapps so that there is little of the pure blood of either race to be found at present i should here remark that throughout norwegian lapland the lapps are universally called finns and the finns quдns as the change of names however might occasion some confusion i shall adhere to the more correct swedish manner of designating them which i have used hitherto kautokeino is situated in a shallow valley or rather basin opening towards the northeast whither its river flows to join the alten although only feet above the sea and consequently below the limits of the birch and the fir in this latitude the country has been stripped entirely bare for miles around and nothing but the scattering groups of low dark huts breaks the snowy monotony it is with great difficulty that vegetables of any kind can be raised potatoes have once or twice been made to yield eightfold but they are generally killed by the early autumn frosts before maturity on the southern bank of the river the ground remains frozen the whole year round at a depth of only nine feet the country furnishes nothing except reindeer meat milk and cheese grain and other supplies of all kinds must be hauled up from the alten fjord a distance of miles the carriage is usually performed in winter when of course everything reaches its destination in a frozen state the potatoes are as hard as quartz pebbles sugar and salt become stony masses and even wine assumes a solid form in this state they are kept until wanted for use rapidly thawed and immediately consumed whereby their flavour is but little impaired the potatoes cabbage and preserved berries on the lдnsmans table were almost as fresh as if they had never been frozen formerly the place was almost entirely deserted during the summer months and the resident missionary and lдnsman returned to alten until the lapps came back to their winter huts but for some years past the stationary population has increased and the church is kept open the whole year winter however is the season when the lapps are found at home and when their life and habits are most characteristic and interesting the population of kautokeino is then perhaps about in summer it is scarcely onetenth of this number many of the families especially those of mixed finnish blood live in wooden huts with the luxury of a fireplace and chimney and a window or two but the greater part of them burrow in low habitations of earth which resemble large mole hills raised in the crust of the soil half snowed over and blended with the natural inequalities of the earth one would never imagine but for the smoke here and there issuing from holes that human beings existed below on both sides of the stream are rows of storehouses wherein the lapps deposit their supplies and household articles during their summer wanderings these structures are raised upon birch posts each capped with a smooth horizontal board in order to prevent the rats and mice from effecting an entrance the church is built upon a slight eminence to the south with its low red belfry standing apart as in sweden in a small grove of birches which have been spared for a summer ornament to the sanctuary we awoke at eight oclock to find a clear twilight and a cold of below zero our stay at muoniovara had given the sun time to increase his altitude somewhat and i had some doubts whether we should succeed in beholding a day of the polar winter the lдnsman however encouraged us by the assurance that the sun had not yet risen upon his residence though nearly six weeks had elapsed since his disappearance but that his return was now looked for every day since he had already begun to shine upon the northern hills by ten oclock it was light enough to read the southern sky was a broad sea of golden orange dotted with a few crimson cloudislands and we set ourselves to watch with some anxiety the gradual approach of the exiled god but for this circumstance and two other drawbacks i should have gone to church to witness the lapps at their religious exercises pastor hvoslef was ill and the service consisted only of the reading of some prayers by the lapp schoolmaster added to which the church is never warmed even in the coldest days of winter one cause of this may perhaps be the dread of an accidental conflagration but the main reason is the inconvenience which would arise from the thawing out of so many antiquated reindeer garments and the effluvia given out by the warmed bodies within them consequently the temperature inside the church is about the same as outside and the frozen moisture of the worshippers breath forms a frosty cloud so dense as sometimes to hide the clergyman from the view of his congregation pastor hvoslef informed me that he had frequently preached in a temperature of below zero at such times said he the very words seem to freeze as they issue from my lips and fall upon the heads of my hearers like a shower of snow but i ventured to remark our souls are controlled to such a degree by the condition of our bodies that i should doubt whether any true devotional spirit could exist at such a time might not even religion itself be frozen yes he answered there is no doubt that all the better feelings either disappear or become very faint when the mercury begins to freeze the pastor himself was at that time suffering the penalty of indulging a spirit of reverence which for a long time led him to officiate with uncovered head the sky increased in brightness as we watched the orange flushed into rose and the pale white hills looked even more ghastly against the bar of glowing carmine which fringed the horizon a few long purple streaks of cloud hung over the suns place and higher up in the vault floated some loose masses tinged with fiery crimson on their lower edges about halfpast eleven a pencil of bright red light shot up a signal which the sun uplifted to herald his coming as it slowly moved westward along the hills increasing in height and brilliancy until it became a long tongue of flame playing against the streaks of cloud we were apprehensive that the near disc would rise to view when the lдnsmans clock pointed to twelve its base had become so bright as to shine almost like the sun itself but after a few breathless moments the unwelcome glow began to fade we took its bearing with a compass and after making allowance for the variation which is here very slight were convinced that it was really past meridian and the radiance which was that of morning a few minutes before belonged to the splendours of evening now the colours of the firmament began to change in reverse order and the dawn which had almost ripened to sunrise now withered away to night without a sunset we had at last seen a day without a sun the snowy hills to the north it is true were tinged with a flood of rosy flame and the very next day would probably bring down the tidemark of sunshine to the tops of the houses one day however was enough to satisfy me you my heroic frienda may paint with true pencil and still truer pen the dreary solemnity of the long arctic night but greatly as i enjoy your incomparable pictures much as i honour your courage and your endurance you shall never tempt me to share in the experience the south is a cup which one may drink to inebriation but one taste from the icy goblet of the north is enough to allay curiosity and quench all further desire yet the contrast between these two extremes came home to me vividly but once during this journey a travellers mind must never stray too far from the things about him and long habit has enabled me to throw myself entirely into the conditions and circumstances of each separate phase of my wandering life thereby preserving distinct the sensations and experiences of each and preventing all later confusion in the memory but one day at muoniovara as i sat before the fire in the afternoon darkness there flashed across my mind a vision of cloudless egypt trees rustling in the hot wind yellow mountainwalls rising beyond the emerald plain of the nile the white pencils of minarets in the distance the creamy odour of beanblossoms in the air a world of glorious vitality where death seemed an unaccountable accident here life existed only on sufferance and all nature frowned with a robbers demand to give it up i flung my pipe across the room and very soon behind a fast reindeer drove away from the disturbing reminiscence i went across the valley to the schoolmasters house to make a sketch of kautokeino but the frost was so thick on the windows that i was obliged to take a chair in the open air and work with bare hands i soon learned the value of rapidity in such an employment we spent the afternoon in the lдnsmans parlor occasionally interrupted by the visits of lapps who having heard of our arrival were very curious to behold the first americans who ever reached this part of the world they came into the room with the most perfect freedom saluted the lдnsman and then turned to stare at us until they were satisfied when they retired to give place to others who were waiting outside we were obliged to hold quite a levee during the whole evening they had all heard of america but knew very little else about it and many of them questioned us through herr berger concerning our religion and laws the fact of the three norwegian residents being able to converse with us astonished them greatly the lapps of kautokeino have hitherto exalted themselves over the lapps of karasjok and karessuando because the lдnsman berger and pastor hvoslef could speak with english and french travellers in their own language while the merchants and pastors of the latter places are acquainted only with norwegian and swedish and now their pride received a vast accession how is it possible said they to herr berger these men come from the other side of the world and you talk with them as fast in their own language as if you had never spoken any other the schoolmaster lars kaino a onearmed fellow with a more than ordinary share of acuteness and intelligence came to request that i would take his portrait offering to pay me for my trouble i agreed to do it gratuitously on condition that i should keep it myself and that he should bring his wife to be included in the sketch he assented with some sacrifice of vanity and came around the next morning in his holiday suit of blue cloth trimmed with scarlet and yellow binding his wife a short woman of about twentyfive with a face as flat and round as a platter but a remarkably fair complexion accompanied him though with evident reluctance and sat with eyes modestly cast down while i sketched her features the circumstance of my giving lars half a dollar at the close of the sitting was immediately spread through kautokeino and before night all the lapps of the place were ambitious to undergo the same operation indeed the report reached the neighboring villages and a hammerfest merchant who came in the following morning from a distance of seven miles obtained a guide at less than the usual price through the anxiety of the latter to arrive in time to have his portrait taken the shortness of the imperfect daylight however obliged me to decline further offers especially as there were few lapps of pure unmixed blood among my visitors kautokeino was the northern limit of my winter journey i proposed visiting altengaard in the summer on my way to the north cape and there is nothing in the barren tract between the two places to repay the excursion i had already seen enough of the lapps to undeceive me in regard to previouslyformed opinions respecting them and to take away the desire for a more intimate acquaintance in features as in language they resemble the finns sufficiently to indicate an ethnological relationship i could distinguish little if any trace of the mongolian blood in them they are fatter fairer and altogether handsomer than the nomadic offshoots of that race and resemble the esquimaux to whom they have been compared in nothing but their rude filthy manner of life von buch ascribes the difference in stature and physical stamina between them and the finns to the use of the vapor bath by the latter and the aversion to water of the former they are a race of northern gipsies and it is the restless blood of this class rather than any want of natural capacity which retards their civilisation although the whole race has been converted to christianity and education is universal among them no lapp being permitted to marry until he can read they have but in too many respects substituted one form of superstition for another the spread of temperance among them however has produced excellent results and in point of morality they are fully up to the prevailing standard in sweden and norway the practice formerly imputed to them of sharing their connubial rights with the guests who visited them is wholly extinct if it ever existed theft is the most usual offence but crimes of a more heinous character are rare whatever was picturesque in the lapps has departed with their paganism no wizards now ply their trade of selling favorable winds to the norwegian coasters or mutter their incantations to discover the concealed grottoes of silver in the kiцlen mountains it is in vain therefore for the romantic traveller to seek in them the materials for weird stories and wild adventures they are frightfully pious and commonplace their conversion has destroyed what little of barbaric poetry there might have been in their composition and instead of chanting to the spirits of the winds and clouds and mountains they have become furious ranters who frequently claim to be possessed by the holy ghost as human beings the change incomplete as it is is nevertheless to their endless profit but as objects of interest to the traveller it has been to their detriment it would be far more picturesque to describe a sabaoth of lapland witches than a prayermeeting of shouting converts yet no friend of his race could help rejoicing to see the latter substituted for the former in proportion therefore as the lapps have become enlightened like all other savage tribes they have become less interesting retaining nearly all that is repulsive in their habits of life they have lost the only peculiarities which could persuade one to endure the inconveniences of a closer acquaintance i have said that the conversion of the lapps was in some respects the substitution of one form of superstition for another a tragic exemplification of this fact which produced the greatest excitement throughout the north took place in kautokeino four years ago through the preaching of lestadius and other fanatical missionaries a spiritual epidemic manifesting itself in the form of visions trances and angelic possessions broke out among the lapps it infected the whole country and gave rise to numerous disturbances and difficulties in kautokeino it was no unusual thing for one of the congregation to arise during church service declare that he was inspired by the holy ghost and call upon those present to listen to his revelations the former lдnsman arrested the most prominent of the offenders and punished them with fine and imprisonment this begat feelings of hatred on the part of the fanatics which soon ripened into a conspiracy the plot was matured during the summer months when the lapps descended towards the norwegian coast with their herds of reindeer i have the account of what followed from the lips of pastor hvoslef who was then stationed here and was also one of the victims of their resentment early one morning in october when the inhabitants were returning from their summer wanderings he was startled by the appearance of the resident merchants wife who rushed into his house in a frantic state declaring that her husband was murdered he fancied that the woman was bewildered by some sudden fright and in order to quiet her walked over to the merchants house here he found the unfortunate man lying dead upon the floor while a band of about thirty lapps headed by the principal fanatics were forcing the house of the lдnsman whom they immediately dispatched with their knives and clubs they then seized the pastor and his wife beat them severely with birchsticks and threatened them with death unless they would acknowledge the divine mission of the socalled prophets the greater part of the day passed in uncertainty and terror but towards evening appeared a crowd of friendly lapps from the neighbouring villages who after having received information through fugitives of what had happened armed themselves and marched to the rescue a fight ensued in which the conspirators were beaten and the prisoners delivered out of their hands the friendly lapps unable to take charge of all the criminals and fearful lest some of them might escape during the night adopted the alternative of beating every one of them so thoroughly that they were all found the next morning in the same places where they had been left the evening before they were tried at alten the two ringleaders executed and a number of the others sent to the penitentiary at christiania this summary justice put a stop to all open and violent manifestations of religious frenzy but it still exists to some extent though only indulged in secret we paid a visit to pastor hvoslef on monday and had the pleasure of his company to dinner in the evening he is a christian gentleman in the best sense of the term and though we differed in matters of belief i was deeply impressed with his piety and sincerity madame hvoslef and two rosy little arctic blossoms shared his exile for this is nothing less than an exile to a man of cultivation and intellectual tastes in his house i saw the last thing one would have expected to find in the heart of lapland a piano madame hvoslef who is an accomplished performer sat down to it and gave us the barcarole from massaniello while in the midst of a maze of wild norwegian melodies i saw the pastor whisper something in her ear at once to our infinite amazement she boldly struck up yankee doodle something like an american warwhoop began to issue from braisteds mouth but was smothered in time to prevent an alarm how on earth did that air get into lapland i asked i heard ole bull play it at christiania said madame hvoslef and learned it from memory afterwards the weather changed greatly after our arrival from below zero on sunday evening it rose to above on monday night with a furious hurricane of snow from the north we sent for our deer from the hills early on tuesday morning in order to start on our return to muoniovara the lapps however have an oriental disregard of time and as there was no chance of our getting off before noon we improved part of the delay in visiting the native schools and some of the earthen huts or rather dens in which most of the inhabitants live there were two schools each containing about twenty scholars fat greasy youngsters swaddled in reindeer skins with blue eyes light brown or yellow hair and tawny red cheeks wherever the original colour could be discerned as the rooms were rather warm the odour of lapp childhood was not quite as fresh as a cowslip and we did not tarry long among them approaching the side of a pile of dirt covered with snow we pushed one after another against a small square door hung at such a slant that it closed of itself and entered an anteden used as a storeroom another similar door ushered us into the house a rude vaulted space framed with poles sticks and reindeer hides and covered compactly with earth except a narrow opening in the top to let out the smoke from a fire kindled in the centre pieces of reindeer hide dried flesh bags of fat and other articles hung from the frame and dangled against our heads as we entered the den was not more than five feet high by about eight feet in diameter the owner a jolly goodhumoured lapp gave me a low wooden stool while his wife with a pipe in her mouth squatted down on the hide which served for a bed and looked at me with amiable curiosity i contemplated them for a while with my eyes full of tears the smoke being very thick until finally both eyes and nose could endure no more and i sought the open air again footnotes a this was written in lapland and at the same time my friend dr elisha kent kane of immortal memory lay upon his deathbed in havana i retain the words which i then supposed would meet his eye that i may add my own tribute of sorrow for the untimely death of one of the truest bravest and noblesthearted men i ever knew chapter xii the return to muoniovara while at kautokeino i completed my lapp outfit by purchasing a scarlet cap stuffed with eider down a pair of boellinger or reindeer leggings and the komager or broad boatshaped shoes filled with dry soft hay and tightly bound around the ankles which are worn by everybody in lapland attired in these garments i made a very passable lapp barring a few superfluous inches of stature and at once realized the prudence of conforming in ones costume to the native habits after the first feeling of awkwardness is over nothing can be better adapted to the polar winter than the lapp dress i walked about at first with the sensation of having each foot in the middle of a large feather bed but my blood preserved its natural warmth even after sitting for hours in an open pulk the boellinger fastened around the thighs by drawingstrings of reindeer sinew are so covered by the poesk that one becomes for all practical purposes a biped reindeer and may wallow in the snow as much as he likes without the possibility of a particle getting through his hide the temperature was nevertheless singularly mild when we set out on our return there had been a violent storm of wind and snow the previous night after which the mercury rose to above zero we waited until noon before our reindeers could be collected and then set off with the kind farewell wishes of the four norwegian inhabitants of the place i confess to a feeling of relief when we turned our faces southward and commenced our return to daylight we had at last seen the polar night the day without a sunrise we had driven our reindeer under the arches of the aurora borealis we had learned enough of the lapps to convince us that further acquaintance would be of little profit and it now seemed time to attempt an escape from the limbo of death into which we had ventured our faces had already begun to look pale and faded from three weeks of alternate darkness and twilight but the novelty of our life preserved us from any feeling of depression and prevented any perceptible effect upon our bodily health such as would assuredly have followed a protracted experience of the arctic winter every day now would bring us further over the steep northern shoulder of the earth and nearer to that great heart of life in the south where her blood pulsates with eternal warmth already there was a perceptible increase of the suns altitude and at noonday a thin upper slice of his disc was visible for about half an hour by herr bergers advice we engaged as guide to lippajдrvi a lapp who had formerly acted as postman and professed to be able to find his way in the dark the wind had blown so violently that it was probable we should have to break our own road for the whole distance leaving kautokeino we travelled up the valley of a frozen stream towards desolate ranges of hills or rather shelves of the tableland running northeast and southwest they were spotted with patches of stunted birch hardly rising above the snow our deer were recruited and we made very good progress while the twilight lasted at some lapp tents where we stopped to make inquiries about the ice i was much amused by the appearance of a group of children who strikingly resembled bearcubs standing on their hind legs they were coated with reindeer hide from head to foot with only a little fullmoon of tawny red face visible we stopped at siepe an hour to bait the deer the single wooden hut was crowded with lapps one of whom apparently the owner spoke a little norwegian he knew who we were and asked me many questions about america he was most anxious to know what was our religion and what course the government took with regard to different sects he seemed a little surprised and not less pleased to hear that all varieties of belief were tolerated and that no one sect possessed any peculiar privileges over another it is only very recently that dissenters from the orthodox church have been allowed to erect houses of worship in norway while we were speaking on these matters an old woman kneeling near us was muttering prayers to herself wringing her hands sobbing and giving other evidences of violent religious excitement this appeared to be a common occurrence as none of the lapps took the slightest notice of it i have no doubt that much of that hallucination which led to the murders at kautokeino still exists among the people kept alive by secret indulgence those missionaries have much to answer for who have planted the seeds of spiritual disease among this ignorant and impressible race the night was cold and splendidly clear we were obliged to leave the river on account of rotten ice and took to the open plains where our deers sank to their bellies in the loose snow the leading animals became fractious and we were obliged to stop every few minutes until their paroxysms subsided i could not perceive that the lapps themselves exercised much more control over them than we who were new to the business the domesticated reindeer still retains his wild instincts and never fails to protest against the necessity of labour the most docile will fly from the track plunge face about and refuse to draw when you least expect it they are possessed by an incorrigible stupidity their sagacity applies only to their animal wants and they seem almost totally deficient in memory they never become attached to men and the only sign of recognition they show is sometimes to allow certain persons to catch them more easily than others in point of speed they are not equal to the horse and an hours run generally exhausts them when one considers their size however their strength and power of endurance seem marvellous herr berger informed me that he had driven a reindeer from alten to kautokeino miles in twentysix hours and from the latter place to muoniovara in thirty i was also struck by the remarkable adaptation of the animal to its uses its hoof resembles that of the camel being formed for snow as the latter for sand it is broad cloven and flexible the separate divisions spreading out so as to present a resisting surface when the foot is set down and falling together when it is lifted thus in snow where a horse would founder in the space of a hundred yards the deer easily works his way mile after mile drawing the sliding canoelike pulk burdened with his masters weight after him the lapps generally treat their animals with the greatest patience and forbearance but otherwise do not exhibit any particular attachment for them they are indebted to them for food clothing habitation and conveyance and their very existence may therefore almost be said to depend on that of their herds it is surprising however what a number of deer are requisite for the support of a family von buch says that a lapp who has a hundred deer is poor and will be finally driven to descend to the coast and take to fishing the does are never made to labour but are kept in the woods for milking and breeding their milk is rich and nourishing but less agreeable to the taste than that of the cow the cheese made from it is strong and not particularly palatable it yields an oil which is the sovereign specific for frozen flesh the male deer used for draft are always castrated which operation the old lapp women perform by slowly chewing the glands between their teeth until they are reduced to a pulp without wounding the hide during this journey i had ample opportunity of familiarising myself with reindeer travel it is picturesque enough at the outset but when the novelty of the thing is worn off nothing is left but a continual drain upon ones patience nothing can exceed the coolness with which your deer jumps off the track slackens his towrope turns around and looks you in the face as much as to say what are you going to do about it the simplicity and stupidity of his countenance seem to you to be admirably feigned and unless you are an old hand you are inevitably provoked this is particularly pleasant on the marshy tablelands of lapland where if he takes a notion to bolt with you your pulk bounces over the hard tussocks sheers sideways down the sudden pitches or swamps itself in beds of loose snow harness a frisky sturgeon to a dugout in a rough sea and you will have some idea of this method of travelling while i acknowledge the providential disposition of things which has given the reindeer to the lapp i cannot avoid thanking heaven that i am not a lapp and that i shall never travel again with reindeer the aberrations of our deer obliged us to take a very sinuous course sometimes we headed north and sometimes south and the way seemed so long that i mistrusted the quality of our guide but at last a light shone ahead it was the hut of eitajдrvi a lot of pulks lay in front of it and the old finn stood already with a fir torch waiting to light us in on arriving anton was greeted by his sister caroline who had come thus far from muoniovara on her way to visit some relatives at altengaard she was in company with some finns who had left lippajдrvi the day previous but losing their way in the storm had wandered about for twentyfour hours exposed to its full violence think of an american girl of eighteen sitting in an open pulk with the thermometer at zero a furious wind and blinding snow beating upon her and neither rest nor food for a day there are few who would survive twelve hours yet caroline was as fresh lively and cheerful as ever and immediately set about cooking our supper we found a fire in the cold guests room the place swept and cleaned and a good bed of deerskins in one corner the temperature had sunk to below zero and the wind blew through wide cracks in the floor but between the fire and the reciprocal warmth of our bodies we secured a comfortable sleep a thing of the first consequence in such a climate our deer started well in the morning and the lapp guide knew his way perfectly the wind had blown so strongly that the track was cleared rather than filled and we slipped up the long slopes at a rapid rate i recognised the narrow valley where we first struck the northern streams and the snowy plain beyond where our first lapp guide lost his way by this time it was beginning to grow lighter showing us the dreary wastes of tableland which we had before crossed in the fog north of us was a plain of unbroken snow extending to a level line on the horizon where it met the dark violet sky were the colour changed it would have perfectly represented the sandy plateaus of the nubian desert in so many particulars does the extreme north imitate the extreme south but the sun which never deserts the desert had not yet returned to these solitudes far far away on the edge of the sky a dull red glimmer showed where he moved not the tableland of pamir in thibet the cradle of the oxus and the indus but this lower lapland terrace is entitled to the designation of the roof of the world we were on the summit creeping along her mountain rafters and looking southward off her shelving eaves to catch a glimpse of the light playing on her majestic front here for once we seemed to look down on the horizon and i thought of europe and the tropics as lying below our journey northward had been an ascent but now the worlds steep sloped downward before us into sunshine and warmer air in ascending the andes or the himalayas you pass through all climates and belts of vegetation between the equator and the pole and so a journey due north beyond the circle of the sun simply reverses the phenomenon and impresses one like the ascent of a mountain on the grandest possible scale in two hours from the time we left eitajдrvi we reached the lapp encampment the herds of deer had been driven in from the woods and were clustered among the birch bushes around the tents we had some difficulty in getting our own deer past them until the lapps came to our assistance we made no halt but pushed on through deeper snows than before over the desolate plain as far as palajдrvi we ran with our gunwales below the snowlevel while the foremost pulks were frequently swamped under the white waves that broke over them we passed through a picturesque gorge between two hills about feet high and beyond it came upon wide lakes covered deep with snow under which there was a tolerable track which the leading deer was able to find with his feet beyond these lakes there was a ridge which we had no sooner crossed than a dismally grand prospect opened before us we overlooked a valleybasin marked with belts of stunted birch and stretching away for several miles to the foot of a bleak snowy mountain which i at once recognised as lippavara after rounding its western point and turning southward again we were rejoiced with the sight of some fir trees from which the snow had been shaken brightening even with their gloomy green the white monotony of the lapland wilderness it was like a sudden gleam of sunshine we reached lippajдrvi at twelve having made twentyeight miles of hard travel in five hours here we stopped two hours to cook a meal and change our deer and then pushed on to reach palajoki the same night we drove through the birch woods no longer glorious as before for the snow had been shaken off and there was no sunset light to transfigure them still on ploughing through deep seas in the gathering darkness over marshy plains all with a slant southward draining into the muonio until we reached the birchen ridge of suontajдrvi with its beautiful firs rising here and there silent and immovable even the trees have no voices in the north let the wind blow as it will there is nothing to be heard but the sharp whistle of the dry snow the same dreary music which accompanies the african simoom the night was very dark and we began to grow exceedingly tired of sitting flat in our pulks i looked sharp for the palajok elv the high firfringed banks of which i remembered for they denoted our approach to the muonio but it was long long before we descended from the marshes upon the winding road of snowcovered ice in vain i shifted my aching legs and worked my benumbed hands looking out ahead for the embouchure of the river braisted and i encouraged each other whenever we were near enough to hear by the reminder that we had only one more day with reindeer after a long time spent in this way the high banks flattened level snows and woods succeeded and we sailed into the port of palajoki the old finnish lady curtsied very deeply as she recognised us and hastened to cook our coffee and reindeer and to make us a good bed with sheets on our former visit the old lady and her sons had watched us undress and get into bed but on this occasion three buxom daughters of ages ranging from sixteen to twentytwo appeared about the time for retiring and stationed themselves in a row near the door where they watched us with silent curiosity as we had shown no hesitation in the first case we determined to be equally courageous now and commenced removing our garments with great deliberation allowing them every opportunity of inspecting their fashion and the manner of wearing them the work thus proceeded in mutual silence until we were nearly ready for repose when braisted by pulling off a stocking and displaying a muscular calf suddenly alarmed the youngest who darted to the door and rushed out the second caught the panic and followed and the third and oldest was therefore obliged to do likewise though with evident reluctance i was greatly amused at such an unsophisticated display of curiosity the perfect composure of the girls and the steadiness with which they watched us showed that they were quite unconscious of having committed any impropriety the morning was clear and cold our deer had strayed so far into the woods that we did not get under way before the forenoon twilight commenced we expected to find a broken road down the muonio but a heavy snow had fallen the day previous and the track was completely filled long isaac found so much difficulty in taking the lead his deer constantly bolting from the path that anton finally relieved him and by standing upright in the pulk and thumping the deers flanks succeeded in keeping up the animals spirits and forcing a way it was slow work however and the sun rolling his whole disc above the horizon announced midday before we reached kyrkessuando as we drove up to the little inn we were boisterously welcomed by hдl herr forstrцms brown wolfdog who had strayed thus far from home our deer were beginning to give out and we were very anxious to reach muoniovara in time for dinner so we only waited long enough to give the animals a feed of moss and procure some hot milk for ourselves the snowstorm which had moved over a narrow belt of country had not extended below this place and the road was consequently well broken we urged our deer into a fast trot and slid down the icy floor of the muonio past hills whose snows flashed scarlet and roseorange in the long splendour of sunset hunger and the fatigue which our journey was producing at last made us extremely sensitive to the cold though it was not more than below zero my blood became so chilled that i was apprehensive the extremities would freeze and the most vigorous motion of the muscles barely sufficed to keep at bay the numbness which attacked them at dusk we drove through upper muonioniska and our impatience kept the reindeers so well in motion that before five oclock although long after dark we were climbing the wellknown slope to herr forstrцms house at muoniovara here we found the merchant not yet departed to the lapp fair at karessuando and mr wolley who welcomed us with the cordiality of an old friend our snug room at the carpenters was already warmed and set in order and after our reindeer drive of miles through the wildest parts of lapland we felt a homelike sense of happiness and comfort in smoking our pipes before the familiar iron stove the trip to kautokeino embraced about all i saw of lapp life during the winter journey the romance of the tribe as i have already said has totally departed with their conversion while their habits of life scarcely improved in the least are sufficiently repulsive to prevent any closer experience than i have had unless the gain were greater mr wolley who had been three years in lapland also informed me that the superstitious and picturesque traditions of the people have almost wholly disappeared and the coarse mysticism and rant which they have engrafted upon their imperfect christianity does not differ materially from the same excrescence in more civilised races they have not even the better for them it is true any characteristic and picturesque vices but have become certainly to their own great advantage a pious fanatical moral ignorant and commonplace people i have described them exactly as i found them and as they have been described to me by those who knew them well the readers of afraja may be a little disappointed with the picture as i confess i have been in an artistic sense only with the reality but the lapps have lost many vices with their poetic diablerie and nobody has a right to complain it is a pity that many traits which are really characteristic and interesting in a people cannot be mentioned on account of that morbid prudery so prevalent in our day which insults the unconscious innocence of nature oh that one could imitate the honest unreserve of the old travellers the conscientiousness which insisted on telling not only the truth but the whole truth this is scarcely possible now but at the same time i have not been willing to emasculate my accounts of the tribes of men to the extent perhaps required by our ultraconventionalism and must insist now and then on being allowed a little flemish fidelity to nature in the description of races as in the biography of individuals the most important half of life is generally omitted chapter xiii about the finns we remained but another day in muoniovara after our return from kautokeino and this was devoted to preparations for the return journey to haparanda my first intention had been to make an excursion across the country to the iron mountains of gellivara thence to quickjock at the foot of the northern alp sulitelma queen of snows and so southward through the heart of swedish lappmark but i found that such a journey would be attended with much difficulty and delay in the first place there were no broken roads at this season except on the routes of inland trade much of the intermediate country is a wilderness where one must camp many nights in the snow food was very scarce the lapps having hardly enough for their own necessities and the delays at every place where guides and reindeer must be changed would have prolonged the journey far beyond the time which i had allotted to the north i began to doubt also whether one would be sufficiently repaid for the great fatigue and danger which such a trip would have involved there is no sensation of which one wearies sooner than disgust and much as i enjoy a degree of barbarism in milder climates i suspected that a long companionship with lapps in a polar winter would be a little too much for me so i turned my face toward stockholm heartily glad that i had made the journey yet not dissatisfied that i was looking forward to its termination before setting out on our return i shall devote a few pages to the finns for the principal facts concerning them i am mostly indebted to mr wolley whose acquaintance with the language and residence of three years in lapland have made him perfectly familiar with the race as i have already remarked they are a more picturesque people than the swedes with stronger lights and shades of character more ardent temperaments and a more deeplyrooted national feeling they seem to be rather clannish and exclusive in fact disliking both swedes and russians and rarely intermarrying with them the sharplydefined boundaries of language and race at the head of the bothnian gulf are a striking evidence of this like their distant relatives the hungarian magyars they retain many distinct traces of their remote asiatic origin it is partly owing to this fact and partly to that curious approach of extremes which we observe in nature no less than in humanity that all suggestive traits of resemblance in these regions point to the orient rather than to europe i have already described the physical characteristics of the finns and have nothing to add except that i found the same type everywhere even among the mixedblooded quдns of kautokeino high cheekbones square strong jaws full yet firm lips low broad foreheads dark eyes and hair and a deeper warmer red on the cheeks than on those of the rosy swedes the average height is perhaps not quite equal to that of the latter race but in physical vigor i can see no inferiority and there are among them many men of splendid stature strength and proportion von buch ascribes the marked difference of stature between the finns and the lapps both living under precisely the same influences of climate to the more cleanly habits of the former and their constant use of the vaporbath but i have always found that blood and descent even where the variation from the primitive stock is but slight are more potent than climate or custom the finns have been so long christianised and civilised according to the european idea of civilisation that whatever peculiar characteristic they retain must be looked for mainly in those habits which illustrate their mental and moral natures in their domestic life they correspond in most particulars to the swedes of the same class they are passionate and therefore prone to excesses imaginative and therefore owing to their scanty education superstitious thus the religious element especially the fantastic aberrations thereof engendered by lestadius and other missionaries while it has tended greatly to repress the vice has in the same proportion increased the weakness drunkenness formerly so prevalent as to be the curse of lapland is now exceedingly rare and so are the crimes for which it is responsible the most flagrant case which has occurred in the neighborhood of muoniovara for some years past was that of a woman who attempted to poison her fatherinlaw by mixing the scrapings of lucifer matches with his coffee in order to get rid of the burden of supporting him although the evidence was very convincing the matter was hushed up in order to avoid a scandal upon the church the woman being a steadfast member in regard to drunkenness i have heard it stated that while it was formerly no unusual thing for a finn to be frozen to death in this condition the same catastrophe never befell a lapp owing to his mechanical habit of keeping his arms and feet in motion a habit which he preserves even while utterly stupefied and unconscious a singular spiritual epidemic ran through polar finland three or four years ago contemporary with the religious excitement in norwegian lapland and partly occasioned by the same reckless men it consisted of sobbings strong nervous convulsions and occasional attacks of that state of semiconsciousness called trance the subjects of which were looked upon as having been possessed by the spirit and transported to the other world where visions like those of john on patmos were revealed to them the missionaries instead of repressing this unhealthy delusion rather encouraged it and even went so far as to publish as supernatural revelations the senseless ravings of these poor deluded people the epidemic spread until there was scarcely a family some member of which was not affected by it and even yet it has not wholly subsided the fit would come upon the infected persons at any time no matter where they were or how employed it usually commenced with a convulsive catching of the breath which increased in violence accompanied by sobbing and sometimes by cries or groans until the victim was either exhausted or fell into a trance which lasted some hours the persons who were affected were always treated with the greatest respect during the attack no one ventured to smile no matter how absurd a form the visitation might take the principle of abstinence from strong drinks was promulgated about the same time and much of the temperance of the finns and lapps is undoubtedly owing the impression made upon their natures by these phenomena the same epidemic has often prevailed in the united states england and germany the barking and dancing mania which visited kentucky thirty or forty years ago and the performances of the holy rollers were even more ludicrous and unnatural such appearances are a puzzle alike to the physiologist and the philosopher their frequency shows that they are based on some weak spot in human nature and in proportion as we pity the victims we have a right to condemn those who sow the seeds of the pestilence true religion is never spasmodic it is calm as the existence of god i know of nothing more shocking than such attempts to substitute rockets and blue lights for heavens eternal sunshine so far as regards their moral character the finns have as little cause for reproach as any other people we found them as universally honest and honourable in their dealings as the northern swedes who are not surpassed in the world in this respect yet their countenances express more cunning and reserve and the virtue may be partly a negative one resulting from that indolence which characterises the frigid and the torrid zone thus also notwithstanding physical signs which denote more ardent animal passions than their neighbors they are equally chaste and have as high a standard of sexual purity illegitimate births are quite rare and are looked upon as a lasting shame and disgrace to both parties the practice of bundling which until recently was very common among finnish lovers very seldom led to such results and their marriage speedily removed the dishonour their manners socially in this respect are curiously contradictory thus while both sexes freely mingle in the bath in a state of nature while the women unhesitatingly scrub rub and dry their husbands brothers or male friends while the salutation for both sexes is an embrace with the right arm a kiss is considered grossly immodest and improper a finnish woman expressed the greatest astonishment and horror at hearing from mr wolley that it was a very common thing in england for a husband and wife to kiss each other if my husband were to attempt such a thing said she i would beat him about the ears so that he would feel it for a week yet in conversation they are very plain and unreserved though by no means gross they acknowledge that such things as generation gestation and parturition exist and it may be that this very absence of mystery tends to keep chaste so excitable and imaginative a race notwithstanding their superstition their love of poetry and the wild rich musical character of their language there is a singular absence of legendary lore in this part of finland perhaps this is owing to the fact that their ancestors have emigrated hither principally within the last two centuries from the early home of the race tavastland the shores of the pajana lake and the gulf of finland it is a difficult matter to preserve family traditions among them or even any extended genealogical record from the circumstance that a finn takes his name not only from his fathers surname but from his residence thus isaaki takes the name of anderinpoika from his father anderi and adds niemi the local name of his habitation his son nils will be called nils isakipoika with the addition of the name of his residence wherever that may be and his family name will be changed as often as his house there may be a dozen different names in the course of one generation and the list soon becomes too complicated and confused for an uneducated memory it is no wonder therefore that the finn knows very little except about what happened during his own life or at best his fathers i never heard the kalewala spoken of and doubt very much whether it is known to the natives of this region the only songs we heard north of haparanda were hymns devout but dismal there must be ballads and household songs yet alive but the recent spiritual fever has silenced them for the time i was at first a little surprised to find the natives of the north so slow indolent and improvident we have an idea that a cold climate is bracing and stimulating ergo the further north you go the more active and energetic you will find the people but the touch of ice is like that of fire the tropics relax the pole benumbs and the practical result is the same in both cases in the long long winter when there are but four hours of twilight to twenty of darkness when the cows are housed the wood cut the hay gathered the barley bran and fir bark stowed away for bread and the summers catch of fish salted what can a man do when his load of wood or hay is hauled home but eat gossip and sleep to bed at nine and out of it at eight in the morning smoking and dozing between the slow performance of his few daily duties he becomes at last as listless and dull as a hibernating bear in the summer he has perpetual daylight and need not hurry besides why should he give himself special trouble to produce an unusually large crop of flax or barley when a single night may make his labours utterly profitless even in midsummer the blighting frost may fall nature seems to take a cruel pleasure in thwarting him he is fortunate only through chance and thus a sort of arab fatalism and acquiescence in whatever happens takes possession of him his improvidence is also to be ascribed to the same cause such fearful famine and suffering as existed in finland and lapland during the winter of might no doubt have been partially prevented but no human power could have wholly forestalled it the polar zone was never designed for the abode of man in the preadamite times when england was covered with palmforests and elephants ranged through siberia things may have been widely different and the human race then if there was any may have planted vineyards on these frozen hills and lived in bamboo huts but since the geological йmeutes and revolutions and the establishment of the terrestrial rйgime i cannot for the life of me see whatever induced beings endowed with human reason to transplant themselves hither and here take root while such vast spaces lie waste and useless in more genial climes a man may be pardoned for remaining where the providences of birth and education have thrown him but i cannot excuse the first colonists for inflicting such a home upon centuries of descendants compare even their physical life the pure animal satisfaction in existence for that is not a trifling matter after all with that of the nubians or the malays or the polynesians it is the difference between a poor hare hunted and worried year after year by hounds and visions of hounds and the familiar confiding wren happiest of creatures because secure of protection everywhere oh that the circle of the ecliptic would coincide with that of the equator that the sun would shine from pole to pole for evermore and all lands be habitable and hospitable and the saharan sands according to fourier be converted into bowers of the hesperides and the bitter salt of the ocean brine vide the same author become delicious champagne punch wherein it would be pleasure to drown but i am afraid that mankind is not yet fit for such a millennium meanwhile it is truly comforting to find that even here where men live under such discouraging circumstances that one would charitably forgive them the possession of many vices they are according to their light fully as true and honest and pure as the inhabitants of the most favoured countries in the world love for each other trust in each other faith in god are all vital among them and their shortcomings are so few and so easily accounted for that one must respect them and feel that his faith in man is not lessened in knowing them you who spend your lives at home can never know how much good there is in the world in rude unrefined races evil naturally rises to the surface and one can discern the character of the stream beneath its scum it is only in the highest civilisation where the outside is goodly to the eye too often concealing an interior foul to the core but i have no time to moralise on these matters my duty is that of a chronicler and if i perform that conscientiously the lessons which my observations suggest will need no pointing out i cannot close this chapter however without confessing my obligations to mr wolley whose thorough knowledge of the lapps and finns enabled me to test the truth of my own impressions and to mature opinions which i should otherwise from my own short experience have hesitated in stating mr wolley with that pluck and persistence of english character which emerson so much admires had made himself master of all that lapland can furnish to the traveller but intended remaining another year for scientific purposes if he gives to the world as i hope and trust he will the result of this long and patient inquiry and investigation we shall have at last a standard authority for this littleknown corner of europe we were also indebted to mr wolley for much personal kindness which i take pleasure in acknowledging in the only way he cannot prevent chapter xiv experiences of arctic weather we bade a final adieu to muoniovara on the afternoon of the th of january leaving mr wolley to wait for june and the birds in that dismal seclusion instead of resuming skjuts we engaged horses as far as kengis from herr forstrцm and a neighbouring finn with a couple of shockheaded natives as postillions our sleds were mounted upon two rough finnish sledges the only advantage of which was to make harder work for the horses but the people would have it so the sun was down but a long long twilight succeeded with some faint show of a zodiacal light there was a tolerable track on the river but our finns walked their horses the whole way and we were nearly seven hours in making parkajoki the air was very sharp my nose feet and hands kept me busily employed and i began to fear that i was becoming unusually sensitive to cold for the thermometer indicated but below zero when we started at parkajoki however my doubts were removed and my sensations explained on finding that the temperature had fallen to below we slept warmly and well on our old bed of reindeer skins in one corner of the milkroom when braisted who rose first opened the door a thick white mist burst in and rolled heavily along the floor i went out attired only in my shirt and drawers to have a look at the weather i found the air very still and keen though not painfully cold but i was still full of the warmth of sleep the mercury however had sunk into the very bulb of the thermometer and was frozen so solid that i held it in the full glare of the fire for about a minute and a half before it thawed sufficiently to mount the temperature was probably below zero if not more greater than any we had yet experienced but it was six oclock and we must travel fortifying ourselves with coffee and a little meat and relying for defence in case of extremity on a bottle of powerful rum with which we had supplied ourselves we muffled up with more than usual care and started for kihlangi we devoted ourselves entirely to keeping warm and during the ride of six hours suffered very little except from the gradual diminution of our bodily temperature it was a dreary journey following the course of the muonio between black snowladen forests the sun rose to a height of seven or eight degrees at meridian when we came over the same road on our way north he only showed half his disc at kihlangi the people recognised us and were as well disposed as their stupidity would allow the old woman cooked part of our reindeer joint which with half a dozen cups of strong coffee brought back a comfortable warmth to our extremities there were still twentyfour miles to be traversed the horses were already exhausted and the temperature only rose to at midday after which it fell again we had a terrible journey step by step the horses slowly pulled us through the snow every hour seeming lengthened to a day as we worked our benumbed fingers and toes until the muscles were almost powerless and yet it was dangerous to cease gradually the blood grew colder in the main channels insidious chills succeeded followed by a drowsy torpor like that which is produced by a heavy dose of opium until we were fain to have recourse to the rum a horrid vitriolic beverage which burned our throats and stomachs like melted lead yet gave us a temporary relief we almost despaired of reaching jokijalka on finding about ten oclock at night that our postillions had taken us to the village of kolare and stopped before a large log house where they seemed to think we would spend the night everybody had gone to bed we knew not where we were and had set our hearts upon the comfortable guests room at jokijalka it was impossible to make the fellows understand me but they saw that we were angry and after a short consultation passed on we again entered the snowy woods which were dimly lighted up by an aurora behind us a strange mysterious ghastly illumination like the phosphorescent glow of a putrefying world we were desperately cold our very blood freezing in our veins and our limbs numb and torpid to keep entirely awake was impossible we talked incessantly making random answers as continual fleeting dreams crossed the current of our consciousness a heavy thump on the back was pardoned by him who received it and a punch between the eyes would have been thankfully accepted had it been necessary at last at last kolare church on the river bank came in sight we crossed to the russian side and drove into the yard of the inn it was nearly midnight below zero and we had been for seventeen hours exposed to such a temperature everybody had long been asleep locks and bolts are unknown however so we rushed into the family room lit fir splinters and inspected the faces of the sleeping group until we found the landlord who arose and kindled a fresh fire in the milkroom they made us coffee and a small bed saying that the guests room was too cold which indeed it was being little less than the outside temperature on opening the door in the morning the cold air rushed in as thick and white as steam we had a little meat cooked but could not eat enough at such an early hour to supply much fuel as for taking anything with us for refreshment on the road it was out of the question one of our finns turned back to muoniovara with the laziest horse and we got another from our russian landlord but it was a long long journey to the next station twenty miles and the continuance of the extreme cold began to tell upon us this part of the road was very heavy as on the journey up seemingly a belt of exposed country where the snow drifts more than elsewhere at kexisvara we found two of the three pleasant women who cooked our last fragment of reindeer meat and sent off for horses to kardis we here parted with our other finn very glad to get rid of his horse and take a fresh start we had no difficulty now in making our way with the people as they all recognised us and remembered our overpayments besides which i had enlarged my finnish vocabulary at muoniovara our horses were better our sledges lighter and we were not long in reaching the ironworks at kengis which we passed at dusk i should willingly have called upon the hospitable brukpatron but we were in too great a hurry to get out of the frigid zone we were warmed by our meal and sang lustily as we slid down the torneе finding its dreary sparselysettled banks cheerful and smiling by contrast with the frightful solitudes we had left after some hours the postillion stopped before a house on the swedish bank to hay his horses we went up and found a single inhabitant a man who was splitting fir for torches but the conversation was limited to alternate puffs from our pipes there was a fine aurora behind us a low arch of white fire with streamers radiating outward shifting and dancing along its curve it was nearly ten oclock before we reached kardis half unconscious from the cold our horse ran into the wrong place and we lost sight of the baggagesled our only guide in the darkness we could no longer trust the animals instinct but had to depend on our own which is perhaps truer at least i have often found in myself traces of that blind unreasoning faculty which guides the bee and the bird and have never been deceived in trusting to it we found the inn and carried a cloud of frozen vapor into the kitchen with us as we opened the door the graceful wreaths of icesmoke rolled before our feet as before those of ascending saints in the old pictures but ourselves hair from head to foot except two pairs of eyes which looked out through icy loopholes resembled the reverse of saints i told the landlord in finnish that we wanted to sleep mia tarvi nuku б he pointed to a bed in the corner out of which rose a sick girl of about seventeen very pale and evidently suffering they placed some benches near the fire removed the bedding and disposed her as comfortably as the place permitted we got some hot milk and hard bread threw some reindeer skins on the vacant truck and lay down but not to sleep much the room was so close and warm and the dozen persons in it so alternately snoring and restless that our rest was continually disturbed we therefore rose early and aroused the lazy natives the cold was still at below zero the roads were so much better however that we descended again to our own runners and our lively horses trotted rapidly down the torneе the signs of settlement and comparative civilisation which now increased with every mile were really cheering part of our way lay through the swedish woods and over the intervening morasses where the firs were hung with weepers of blackgreen moss and stood solid and silent in their mantles of snow lighted with a magnificent golden flush at sunrise the morning was icyclear and dazzling there was not the least warmth in the suns rays but it was pleasant to see him with a white face once more we could still stare at him without winking but the reflection from the jewelled snow pained our eyes the cold was so keen that we were obliged to keep our faces buried between our caps and boas leaving only the smallest possible vacancy for the eyes this was exceedingly disagreeable on account of the moisture from the breath which kept the squirrel tails constantly wet and sticky nevertheless the cold penetrated through the little aperture my eyes and forehead were like marble the eyeballs like lumps of ice sending a sharp pang of cold backward into the brain i realised distinctly how a statue must feel beyond pello where we stopped to fire up our road lay mostly on the russian side while crossing the torneе at sunset we met a drove of seventy or eighty reindeer in charge of a dozen lapps who were bringing a cargo from haparanda we were obliged to turn off the road and wait until they had passed the landlord at juoxengi who was quite drunk hailed us with a shout and a laugh and began talking about kautokeino we had some difficulty in getting rid of his conversation and his importunities for us to stay all night this was the place where they tried to make us leave on the way up i replied to the landlords torrent of finnish with some choice specimens of kentucky oratory which seemed to make but little impression on him he gave us excellent horses however and we sped away again by the light of another brilliant auroral arch our long exposure to the extreme cold coupled as it was with lack of rest and nourishment now began to tell upon us our temperature fell so low that we again had recourse to the rum which alone i verily believe prevented us from freezing bodily one is locked in the iron embrace of the polar air until the very life seems to be squeezed out of him i huddled myself in my poesk worked my fingers and toes buried my nose in the damp frozen fur and laboured like a hercules to keep myself awake and alive but almost in vain braisted and i kept watch over each other or attempted it for about the only consciousness either of us had was that of the peril of falling asleep we talked of anything and everything sang thumped each other but the very next minute would catch ourselves falling over the side of the sled a thousand dreams worried my brain and mixed themselves with my talk and the absurdities thus created helped to arouse me speaking of seeing some wolves in the woods of california i gravely continued i took out my sword sharpened it on the grindstone and dared him to come on when a punch in the ribs stopped me another time while talking of hippopotami in the white nile i said if you want any skins you must go to the hudsons bay company they have a depфt of them on vancouvers island braisted gave me much trouble by assuring me in the most natural wideawake voice that he was not in the least sleepy when the reins had dropped from his hands and his head rocked on his shoulder i could never be certain whether he was asleep or awake our only plan was not to let the conversation flag a minute at torakankorwa we changed horses without delay and hurried on to matarengi on turning out of the road to avoid a haysled we were whirled completely over there was no fun in this at such a time i fell head foremost into deep snow getting a lump in my right eye which completely blinded me for a time my forehead eyebrows and the bridge of my nose were insufferably painful on reaching matarengi i found my nose frozen through and considerably swollen the people were in bed but we went into the kitchen where a dozen or more were stowed about and called for the landlord three young girls who were in bed in one corner rose and dressed themselves in our presence without the least hesitation boiled some milk and gave us bread and butter we had a single small bed which kept us warm by obliging us to lie close sometime in the night two swedes arrived who blustered about and made so much noise that braisted finally silenced them by threats of personal violence delivered in very good english in the morning the mercury froze after showing below zero the cold was by this time rather alarming especially after our experiences of the previous day the air was hazy with the fine frozen atoms of moisture a raw wind blew from the north the sky was like steel which has been breathed upon in short the cold was visible to the naked eye we warmed our gloves and boots and swathed our heads so completely that not a feature was to be seen i had a little loophole between my cap and boa but it was soon filled up with frost from my breath and helped to keep in the warmth the road was hard and smooth as marble we had good horses and leaving avasaxa and the polar circle behind us we sped down the solid bed of the torneе to niemis on the second stage we began to freeze for want of food the air was really terrible nobody ventured out of doors who could stay in the house the smoke was white and dense like steam the wind was a blast from the norsemans hell and the touch of it on your face almost made you scream nothing can be more severe flaying branding with a hot iron cutting with a dull knife c may be something like it but no worse the sun rose through the frozen air a little after nine and mounted quite high at noon at pдckilд we procured some hot milk and smoked reindeer tolerable horses and a stout boy of fourteen to drive our baggagesled every one we met had a face either frozen or about to freeze such a succession of countenances fiery red purple blue black almost with white frost spots and surrounded with rings of icy hair and fur i never saw before we thanked god again and again that our faces were turned southward and that the deadly wind was blowing on our backs when we reached korpikilд our boys face though solid and greasy as a bag of lard was badly frozen his nose was quite white and swollen as if blistered by fire and there were frozen blotches on both cheeks the landlord rubbed the parts instantly with rum and performed the same operation on our noses on this day for the first time in more than a month we saw daylight and i cannot describe how cheering was the effect of those pure white brilliant rays in spite of the iron landscape they illumined it was no longer the setting light of the level arctic sun not the twilight gleams of shifting colour beautiful but dim not the faded mock daylight which sometimes glimmered for a halfhour at noon but the true white full golden day which we had almost forgotten so nearly indeed that i did not for some time suspect the cause of the unusual whiteness and brightness its effect upon the trees was superb the twigs of the birch and the needles of the fir were coated with crystal and sparkled like jets of jewels spouted up from the immaculate snow the clumps of birches can be compared to nothing but frozen fountains frozen in full action with their showery sheaves of spray arrested before they fell it was a wonderful a fairy world we beheld too beautiful to be lifeless but every face we met reminded us the more that this was the chill beauty of death of dead nature death was in the sparkling air in the jewelled trees in the spotless snow take off your mitten and his hand will grasp yours like a vice uncover your mouth and your frozen lips will soon acknowledge his kiss even while i looked the same icy chills were running through my blood precursors of that drowsy torpor which i was so anxious to avoid but no it would come and i dozed until both hands became so stiff that it was barely possible to restore their powers of motion and feeling it was not quite dark when we reached kuckula the last station but thence to haparanda our horses were old and lazy and our postillion was a little boy whose weak voice had no effect braisted kept his hands warm in jerking and urging but i sat and froze village after village was passed but we looked in vain for the lights of torneе we were thoroughly exhausted with our five days battle against the dreadful cold when at last a row of lights gleamed across the river and we drove up to the inn the landlord met us with just the same words as on the first visit and strange enough put us into the same room where the same old norrland merchant was again quartered in the same stage of tipsiness the kind fredrika did not recognise us in our lapp dresses until i had unrobed when she cried out in joyful surprise why you were here before we had been so completely chilled that it was a long time before any perceptible warmth returned but a generous meal with a bottle of what was called gammal scherry though the devil and his servants the manufacturers of chemical wines only knew what it was started the flagging circulation we then went to bed tingling and stinging in every nerve from the departing cold every one complained of the severity of the weather which we were told had not been equalled for many years past but such a bed and such a rest as i had lying between clean sheets with my feet buried in soft fur i wallowed in a flood of downy delicious sensations until sunrise in the morning we ventured to wash our faces and brush our teeth for the first time in five days put on clean shirts and felt once more like responsible beings the natives never wash when the weather is so cold and cautioned us against it the wind had fallen but the mercury again froze at below zero nevertheless we went out after breakfast to call upon dr wretholm and walk over the torneе the old doctor was overjoyed to see us again ah said he it is a good fortune that you have got back alive when the weather was so cold i thought of you travelling over the norwegian fjeller and thought you must certainly be frozen to death his wife was no less cordial in her welcome they brought us ale and swedish punch with reindeer cheese for our frozen noses and insisted on having their horse put into the sled to take us over to torneе and bring us back to dinner the doctors boy drove us facing the wind with our faces exposed at but one nights rest and good food enabled us to bear it without inconvenience torneе is a plain swedish town more compactly built than haparanda yet scarcely larger the old church is rather picturesque and there were some tolerable houses which appeared to be government buildings but the only things particularly russian which we noticed were a cossack sentry whose purple face showed that he was nearly frozen and a guidepost with versts to uleaborg upon it on returning to the doctors we found a meal ready with a capital salad of frozen salmon bouillon ale and coffee the family were reading the swedish translation of dred in the aftonblad and were interested in hearing some account of mrs beecher stowe we had a most agreeable and interesting visit to these kind simplehearted people i made a sunset sketch of torneе i proposed also to draw fredrika but she at once refused in great alarm not for anything in the world said she would i have it done what superstitious fears possessed her i could not discover we made arrangements to start for kalix the next day on our way to stockholm the extreme temperature still continued the air was hazy with the frozen moisture the smoke froze in solid masses the snow was brittle and hard as metal iron stuck like glue in short none of the signs of an arctic winter were wanting nevertheless we trusted to the days rest and fatter fare on the road for strength to continue the battle chapter xv incidents of the return journey we left haparanda on the th of january after six days of true arctic weather severer than any registered by de havens expedition during a winter in the polar ice the temperature rose suddenly to below zero we were happy and jolly at getting fairly started for stockholm at last and having such mild weather to travel in the difference in our sensations was remarkable we could boldly bare our faces and look about us our feet kept warm and glowing and we felt no more the hazardous chill and torpor of the preceding days on the second stage the winter road crossed an arm of the bothnian gulf the path was well marked out with firtrees a pretty avenue four or five miles in length over the broad white plain on the way we saw an eruption of the ice which had been violently thrown up by the confined air masses three feet thick and solid as granite were burst asunder and piled atop of each other we travelled too fast this day for the proper enjoyment of the wonderful scenery on the road i thought i had exhausted my admiration of these winter forests but no miracles will never cease such fountains candelabra gothic pinnacles tufts of plumes colossal sprays of coral and the embodiments of the fairy pencillings of frost on window panes wrought in crystal and silver are beyond the power of pen or pencil it was a wilderness of beauty we knew not where to look nor which forms to choose in the dazzling confusion silent and all unmoved by the wind they stood sharp and brittle as of virgin ore not trees of earth but the glorified forests of allfather odins paradise the celestial city of asgaard no living forms of vegetation are so lovely tropical palms the treeferns of penang the lotus of indian rivers the feathery bamboo the arrowy areca what are they beside these marvellous growths of winter these shining sprays of pearl ivory and opal gleaming in the soft orange light of the arctic sun at sдngis we met a handsome young fellow with a moustache who proved to be the lдnsman of kalix i was surprised to find that he knew all about us he wondered at our coming here north when we might stay at home thought once would be enough for us and had himself been no further than stockholm i recognised our approach to nдsby by the barrels set in the snow an ingenious plan of marking the road in places where the snow drifts as the wind creates a whirl or eddy around them we were glad to see nдsby and its twostory inn once more the pleasant little handmaiden smiled all over her face when she saw us again nдsby is a crack place the horses were ready at once and fine creatures they were taking us up the kalix to mеnsbyn eight miles in one hour the road was hard as a rock and smooth as a table from much ploughing and rolling the next day was dark and lowering threatening snow with a raw wind from the northwest and an average temperature of below zero we turned the northwestern corner of the bothnian gulf in the afternoon and pushed on to old luleе by suppertime at persц on the journey north i had forgotten my cigarcase an old familiar friend of some years standing and was overjoyed to find that the servantgirl had carefully preserved it thinking i might return some day we drove through the streets of empty stables and past the massive church of old luleе to the inn where we had before met the surly landlord there he was again and the house was full as the first time however we obtained the promise of a bed in the large room and meanwhile walked up and down to keep ourselves warm the guests rooms were filled with gentlemen of the neighborhood smoking and carousing after an hour had passed a tall handsome strong fellow came out of the rooms and informed us that as we were strangers he would give up the room to us and seek lodgings elsewhere he had drunk just enough to be mellow and happy and insisted on delaying his own supper to let us eat first who should come along at this juncture but the young fellow we had seen in company with brother horton at mеnsbyn who hailed us with thank you for the last time with him was a very gentlemanly man who spoke english they were both accompanied by ladies and were returning from the ball of piteе the guests all treated us with great courtesy and respect and the landlord retired and showed his surly face no more our first friend informed me that he had been born and brought up in the neighborhood but could not recollect such a severe winter as we descended upon the luleе river in the morning we met ten sleighs coming from the ball the horses were all in requisition at the various stations but an extra supply had been provided and we were not detained anywhere the norrland sleds are so long that a man may place his baggage in the front part and lie down at full length behind it a high back shields the traveller from the wind and upon a step in the rear stands the driver with a pair of reins as long as a maintopbowline in order to reach the horse who is at the opposite end of a very long pair of shafts in these sleds one may travel with much comfort and less danger of overturning though not so great speed as in the short light open frames we bought in sundsvall the latter are seldom seen so far north and were a frequent object of curiosity to the peasants at the stations there is also a sled with a body something like a hansom cab entirely closed with a window in front but they are heavy easily overturned and only fit for luxurious travellers we approached piteе at sunset the view over the broad embouchure of the river studded with islands was quite picturesque and the town itself scattered along the shore and over the slopes of the hills made a fair appearance it reminded me somewhat of a small newengland country town with its square frame houses and an occasional garden here i was rejoiced by the sight of a cherrytree the most northern fruittree which i saw on our way up we thought piteе at night and in a snowstorm next door to the north pole now coming from the north seeing its snowy hills and houseroofs rosy with the glow of sunset it was warm and southern by contrast the four principal towns of west and north bothnia are thus characterised in an old verse of swedish doggerel umeе the fine piteе the needlemaking luleе the lazy and in torneе everybody gets drunk we took some refreshment pushed on and reached abyn between nine and ten oclock having travelled seventy miles since morning the sleighing was superb how i longed for a dashing american cutter with a span of fast horses a dozen strings of bells and an ebony driver such a turnout would rather astonish the northern solitudes and the slow quaint northern population the next day we had a temperature of above zero with snow falling but succeeded in reaching skellefteе for breakfast for the last two or three miles we travelled along a hillside overlooking a broad beautiful valley cleared and divided into cultivated fields and thickly sprinkled with villages and farmhouses skellefteе itself made an imposing appearance as the lofty dome of its grecian church came in sight around the shoulder of the hill we took the wrong road and in turning about split one of our shafts but braisted served it with some spare rope using the hatchethandle as a marlingspike so that it held stoutly all the rest of the way to stockholm we went on to burea that night and the next day to djekneboda sixty miles farther the temperature fluctuated about the region of zero with a heavy sky and light snowfalls as we proceeded southward the forests became larger and the trees began to show a dark green foliage where the wind had blown away the snow which was refreshing to see after the black or dark indigo hue they wear farther north on the th of february at noon we passed through umeе and congratulated ourselves on getting below the southern limit of the lapland climate there is nothing to say about these towns they are mere villages with less than a thousand inhabitants each and no peculiar interest either local or historical attaching to any of them we have slept in luleе and piteе and dined in umeе and further my journal saith not the th however was a day to be noticed we started from angersjц with a violent snow storm blowing in our teeth thermometer at zero our road entered the hilly country of norrland where we found green forests beautiful little dells pleasant valleys and ash and beech intermingled with the monotonous but graceful purple birch we were overwhelmed with gusts of fine snow shaken from the trees as we passed blinding white clouds swept the road and once again we heard the howl of the wind among boughs that were free to toss at afwa which we reached at one oclock we found a pale weak sickly young swede with faded moustaches who had decided to remain there until next day this circumstance induced us to go on but after we had waited half an hour and were preparing to start the weather being now ten times worse than before he announced his resolution to start also he had drunk four large glasses of milk and two cups of coffee during the half hour we went ahead breaking through drifts of loose snow which overtopped our sleds and lashed by the furious wind which drove full in our faces there were two or three plows at work but we had no benefit from them so long as we were not directly in their wake up and down went our way over dark hills and through valleys wild with the storm and ending in chaos as they opened toward the bothnian gulf hour after hour passed by the storm still increased and the snow beat in our eyes so that we were completely blinded it was impossible to keep them open and yet the moment we shut them the lashes began to freeze together i had a heavy weight of ice on my lids and long icicles depending from every corner of my beard yet our frozen noses appeared to be much improved by the exposure and began to give promise of healing without leaving a red blotch as a lasting record of what they had endured we finally gave up all attempts to see or to guide the horse but plunged along at random through the chaos until the postillion piloted our baggagesled into the innyard of onska and our horse followed it the swede was close upon our heels but i engaged a separate room so that we were freed from the depressing influence of his company he may have been the best fellow in the world so far as his heart was concerned but was too weak in the knees to be an agreeable associate there was no more stiffness of fibre in him than in a wet towel and i would as soon wear a damp shirt as live in the same room with such a man after all it is not strange that one prefers nerve and energy even when they are dashed with a flavour of vice to the negative virtues of a character too weak and insipid to be tempted our inn in this little norrland village was about as comfortable and as elegant as threefourths of the hotels in stockholm the rooms were well furnished none of the usual appliances were wanting the attendance was all that could be desired the fare good and abundant and the charges less than half of what would be demanded in the capital yet stockholm small as it is claims to be for sweden what paris is to france and its inhabitants look with an eye of compassion on those of the provinces norrland in spite of its long winter has a bracing healthy climate and had it not been for letters from home facilities for studying swedish occasional recreation and the other attractions of a capital i should have preferred waiting in some of those wild valleys for the spring to open the people notwithstanding their seclusion from the world have a brighter and more intelligent look than the peasants of uppland and were there a liberal system of common school education in sweden the raw material here might be worked up into products alike honourable and useful to the country the norrlanders seem to me to possess an indolent almost phlegmatic temperament and yet there are few who do not show a latent capacity for exertion the latter trait perhaps is the true core and substance of their nature the former is an overgrowth resulting from habits and circumstances like the peasants or rather small farmers further north they are exposed to the risk of seeing their summers labours rendered fruitless by a single night of frost such a catastrophe which no amount of industry and foresight can prevent recurring frequently perhaps once in three years on an average makes them indifferent if not reckless while that patience and cheerfulness which is an integral part of the scandinavian as of the saxon character renders them contented and unrepining under such repeated disappointments there is the stuff here for a noble people although nature and a long course of neglect and misrule have done their best to destroy it the norrlanders live simply perhaps frugally but there seems to be little real destitution among them we saw sometimes in front of a church a representation of a beggar with his hat in his hand under which was an iron box with an appeal to travellers to drop something in for the poor of the parish but of actual beggars we found none the houses although small are warm and substantial mostly with double windows and a little vestibule in front of the door to create an intermediate temperature between the outer and inner air the beds even in many of the inns are in the family room but during the day are either converted into sofas or narrow frames which occupy but little space at night the bedstead is drawn out to the required breadth single or double as may be desired the family room is always covered with a strong homemade rag carpet the walls generally hung with colored prints and lithographs illustrating religion or royalty and as many greenhouse plants as the owner can afford to decorate the windows i have seen even beyond umeе some fine specimens of cactus pelargonium calla and other exotics it is singular that with the universal passion of the swedes for flowers and for music they have produced no distinguished painters or composers but indeed a linnжus we spent the evening cosily in the stately inns best room with its white curtains polished floor and beds of sumptuous linen the great clipperplows were out early in the morning to cut a path through the drifts of the storm but it was nearly noon before the road was sufficiently cleared to enable us to travel the temperature by contrast with what we had so recently endured seemed almost tropical actually above zero with a soft southern breeze and patches of brilliant blue sky between the parting clouds our deliverance from the arctic cold was complete chapter xvi conclusion of the arctic trip on leaving onska we experienced considerable delay on account of the storm the roads were drifted to such an extent that even the ploughs could not be passed through in many places and the peasants were obliged to work with their broad wooden spades the sky however was wholly clear and of a pure daylight blue such as we had not seen for two months the sun rode high in the firmament like a strong healthy sun again with some warmth in his beams as they struck our faces and the air was all mildness and balm it was heavenly after our arctic life the country too boldly undulating with firforested hills green and warm in the sunshine and wild picturesque valleys sunk between shining in their covering of snow charmed us completely again we saw the soft blue of the distant ranges as they melted away behind each other suggesting space and light and warmth give me daylight and sunshine after all our arctic trip seems like a long long night full of splendid dreams but yet night and not day on the road we bought a quantity of the linen handkerchiefs of the country at prices varying from twentyfive to forty cents a piece according to the size and quality the bedding in all the inns was of homemade linen and i do not recollect an instance where it was not brought out fresh and sweet from the press for us in this as in all other household arrangements the people are very tidy and cleanly though a little deficient as regards their own persons their clothing however is of a healthy substantial character and the women consult comfort rather than ornament many of them wear cloth pantaloons under their petticoats which therefore they are able to gather under their arms in wading through snowdrifts i did not see a lownecked dress or a thin shoe north of stockholm the damsel who trips at daybreak is shod like a mountaineer yet a sensible man would sooner take such a damsel to wife than any delicate cinderella of the ballroom i protest i lose all patience when i think of the habits of our american women especially our country girls if ever the saxon race does deteriorate on our side of the atlantic as some ethnologists anticipate it will be wholly their fault we stopped for the night at hцrnдs and had a charming ride the next day among the hills and along the inlets of the gulf the same bold picturesque scenery which had appeared so dark and forbidding to us on our way north now under the springlike sky cheered and inspired us at the station of docksta we found the peasant girls scrubbing the outer steps barefooted at night we occupied our old quarters at weda on the angermann river the next morning the temperature was above zero and at noon rose to it was delightful to travel once more with caplappets turned up fur collar turned down face and neck free and hands bare on our second stage we had an overgrown insolent boy for postillion who persisted in driving slow and refused to let us pass him he finally became impertinent whereupon braisted ran forward and turned his horse out of the road so that i could drive past the boy then seized my horse by the head b pitched him into a snowbank and we took the lead we had not gone far before we took the road to hernцsand through mistake and afterwards kept it through spite thus adding about seven miles to our days journey a stretch of magnificent darkgreen forests brought us to a narrow strait which separates the island of hernцsand from the main land the ice was already softening and the upper layer repeatedly broke through under us hernцsand is a pretty town of about inhabitants with a considerable commerce it is also the capital of the most northern bishopric of sweden the church on an eminence above the town is next to that of skellefteе the finest we saw in the north we took a walk while breakfast was preparing and in the space of twenty minutes saw all there was to be seen by leaving the regular road however we had incurred a delay of two hours which did not add to our amiability therefore when the postillion furiously angry now as well as insolent came in to threaten us with legal prosecution in case we did not pay him heavy damages for what he called an assault i cut the discussion short by driving him out of the room and that was the last we saw of him we reached fjдl as the moon rose a globe of silver fire in a perfect violet sky two merry boys who sang and shouted the whole way drove us like the wind around the hay to wifsta the moonlight was as bright as the arctic noonday and the snowy landscape flashed and glittered under its resplendent shower from the last hill we saw sundsvall which lay beneath us with its wintry roofs like a city of ivory and crystal shining for us with the fairy promise of a warm supper and a good bed on the th we drove along the shores of the magnificent bay of sundsvall six vessels lay frozen in at a considerable distance from the town near the southern extremity of the bay we passed the village of svartvik which the postillion informed us is all owned by one person who carries on shipbuilding the appearance of the place justified his statements the labourers houses were mostly new all built on precisely the same model and with an unusual air of comfort and neatness in the centre of the village stood a handsome white church with a clock tower and near it the parsonage and schoolhouse at the foot of the slope were the yards where several vessels were on the stocks and a number of sturdy workmen busy at their several tasks there was an air of associated labour and the model lodginghouse about the whole place which was truly refreshing to behold except a touch of barren utilitarianism in the cutting away of the graceful firs left from the forest and thus depriving the houses of all shade and ornament we met many woodteams hauling knees and spars and were sorely troubled to get out of their way beyond the bay the hills of norrland ceased sinking into those broad monotonous undulations which extend nearly all the way to stockholm gardens with thriving fruittrees now began to be more frequent giving evidence of a climate where man has a right to live i doubt whether it was ever meant that the human race should settle in any zone so frigid that fruit cannot ripen thenceforth we had the roughest roads which were ever made upon a foundation of snow the increase in travel and in the temperature of the air and most of all the short looselyattached sleds used to support the shiptimber had worn them into a succession of holes channels and troughs in and out of which we thumped from morning till night on going down hill the violent shocks frequently threw our runners completely into the air and the wrench was so great that it was a miracle how the sled escaped fracture all the joints it is true began to work apart and the ash shafts bent in the most ticklish way but the rough little conveyance which had already done us such hard service held out gallantly to the end we reached mo myskie on the second night after leaving sundsvall and i was greeted with salaam aleikoom ya sidi from the jolly old tripolitan landlord there was an unusual amount of travel northward on the following day and we were detained at every station so that it was nearly midnight before we reached the extortionate inn at gefle the morning dawned with a snowstorm but we were within miles of stockholm and drove in the teeth of it to elfkarleby the renowned cascades of the dal were by no means what i expected but it was at least a satisfaction to see living water after the silent rivers and fettered rapids of the north the snow was now getting rapidly thinner so scant was it on the exposed upsala plain that we fully expected being obliged to leave our sleds on the way even before reaching upsala our postillions chose the lesstravelled fieldroads whenever they led in the same direction and beyond that town we were charged additional postmoney for the circuits we were obliged to make to keep our runners on the snow on the evening of the th we reached rotebro only fourteen miles from stockholm and the next morning in splendid sunshine drove past haga park and palace into the northgate down the long drottninggatan and up to kahns hotel where we presented our sleds to the valetdeplace pulled off our heavy boots threw aside our furs for the remainder of the winter and sat down to read the pile of letters and papers which herr kahn brought us it was precisely two months since our departure in december and in that time we had performed a journey of miles of which were by reindeer and nearly inside of the arctic circle our frozen noses had peeled off and the new skin showed no signs of the damage they had sustained so that we had come out of the fight not only without a scar but with a marked increase of robust vitality i must confess however that interesting as was the journey and happily as we endured its exposures i should not wish to make it again it is well to see the north even after the south but as there is no one who visits the tropics without longing ever after to return again so i imagine there is no one who having once seen a winter inside the arctic circle would ever wish to see another in spite of the warm gorgeous and everchanging play of colour hovering over the path of the unseen sun in spite of the dazzling auroral dances and the magical transfiguration of the forests the absence of true daylight and of all signs of warmth and life exercises at last a depressing influence on the spirits the snow so beautiful while the sunrise setting illumination lasts wears a ghastly monotony at all other times and the air so exhilarating even at the lowest temperature becomes an enemy to be kept out when you know its terrible power to benumb and destroy to the native of a warmer zone this presence of an unseen destructive force in nature weighs like a nightmare upon the mind the inhabitants of the north also seem to undergo a species of hibernation as well as the animals nearly half their time is passed in sleep they are silent in comparison with the natives of the other parts of the world there is little exuberant gaiety and cheerfulness but patience indifference apathy almost aspects of nature which appear to be hostile to man often develop and bring into play his best energies but there are others which depress and paralyse his powers i am convinced that the extreme north like the tropics is unfavourable to the best mental and physical condition of the human race the proper zone of man lies between and north to one who has not an unusual capacity to enjoy the experiences of varied travel i should not recommend such a journey with me the realization of a longcherished desire the sense of novelty the opportunity for contrasting extremes and the interest with which the people inspired me far outweighed all inconveniences and privations in fact i was not fully aware of the gloom and cold in which i had lived until we returned far enough southward to enjoy eight hours of sunshine and a temperature above the freezing point it was a second birth into a living world although we had experienced little positive suffering from the intense cold except on the return from muoniovara to haparanda our bodies had already accommodated themselves to a low temperature and the sudden transition to above zero came upon us like the warmth of june my friend dr kane once described to me the comfort he felt when the mercury rose to below zero making it pleasant to be on deck the circumstance was then incomprehensible to me but is now quite plain i can also the better realise the terrible sufferings of himself and his men exposed to a storm in a temperature of when the same degree of cold with a very light wind turned my own blood to ice most of our physical sensations are relative and the mere enumeration of so many degrees of heat or cold gives no idea of their effect upon the system i should have frozen at home in a temperature which i found very comfortable in lapland with my solid diet of meat and butter and my garments of reindeer the following is a correct scale of the physical effect of cold calculated for the latitude of to north above zero unpleasantly warm zero mild and agreeable below zero pleasantly fresh and bracing below zero sharp but not severely cold keep your fingers and toes in motion and rub your nose occasionally below zero very cold take particular care of your nose and extremities eat the fattest food and plenty of it below intensely cold keep awake at all hazards muffle up to the eyes and test your circulation frequently that it may not stop somewhere before you know it below a struggle for life we kept a record of the temperature from the time we left sundsvall dec until our return to stockholm as a matter of interest i subjoin it changing the degrees from reaumur to fahrenheit we tested the thermometer repeatedly on the way and found it very generally reliable although in extremely low temperature it showed from one to two degrees more than a spirit thermometer the observations were taken at from to a m to p m and to p m whenever it was possible chapter xvii life in stockholm the swedes are proud of stockholm and justly so no european capital except constantinople can boast such picturesque beauty of position and none whatever affords so great a range of shifting yet ever lovely aspects travellers are fond of calling it in the imitative nomenclature of commonplace the venice of the north but it is no venice it is not that swan of the adriatic singing her deathsong in the purple sunset but a northern eaglet nested on the islands and rocky shores of the pale green mдlar lake the stad or city proper occupies three islands which lie in the mouth of the narrow strait by which the waters of the lake after having come a hundred miles from the westward and washed in their course the shores of thirteen hundred islands pour themselves into the outer archipelago which is claimed by the baltic sea on the largest of these islands according to tradition agne king of sweden was strangled with his own golden chain by the finnish princess skiolfa whom he had taken prisoner this was sixteen hundred years ago and a thousand years later birger jarl on the same spot built the stronghold which was the seed out of which stockholm has grown this island and the adjoining riddarholm or island of the knights contain all the ancient historic landmarks of the city and nearly all of its most remarkable buildings the towers of the storkyrka and the riddarholms church lift themselves high into the air the dark red mass of the riddarhus or house of nobles and the white turrets and quadrangles of the penitentiary are conspicuous among the old white tileroofed blocks of houses while rising above the whole the most prominent object in every view of stockholm is the slot or royal palace this is one of the noblest royal residences in europe standing on an immense basement terrace of granite its grand quadrangle of between three and four hundred feet square with wings resembling in general design the pitti palace at florence is elevated quite above the rest of the city which it crowns as with a mural diadem the chaste and simple majesty of this edifice and its admirable proportions are a perpetual gratification to the eye which is always drawn to it as a central point and thereby prevented from dwelling on whatever inharmonious or unsightly features there may be in the general view splendid bridges of granite connect the island with the northern and southern suburbs each of which is much greater in extent than the city proper the palace fronts directly upon the norrbro or northern bridge the great thoroughfare of stockholm which leads to the square of gustavus adolphus flanked on either side by the palace of the crown prince and the opera house the northern suburb is the fashionable quarter containing all the newest streets and the handsomest private residences the ground rises gradually from the water and as very little attention is paid to grading the streets follow the undulations of the low hills over which they spread rising to the windmills on the outer heights and sinking into the hollows between the southern suburb however is a single long hill up the steep side of which the houses climb row after row until they reach the church of st catherine which crowns the very summit in front of the city that is eastward and toward the baltic lie two other islands connected by bridges with the northern suburb still beyond is the djurgеrd or deerpark a singularly picturesque island nearly the whole of which is occupied by a public park and the summer villas of the wealthy stockholmers its natural advantages are superior to those of any other park in europe even in april when there was scarcely a sign of spring its cliffs of grey rock its rolling lawns of brown grass and its venerable oaks with their iron trunks and gnarled contorted boughs with blue glimpses of icefree water on all sides attracted hundreds of visitors daily the streets of stockholm are with but two or three exceptions narrow and badly paved the municipal regulations in regard to them appear to be sadly deficient they are quite as filthy as those of newyork and the american reader will therefore have some idea of their horrid condition a few trottoirs have been recently introduced but even in the drottninggatan the principal street they are barely wide enough for two persons to walk abreast the pavements are rough slippery and dangerous both to man and beast i have no doubt that the great number of cripples in stockholm is owing to this cause on the other hand the houses are models of solidity and stability they are all of stone or brick stuccoed over with staircases of stone or iron wood being prohibited by law and roofs of copper slate or tiles in fact the swedes have singularly luxurious ideas concerning roofs spending much more money upon them proportionately than on the house itself you even see wooden shanties with copper roofs got up regardless of expense the houses are well lighted which is quite necessary in the dark streets and supplied with double windows against the cold the airtight russian stove is universal it has the advantage of keeping up sufficient warmth with a very small supply of fuel but at the expense of ventilation i find nothing yet equal to the oldfashioned fireplace in this respect though i must confess i prefer the russian stove to our hotair furnaces carpets are very common in sweden and thus the dwellings have an air of warmth and comfort which is not found in germany and other parts of the continent the arrangements for sleeping and washing are tolerable though scanty as compared with england but the cleanliness of swedish houses makes amends for many deficiencies the manner of living in stockholm nevertheless is not very agreeable to the stranger there is no hotel except kahns where one can obtain both beds and meals the practice is to hire rooms generally with the privilege of having your coffee in the morning and to get your meals at a restaurant of which there are many tolerably cheap and not particularly good even davisons the best and most fashionable has but an ordinary cuisine rooms are quite dear particularly during our sojourn when the diet was in session and the city crowded with country visitors and the inclusive expenses of living were equal to berlin and greater than in paris i found that it cost just about as much to be stationary here as to travel with posthorses in the northern provinces the swedes generally have a cup of coffee on getting out of bed or before a substantial breakfast at nine dinner at three and tea in the evening the wealthier families dine an hour or two later but the crowds at the restaurants indicate the prevailing time dinner and frequently breakfast is prefaced with a smцrgеs buttergoose consisting of anchovies pickled herrings cheese and brandy soup which is generally sweet comes in the middle and sometimes at the end of dinner and the universal dessert is preserved fruit covered with whipped cream i have had occasion to notice the fondness of the swedes for sugar which some persons seem to apply to almost every dish except fish and oysters i have often seen them season crab soup with powdered sugar a favourite dish is raw salmon buried in the earth until it is quite sodden a great delicacy they say but i have not yet been hungry enough to eat it meat which is abundant is rarely properly cooked and game of which sweden has a great variety is injured by being swamped in sauces he must be very fastidious however who cannot live passably well in stockholm especially if he has frequent invitations to dine with private families many of whom have very excellent cooks my swedish friends all said you should see stockholm in summer you have passed the worst part of the whole year among us and you leave just when our fine days begin i needed no assurance however of the summer charm of the place in those long golden evenings which give place to an unfading twilight when the birch is a network of silver and green and the meadows are sown with the bright wild flowers of the north those labyrinths of land and water must be truly enchanting but were the glories of the northern summer increased tenfold i could not make my home where such a price must be paid for them from the time of our arrival in february until towards the close of april the weather was of that kind which aggravates one to the loss of all patience we had dull raw cloudy skies a penetrating unnerving and depressing atmosphere mud under foot alternating with slushy snow in short everything that is disagreeable in winter without its brisk and bracing qualities i found this season much more difficult to endure than all the cold of lapland and in spite of pleasant society and the charms of rest after a fatiguing journey our sojourn in stockholm was for a time sufficiently tedious at first we lived a rather secluded life in our rooms in the beridarebansgatan in the northern suburb devoting ourselves principally to gymnastics and the study of the swedish language both of which can be prosecuted to more advantage in stockholm than anywhere else for among the distinguished men of sweden may be reckoned ling the inventor of what may be termed anatomical gymnastics his system not only aims at reducing to a science the muscular development of the body but by means of both active and passive movements at reaching the seat of disease and stimulating the various organs to healthy action in the former of these objects ling has certainly succeeded there is no other system of muscular training that will bear comparison with his and if he has to some extent failed in the latter it is because with the enthusiasm of a man possessed by a new discovery he claimed too much his successor prof branting possesses equal enthusiasm and his faith in gymnastics as a panacea for all human infirmities is most unbounded the institution under his charge is supported by government and in addition to the officers of the army and navy who are obliged to make a complete gymnastic course is largely attended by invalids of all ages and classes neither of us required the system as a medical application i wished to increase the girth of my chest somewhat diminished by a sedentary life and braisted needed a safetyvalve for his surplus strength however the professor by dint of much questioning ascertained that one of us was sometimes afflicted with cold feet and the other with headaches and thereupon clapped us both upon the sick list on entering the hall on the first morning of our attendance a piece of paper containing the movements prescribed for our individual cases was stuck in our bosoms on inspecting the lists we found we had ten movements apiece and no two of them alike what they were we could only dimly guess from such cabalistic terms as stцdgеngst krhalfligg simhдng or hцgstrgrsitt the hall about eighty feet in length by thirty in height was furnished with the usual appliances for gymnastic exercises some fifty or sixty patients were present part of whom were walking up and down the middle passage with an air of great solemnity while the others gathered in various little groups on either side appeared to be undergoing uncouth forms of torture there was no voluntary exercise if i except an old gentleman in a black velvet coat who repeatedly suspended himself by the hands head downwards and who died of apoplexy not long afterwards every one was being exercised upon here a lathy young man bent sideways over a spar was struggling with a very red face to right himself while a stout teacher held him down there a corpulent gentleman in the hands of five robust assistants was having his body violently revolved upon the base of his hip joints as if they were trying to unscrew him from his legs and yonder again an individual suspended by his arms from a crossbar had his feet held up and his legs stretched apart by another while a third pounded vigorously with closed fists upon his seat of honour now and then a prolonged yell accompanied with all sorts of burlesque variations issued from the throats of the assembly the object of this was at first not clear to me but i afterwards discovered that the full use of the lungs was considered by ling a very important part of the exercises altogether it was a peculiar scene and not without a marked grotesque character on exhibiting my matsedel or bill of fare to the first teacher who happened to be disengaged i received my first movement which consisted in being held with my back against a post while i turned my body from side to side against strong resistance employing the muscles of the chest only i was then told to walk for five minutes before taking the second movement it is unnecessary to recapitulate the various contortions i was made to perform suffice it to say that i felt very sore after them which professor branting considered a promising sign and that at the end of a month i was taken off the sick list and put among the friskas or healthy patients to whom more and severer movements in part active are allotted this department was under the special charge of baron vegesach an admirable teacher and withal a master of fencing with the bayonet a branch of defensive art which the swedes have the honour of originating the drill of the young officers in bayonet exercise was one of the finest things of the kind i ever saw i prospered so well under the barons tuition that at the end of the second month i was able to climb a smooth mast to run up ropes with my hands and to perform various other previous impossibilities while my chest had increased an inch and a half in circumference the addition being solid muscle during the time of my attendance i could not help but notice the effect of the discipline upon the other patients especially the children the weak and listless gradually straightened themselves the pale and sallow took colour and lively expression the crippled and paralytic recovered the use of their limbs in short all with the exception of two or three hypochondriacs exhibited a very marked improvement the cheerfulness and geniality which pervaded the company and of which professor branting himself was the best example no doubt assisted the cure all both teachers and pupils met on a platform of the most absolute equality and willingly took turns in lending a hand wherever it was needed i have had my feet held up by a foreign ambassador while a pair of swedish counts applied the proper degree of resistance to the muscles of my arms and shoulders the result of my observation and experience was that lings system of physical education is undoubtedly the best in the world and that as a remedial agent in all cases of congenital weakness or deformity as well as in those diseases which arise from a deranged circulation its value can scarcely be overestimated it may even afford indirect assistance in more serious organic diseases but i do not believe that it is of much service in those cases where chemical agencies are generally employed professor branting however asserts that it is a specific for all diseases whatsoever including consumption malignant fevers and venereal affections one thing at least is certain that in an age when physical training is most needed and most neglected this system deserves to be introduced into every civilised country as an indispensable branch in the education of youth i found the swedish language as easy to read as it is difficult to speak correctly the simplicity of its structure which differs but slightly from english accounts for the former quality while the peculiar use of the definite article as a terminal syllable attached to the noun is a great impediment to fluent speaking the passive form of the verb also requires much practice before it becomes familiar and the mode of address in conversation is awkward and inconvenient beyond measure the word you or its correspondent is never used except in speaking to inferiors wherever it occurs in other languages the title of the person addressed must be repeated as for example how is the herr justizrеd i called at the herr justizrеds house this morning but the herr justizrеd was not at home some of the more progressive swedes are endeavouring to do away with this absurdity by substituting the second person plural ni which is already used in literature but even they only dare to use it in their own private circle the swedes especially in stockholm speak with a peculiar drawl and singing accent exactly similar to that which is often heard in scotland it is very inferior to the natural musical rhythm of spanish to which in its vocalisation swedish has a great resemblance except finnish which is music itself it is the most melodious of northern languages and the mellow flow of its poetry is often scarcely surpassed by the italian the infinitive verb always ends in a and the language is full of soft gliding iambics which give a peculiar grace to its poetry it is rather singular that the swedish prose in point of finish and elegance is far behind the swedish poetry one cause of this may be that it is scarcely more than fifty years since the prose writers of the country began to use their native language the works of linnжus swedenborg and other authors of the past century must now be translated into swedish besides there are two prose dialects a conversational and a declamatory the latter being much more artificial and involved than the former all public addresses as well as prose documents of a weighty or serious character must be spoken or written in this pompous and antiquated style owing to which naturally the country is almost destitute of orators but the poets especially men of the sparkling fancy of bellman or the rich lyrical inspiration of tegner are not to be fettered by such conventionalities and they have given the verse of sweden an ease and grace and elegance which one vainly seeks in its prose in stockholm the french taste so visible in the manners of the people has also affected the language and a number of french words and forms of expression which have filtered through society from the higher to the lower classes are now in general use the spelling however is made to conform to swedish pronunciation and one is amused at finding on placards such words as trottoar salong and paviljong no country is richer in songliterature than sweden the popular songs and ballads of the different provinces wedded to airs as original and characteristic as the words number many hundreds there are few swedes who cannot sing and i doubt whether any country in europe would be able to furnish so many fine voices yet the taste for what is foreign and unaccustomed rules and the minstrels of the cafes and the djurgеrd are almost without exception german latterly two or three bands of native singers have been formed who give concerts devoted entirely to the country melodies of sweden and i believe they have been tolerably successful in these studies relieved occasionally by rambles over the hills whenever there was an hours sunshine and by occasional evenings with swedish english and american friends we passed the months of march and april waiting for the tardy spring of the shifting and picturesque views which stockholm presents to the strangers eye from whatever point he beholds her we never wearied but we began at last to tire of our iceolation and to look forward to the reopening of the gotha canal as a means of escape day after day it was a new satisfaction to behold the majestic palace crowning the islandcity and looking far and wide over the frozen lakes the tall slender spire of the riddarholm soaring above the ashes of charles xii and gustavus adolphus was always a welcome sight but we had seen enough of the hideous statues which ornament the public squares charles xii not among them and the imbecile charles xiii occupying the best place we grew tired of the monotonous perambulators on the forrbro and the tameness and sameness of stockholm life in winter and therefore hailed the lengthening days which heralded our deliverance as to the sights of the capital are they not described in the guidebooks the champion of the reformation lies in his chapel under a cloud of his captured banners opposite to him the magnificent madman of the north with hundreds of polish and russian ensigns rustling above his heads in the royal armory you see the sword and the bloody shirt of the one the bulletpierced hat and cloak of the other still coated with the mud of the trench at fredrickshall there are robes and weapons of the other carls and gustavs but the splendour of swedish history is embodied in these two names and in that of gustavus vasa who lies entombed in the old cathedral at upsala when i had grasped their swords and the sabre of czar peter captured at narva i felt that there were no other relics in sweden which could make my heart throb a beat the faster chapter xviii manners and morals of stockholm as a people the swedes are very hospitable and particularly so toward foreigners there is perhaps no country in europe where travellers are treated with so much kindness and allowed so many social privileges this is fortunate as the conventionalities of the country are more rigid than the laws of the medes and persians nothing excites greater scandal than an infraction of the numberless little formalities with which the descendants of the honest spontaneous impulsive old scandinavians have somehow or other allowed themselves to be fettered and were not all possible allowance made for the stranger he would have but a dismal time of it notwithstanding these habits have become a second nature they are still a false nature and give a painfully stiff and constrained air to society the swedes pride themselves on being the politest people in europe voltaire called them the frenchmen of the north and they are greatly flattered by the epithet but how much better to call themselves swedes to preserve the fine manly characteristics of their ancient stock rather than imitate a people so alien to them in blood in character and in antecedents those meaningless social courtesies which sit well enough upon the gay volatile mercurial frenchman seem absurd affectations when practiced by the tall grave sedate scandinavian the intelligent swedes feel this but they are powerless to make headway against the influence of a court which was wholly french even before bernadottes time we are a race of apes said one of them to me bitterly gustavus iii was thoroughly french in his tastes but the ruin of swedish nationality in stockholm was already commenced when he ascended the throne stockholm manners at present are a curious mixture of english and french the latter element of course being predominant in costume the gentlemen are english with exaggeration nowhere are to be seen such enormously tall and stiff black chimneypots misnamed hats nowhere such straightcut overcoats descending to the very heels you might stick all the men you see into pasteboard cards like a row of pins so precisely are they clothed upon the same model but when you meet one of these grim funereal figures he pulls off his hat with a politeness which is more than french he keeps it off perhaps while he is speaking you shake hands and accept his invitation to enter his house after you are within he greets you a second time with the same ceremonies as if you had then first met he says tak for sist equivalent to thank you for the pleasure of your company the last time we met and after your visit is over you part with equal formality at dinner the guests stand gravely around the table with clasped hands before sitting down this is repeated on rising after which they bow to each other and shake hands with the host and hostess formerly they used to say i thank you for the meal a custom still retained in denmark and norway not long ago the guests were obliged to make a subsequent visit of ceremony to thank the host for his entertainment and he was obliged to invite them all to a second dinner in consequence thereof so that giving one dinner always involved giving two fortunately the obligation was cancelled by the second or the visits and dinners might have gone on alternately ad infinitum at dinners and evening parties white gloves and white cravats are invariably worn and generally white vests the same custom is observed at funerals even the drivers of the hearse and carriages being furnished with resplendent white gloves for the occasion i have a horror of white cravats and took advantage of the travellers privilege to wear a black one i never could understand why in england where the boundaries of caste are so distinctly marked a gentlemans full dress should be his servants livery the chimneypots are no protection to the head in raw or very cold weather and it required no little courage in me to appear in fur or felt i wish i could wear such a comfortable hat said a swede to me but i dare not you are a traveller and it is permitted but a swede would lose his position in society if he were to do so another gentleman informed me that his own sisters refused to appear in the streets with him because he wore a cap a former english consul greatly shocked the people by carrying home his own marketing a few gentlemen have independence enough to set aside in their own houses some of the more disagreeable features of this conventionalism and the success of two or three who held weekly soirees through the winter on a more free and unrestrained plan may in the end restore somewhat of naturalness and spontaneity to the society of stockholm the continual taking off of your hat to everybody you know is a great annoyance to many strangers a lift of the hat as in germany is not sufficient you must remove it entirely and hold it in the air a second or two before you replace it king oscar once said to an acquaintance of mine who was commiserating him for being obliged to keep his hat off the whole length of the drottninggatan in a violent snowstorm you are quite right it was exceedingly disagreeable and i could not help wishing that instead of being king of sweden i were king of thibet where according to huc the polite salutation is simply to stick out your tongue the consideration extended to foreigners is i am told quite withdrawn after they become residents so that as an englishman informed me stockholm is much more pleasant the first year than the second the principle on the whole is about the same as governs english and most american society only in sweden its tyranny is more severely felt on account of the french imitations which have been engrafted upon it i do not wish to be understood as saying a word in censure of that genial courtesy which is characteristic of the swedes not less of the bonder or country farmers than of the nobility they are by nature a courteous people and if throughout the country something of the primness and formality of ancient manners has been preserved it the rather serves to give a quaint and picturesque grace to society the affectation of french manners applies principally to the capital which both in manners and morals can by no means be taken as a standard for the whole country the swedes are neither licentious nor extravagantly overmannered the stockholmers are both during the whole of our journey to lapland we were invariably treated with a courtesy which bordered on kindness and had abundant opportunities of noticing the general amenity which exists in the intercourse even of the poorest classes the only really rude people we saw were travelling traders especially those from the capital who thought to add to their importance by a little swaggering i recollect hearing of but a single instance in which the usual worldwide rules of hospitality were grossly violated this occurred to an english traveller who spent some time in the interior of the country while taking tea one evening with a prominent family of the province he happened to make use of his thumb and forefinger in helping himself to a lump of sugar the mistress of the house immediately sent out the servant who reappeared after a short time with another sugarbowl filled with fresh lumps noticing this the traveller in order to ascertain whether his harmless deviation from swedish customs had really contaminated the whole sugarbowl sweetened his second cup in the same manner the result was precisely the same the servant was again sent out and again returned with a fresh supply the traveller thereupon coolly walked to the stove opened the door and threw in his cup saucer and teaspoon affecting to take it for granted that they never could be used again speaking of king oscar reminds me that i should not fail to say a word about this liberal and enlightened monarch there is probably no king in europe at present who possesses such extensive acquirements or is animated by a more genuine desire for the good of his kingdom the slow progress which sweden has made in introducing needful reforms is owing to the conservative spirit of the nobility and the priesthood who possess half the legislative power i do not believe there is a greater enemy to progress than an established church oscar is deservedly popular throughout sweden and i wish i could believe that his successor will exhibit equal intelligence and liberality during my stay i saw all the members of the royal family frequently and once had an informal selfpresentation to the whole of them i was descending the stairway of kahns hotel one afternoon when a tall blackbearded frenchy gentleman coming up brushed so close to me in the narrow passage that he received the full benefit of a cloud of smoke which i was ejaculating it was the crown prince as a servant whispered to me but as my cigar was genuine havana and he is said to be a connoisseur of the article there was no harm done as i reached the street door a dragoon dashed up preceding the carriages containing the royal family who were coming to view professor enslens panoramas first the crown princess with her children she bowed gracefully in answer to my greeting the princess eugenia a lady of twentyseven or thereabouts with a thoroughly cheerful and amiable face came next and nodded smiling with her was the queen a daughter of eugene beauharnais a handsome woman for her years with the dark hair and eyes of her grandmother josephine king oscar followed at the head of a company of officers and nobles among whom was his second son prince oscar the handsomest young man in stockholm he wore his admirals uniform and made me a naval salute as he passed the king is about medium height with a symmetrical head a bold finelycut nose keen intelligent eyes and a heavy grey moustache there was something gallant dashing and manly in his air despite his fiftyseven years he gave me the impression of an honest energetic and thoroughly accomplished man and this is the character he bears throughout sweden except with a small class who charge him with being insincere and too much under the influence of the queen against whom however they can find no charge except that of her catholicism i was sorry to notice not only in stockholm but more or less throughout sweden a spirit of detraction in regard to everything swedish whenever i mentioned with admiration the name of a distinguished swede i was almost always sure to hear in return some disparaging remark or a story to his disadvantage yet singularly enough the swedes are rather sensitive to foreign criticism seeming to reserve for themselves the privilege of being censorious no amount of renown nor even the sanctity which death gives to genius can prevent a certain class of them from exhibiting the vices and weaknesses of their countrymen much the severest things which i heard said about sweden were said by swedes themselves and i was frequently obliged to rely upon my own contrary impressions to protect me from the chance of being persuaded to paint things worse than they really are just before leaving stockholm i made application through the hon mr schroeder our minister resident and baron lagerheim for the privilege of an interview with the king a few days previously however he had been attacked with that illness which has obliged him to withdraw from the labours of government and was advised by his physicians to receive no one he sent me a very kind message with an invitation to renew my request as soon as his health should be restored gentlemen who had opportunities of knowing the fact assured me that his health broke down under an accumulation of labour and anxiety in his endeavours to bring the question of religious liberty before the diet a measure in which he had to contend with the united influence of the clergy the house of peasants whom the clergy rule to a great extent and a portion of the house of nobles it is not often that a king is in advance of the general sentiment of his people and in losing the services of oscar i fear that sweden has lost her best man the crown prince now prince regent is said to be amiably weak in his character rather reactionary in his views and very ambitious of military glory at least that is the average of the various opinions which i heard expressed concerning him after speaking of the manners of stockholm i must not close this chapter without saying a few words about its morals it has been called the most licentious city in europe and i have no doubt with the most perfect justice vienna may surpass it in the amount of conjugal infidelity but certainly not in general incontinence very nearly half the registered births are illegitimate to say nothing of the illegitimate children born in wedlock of the servantgirls shopgirls and seamstresses in the city it is very safe to say that scarcely ten out of a hundred are chaste while as rakish young swedes have coolly informed me many girls of respectable parentage belonging to the middle class are not much better the men of course are much worse than the women and even in paris one sees fewer physical signs of excessive debauchery here the number of brokendown young men and bleareyed hoary sinners is astonishing i have never been in any place where licentiousness was so open and avowed and yet where the slang of a sham morality was so prevalent there are no houses of prostitution in stockholm and the city would be scandalised at the idea of allowing such a thing a few years ago two were established and the fact was no sooner known than a virtuous mob arose and violently pulled them down at the restaurants young blades order their dinners of the female waiters with an arm around their waists while the old men place their hands unblushingly upon their bosoms all the baths in stockholm are attended by women generally middleaged and hideous i must confess who perform the usual scrubbing and shampooing with the greatest nonchalance one does not wonder when he is told of young men who have passed safely through the ordeals of berlin and paris and have come at last to stockholm to be ruinedb it is but fair to say that the swedes account for the large proportion of illegitimate births by stating that many unfortunate females come up from the country to hide their shame in the capital which is no doubt true everything that i have said has been derived from residents of stockholm who proud as they are and sensitive cannot conceal this glaring depravity the population of stockholm as is proved by statistics has only been increased during the last fifty years by immigration from the country the number of deaths among the inhabitants exceeding the births by several hundreds every year i was once speaking with a swede about these facts which he seemed inclined to doubt but said i they are derived from your own statistics well he answered with a naпve attempt to find some compensating good you must at least admit that the swedish statistics are as exact as any in the world drunkenness is a leading vice among the swedes as we had daily evidence six years ago the consumption of brandy throughout the kingdom was nine gallons for every man woman and child annually but it has decreased considerably since then mainly through the manufacture of beer and porter bajerskt цl bavarian beer is now to be had everywhere and is rapidly becoming the favourite drink of the people sweden and the united states will in the end establish the fact that lager beer is more efficacious in preventing intemperance than any amount of prohibitory law brandydrinking is still nevertheless one of the greatest curses of sweden it is no unusual thing to see boys of twelve or fourteen take their glass of fiery finkel before dinner the celebrated swedish punch made of arrack wine and sugar is a universal evening drink and one of the most insidious ever invented despite its agreeable flavor there is a movement in favor of total abstinence but it seems to have made but little progress except as it is connected with some of the new religious ideas which are now preached throughout the country i have rarely witnessed a sadder example of ruin than one evening in a stockholm cafй a tall distinguishedlooking man of about forty in an advanced state of drunkenness was seated at a table opposite to us he looked at me awhile apparently endeavoring to keep hold of some thought with which his mind was occupied rising at last he staggered across the room stood before me and repeated the words of bellman sе vandra vеra stora mдn frеn ljuset ned til skugganc a wild despairing laugh followed the lines and he turned away but came back again and again to repeat them he was a nobleman of excellent family a man of great intellectual attainments who a few years ago was considered one of the most promising young men in sweden i saw him frequently afterwards and always in the same condition but he never accosted me again the swedes say the same thing of bellman himself and of tegner and many others with how much justice i care not to know for a mans faults are to be accounted for to god and not to a gossiping public footnotes b the substance of the foregoing paragraph was contained in a letter published in the newyork tribune during my travels in the north and which was afterwards translated and commented upon by the swedish papers the latter charged me with having drawn too dark a picture and i therefore took some pains to test my statements both by means of the government statistics and the views of my swedish friends i see no reason to change my first impression had i accepted all that was told me by natives of the capital i should have made the picture much darker the question is simply whether there is much difference between the general adoption of illicit connections or the existence of open prostitution the latter is almost unknown the former is almost universal the supply being kept up by the miserable rates of wages paid to female servants and seamstresses the former get on an average fifty rigsdaler per year out of which they must clothe themselves few of the latter can make one rigsdaler a day these connections are also encouraged by the fact that marriage legitimates all the children previously born in fact during the time of my visit to stockholm a measure was proposed in the house of clergy securing to bastards the same right of inheritance as to legitimate children such measures however just they may be so far as the innocent offspring of a guilty connection are concerned have a direct tendency to impair the sanctity of marriage and consequently the general standard of morality this the most vital of all the social problems is strangely neglected the diseases and excesses which it engenders are far more devastating than those which spring from any other vice and yet no philanthropist is bold enough to look the question in the face the virtuous shrink from it the vicious dont care about it the godly simply condemn and the ungodly indulge and so the world rolls on and hundreds of thousands go down annually to utter ruin it is useless to attempt the extirpation of a vice which is inherent in the very nature of man and the alternative of either utterly ignoring or of attempting to check and regulate it is a question of the most vital importance to the whole human race c thus our great men wander from the light down into the shades chapter xix journey to gottenburg and copenhagen i never knew a more sudden transition from winter to summer than we experienced on the journey southward from stockholm when we left that city on the evening of the th of may there were no signs of spring except a few early violets and anemones on the sheltered southern banks in haga park the grass was still brown and dead the trees bare and the air keen but the harbour was free from ice and the canal open and our winter isolation was therefore at an end a little circulation entered into the languid veins of society steamers from germany began to arrive fresh faces appeared in the streets and less formal costumes merchants and bagmen only it is true but people of a more dashing and genial air we were evidently as the swedes said leaving stockholm just as it began to be pleasant and lively the steamer left the riddarholm pier at midnight and took her way westward up the mдlar lake to sцdertelje the boats which ply on the gotha canal are small but neat and comfortable the price of a passage to gottenburg a distance of miles is about this however does not include meals which are furnished at a fixed price amounting to more the time occupied by the voyage varies from two and a half to four days in the night we passed through the lock at sцdertelje where st olaf when a heathen viking cut a channel for his ships into the long baltic estuary which here closely approaches the lake and in the morning found ourselves running down the eastern shore of sweden under the shelter of its fringe of jagged rocky islets towards noon we left the baltic and steamed up the long narrow bay of sцderkцping passing on the way the magnificent ruins of stegeborg castle the first mediжval relic i had seen in sweden its square massive walls and tall round tower of grey stone differed in no respect from those of contemporary ruins in germany before reaching sцderkцping we entered the canal a very complete and substantial work of the kind about eighty feet in breadth but much more crooked than would seem to be actually necessary for this reason the boats make but moderate speed averaging not more than six or seven miles an hour exclusive of the detention at the locks the country is undulating and neither rich nor populous before reaching the beautiful roxen lake beyond which we entered upon a charming district here the canal rises by eleven successive locks to the rich uplands separating the roxen from the wetter a gently rolling plain chequered so far as the eye could reach with green squares of springing wheat and the dark mould of the newly ploughed barley fields while the boat was passing the locks we walked forward to a curious old church called vreta kloster the building dates from the year and contains the tombs of three swedish kings together with that of the count douglas who fled hither from scotland in the time of cromwell the douglas estate is in this neighbourhood and is i believe still in the possession of the family the church must at one time have presented a fine venerable appearance but all its dark rich colouring and gilding are now buried under a thick coat of whitewash we had already a prophecy of the long summer days of the north in the perpetual twilight which lingered in the sky moving around from sunset to sunrise during the second night we crossed the wetter lake which i did not see for when i came on deck we were already on the viken the most beautiful sheet of water between stockholm and gottenburg its irregular shores covered with forests of fir and birch thrust out long narrow headlands which divide it into deep bays studded with wild wooded islands but the scenery was still that of winter except in the absence of ice and snow we had not made much southing but we expected to find the western side of sweden much warmer than the eastern the highest part of the canal more than feet above the sea was now passed however and as we descended the long barren hills towards the wener lake i found a few early wild flowers in the woods in the afternoon we came upon the wener the third lake in europe being one hundred miles in extent by about fifty in breadth to the west it spread away to a level line against the sky but as i looked southward i perceived two opposite promontories with scattered islands between dividing the body of water into almost equal portions the scenery of the wener has great resemblance to that of the northern portion of lake michigan further down on the eastern shore the hill of kinnekulle the highest land in southern sweden rises to the height of nearly a thousand feet above the water with a graceful and very gradual sweep but otherwise the scenery is rather tame and i suspect depends for most of its beauty upon the summer foliage there were two or three intelligent and agreeable passengers on board who showed a more than usual knowledge of america and her institutions the captain however as we walked the deck together betrayed the same general impression which prevails throughout the continent germany in particular that we are a thoroughly material people having little taste for or appreciation of anything which is not practical and distinctly utilitarian nothing can be further from the truth yet i have the greatest difficulty in making people comprehend that a true feeling for science art and literature can coexist with our great practical genius there is more intellectual activity in the free states than in any other part of the world a more general cultivation and taking the collective population i venture to say a more enlightened taste nowhere are greater sums spent for books and works of art or for the promotion of scientific objects yet this cry of materialism has become the cant and slang of european talk concerning america and is obtruded so frequently and so offensively that i have sometimes been inclined to doubt whether the good breeding of continental society has not been too highly rated while on the steamer i heard an interesting story of a swedish nobleman who is at present attempting a practical protest against the absurd and fossilised ideas by which his class is governed the nobility of sweden are as proud as they are poor and as the fathers title is inherited by each of his sons the country is overrun with counts and barons who repudiating any means of support that is not somehow connected with the service of the government live in a continual state of debt and dilapidation count r however has sense enough to know that honest labour is always honourable and has brought up his eldest son to earn his living by the work of his own hands for the past three years the latter has been in the united states working as a daylabourer on farms and on western railroads his experiences i learn have not been agreeable but he is a young man of too much spirit and courage to give up the attempt and has hitherto refused to listen to the entreaties of his family that he shall come home and take charge of one of his fathers estates the second son is now a clerk in a mercantile house in gottenburg while the count has given his daughter in marriage to a radical and untitled editor whose acquaintance i was afterwards so fortunate as to make and who confirmed the entire truth of the story we were to pass the locks at trollhдtta in the middle of the night but i determined to visit the celebrated falls of the gotha river even at such a time and gave orders that we should be called the stupid boy however woke up the wrong passenger and the last locks were reached before the mistake was discovered by sunrise we had reached lilla edet on the gotha river where the buds were swelling on the early trees and the grass in sunny places showed a little sprouting greenness we shot rapidly down the swift brown stream between brown bald stony hills whose forests have all been stripped off to feed the hostile campfires of past centuries bits of bottom land held in the curves of the river looked rich and promising and where the hills fell back a little there were groves and countryhouses but the scenery in general was bleak and unfriendly until we drew near gottenburg two round detached forts built according to vaubans ideas which the swedes say he stole from sweden where they were already in practice announced our approach and before noon we were alongside the pier here to my great surprise a customhouse officer appeared and asked us to open our trunks but we came by the canal from stockholm that makes no difference he replied your luggage must be examined i then appealed to the captain who stated that in consequence of the steamers being obliged to enter the baltic waters for two or three hours between sцdertelje and sцderkцping the law took it for granted that we might have boarded some foreign vessel during that time and procured contraband goods in other words though sailing in a narrow sound between the swedish islands and the swedish coast we had virtually been in a foreign country it would scarcely be believed that this sagacious law is of quite recent enactment we remained until the next morning in gottenburg this is in every respect a more energetic and wideawake place than stockholm it has not the same unrivalled beauty of position but is more liberally laid out and kept in better order although the population is only about its commerce is much greater than that of the capital and so are proportionately its wealth and public spirit the magister hedlund a very intelligent and accomplished gentleman to whom i had a letter from mьgge the novelist took me up the valley a distance of five or six miles to a very picturesque village among the hills which is fast growing into a manufacturing town large cotton woollen and paper mills bestride a strong stream which has such a fall that it leaps from one millwheel to another for the distance of nearly half a mile on our return we visited a number of wells hollowed in the rocky strata of the hills to which the country people have given the name of the giants pots a clergyman of the neighbourhood even has written a pamphlet to prove that they were the work of the antediluvian giants who excavated them for the purpose of mixing dough for their loaves of bread and batter for their puddings they are simply those holes which a pebble grinds in a softer rock under the rotary action of a current of water but on an immense scale some of them being ten feet in diameter by fifteen or eighteen in depth at herr hedlunds house i met a number of gentlemen whose courtesy and intelligence gave me a very favourable impression of the society of the place the next morning at five oclock the steamer viken from christiania arrived and we took passage for copenhagen after issuing from the skдrgaard or rocky archipelago which protects the approach to gottenburg from the sea we made a direct course to elsinore down the swedish coast but too distant to observe more than its general outline this part of sweden however the province of halland is very rough and stony and not until after passing the sound does one see the fertile hills and vales of scania the cattegat was as smooth as an inland sea and our voyage could not have been pleasanter in the afternoon zealand rose blue from the wave and the increase in the number of small sailing craft denoted our approach to the sound the opposite shores drew nearer to each other and finally the spires of helsingborg on the swedish shore and the square mass of kronborg castle under the guns of which the sound dues have been so long demanded appeared in sight in spite of its bare wintry aspect the panorama was charming the picturesque gothic buttresses and gables of kronborg rose above the zigzag of its turfed outworks beyond were the houses and gardens of helsingцr elsinore while on the glassy breast of the sound a fleet of merchant vessels lay at anchor and beyond the fields and towns of sweden gleamed in the light of the setting sun yet here again i must find fault with campbell splendid lyrist as he is we should have been sailing by thy wild and stormy steep elsinore only that the level shore with its fair gardens and groves wouldnt admit the possibility of such a thing the music of the line remains the same but you must not read it on the spot there was a beautiful american clipper at anchor off the castle there said a danish passenger to me is one of the ships which have taken from us the sovereignty of the sound i am very glad of it i replied and i can only wonder why the maritime nations of europe have so long submitted to such an imposition i am glad also said he that the question has at last been settled and our privilege given up and i believe we are all even the government itself entirely satisfied with the arrangement i heard the same opinion afterwards expressed in copenhagen and felt gratified as an american to hear the result attributed to the initiative taken by our government but i also remembered the camden and amboy railroad company and could not help wishing that the same principle might be applied at home we have a denmark lying between newyork and philadelphia and i have often paid sand dues for crossing her territory at dusk we landed under the battlements of copenhagen are you travellers or merchants asked the customhouse officers travellers we replied then was the answer there is no necessity for examining your trunks and we were politely ushered out at the opposite door and drove without further hindrance to a hotel a gentleman from stockholm had said to me when you get to copenhagen you will find yourself in europe and i was at once struck with the truth of his remark although copenhagen is by no means a commercial city scarcely more so than stockholm its streets are gay brilliant and bustling and have an air of life and joyousness which contrasts strikingly with the gravity of the latter capital from without it makes very little impression being built on a low level ground and surrounded by high earthen fortifications but its interior is full of quaint and attractive points there is already a strong admixture of the german element in the population softening by its warmth and frankness the scandinavian reserve in their fondness for outdoor recreation the danes quite equal the viennese and their summergarden of tivoli is one of the largest and liveliest in all europe in costume there is such a thing as individuality in manners somewhat of independence the danish nature appears to be more pliant and flexible than the swedish but i cannot judge whether the charge of inconstancy and dissimulation which i have heard brought against it is just with regard to morals copenhagen is said to be an improvement upon stockholm during our short stay of three days we saw the principal sights of the place the first and one of the pleasantest to me was the park of rosenborg palace with its fresh green turf starred with dandelions and its grand avenues of chestnuts and lindens just starting into leaf on the th of may we found spring at last after six months of uninterrupted winter i dont much enjoy going the round of a new city attended by a valetdeplace and performing the programme laid down by a guidebook nor is it an agreeable task to describe such things in catalogue style so i shall merely say that the most interesting things in copenhagen are the museum of northern antiquities the historical collections in rosenborg palace thorwaldsens museum and the church of our lady containing the great sculptors statues of christ and the apostles we have seen very good casts of the latter in newyork but one must visit the museum erected by the danish people which is also thorwaldsens mausoleum to learn the number variety and beauty of his works here are the casts of between three and four hundred statues busts and bas reliefs with a number in marble no artist has ever had so noble a monument on the day after my arrival i sent a note to hans christian andersen reminding him of the greeting which he had once sent me through a mutual friend and asking him to appoint an hour for me to call upon him the same afternoon as i was sitting in my room the door quietly opened and a tall looselyjointed figure entered he wore a neat evening dress of black with a white cravat his head was thrown back and his plain irregular features wore an expression of the greatest cheerfulness and kindly humour i recognised him at once and forgetting that we had never met so much did he seem like an old familiar acquaintance cried out andersen and jumped up to greet him ah said he stretching out both his hands here you are now i should have been vexed if you had gone through copenhagen and i had not known it he sat down and i had a delightful hours chat with him one sees the man so plainly in his works that his readers may almost be said to know him personally he is thoroughly simple and natural and those who call him egotistical forget that his egotism is only a naпve and unthinking sincerity like that of a child in fact he is the youngest man for his years that i ever knew when i was sixteen said he i used to think to myself when i am twentyfour then will i be old indeed but now i am fiftytwo and i have just the same feeling of youth as at twenty he was greatly delighted when braisted who was in the room with me spoke of having read his improvisatore in the sandwich islands why is it possible he exclaimed when i hear of my books going so far around the earth i sometimes wonder if it can be really true that i have written them he explained to me the plot of his new novel to be or not to be and ended by presenting me with the illustrated edition of his stories now dont forget me said he with a delightful entreaty in his voice as he rose to leave for we shall meet again were it not for seasickness i should see you in america and who knows but i may come in spite of it god bless you andersen i said in my thoughts it is so cheering to meet a man whose very weaknesses are made attractive through the perfect candour of his nature goldschmidt the author of the jew whose acquaintance i made is himself a jew and a man of great earnestness and enthusiasm he is the editor of the north and south a monthly periodical and had just completed as he informed me a second romance which was soon to be published like most of the authors and editors in northern europe he is well acquainted with american literature professor rafn the distinguished archжologist of northern lore is still as active as ever notwithstanding he is well advanced in years after going up an innumerable number of steps i found him at the very top of a high old building in the kronprinzensgade in a study crammed with old norsk and icelandic volumes he is a slender old man with a thin face and high narrow head clear grey eyes and a hale red on his cheeks the dust of antiquity does not lie very heavily on his grey locks his enthusiasm for his studies is of that fresh and lively character which mellows the whole nature of the man i admired and enjoyed it when after being fairly started on his favourite topic he opened one of his own splendid folios and read me some ringing stanzas of icelandic poetry he spoke much of mr marsh our former minister to turkey whose proficiency in the northern languages he considered very remarkable chapter xx return to the north christiania i was obliged to visit both germany and england before returning to spend the summer in norway as neither of those countries comes within the scope of the present work i shall spare the reader a recapitulation of my travels for six weeks after leaving copenhagen midsummers day was ten days past before i was ready to resume the journey and there was no time to be lost if i wished to see the midnight sun from the cliffs of the north cape i therefore took the most direct route from london by the way of hull whence a steamer was to sail on the rd of july for christiania we chose one of the steamers of the english line to our subsequent regret as the norwegian vessels are preferable in most respects i went on board on friday evening and on asking for my berth was taken into a small stateroom containing ten oh theres only seven gentleman goin in here this time said the steward noticing my look of dismay and then you can sleep on a sofa in the saloon if you like it better on referring to the steamers framed certificate i found that she was tons burden and constructed to carry cabin and deck passengers the stateroom for ten passengers had a single washbasin but i believe we had as many as four small towels which was a source of congratulation what a jolly nice boat it is i heard one of the english passengers exclaim the steward who stood up for the dignity of the vessel said oh youll find it very pleasant we ave only twenty passengers and we once ad heightyfour in the morning we were upon the north sea rolling with a short nauseating motion under a dismal rainy sky it always rains when you leave hull said the mate and it always rains when you come back to it i divided my time between sea sickness and charles reades novel of never too late to mend a cheery companion under such circumstances the purposed rowdyism of the mans style shows a little too plainly but his language is so racy and muscular his characters so fairly and sharply drawn that one must not be censorious towards evening i remembered that it was the fourth and so procured a specific for seasickness with which braisted and i sitting alone on the main hatch in the rain privately remembered our fatherland there was on board an american seacaptain of norwegian birth as i afterwards found who would gladly have joined us the other passengers were three norwegians three fossil englishmen two snobbish do and some jolly goodnatured freeandeasy youths bound to norway with dogs guns rods fishing tackle and oilcloth overalls we had a fair wind and smooth sea but the most favourable circumstances could not get more than eight knots an hour out of our steamer after fortyeight hours however the coast of norway came in sight a fringe of scattered rocks behind which rose bleak hills enveloped in mist and rain our captain who had been running on this route some years did not know where we were and was for putting to sea again but one of the norwegian passengers offered his services as pilot and soon brought us to the fjord of christiansand we first passed through a skдrgaard archipelago or garden of rocks as it is picturesquely termed in norsk and then between hills of darkred rock covered by a sprinkling of firtrees to a sheltered and tranquil harbour upon which lay the little town by this time the rain came down not in drops but in separate threads or streams as if the nozzle of an immense wateringpot had been held over us after three months of drouth which had burned up the soil and entirely ruined the haycrops it was now raining for the first time in southern norway the young englishmen bravely put on their waterproofs and set out to visit the town in the midst of the deluge but as it contains no sight of special interest i made up my mind that like constantinople it was more attractive from without than within and remained on board an amphitheatre of rugged hills surrounds the place broken only by a charming little valley which stretches off to the westward the fishermen brought us some fresh mackerel for our breakfast they are not more than half the size of ours and of a brighter green along the back their flavour however is delicious with these mackerels four salmons a customhouse officer and a norwegian parson we set off at noon for christiania the coast was visible but at a considerable distance all day fleeting gleams of sunshine sometimes showed the broken inland ranges of mountains with jagged sawtooth peaks shooting up here and there when night came there was no darkness but a strong golden gleam whereby one could read until after ten oclock we reached the mouth of christiania fjord a little after midnight and most of the passengers arose to view the scenery after passing the branch which leads to drammen the fjord contracts so as to resemble a river or one of our islandstudded new england lakes the alternation of bare rocky islets redribbed cliffs firwoods greygreen birchen groves tracts of farm land and redframe cottages rendered this part of the voyage delightful although as the morning advanced we saw everything through a gauzy veil of rain finally the wateringpot was turned on again obliging even oil cloths to beat a retreat to the cabin and so continued until we reached christiania after a mild customhouse visitation not a word being said about passports we stepped ashore in republican norway and were piloted by a fellowpassenger to the victoria hotel where an old friend awaited me he who had walked with me in the colonnades of karnak among the sands of kфmombos and under the palms of philж was there to resume our old companionship on the bleak fjelds of norway and on the shores of the arctic sea we at once set about preparing for the journey first to the bankers who supplied me with a sufficient quantity of small money for the poststations on the road to drontheim then to a seller of carrioles of whom we procured three at apiece to be resold to him for at the expiration of two months and then to supply ourselves with maps postingbook hammer nails rope gimlets and other necessary helps in case of a breakdown the carriole carryall lucus a non lucendo because it only carries one is the national norwegian vehicle and deserves special mention it resembles a reindeerpulk mounted on a pair of wheels with long flat flexible ash shafts and no springs the seat much like the stern of a canoe and rather narrow for a traveller of large basis slopes down into a trough for the feet with a dashboard in front your single valise is strapped on a flat board behind upon which your postillion sits the whole machine resembles an american sulky in appearance except that it is springless and nearly the whole weight is forward of the axle we also purchased simple and strong harness which easily accommodates itself to any horse christiania furnishes a remarkable example of the progress which norway has made since its union with sweden and the adoption of a free constitution in its signs of growth and improvement the city reminds one of an american town its population has risen to and though inferior to gottenburg in its commerce it is only surpassed by stockholm in size the old log houses of which it once was built have almost entirely disappeared the streets are broad tolerably paved and have what stockholm cannot yet boast of decent sidewalks from the little nucleus of the old town near the water branch off handsome new streets where you often come suddenly from stately threestory blocks upon the rough rock and meadow land the broad carljohansgade leading directly to the imposing white front of the royal palace upon an eminence in the rear of the city is worthy of any european capital on the old market square a very handsome market hall of brick in semibyzantine style has recently been erected and the only apparent point in which christiania has not kept up with the times is the want of piers for her shipping a railroad about forty miles in length is already in operation as far as eidsvold at the foot of the long miцsen lake on which steamers ply to lillehammer at its head affording an outlet for the produce of the fertile guldbrandsdal and the adjacent country the norwegian constitution is in almost all respects as free as that of any american state and it is cheering to see what material wellbeing and solid progress have followed its adoption the environs of christiania are remarkably beautiful from the quiet basin of the fjord which vanishes between blue interlocking islands to the southward the land rises gradually on all sides speckled with smiling countryseats and farmhouses which trench less and less on the dark evergreen forests as they recede until the latter keep their old dominion and sweep in unbroken lines to the summits of the mountains on either hand the ancient citadel of aggershus perched upon a rock commands the approach to the city fine old linden trees rising above its white walls and tiled roofs beyond over the trees of the palace park in which stand the new museum and university towers the long palacefront behind which commences a range of villas and gardens stretching westward around a deep bight of the fjord until they reach the new palace of oscarhall on a peninsula facing the city as we floated over the glassy water in a skiff on the afternoon following our arrival watching the scattered sungleams move across the lovely panorama we found it difficult to believe that we were in the latitude of greenland the dark rich green of the foliage the balmy odours which filled the air the deep blue of the distant hills and islands and the soft warm colors of the houses all belonged to the south only the air fresh without being cold elastic and exciting not a delicious opiate was wholly northern and when i took a swim under the castle walls i found that the water was northern too it was the height of summer and the showers of roses in the gardens the strawberries and cherries in the market show that the summers best gifts are still enjoyed here the english were off the next day with their dogs guns fishing tackle waterproofs clay pipes and native language except one who became homesick and went back in the next steamer we also prepared to set out for ringerike the ancient dominion of king ring on our way to the dovrefjeld and drontheim chapter xxi incidents of carriole travel it is rather singular that whenever you are about to start upon a new journey you almost always fall in with some one who has just made it and who overwhelms you with all sorts of warning and advice this has happened to me so frequently that i have long ago ceased to regard any such communications unless the individual from whom they come inspires me with more than usual confidence while inspecting our carrioles at the hotel in christiania i was accosted by a hamburg merchant who had just arrived from drontheim by way of the dovre fjeld and the miцsen lake ah said he those things wont last long that oilcloth covering for your luggage will be torn to pieces in a few days by the postillions climbing upon it then they hold on to your seat and rip the cloth lining with their long nails besides the rope reins wear the leather off your dashboard and you will be lucky if your wheels and axles dont snap on the rough roads now here was a man who had travelled much in norway spoke the language perfectly and might be supposed to know something but his face betrayed the croaker and i knew moreover that of all fretfully luxurious men merchants and especially northgerman merchants are the worst so i let him talk and kept my own private opinion unchanged at dinner he renewed the warnings you will have great delay in getting horses at the stations the only way is to be rough and swaggering and threaten the people and even that wont always answer most likely i thought of course you have a supply of provisions with you he continued no said i i always adopt the diet of the country in which i travel but you cant do it here he exclaimed in horror you cant do it here they have no wine nor no white bread nor no fresh meat and they dont know how to cook anything i am perfectly aware of that i answered but as long as i am not obliged to come down to bread made of firbark and barleystraw as last winter in lapland i shall not complain you possess the courage of a hero if you can do such a thing but you will not start now in this rain we answered by bidding him a polite adieu for the posthorses had come and our carrioles were at the door as if to reward our resolution the rain which had been falling heavily all the morning ceased at that moment and the grey blanket of heaven broke and rolled up into loose masses of cloud i mounted into the canoeshaped seat drew the leathern apron over my legs and we set out in single file through the streets of christiania the carriole as i have already said has usually no springs ours had none at least except those which it makes in bounding over the stones we had not gone a hundred yards before i was ready to cry out lord have mercy upon me such a shattering of the joints such a vibration of the vertebrж such a churning of the viscera i had not felt since travelling by banghycart in india breathing went on by fits and starts between the jolts my teeth struck together so that i put away my pipe lest i should bite off the stem and the pleasant sensation of having been pounded in every limb crept on apace once off the pavingstones it was a little better beyond the hard turnpike which followed better still and on the gravel and sand of the first broad hill we found the travel easy enough to allay our fears the two skydsbonder or postillions who accompanied us sat upon our portmanteaus and were continually jumping off to lighten the ascent of the hills the descents were achieved at full trotting speed the horses leaning back supporting themselves against the weight of the carrioles and throwing out their feet very firmly so as to avoid the danger of slipping thus no matter how steep the hill they took it with perfect assurance and boldness never making a stumble there was just sufficient risk left however to make these flying descents pleasant and exhilarating our road led westward over high hills and across deep valleys down which we had occasional glimpses of the blue fjord and its rocky islands the grass and grain were a rich dark green sweeping into a velvety blue in the distance and against this deep ground the bright red of the houses showed with strong effect a contrast which was subdued and harmonised by the still darker masses of the evergreen forests covering the mountain ranges at the end of twelve or thirteen miles we reached the first poststation at the foot of the mountains which bound the inland prospect from christiania on the west as it was not a fast station we were subject to the possibility of waiting two or three hours for horses but fortunately were accosted on the road by one of the farmers who supply the skyds and changed at his house the norwegian skyds differs from the swedish skjuts in having horses ready only at the fast stations which are comparatively few while at all others you must wait from one to three hours according to the distance from which the horses must be brought in sweden there are always from two to four horses ready and you are only obliged to wait after these are exhausted there also the regulations are better and likewise more strictly enforced it is at best an awkward mode of travelling very pleasant when everything goes rightly but very annoying when otherwise we now commenced climbing the mountain by a series of terribly steep ascents every opening in the woods disclosing a wider and grander view backward over the lovely christiania fjord and the intermediate valleys beyond the crest we came upon a wild mountain plateau a thousand feet above the sea and entirely covered with forests of spruce and fir it was a black and dismal region under the lowering sky not a house or a grain field to be seen and thus we drove for more than two hours to the solitary inn of krogkleven where we stopped for the night in order to visit the celebrated kings view in the morning we got a tolerable supper and good beds sent off a messenger to the station of sundvolden at the foot of the mountain to order horses for us and set out soon after sunrise piloted by the landlords son olaf half an hours walk through the forest brought us to a pile of rocks on the crest of the mountain which fell away abruptly to the westward at our feet lay the tyri fjord with its deeply indented shores and its irregular scattered islands shining blue and bright in the morning sun while away beyond it stretched a great semicircle of rolling hills covered with green farms dotted with red farmhouses and here and there a white church glimmering like a spangle on the breast of the landscape behind this soft warm beautiful region rose dark wooded hills with lofty mountainridges above them until far and faint under and among the clouds streaks of snow betrayed some peaks of the nore fjeld sixty or seventy miles distant this is one of the most famous views in norway and has been compared to that from the righi but without sufficient reason the sudden change however from the gloomy wilderness through which you first pass to the sunlit picture of the enchanting lake and green inhabited hills and valleys may well excuse the raptures of travellers ringerike the realm of king ring is a lovely land not only as seen from this eagles nest but when you have descended upon its level i believe the monarchs real name was halfdan the black so beloved was he in life that after death his body was divided into four portions so that each province might possess some part of him yet the noblest fame is transitory and nobody now knows exactly where any one of his quarters was buried a terrible descent through a chasm between perpendicular cliffs some hundreds of feet in height leads from krogkleven to the level of the tyri fjord there is no attempt here nor indeed upon the most of the norwegian roads we travelled to mitigate by wellarranged curves the steepness of the hills straight down you go no matter of how breakneck a character the declivity may be there are no drags to the carrioles and country carts and were not the native horses the toughest and surestfooted little animals in the world this sort of travel would be trying to the nerves our ride along the banks of the tyri fjord in the clear morning sunshine was charming the scenery was strikingly like that on the lake of zug in switzerland and we missed the only green turf which this years rainless spring had left brown and withered in all sweden we had seen no such landscapes not even in norrland there however the people carried off the palm we found no farmhouses here so stately and clean as the swedish no such symmetrical forms and frank friendly faces the norwegians are big enough and strong enough to be sure but their carriage is awkward and their faces not only plain but ugly the countrywomen we saw were remarkable in this latter respect but nothing could exceed their development of waist bosom and arms here is the stuff of which vikings were made i thought but there has been no refining or ennobling since those times these are the rough primitive formations of the human race the bare granite and gneiss from which sprouts no luxuriant foliage but at best a few simple and hardy flowers i found much less difficulty in communicating with the norwegians than i anticipated the language is so similar to the swedish that i used the latter with a few alterations and easily made myself understood the norwegian dialect i imagine stands in about the same relation to pure danish as the scotch does to the english to my ear it is less musical and sonorous than the swedish though it is often accented in the same peculiar singsong way leaving the tyri fjord we entered a rolling wellcultivated country with some pleasant meadow scenery the crops did not appear to be thriving remarkably probably on account of the dry weather the hay crop which the farmers were just cutting was very scanty rye and winter barley were coming into head but the ears were thin and light while spring barley and oats were not more than six inches in height there were many fields of potatoes however which gave a better promise so far as one could judge from looking over the fields norwegian husbandry is yet in a very imperfect state and i suspect that the resources of the soil are not half developed the whole country was radiant with flowers and some fields were literally mosaics of blue purple pink yellow and crimson bloom clumps of wild roses fringed the road and the air was delicious with a thousand odours nature was throbbing with the fullness of her short midsummer life with that sudden and splendid rebound from the long trance of winter which she nowhere makes except in the extreme north at klдkken which is called a lilsigelse station where horses must be specially engaged we were obliged to wait two hours and a half while they were sent for from a distance of four miles the utter coolness and indifference of the people to our desire to get on faster was quite natural and all the better for them no doubt but it was provoking to us we whiled away a part of the time with breakfast which was composed mainly of boiled eggs and an immense dish of wild strawberries of very small size but exquisitely fragrant flavour the next station brought us to vasbunden at the head of the beautiful randsfjord which was luckily a fast station and the fresh horses were forthcoming in two minutes our road all the afternoon lay along the eastern bank of the fjord coursing up and down the hills through a succession of the loveliest landscape pictures this part of norway will bear a comparison with the softer parts of switzerland such as the lakes of zurich and thun the hilly shores of the fjord were covered with scattered farms the villages being merely churches with half a dozen houses clustered about them at sunset we left the lake and climbed a long wooded mountain to a height of more than two thousand feet it was a weary pull until we reached the summit but we rolled swiftly down the other side to the inn of teterud our destination which we reached about pm it was quite light enough to read yet every one was in bed and the place seemed deserted until we remembered what latitude we were in finally the landlord appeared followed by a girl whom on account of her size and blubber braisted compared to a cowwhale she had been turned out of her bed to make room for us and we two instantly rolled into the warm hollow she had left my nilotic friend occupying a separate bed in another corner the guests room was an immense apartment eight sets of quadrilles might have been danced in it at one time the walls were hung with extraordinary pictures of the six days of creation in which the almighty was represented as an old man dressed in a long gown with a peculiarly goodhumoured leer suggesting a wink on his face i have frequently seen the same series of pictures in the swedish inns in the morning i was aroused by braisted exclaiming there she blows and the whale came up to the surface with a huge pot of coffee some sugar candy excellent cream and musty biscuit it was raining when we started and i put on a light coat purchased in london and recommended in the advertisement as being light in texture gentlemanly in appearance and impervious to wet with strong doubts of its power to resist a norwegian rain fortunately it was not put to a severe test we had passing showers only heavy though short the country between the randsfjord and the miцsen lake was open and rolling everywhere under cultivation and apparently rich and prosperous our road was admirable and we rolled along at the rate of one norsk mile seven miles an hour through a land in full blossom and an atmosphere of vernal odours at the end of the second station we struck the main road from christiania to drontheim in the stationhouse i found translations of the works of dickens and captain chamier on the table the landlord was the most polite and attentive norwegian we had seen but he made us pay for it charging one and a half marks apiece for a breakfast of boiled eggs and cheese starting again in a heavy shower we crossed the crest of a hill and saw all at once the splendid miцsen lake spread out before us the lofty island of helge covered with farms and forests lying in the centre of the picture our road went northward along the side of the vast sweeping slope of farmland which bounds the lake on the west its rough and muddy condition showed how little landtravel there is at present since the establishment of a daily line of steamers on the lake at the station of gjцvik a glass furnace situated in a wooded little dell on the shore i found a young norwegian who spoke tolerable english and who seemed astounded at our not taking the steamer in preference to our carrioles he hardly thought it possible that we could be going all the way to lillehammer at the head of the lake by the land road when we set out our postillion took a way leading up the hills in the rear of the place knowing that our course was along the shore we asked him if we were on the road to sveen the next station oh yes its all right said he this is a new road it was in truth a superb highway broad and perfectly macadamised and leading along the brink of a deep rocky chasm down which thundered a powerful stream from the top of this glen we struck inland keeping more and more to the westward again we asked the postillion and again received the same answer finally when we had travelled six or seven miles and the lake had wholly disappeared i stopped and demanded where sveen was sveen is not on this road he answered we are going to mustad but i exclaimed we are bound for sveen and lillehammer oh said he with infuriating coolness you can go there afterwards you may judge that the carrioles were whirled around in a hurry and that the only answer to the fellows remonstrances was a shaking by the neck which frightened him into silence we drove back to gjцvik in a drenching shower which failed to cool our anger on reaching the station i at once made a complaint against the postillion and the landlord called a man who spoke good english to settle the matter the latter brought me a bill of for going to mustad and back knowing that the horses belonged to farmers who were not to blame in the least we had agreed to pay for their use but i remonstrated against paying the full price when we had not gone the whole distance and had not intended to go at all why then did you order horses for mustad he asked i did no such thing i exclaimed in amazement you did he persisted and an investigation ensued which resulted in the discovery that the norwegian who had advised us to go by steamer had gratuitously taken upon himself to tell the landlord to send us to the randsfjord and had given the postillion similar directions the latter imagining perhaps that we didnt actually know our own plans had followed his instructions i must say that i never before received such an astonishing mark of kindness the illconcealed satisfaction of the people at our mishap made it all the more exasperating the end of it was that two or three marks were taken off the account which we then paid and in an hour afterwards shipped ourselves and carrioles on board a steamer for lillehammer the norwegian who had caused all this trouble came along just before we embarked and heard the story with the most sublime indifference proffering not a word of apology regret or explanation judging from this specimen the king of sweden and norway has good reason to style himself king of the goths and vandals i was glad nevertheless that we had an opportunity of seeing the miцsen from the deck of a steamer moving over the glassy palegreen water midway between its shores we had a far better exhibition of its beauties than from the landroad it is a superb piece of water sixty miles in length by from two to five in breadth with mountain shores of picturesque and evervarying outline the lower slopes are farm land dotted with the large gaards or mansions of the farmers many of which have a truly stately air beyond them are forests of fir spruce and larch while in the glens between winding groves of birch alder and ash come down to fringe the banks of the lake wandering gleams of sunshine falling through the broken clouds touched here and there the shadowed slopes and threw belts of light upon the water and these illuminated spots finely relieved the otherwise sombre depth of colour our boat was slow and we had between two and three hours of unsurpassed scenery before reaching our destination an immense raft of timber gathered from the loose logs which are floated down the lougen elv lay at the head of the lake which contracts into the famous guldbrandsdal on the brow of a steep hill on the right lay the little town of lillehammer where we were ere long quartered in a very comfortable hotel chapter xxii guldbrandsdal and the dovre fjeld we left lillehammer on a heavenly sabbath morning there was scarcely a cloud in the sky the air was warm and balmy and the verdure of the valley freshened by the previous days rain sparkled and glittered in the sun the miцsen lake lay blue and still to the south and the bald tops of the mountains which inclose guldbrandsdal stood sharp and clear and almost shadowless in the flood of light which streamed up the valley of lillehammer i can only say that it is a commonplace town of about a thousand inhabitants it had a cathedral and bishop some six hundred years ago no traces of either of which now remain we drove out of it upon a splendid new road leading up the eastern bank of the river and just high enough on the mountain side to give the loveliest views either way our horses were fast and spirited and the motion of our carrioles over the firmly macadamised road was just sufficient to keep the blood in nimble circulation rigid sabbatarians may be shocked at our travelling on that day but there were few hearts in all the churches of christendom whose hymns of praise were more sincere and devout than ours the lougen roared an anthem for us from his rocky bed the mountain streams flashing down their hollow channels seemed hastening to join it the mountains themselves stood silent with uncovered heads and over all the paleblue northern heaven looked lovingly and gladly down a smile of god upon the grateful earth there is no sabbath worship better than the simple enjoyment of such a day toward the close of the stage our road descended to the banks of the lougen which here falls in a violent rapid almost a cataract over a barrier of rocks masses of water broken or wrenched from the body of the river are hurled intermittently high into the air scattering as they fall with fragments of rainbows dancing over them in this scene i at once recognised the wild landscape by the pencil of dahl the norwegian painter which had made such an impression upon me in copenhagen in guldbrandsdal we found at once what we had missed in the scenery of ringerike swift foaming streams here they leapt from every rift of the upper crags brightening the gloom of the firwoods which clothed the mountainsides like silver braiding upon a funeral garment this valley is the pride of norway nearly as much for its richness as for its beauty and grandeur the houses were larger and more substantial the fields blooming with frequent orchards of fruittrees and the farmers in their sunday attire showed in their faces a little more intelligence than the people we had seen on our way thither their countenances had a plain homely stamp and of all the largelimbed strongbacked forms i saw not one could be called graceful or even symmetrical something awkward and uncouth stamps the country people of norway honest and simpleminded they are said to be and probably are but of native refinement of feeling they can have little unless all outward signs of character are false we changed horses at moshыыs and drove up a level splendid road to holmen along the riverbank the highway thus far is entirely new and does great credit to norwegian enterprise there is not a better road in all europe and when it shall be carried through to drontheim the terrors which this trip has for timid travellers will entirely disappear it is a pity that the skyds system should not be improved in equal ratio instead of becoming even more inconvenient than at present holmen hitherto a fast station is now no longer so and the same retrograde change is going on at other places along the road the waiting at the tilsigelse stations is the great drawback to travelling by skyds in norway you must either wait two hours or pay fast prices which the people are not legally entitled to ask travellers may write complaints in the space allotted in the postbooks for such things but with very little result if one may judge from the perfect indifference which the stationmasters exhibit when you threaten to do so i was more than once tauntingly asked whether i would not write a complaint in sweden i found but one instance of inattention at the stations during two months travel and expected from the boasted honesty of the norwegians to meet with an equally fortunate experience travellers however and especially english are fast teaching the people the usual arts of imposition oh you hardshelled unplastic insulated englishmen you introduce towels and fresh water and tea and beefsteak wherever you go it is true but you teach high prices and swindling and insolence likewise a short distance beyond holmen the new road terminated and we took the old track over steep spurs of the mountain rising merely to descend and rise again the lougen river here forms a broad tranquil lake a mile in width in which the opposite mountains were splendidly reflected the water is pale milkygreen colour which under certain effects of light has a wonderful aerial transparency as we approached lцsnдs after this long and tedious stage i was startled by the appearance of a steamer on the river it is utterly impossible for any to ascend the rapids below moshыыs and she must therefore have been built there we could discover no necessity for such an undertaking in the thin scattered population and their slow indifferent habits her sudden apparition in such a place was like that of an omnibus in the desert the magnificent vista of the valley was for a time closed by the snowy peaks of the rundan fjeld but as the direction of the river changed they disappeared the valley contracted and its black walls two thousand feet high almost overhung us below however were still fresh meadows twinkling birchen groves and comfortable farmhouses out of a gorge on our right plunged a cataract from a height of eighty or ninety feet and a little further on high up the mountain a gush of braided silver foam burst out of the dark woods covered with gleaming drapery the face of a huge perpendicular crag and disappeared in the woods again my friend drew up his horse in wonder and rapture i know all switzerland and the tyrol he exclaimed but i have never seen a cataract so wonderfully framed in the setting of a forest in the evening as we approached our destination two streams on the opposite side of the valley fell from a height of more than a thousand feet in a series of linked plunges resembling burnished chains hanging dangling from the tremendous parapet of rock on the meadow before us commanding a full view of this wild and glorious scene stood a stately gaard entirely deserted its barns outhouses and gardens utterly empty and desolate its aspect saddened the whole landscape we stopped at the station of lillehaave which had only been established the day before and we were probably the first travellers who had sojourned there consequently the people were unspoiled and it was quite refreshing to be courteously received furnished with a trout supper and excellent beds and to pay therefor an honest price the morning was lowering and we had rain part of the day but thanks to our waterproofs and carriole aprons we kept comfortably dry during this days journey of fifty miles we had very grand scenery the mountains gradually increasing in height and abruptness as we ascended the guldbrandsdal with still more imposing cataracts blowing their trumpets from the steeps at viik i found a complaint in the postbook written by an englishman who had come with us from hull stating that the landlord had made him pay five dollars for beating his dog off his own the complaint was written in english of course and therefore useless so far as the authorities were concerned the landlord whom i expected from this account to find a surly swindling fellow accosted us civilly and invited us into his house to see some old weapons principally battleaxes there was a crossbow a battered antique sword and a buff coat which may have been stripped from one of sinclairs men in the pass of kringelen the logs of his house or part of them are said to have been taken from the dwelling in which the saintking olaf the apostle of christianity in the north was born they are of the red norwegian pine which has a great durability and the legend may be true although this would make them eight hundred and fifty years old colonel sinclair was buried in the churchyard at viik and about fifteen miles further we passed the defile of kringelen where his band was cut to pieces he landed in romsdals fjord on the western coast with men intending to force his way across the mountains to relieve stockholm which was then besieged by the danes some three hundred of the peasants collected at kringelen gathered together rocks and trunks of trees on the brow of the cliff and at a concerted signal rolled the mass down upon the scotch the greater part of whom were crushed to death or hurled into the river of the whole force only two escaped a wooden tablet on the spot says as near as i could make it out that there was never such an example of courage and valour known in the world and calls upon the people to admire this glorious deed of their fathers courage and valour cried braisted indignantly it was a cowardly butchery if they had so much courage why did they allow scotchmen to get into the very heart of the country before they tried to stop them well war is full of meanness and cowardice if it were only fair fighting on an open field there would be less of it beyond laurgaard guldbrandsdal contracts to a narrow gorge down which the lougen roars in perpetual foam this pass is called the rusten and the road here is excessively steep and difficult the forests disappear only hardy firs and the red pine cling to the ledges of the rocks and mountains black grim and with snowstreaked summits tower grandly on all sides a broad cataract a hundred feet high leaped down a chasm on our left so near to the road that its sprays swept over us and then shot under a bridge to join the seething flood in the frightful gulf beneath i was reminded of the valley of the reuss on the road to st gothard like which the pass of the rusten leads to a cold and bleak upper valley here we noticed the blight of late frost on the barley fields and were for the first time assailed by beggars black stormclouds hung over the gorge adding to the savage wildness of its scenery but the sun came out as we drove up the valley of dovre with its long stretch of grainfields on the sunny sweep of the hillside sheltered by the lofty dovre fjeld behind them we stopped for the night at the inn of toftemoen long before sunset although it was eight oclock and slept in a halfdaylight until morning the sun was riding high in the heavens when we left and dark lowering clouds slowly rolled their masses across the mountaintops the lougen was now an inconsiderable stream and the superb guldbrandsdal narrowed to a bare bleak dell like those in the high alps the grainfields had a chilled struggling appearance the forests forsook the mountainsides and throve only in sheltered spots at their bases the houses were mere log cabins many of which were slipping off their foundationposts and tottering to their final fall and the people poorer than ever came out of their huts to beg openly and shamelessly as we passed over the head of the valley which here turns westward to the low watershed dividing it from the famous romsdal rose two or three snowstreaked peaks of the hurunger fjeld and the drifts filling the ravines of the mountains on our left descended lower and lower into the valley at dombaas a lonely station at the foot of the dovre fjeld we turned northward into the heart of the mountains my postillion a boy of fifteen surprised me by speaking very good english he had learned it in the school at drontheim sometimes he said they had a schoolmaster in the house and sometimes one at jerkin twenty miles distant our road ascended gradually through halfcut woods of red pine for two or three miles after which it entered a long valley or rather basin belonging to the table land of the dovre fjeld stunted heath and dwarfed juniperbushes mixed with a grey foxy shrubwillow covered the soil and the pale yellow of the reindeer moss stained the rocks higher greyer and blacker ridges hemmed in the lifeless landscape and above them to the north and west broad snowfields shone luminous under the heavy folds of the clouds we passed an old woman with bare legs and arms returning from a sцter or summer chвlet of the shepherds she was a powerful but purely animal specimen of humanity beef to the heel as braisted said at last a cluster of log huts with a patch of green pastureground about them broke the monotony of the scene it was fogstuen or next station where we were obliged to wait half an hour until the horses had been caught and brought in the place had a poverty stricken air and the slovenly woman who acted as landlady seemed disappointed that we did not buy some horridly coarse and ugly woolen gloves of her own manufacture our road now ran for fourteen miles along the plateau of the dovre more than feet above the level of the sea this is not a plain or table land but an undulating region with hills valleys and lakes of its own and more desolate landscapes one can scarcely find elsewhere everything is grey naked and barren not on a scale grand enough to be imposing nor with any picturesqueness of form to relieve its sterility one can understand the silence and sternness of the norwegians when he has travelled this road but i would not wish my worst enemy to spend more than one summer as a solitary herdsman on these hills let any disciple of zimmerman try the effect of such a solitude the statistics of insanity in norway exhibit some of its effects and that which is most common is most destructive there never was a greater humbug than the praise of solitude it is the fruitful mother of all evil and no man covets it who has not something bad or morbid in his nature by noon the central ridge or comb of the dovre fjeld rose before us with the sixhundredyear old station of jerkin in a warm nook on its southern side this is renowned as the best poststation in norway and is a favourite resort of english travellers and sportsmen who come hither to climb the peak of snжhдtten and to stalk reindeer i did not find the place particularly inviting the two women who had charge of it for the time were unusually silent and morose but our dinner was cheap and well gotten up albeit the trout were not the freshest we admired the wonderful paintings of the landlord which although noticed by murray give little promise for norwegian art in these high latitudes his cows dogs and men are all snowwhite and rejoice in an original anatomy the horses on this part of the road were excellent the road admirable and our transit was therefore thoroughly agreeable the ascent of the dividing ridge after leaving jerkin is steep and toilsome for half a mile but with this exception the passage of the dovre fjeld is remarkably easy the highest point which the road crossed is about feet above the sea or a little higher than the brenner pass in the tyrol but there grain grows and orchards bear fruit while here under the parallel of nearly all vegetation ceases and even the omnivorous northern sheep can find no pasturage before and behind you lie wastes of naked grey mountains relieved only by the snowpatches on their summits i have seen as desolate tracts of wilderness in the south made beautiful by the lovely hues which they took from the air but nature has no such tender fancies in the north she is a realist of the most unpitying stamp and gives atmospheric influences which make that which is dark and bleak still darker and bleaker black clouds hung low on the horizon and dull grey sheets of rain swept now and then across the nearer heights snжhдtten to the westward was partly veiled but we could trace his blunt mound of alternate black rock and snow nearly to the apex the peak is about feet above the sea and was until recently considered the highest in norway but the skagtolstind has been ascertained to be feet higher and snжhдtten is dethroned the river driv came out of a glen on our left and entered a deep gorge in front down which our road lay following the rapid descent of the foaming stream at the station of kongsvold we had descended to feet again yet no trees appeared beyond this the road for ten miles has been with great labour hewn out of the solid rock at the bottom of a frightful defile like some of those among the alps formerly it climbed high up on the mountainside running on the brink of almost perpendicular cliffs and the vaarsti as it is called was then reckoned one of the most difficult and dangerous roads in the country now it is one of the safest and most delightful we went down the pass on a sharp trot almost too fast to enjoy the wild scenery as it deserved the driv fell through the cleft in a succession of rapids while smaller streams leaped to meet him in links of silver cataract down a thousand feet of cliff birch and fir now clothed the little terraces and spare corners of soil and the huge masses of rock hanging over our heads were tinted with black warm brown and russet orange in such a manner as to produce the most charming effects of colour over the cornices of the mountainwalls hovering at least two thousand feet above gleamed here and there the scattered snowy jцtuns of the highest fjeld the pass gradually opened into a narrow valley where we found a little cultivation again here was the post of drivstuen kept by a merry old lady our next stage descended through increasing habitation and culture to the inn of rise where we stopped for the night having the dovre fjeld fairly behind us the morning looked wild and threatening but the clouds gradually hauled off to the eastward leaving us the promise of a fine day our road led over hills covered with forests of fir and pine whence we looked into a broad valley clothed with the same dark garment of forest to which the dazzling white snows of the fjeld in the background made a striking contrast we here left the waters of the driv and struck upon those of the orkla which flow into drontheim fjord at stuen we got a fair breakfast of eggs milk cheese bread and butter eggs are plentiful everywhere yet singularly enough we were nearly a fortnight in norway before we either saw or heard a single fowl where they were kept we could not discover and why they did not crow was a still greater mystery norway is really the land of silence for an inhabited country it is the quietest i have ever seen no wonder that anger and mirth when they once break through the hard ice of norwegian life are so furious and uncontrollable these inconsistent extremes may always be reconciled when we understand how nicely the moral nature of man is balanced our road was over a high undulating tract for two stages commanding wide views of a wild wooded region which is said to abound with game the range of snowy peaks behind us still filled the sky appearing so near at hand as to deceive the eye in regard to their height at last we came upon the brink of a steep descent overlooking the deep glen of the orkla a singularly picturesque valley issuing from between the bases of the mountains and winding away to the northward down the frightful slant our horses plunged and in three minutes we were at the bottom with flowersown meadows on either hand and the wooded sides of the glen sweeping up to a waving and fringed outline against the sky after crossing the stream we had an ascent as abrupt on the other side but halfway up stood the station of bjжrkager where we left our panting horses the fast stations were now at an end but by paying fast prices we got horses with less delay in the evening a man travelling on foot offered to carry fцrbud notices for us to the remaining stations if we would pay for his horse we accepted i wrote the orders in my best norsk and on the following day we found the horses in readiness everywhere the next stage was an inspiring trot through a parklike country clothed with the freshest turf and studded with clumps of fir birch and ash the air was soft and warm and filled with balmy scents from the flowering grasses and the millions of blossoms spangling the ground in one place i saw half an acre of the purest violet hue where the pansy of our gardens grew so thickly that only its blossoms were visible the silver green of the birch twinkled in the sun and its jets of delicate foliage started up everywhere with exquisite effect amid the dark masses of the fir there was little cultivation as yet but these trees formed natural orchards which suggested a design in their planting and redeemed the otherwise savage character of the scenery we dipped at last into a hollow down which flowed one of the tributaries of the gыыl elv the course of which we thence followed to drontheim one of the stations was a lonely gaard standing apart from the road on a high hill as we drove up a horrid old hag came out to receive us can i get three horses soon i asked no she answered with a chuckle how soon in a few hours was her indifferent reply but the promise of paying fast rates got them in less than one my friend wanted a glass of wine but the old woman said she had nothing but milk we were sitting on the steps with our pipes shortly afterwards when she said why dont you go into the house it smells too strongly of paint i answered but you had better go in said she and shuffled off when we entered behold there were three glasses of very good marsala on the table how do you sell your milk i asked her that kind is three skillings a dram she answered the secret probably was that she had no license to sell wine i was reminded of an incident which occurred to me in maine during the prevalence of the prohibitory law i was staying at an hotel in a certain town and jestingly asked the landlord where is the maine law i should like to see it why said he i have it here in the house and he unlocked a back room and astonished me with the sight of a private bar studded with full decanters the men folks were all away at work and our postillion was a strapping girl of eighteen who rode behind braisted she was gotten up on an immense scale but nature had expended so much vigour on her body that none was left for her brain she was a consummate representation of health and stupidity at the station where we stopped for the night i could not help admiring the solid bulk of the landladys sister although not over twenty four she must have weighed full two hundred her waist was of remarkable thickness and her bust might be made into three average american ones i can now understand why mьgge calls his heroine ilda the strong maiden a drive of thirtyfive miles down the picturesque valley of the gыыl brought us to drontheim the next day the eighth after leaving christiania chapter xxiii drontheim voyage up the coast of norway our first view of drontheim or trondhjem as it should properly be written was from the top of the hill behind the town at the termination of six miles of execrable road and perhaps the relief springing from that circumstance heightened the agreeable impression which the scene made upon our minds below us at the bottom of a crescentshaped bay lay drontheim a mass of dark red yellow and brown buildings with the grey cathedral in the rear the rich well cultivated valley of the nid stretched behind it on our right past the lierfoss whose column of foam was visible three miles away until the hills rising more high and bleak behind each other completely enclosed it the rockfortress of munkholm in front of the city broke the smooth surface of the fjord whose further shores dim with passing showers swept away to the northeast hiding the termination of this great seaarm which is some fifty miles distant the panorama was certainly on a grand scale and presented very diversified and picturesque features but i can by no means agree with dr clarke who compares it to the bay of naples not only the rich colours of the mediterranean are wanting but those harmonic sweeps and curves of the italian shores and hills have nothing in common with these rude ragged weather beaten defiant forms descending the hill between rows of neat countryhouses we passed a diminutive fortification and entered the city the streets are remarkably wide and roughly paved crossing each other at right angles with a philadelphian regularity the houses are all two stories high and raised upon ample foundations so that the doors are approached by flights of steps probably on account of the deep snows during the winter they are almost exclusively of wood solid logs covered with neat clapboards but a recent law forbids the erection of any more wooden houses and in the course of time the town like christiania will lose all that is peculiar and characteristic in its architecture a cleaner place can scarcely be found and i also noticed what is quite rare in the north large square fountains or wells at the intersection of all the principal streets the impression which drontheim makes upon the stranger is therefore a cheerful and genial one small and unpretending though it be it is full of pictures the dark blue fjord closes the vista of half its streets hills of grey rock draped with the greenest turf overlook it on either side and the beautiful valley of the nid one of the loveliest nooks of norway lies in its rear we drove to the hotel de bellevue one of the two little caravanserais of which the town boasts and were fortunate in securing the two vacant rooms the hotel business in norway is far behind that of any other country except in regard to charges where it is far in advance considering what one gets for his money this is the most expensive country in the world for foreigners except where the rates are fixed by law as in posting the natives pay much less and here is an instance of doubledealing which does not harmonise with the renowned honesty of the norwegians at the bellevue we were furnished with three very meagre meals a day at the rate of two dollars and a half the attendance was performed by two boys of fourteen or fifteen whose services as may be supposed were quite inadequate to the wants of near twenty persons the whole business of the establishment devolved on these two fellows the landlady though goodhumoured and corpulent as was meet knowing nothing about the business and on the whole it was a wonder that matters were not worse it is singular that in a pastoral country like norway one gets nothing but rancid butter and generally sour cream where both should be of the finest quality nature is sparing of her gifts to be sure but what she does furnish is of the best as it comes from her hand of course one does not look for much culinary skill and is therefore not disappointed but the dairy is the primitive domestic art of all races and it is rather surprising to find it in so backward a state my friend who received no letters and had no transatlantic interests to claim his time as i had applied himself to seeing the place which he accomplished with praiseworthy industry in one day he walked out to the falls of the nid three miles up the valley and was charmed with them he then entered the venerable cathedral where he had the satisfaction of seeing a protestant clergyman perform high mass in a scarlet surplice with a gold cross on his back the state church of norway which like that of sweden is lutheran of a very antiquated type not only preserves this ritual but also the form of confession in a general way i believe and without reference to particular sins and of absolution of course it is violently dogmatic and illiberal and there is little vital religious activity in the whole country until within a very few years no other sects were tolerated and even yet there is simply freedom of conscience but not equal political rights for those of other denominations this concession has perhaps saved the church from becoming a venerable fossil yet one still finds persons who regret that it should have been made not knowing that all truth to retain its temper must be whetted against an opposing blade according to the new constitution of norway the king must be crowned in the cathedral of drontheim bernadotte received the proper consecration but oscar though king of norway has not yet seen fit to accept it i once heard a norwegian exclaim with a sort of jealous satisfaction oscar calls himself king of norway but he is a king without a crown i cannot see however that this fact lessens his authority as sovereign in the least there is a weekly line of steamers established by the storthing legislative assembly to hammerfest and around the north cape the nordkap the largest and best of these boats was to leave drontheim on saturday evening the th of july and we lost no time in securing berths as another week would have made it too late for the perpetual sunshine of the northern summer here again one is introduced to a knowledge of customs and regulations unknown elsewhere the ticket merely secures you a place on board the steamer but neither a berth nor provisions the latter you obtain from a restaurateur on board according to fixed rates the former depends on the will of the captain who can stow you where he chooses on the nordkap the staterooms were already occupied and there remained a single small saloon containing eight berths here we did very well so long as there were only english and american occupants who at once voted to have the skylight kept open but after two norwegians were added to our company we lived in a state of perpetual warfare the latter sharing the national dread of fresh air and yet one of them was a professor from the university of christiania and the other a physician who had charge of the hospital in bergen with this exception we had every reason to be satisfied with the vessel she was very stanch and steadygoing with a spacious airy saloon on deck no captain could have been more kind and gentlemanly and there was quite as much harmony among the passengers as could reasonably have been expected our party consisted of five americans three english two germans and one frenchman m gay membre de lacademie besides a variety of norwegians from all parts of the country leaving our carrioles and part of our baggage behind us we rowed out to the steamer in a heavy shower the sun was struggling with dark grey rainclouds all the evening and just as we hove anchor threw a splendid triumphal iris across the bay completely spanning the town which with the sheltering hills glimmered in the rosy mist floating within the bow enclosed by such a dazzling frame the picture of drontheim shone with a magical lustre like a vision of asgaard beckoning to us from the tempestuous seas but we were bound for the north the barriers of niflhem the land of fog and sleet and we disregarded the celestial token though a second perfect rainbow overarched the first and the two threw their curves over hill and fortress and the bosom of the rainy fjord until they almost touched our vessel on either side in spite of the rain we remained on deck until a late hour enjoying the bold scenery of the outer fjord here precipitous woody shores gashed with sudden ravines there jetblack rocky peaks resembling the porphyry hills of the african deserts and now and then encircling the sheltered coves soft green fields glowing with misty light and the purple outlines of snowstreaked mountains in the distance the morning was still dark and rainy we were at first running between mountainislands of bare rock and the iron coast of the mainland after which came a stretch of open sea for two hours and at noon we reached bjцrц near the mouth of the namsen fjord here there was half a dozen red houses on a bright green slope with a windmill out of gear crowning the rocky hill in the rear the sky gradually cleared as we entered the namsen fjord which charmed us with the wildness and nakedness of its shores studded with little nooks and corners of tillage which sparkled like oases of tropical greenness in such a rough setting precipices of darkred rock streaked with foamy lines of water from the snows melting upon their crests frowned over the narrow channels between the islands and through their gaps and gorges we caught sight of the loftier ranges inland namsos at the head of the fjord is a redroofed town of a few hundred inhabitants with a pleasant background of barleyfields and birchen groves the namsen valley behind it is one of the richest in this part of norway and is a great resort of english salmonfishers there was a vessel of two hundred tons on the stocks and a few coasting crafts lying at anchor we had a beautiful afternoon voyage out another arm of the fjord and again entered the labyrinth of islands fringing the coast already the days had perceptibly lengthened and the increased coldness of the air at night indicated our approach to the arctic circle i was surprised at the amount of business done at the little stations where we touched few of these contained a dozen houses yet the quantity of passengers and freight which we discharged and took on board at each could only be explained by the fact that these stations are generally outlets for a tolerably large population hidden in the valleys and fjords behind which the steamer does not visit bleak and desolate as the coast appears the back country has its fertile districts its pastureground its cornland and forests of which the voyager sees nothing and thus might be led to form very erroneous conclusions before we had been twentyfour hours out from drontheim there was a marked change in the appearance of the people we took on board not even in the neighborhood of christiania or in the rich guldbrandsdal were the inhabitants so welldressed so prosperous judging from outward signs merely or so intelligent they are in every respect more agreeable and promising specimens of humanity than their brothers of southern norway notwithstanding the dark and savage scenery amidst which their lot is cast toward midnight we approached the rock of torghдtten rising feet high in the shape of a tallcrowned battered wideawake above the low rocky isles and reefs which surround it this rock is famous for a natural tunnel passing directly through its heart the path of an arrow which the giant horseman of whom i shall speak presently shot at a disdainful maiden equally colossal in the old mythological times when odin got drunk nightly in walhalla we were all on the lookout for this tunnel which according to murray is large enough for a ship to go through if it were not some six hundred feet above the sealevel we had almost passed the rock and nothing of the kind could be seen but capt riis who was on deck encouraged us to have a little patience changed the steamers course and presently we saw a dark cavern yawning in the face of a precipice on the northern side it was now midnight but a sunset light tinged the northern sky and the torghдtten yet stood in twilight shall we see through it was the question but while we were discussing the chances a faint star sparkled in the midst of the cavernous gloom you see it because you imagine it cried some yet no it was steadfast and grew broad and bright until even the most sceptical recognised the pale midnight sky at the bottom of the gigantic arch my friend aroused me at five in the morning to see the seven sisters seven majestic peaks feet high and seated closely side by side with their feet in the sea they all wore nightcaps of gray fog and had a sullen and sleepy air i imagined they snored but it was a damp wind driving over the rocks they were northern beauties hardfeatured and largeboned and i would not give a graceful southern hill like monte albano or the paphian olympus for the whole of them so i turned in again and did not awake until the sun had dried the decks and the split twisted and contorted forms of the islands gave promise of those remarkable figures which mark the position of the arctic circle there was already a wonderful change in the scenery the islands were high and broken rising like towers and pyramids from the water and grouped together in the most fantastic confusion between their jagged pinnacles and through their sheer walls of naked rock we could trace the same formation among the hills of the mainland while in the rear white against the sky stretched the snowy tableland which forms a common summit for all one is bewildered in the attempt to describe such scenery there is no central figure no prevailing character no sharp contrasts which may serve as a guide whereby to reach the imagination of the reader all is confused disordered chaotic one begins to understand the old norse myth of these stones being thrown by the devil in a vain attempt to prevent the lord from finishing the world grand as they are singly you are so puzzled by their numbers and by the fantastic manner in which they seem to dance around you as the steamer threads the watery labyrinth that you scarcely appreciate them as they deserve take almost any one of these hundreds and place it inland anywhere in europe or america and it will be visited sketched and sung to distraction at last we saw in the west far out at sea the four towers of threnen rising perpendicularly many hundred feet from the water before us was the hestmand or horseman who bridles his rocky steed with the polar circle at first he appeared like a square turret crowning an irregular mass of islandrock but as we approached a colossal head rounded itself at the top and a sweeping cloak fell from the broad shoulder flowing backward to the horses flanks still there was no horse but here again our captain took the steamer considerably out of her course so that at a distance of a mile the whole enormous figure feet in height lay clearly before us a heavy beard fell from the grand jupitolian head the horse with sharp ears erect and head bent down seemed to be plunging into the sea which was already above his belly the saddle had slipped forward so that the rider sat upon his shoulders but with his head proudly lifted as if conscious of his fate and taking a last look at the world was it not allfather odin on his horse sleipner forsaking the new race which had ceased to worship him the colossi of the orient rameses and brahma and boodh dwindle into insignificance before this sublime natural monument to the lost gods of the north at the little fishingvillage of anklakken near the horseman a fair was being held and a score or more of coasting craft gay with norwegian flags lay at anchor these jжgts as they are called have a single mast with a large square sail precisely like those of the japanese fishing junks and their hulls are scarcely less heavy and clumsy they are the norwegian boats of a thousand years ago all attempt to introduce a better form of shipbuilding having been in vain but the romantic traveller should not suppose that he beholds the dragons of the vikings which were a very different craft and have long since disappeared the jжgts are slow but good seaboats and as the article haste is not in demand anywhere in norway they probably answer every purpose as well as more rational vessels those we saw belonged to traders who cruise along the coast during the summer attending the various fairs which appear to be the principal recreation of the people at any rate they bring some life and activity into these silent solitudes we had on board the effects of an englishman who went on shore to see a fair and was left behind by a previous steamer he had nothing with him but the clothes on his back and spoke no norsk so the captain anxiously looked out for a melancholy dilapidated individual at every station we touched at but he looked in vain for we neither saw nor heard anything of the unfortunate person all the afternoon we had a continuation of the same wonderful scenery precipices of red rock a thousand feet high with snowy turreted summits and the loveliest green glens between to the east were vast snowfields covering the eternal glaciers of the alpine range as we looked up the salten fjord while crossing its mouth the snows of sulitelma the highest mountain in lappmark feet above the sea were visible about fifty miles distant next came the little town of bodц where we stopped for the night it is a cluster of wooden houses with roofs of green sod containing about three hundred inhabitants we found potatoes in the gardens some currant bushes and a few hardy vegetables stunted ash trees and some patches of barley the sun set a little before eleven oclock but left behind him a glory of colours which i have never seen surpassed the snowy mountains of lappmark were transmuted into pyramids of scarlet flame beside which the most gorgeous sunset illuminations of the alps would have been pale and tame the sky was a sheet of saffron amber and rose reduplicated in the glassy sea and the peaked island of landegode in the west which stood broad against the glow became a mass of violet hue topped with cliffs of crimson fire i sat down on deck and tried to sketch this superb spectacle in colours which nobody will believe to be real before i had finished the sunset which had lighted one end of landegode became sunrise at the other and the fading alps burned anew with the flames of morning chapter xxiv the lofoden isles the northern summer soon teaches one fashionable habits of life like the man whose windows sidney smith darkened and who slept all day because he thought it was night you keep awake all night because you forget that it is not day ones perception of time contracts in some mysterious way and the sun setting at eleven seems to be no later than when he set at seven you think you will enjoy the evening twilight an hour or two before going to bed and lo the morning begins to dawn it seems absurd to turn in and sleep by daylight but you sleep nevertheless until eight or nine oclock and get up but little refreshed with your repose you miss the grateful covering of darkness the sweet welcome gloom which shuts your senses one after one like the closing petals of a flower in the restoring trance of the night the light comes through your eyelids as you sleep and a certain nervous life of the body that should sleep too keeps awake and active i soon began to feel the wear and tear of perpetual daylight in spite of its novelty and the many advantages which it presents to the traveller at bodц we were in sight of the lofoden islands which filled up all the northern and western horizon rising like blue sawteeth beyond the broad expanse of the west fjord which separates them from the group of the shore islands the next morning we threaded a perfect labyrinth of rocks after passing grotц and headed across the fjord for balstad on westvaagцe one of the outer isles this passage is often very rough especially when the wind blows from the southwest rolling the heavy swells of the atlantic into the open mouth of the fjord we were very much favoured by the weather having a clear sky with a light north wind and smooth sea the long line of jagged peaks stretching from vжrцe in the south west to the giant ridges of hindцe in the north east united themselves in the distance with the alpine chain of the mainland behind us forming an amphitheatre of sharp snowy summits which embraced fivesixths of the entire circle of the horizon and would have certainly numbered not less than two hundred von buch compares the lofodens to the jaws of a shark and most travellers since his time have resuscitated the comparison but i did not find it so remarkably applicable there are shark tooth peaks here and there it is true but the peculiar conformation of norway extensive plateaus forming the summitlevel of the mountains extends also to these islands whose only valleys are those which open to the sea and whose interiors are uninhabitable snowy tracts mostly above the line of vegetation on approaching the islands we had a fair view of the last outposts of the group the solid barriers against which the utmost fury of the atlantic dashes in vain this side of vжrцe lay the large island of moskцe between which and a large solitary rock in the middle of the strait dividing them is the locality of the renowned maelstrцm now alas almost as mythical as the kraaken or great sea snake of the norwegian fjords it is a great pity that the geographical illusions of our boyish days cannot retrain you learn that the noise of niagara can be heard miles off and that some indians in their canoes have ventured down it with safety well one could give up the indians without much difficulty but it is rather discouraging to step out of the falls depфt for the first time within a quarter of a mile of the cataract and hear no sound except cab sir hotel sir so of the maelstrцm denoted on my schoolboy map by a great spiral twist which suggested to me a tremendous whirl of the ocean currents aided by the information that vessels cannot approach nearer than seven miles in olney moreover there was a picture of a luckless bark halfway down the vortex i had been warming my imagination as we came up the coast with campbells sonorous lines round the shores where runic odin howls his warsong to the gale round the isles where loud lofoden whirls to death the roaring whale and as we looked over the smooth water towards moskцe felt a renewed desire to make an excursion thither on out return from the north but according to captain riis and other modern authorities which i consulted the maelstrцm has lost all its terrors and attractions under certain conditions of wind and tide an eddy is formed in the strait it is true which may be dangerous to small boats but the place is by no means so much dreaded as the salten fjord where the tide rushing in is caught in such a manner as to form a bore as in the bay of fundy and frequently proves destructive to the fishing craft it is the general opinion that some of the rocks which formerly made the maelstrцm so terrible have been worn away or that some submarine convulsion has taken place which has changed the action of the waters otherwise it is impossible to account for the reputation it once possessed it should also be borne in mind that any accident to a boat among these islands is more likely to prove disastrous than elsewhere since there are probably not a score out of the twenty thousand lofoden fishermen who pass half their lives on the water who know how to swim the water is too cold to make bathing a luxury and they are not sufficiently prepossessed in favour of cleanliness to make it a duty nevertheless they are bold sailors in their way and a tougher hardier more athletic class of men it would be difficult to find handsome they are not but quite the reverse and the most of them have an awkward and uncouth air but it is refreshing to look at their broad shoulders their brawny chests and the massive muscles of their legs and arms during the whole voyage i saw but one man who appeared to be diseased such men i suspect were the vikings rough powerful ugly dirty fellows with a few primitive virtues and any amount of robust vices we noticed however a marked change for the better in the common people as we advanced northward they were altogether better dressed better mannered and more independent and intelligent but with a hard keen practical expression of face such as one finds among the shoremen of newengland the school system of norway is still sadly deficient but there is evidently no lack of natural capacity among these people their prevailing vice is intemperance which here as in all other parts of the country is beginning to diminish since restrictions have been placed upon the manufacture and sale of spirituous liquors simultaneously with the introduction of cheap and excellent fermented drinks the statistics of their morality also show a better state of things than in the south there is probably no country population in the world where licentiousness prevails to such an extent as in the districts of guldbrandsdal and hedemark a voyage of four hours across the west fjord brought us to the little village of balstad at the southern end of westvaagцe the few red sodroofed houses were built upon a rocky point behind which were some patches of bright green pasture starred with buttercups overhung by a splendid peak of darkred rock two thousand feet in height it was a fine frontispiece to the lofoden scenery which now opened before us running along the coast of west and east vaagцe we had a continual succession of the wildest and grandest pictures thousand feet precipices with turrets and needles of rock piercing the sky dazzling snowfields leaking away in cataracts which filled the ravines with foam and mazes of bald seaworn rocks which seem to have been thrown down from the scarred peaks in some terrible convulsion of nature here and there were hollows affording stony pasturage for a few sheep and cows and little wooden fisherhuts stood on the shore in the arms of sheltered coves at the village of svolvжr which is built upon a pile of bare stones we took on board a number of ladies in fashionable dresses with bonnets on the backs of their heads and a sufficiency of cumbrous petticoats to make up for the absence of hoops which have not yet got further north than drontheim in seeing these unexpected apparitions emerge from such a wild corner of chaos i could not but wonder at the march of modern civilisation pianos in lapland parisian dresses among the lofodens billiardtables in hammerfest whither shall we turn to find the romance of the north we sailed in the lovely nocturnal sunshine through the long riverlike channel the rasksund i believe it is called between the islands of eastvaagцe and hindцe the largest of the lofodens for a distance of fifteen miles the strait was in no place more than a mile in breadth while it was frequently less than a quarter the smooth water was a perfect mirror reflecting on one side the giant cliffs with their gorges choked with snow their arrowy pinnacles and white lines of falling water on the other hills turfed to the summit with emerald velvet sprinkled with pale groves of birch and alder and dotted along their bases with the dwellings of the fishermen it was impossible to believe that we were floating on an arm of the atlantic it was some unknown river or a lake high up among the alpine peaks the silence of these shores added to the impression now and then a white seagull fluttered about the cliffs or an eider duck paddled across some glassy cove but no sound was heard there was no sail on the water no human being on the shore emerging at last from this wild and enchanting strait we stood across a bay opening southward to the atlantic to the port of steilo on one of the outer islands here the broad front of the island rising against the roseate sky was one swell of the most glorious green down to the very edge of the sea while the hills of eastvaagцe across the bay showed only naked and defiant rock with summitfields of purpletinted snow in splendour of coloring the tropics were again surpassed but the keen north wind obliged us to enjoy it in an overcoat toward midnight the sun was evidently above the horizon though hidden by intervening mountains braisted and another american made various exertions to see it such as climbing the foremast but did not succeed until about one oclock when they were favoured by a break in the hills although we had daylight the whole twentyfour hours travellers do not consider that their duty is fulfilled unless they see the sun itself exactly at midnight in the morning we touched at throndenaes on the northern side of hindцe a beautiful bay with green and wooded shores and then leaving the lofodens behind us entered the archipelago of large islands which lines the coast of finmark though built on the same grand and imposing scale as the lofodens these islands are somewhat less jagged and abrupt in their forms and exhibit a much more luxuriant vegetation in fact after leaving the namsen fjord near drontheim one sees very little timber until he reaches the parallel of the long straits between senjen and qvalц and the mainland are covered with forests of birch and turfy slopes greener than england has ever shown at the same time the snow level was not more than feet above the sea and broad patches lay melting on all the lower hills this abundance of snow seems a singular incongruity when you look upon the warm summer sky and the dark mellow juicy green of the shores one fancies that he is either sailing upon some lofty inland lake or that the oceanlevel in these latitudes must be many thousand feet higher than in the temperate zone he cannot believe that he is on the same platform with sicily and ceylon after a trip up the magnificent maans fjord and the sight of some seagreen glaciers we approached tromsцe the capital of finmark this is a town of nearly inhabitants on a small island in the strait between qvalц and the mainland it was just midnight when we dropped anchor but although the sun was hidden by a range of snowy hills in the north the daylight was almost perfect i immediately commenced making a sketch of the harbour with its fleet of coasting vessels some russian craft from archangel and a norwegian cutter carrying six guns were also at anchor before the town our french traveller after amusing himself with the idea of my commencing a picture at sunset and finishing it at sunrise started for a morning ramble over the hills boats swarmed around the steamer the coallighters came off our crew commenced their work and when the suns disc appeared before one oclock there was another day inaugurated the night had vanished mysteriously no one could tell how chapter xxv finmark and hammerfest the steamer lay at tromsцe all day affording us an opportunity to visit an encampment of lapps in tromsdal about four miles to the eastward so far as the lapps were concerned i had seen enough of them but i joined the party for the sake of the northern summer the captain was kind enough to despatch a messenger to the lapps immediately on our arrival that their herd of reindeer pasturing on the mountains might be driven down for our edification and also exerted himself to procure a horse for the american lady the horse came in due time but a side saddle is an article unknown in the arctic regions and the lady was obliged to trust herself to a mans saddle and the guidance of a norseman of the most remarkable health strength and stupidity our path led up a deep valley shut in by overhanging cliffs and blocked up at the eastern end by the huge mass of the fjeld the streams poured down the crags from their snowy reservoirs spread themselves over the steep side of the hill making a succession of quagmires over which we were obliged to spring and scramble in breakneck style the sun was intensely hot in the enclosed valley and we found the shade of the birchen groves very grateful some of the trees grew to a height of forty feet with trunks the thickness of a mans body there were also ash and alder trees of smaller size and a profusion of brilliant wild flowers the little multeberry was in blossom the ranunculus the globeflower the purple geranium the heath and the blue forgetmenot spangled the ground and on every hillock the young ferns unrolled their aromatic scrolls written with wonderful fables of the southern spring for it was only spring here or rather the very beginning of summer the earth had only become warm enough to conceive and bring forth flowers and she was now making the most of the little maternity vouchsafed to her the air was full of winged insects darting hither and thither in astonishment at finding themselves alive the herbage seemed to be visibly growing under your eyes even the wild shapes of the trees were expressive of haste lest the winter might come on them unawares and i noticed that the years growth had been shot out at once so that the young sprays might have time to harden and to protect the next years buds there was no lush rollicking outburst of foliage no mellow epicurean languor of the woods no easy unfolding of leaf on leaf as in the long security of our summers but everywhere a feverish hurry on the part of nature to do something even if it should only be half done and above the valley behind its mural ramparts glowered the cold white snows which had withdrawn for a little while but lay in wait ready to spring down as soon as the protecting sunshine should fail the lady had one harmless tumble into the mud and we were all pretty well fatigued with our rough walk when we reached the lapp encampment it consisted only of two families who lived in their characteristic gammes or huts of earth which serve them also for winter dwellings these burrows were thrown up on a grassy meadow beside a rapid stream which came down from the fjeld and at a little distance were two folds or corrals for their reindeer fenced with pickets slanting outward a number of brownhaired tailless dogs so much resembling bearcubs that at first sight we took them for such were playing about the doors a middleaged lapp with two women and three or four children were the inmates they scented profit and received us in a friendly way allowing the curious strangers to go in and out at pleasure to tease the dogs drink the reindeer milk inspect the children rock the baby and buy horn spoons to the extent of their desire they were smaller than the lapps of kautokeino or perhaps the latter appeared larger in their winter dresses and astonishingly dirty their appearance is much more disgusting in summer than in winter when the snow to a certain extent purifies everything after waiting an hour or more the herd appeared descending the fjeld and driven toward the fold by two young lapps assisted by their dogs there were about four hundred in all nearly onethird being calves their hoarse bleating and the cracking noise made by their kneejoints as they crowded together into a dense mass of grey mossy backs made a very peculiar sound and this combined with their ragged look from the process of shedding their coats of hair did not very favourably impress those of our party who saw them for the first time the old lapp and his boy a strapping fellow of fifteen with a ruddy olive complexion and almost chinese features caught a number of the cows with lassos and proceeded to wean the young deer by anointing the mothers dugs with cowdung which they carried in pails slung over their shoulders in this delightful occupation we left them and returned to tromsцe as we crossed the mouth of the ulvsfjord that evening we had an open sea horizon toward the north a clear sky and so much sunshine at eleven oclock that it was evident the polar day had dawned upon us at last the illumination of the shores was unearthly in its glory and the wonderful effects of the orange sunlight playing upon the dark hues of the island cliffs can neither be told nor painted the sun hung low between fuglцe rising like a double dome from the sea and the tall mountains of arnцe both of which islands resembled immense masses of transparent purple glass gradually melting into crimson fire at their bases the glassy leadencoloured sea was powdered with a golden bloom and the tremendous precipices at the mouth of the lyngen fjord behind us were steeped in a dark red mellow flush and touched with pencillings of pure rosecoloured light until their naked ribs seemed to be clothed in imperial velvet as we turned into the fjord and ran southward along their bases a waterfall struck by the sun fell in fiery orange foam down the red walls and the blue icepillars of a beautiful glacier filled up the ravine beyond it we were all on deck and all faces excited by the divine splendour of the scene and tinged by the same wonderful aureole shone as if transfigured in my whole life i have never seen a spectacle so unearthly beautiful our course brought the sun rapidly toward the ruby cliffs of arnцe and it was evident that he would soon be hidden from sight it was not yet halfpast eleven and an enthusiastic passenger begged the captain to stop the vessel until midnight why said the latter it is midnight now or very near it you have drontheim time which is almost forty minutes in arrears true enough the real time lacked but five minutes of midnight and those of us who had sharp eyes and strong imaginations saw the sun make his last dip and rise a little before he vanished in a blaze of glory behind arnцe i turned away with my eyes full of dazzling spheres of crimson and gold which danced before me wherever i looked and it was a long time before they were blotted out by the semioblivion of a daylight sleep the next morning found us at the entrance of the long alten fjord here the gashed hacked split scarred and shattered character of the mountains ceases and they suddenly assume a long rolling outline full of bold features but less wild and fantastic on the southern side of the fjord many of them are clothed with birch and fir to the height of a thousand feet the valleys here are cultivated to some extent and produce in good seasons tolerable crops of potatoes barley and buckwheat this is above lat or parallel with the northern part of greenland and consequently the highest cultivated land in the world in the valley of the alten river the scotch fir sometimes reaches a height of seventy or eighty feet this district is called the paradise of finmark and no doubt floats in the imaginations of the settlers on magerцe and the dreary porsanger fjord as andalusia and syria float in ours it is well that human bliss is so relative in its character at talvik a cheerful village with a very neat pretty church who should come on board but pastor hvoslef our kautokeino friend of the last winter he had been made one of a government commission of four appointed to investigate and report upon the dissensions between the nomadic lapps and those who have settled habitations a better person could not have been chosen than this good man who has the welfare of the lapps truly at heart and in whose sincerity every one in the north confides we had on board mr thomas the superintendent of the copper works at kaafjord who had just resigned his seat in the storthing and given up his situation for the purpose of taking charge of some mines at copiapo in chili mr thomas is an englishman who has been for twenty years past one of the leading men of finmark and no other man i venture to say has done more to improve and enlighten that neglected province his loss will not be easily replaced at talvik his wife a pleasant intelligent norwegian lady came on board and as we passed the rocky portals guarding the entrance to the little harbour of kaafjord a gun planted on a miniature battery above the landingplace pealed forth a salute of welcome i could partly understand mr thomass long residence in those regions when i saw what a wild picturesque spot he had chosen for his home the cavernous entrances to the copper mines yawned in the face of the cliff above the outer bay below on the waters edge stood the smelting works surrounded by labourers cottages a graceful white church crowned a rocky headland a little further on and beyond above a green lawn decked with a few scattering birches stood a comfortable mansion with a garden in the rear the flag of norway and the cross of st george floated from separate staffs on the lawn there were a number of houses surrounded with potatofields on the slope stretching around the bay and an opening of the hills at its head gave us a glimpse of the fir forests of the inland valleys on such a cloudless day as we had it was a cheerful and homelike spot we took a friendly leave of mr thomas and departed the little battery giving us i dont know how many threegun salutes as we moved off a number of whales spouted on all sides of us as we crossed the head of the fjord to bosekop near the mouth of the alten river this is a little village on a bare rocky headland which completely shuts out from view the rich valley of the alten about which the finmarkers speak with so much enthusiasm ah you should see the farms on the alten say they there we have large houses fields meadows cattle and the finest timber this is altengaard familiar to all the readers of mьgges afraja the gaard however is a single large estate and not a name applied to the whole district as those unfamiliar with norsk nomenclature might suppose here the catholics have established a mission ostensibly a missionary boardinghouse for the purpose of acclimating arctic apostles but the people who regard it with the greatest suspicion and distrust suspect that the ultimate object is the overthrow of their inherited venerated and deeplyrooted lutheran faith at bosekop we lost pastor hvoslef and took on board the chief of the mission the catholic bishop of the arctic zone for i believe his diocese includes greenland spitzbergen and polar america here is a calmuck tartar thought i as a short stronglybuilt man with sallow complexion deepset eyes broad nostrils heavy mouth pointed chin and high cheekbones stepped on board but he proved to be a russian baron whose conversion cost him his estates he had a massive head however in which intellect predominated and his thoroughly polished manners went far to counteract the effect of one of the most unprepossessing countenances i ever saw m gay who had known the bishop at paris at once entered into conversation with him a short time afterwards my attention was drawn to the spot where they stood by loud and angry exclamations two of our norwegian savans stood before the bishop and one of them with a face white with rage was furiously vociferating it is not true it is not true norway is a free country in this respect it is not free answered the bishop with more coolness than i thought he could have shown under such circumstances you know very well that no one can hold office except those who belong to your state church neither a catholic nor a methodist nor a quaker whereas in france as i have said a protestant may even become a minister of the government but we do not believe in the catholic faith we will have nothing to do with it screamed the norwegian we are not discussing our creeds answered the bishop i say that though norway is a free country politically it does not secure equal rights to all its citizens and so far as the toleration of religious beliefs is concerned it is behind most other countries of europe he thereupon retreated to the cabin for a crowd had gathered about the disputants and the deckpassengers pressing aft seemed more than usually excited by what was going on the norwegian shaking with fury hissed through his set teeth how dare he come here to insult our national feeling yes but every word was true and the scene was only another illustration of the intense vanity of the norwegians in regard to their country woe to the man who says a word against norway though he say nothing but what everybody knows to be true so long as you praise everything scenery people climate institutions and customs or keep silent where you cannot praise you have the most genial conversation but drop a word of honest dissent or censure and you will see how quickly every one draws back into his shell there are parts of our own country where a foreigner might make the same observation let a norwegian travel in the southern states and dare to say a word in objection to slavery there is nothing of interest between alten and hammerfest except the old seamargins on the cliffs and a small glacier on the island of seiland the coast is dismally bleak and barren whales were very abundant we sometimes saw a dozen spouting at one time they were of the humpbacked species and of only moderate size yet the fishery would doubtless pay very well if the natives had enterprise enough to undertake it i believe however there is no whale fishery on the whole norwegian coast the desolate hills of qvalц surmounted by the pointed peak of the tjuve fjeld or thief mountain so called because it steals so much of the winter sunshine announced our approach to hammerfest and towards nine oclock in the evening we were at anchor in the little harbour the summer trade had just opened and forty russian vessels which had arrived from the white sea during the previous week or two lay crowded before the large fish warehouses built along the water they were all threemasted schooners the main and mizen masts set close together and with very heavy square hulls strong muscovite faces adorned with magnificent beards stared at us from the decks and a jabber of russian finnish lapp and norwegian came from the rough boats crowding about our gangways the north wind blowing to us off the land was filled with the perfume of dried codfish train oil and burning whalescraps with which as we soon found the whole place is thoroughly saturated there is one hotel in the place containing half a dozen chambers of the size of a stateroom we secured quarters here with a great deal of difficulty owing to slowness of comprehension on the part of an old lady who had charge of the house the other american who at first took rooms for himself and wife gave them up again very prudently for the noises of the billiardroom penetrated through the thin wooden partitions and my bed at least had been slept in by one of the codfish aristocracy for the salty odour was so pungent that it kept me awake for a long time with our fare we had less reason to complain fresh salmon arctic ptarmigan and reindeers tongue were delicacies which would have delighted any palate and the wine had really seen bordeaux although rainy weather had evidently prevailed during the voyage thence to hammerfest the town lies in a deep bight inclosed by precipitous cliffs on the southwestern side of the island whence the sun by this time long past his midsummer altitude was not visible at midnight those of our passengers who intended returning by the nordkap climbed the hills to get another view of him but unfortunately went upon the wrong summit so that they did not see him after all i was so fatigued from the imperfect sleep of the sunshiny nights and the crowd of new and exciting impressions which the voyage had given me that i went to bed but my friend sat up until long past midnight writing with curtains drawn chapter xxvi the midnight sun most of the travellers who push as far north as hammerfest content themselves with one experience of the midnight sun and return with the same steamer to drontheim a few extend their journey to the north cape and once a year on an average perhaps some one is adventurous enough to strike across lapland to torneе the steamers nevertheless pass the north cape and during the summer make weekly trips to the varanger fjord the extreme eastern limit of the norwegian territory we were divided in opinion whether to devote our week of sunshine to the north cape or to make the entire trip and see something of the northern coast of europe but finally decided that the latter on the whole as being unfamiliar ground would be most interesting the screwsteamer gyller one of odins horses was lying in the harbour when we arrived and was to leave in the course of the next night so we lost no time in securing places as she had but a small cabin and no staterooms nevertheless we found her very comfortable and in every respect far superior to the english vessels which ply between hull and christiania our fellow travellers were all returning to drontheim except three norwegian officers on their way to make an official inspection of the fortress of wardцhuus and the last we saw of them was their return an hour past midnight from making a second attempt to see the sun from the hills the night was somewhat obscured and i doubt if they were successful when i went on deck on the morning after our departure we were in the narrow strait between the island of magerцe the northern extremity of which forms the north cape and the mainland on either side the shores of bare bleak rock spotted with patches of moss and stunted grass rose precipitously from the water the snow filling up their ravines from the summit to the sea not a tree nor a shrub nor a sign of human habitation was visible there was no fishers sail on the lonely waters and only the cries of some seagulls wheeling about the cliffs broke the silence as the strait opened to the eastward a boat appeared beating into kjelvik on the southeastern corner of the island but the place itself was concealed from us by an intervening cape this is the spot which von buch visited in the summer of just fifty years ago and his description would be equally correct at the present day here where the scurvy carries off half the inhabitants where pastors coming from southern norway die within a year where no trees grow no vegetables come to maturity and gales from every quarter of the icy sea beat the last faint life out of nature men will still persist in living in apparent defiance of all natural laws yet they have at least an excuse for it in the miraculous provision which providence has made for their food and fuel the sea and fjords are alive with fish which are not only a means of existence but of profit to them while the wonderful gulf stream which crosses miles of the atlantic to die upon this ultima thule in a last struggle with the polar sea casts up the spoils of tropical forests to feed their fires think of arctic fishers burning upon their hearths the palms of hayti the mahogany of honduras and the precious woods of the amazon and the orinoco in the spring months there are on an average vessels on the northern coast between the north cape and vadsц with a fishing population of men on board whose average gains even at the scanty prices they receive amount to apiece making a total yield of it is only within a very few years that the norwegian government has paid any attention to this far corner of the peninsula at present considering the slender population the means of communication are well kept up during eight months in the year and the result is an increase perceptible to an old resident no doubt in the activity and prosperity of the country on issuing from the strait we turned southward into the great porsanger fjord which stretches nearly a hundred miles into the heart of lapland dividing western from eastern finmark its shores are high monotonous hills half covered with snow and barren of vegetation except patches of grass and moss if once wooded like the hills of the alten fjord the trees have long since disappeared and now nothing can be more bleak and desolate the wind blew violently from the east gradually lifting a veil of grey clouds from the cold pale sky and our slow little steamer with jib and foretopsail set made somewhat better progress toward evening if there is such a time in the arctic summer we reached kistrand the principal settlement on the fjord it has eight or nine houses scattered along a gentle slope a mile in length and a little red church but neither gardens fields nor potato patches a strip of grazing ground before the principal house was yellow with dandelions the slope behind showed patches of brownish green grass and above this melancholy attempt at summer stretched the cold grey snowstreaked ridge of the hill two boats manned by sealapps with square blue caps and long ragged locks of yellow hair fluttering in the wind brought off the only passenger and the mails and we put about for the mouth of the fjord running along under the eastern shore we exchanged the dreadful monotony through which we had been sailing for more rugged and picturesque scenery before us rose a wall of dark cliff from five to six hundred feet in height gaping here and there with sharp clefts or gashes as if it had cracked in cooling after the primeval fires the summit of these cliffs was the average level of the country and this peculiarity i found applies to all the northern shore of finmark distinguishing the forms of the capes and islands from those about alten and hammerfest which again are quite different from those of the lofodens on returning from spitzbergen said a hammerfest merchant to me i do not need to look at chart or compass when i get sight of the coast i know from the formation of the cliffs exactly where i am there is some general resemblance to the chalk bluffs of england especially about beachy head but the rock here appears to be micaslate disposed in thin vertical strata with many violent transverse breaks as we approached the end of the promontory which divides the porsanger from the laxe fjord the rocks became more abrupt and violently shattered huge masses fallen from the summit lined the base of the precipice which was hollowed into cavernous arches the home of myriads of seagulls the rock of svжrholtklub off the point resembled a massive fortress in ruins its walls of smooth masonry rested on three enormous vaults the piers of which were buttressed with slanting piles of rocky fragments the ramparts crenelated in some places had mouldered away in others and one fancied he saw in the rents and scars of the giant pile the marks of the shot and shell which had wrought its ruin thousands of white gulls gone to their nightly roost rested on every ledge and cornice of the rock but preparations were already made to disturb their slumbers the steamers cannon was directed towards the largest vault and discharged the fortress shook with the crashing reverberation then rose a shriek as of a city sacked a wild piercing maddening myriadtongued cry which still rings in my ears with the cry came a rushing sound as of a tempest among the woods a white cloud burst out of the hollow archway like the smoke of an answering shot and in the space of a second the air was filled with birds thicker than autumn leaves and rang with one universal clanging shriek a second shot followed by a second outcry and an answering discharge from the other caverns almost darkened the sky the whirring rustling and screaming as the birds circled overhead or dropped like thick scurries of snowflakes on the water was truly awful there could not have been less than fifty thousand in the air at one time while as many more clung to the face of the rock or screamed from the depth of the vaults such an indignation meeting i never attended before but like many others i have heard of the time for action was passed before they had decided what to do it was now eleven oclock and svжrholt glowed in fiery bronze lustre as we rounded it the eddies of returning birds gleaming golden in the nocturnal sun like drifts of beech leaves in the october air far to the north the sun lay in a bed of saffron light over the clear horizon of the arctic ocean a few bars of dazzling orange cloud floated above him and still higher in the sky where the saffron melted through delicate rosecolour into blue hung light wreaths of vapour touched with pearly opaline flushes of pink and golden grey the sea was a web of pale slatecolour shot through and through with threads of orange and saffron from the dance of a myriad shifting and twinkling ripples the air was filled and permeated with the soft mysterious glow and even the very azure of the southern sky seemed to shine through a net of golden gauze the headlands of this deeplyindented coast the capes of the laxe and porsanger fjords and of magerцe lay around us in different degrees of distance but all with foreheads touched with supernatural glory far to the northeast was nordkyn the most northern point of the mainland of europe gleaming rosily and faint in the full beams of the sun and just as our watches denoted midnight the north cape appeared to the westward a long line of purple bluff presenting a vertical front of nine hundred feet in height to the polar sea midway between those two magnificent headlands stood the midnight sun shining on us with subdued fires and with the gorgeous colouring of an hour for which we have no name since it is neither sunset nor sunrise but the blended loveliness of both but shining at the same moment in the heat and splendour of noonday on the pacific isles this was the midnight sun as i had dreamed it as i had hoped to see it within fifteen minutes after midnight there was a perceptible increase of altitude and in less than half an hour the whole tone of the sky had changed the yellow brightening into orange and the saffron melting into the pale vermilion of dawn yet it was neither the colours nor the same character of light as we had had half an hour before midnight the difference was so slight as scarcely to be described but it was the difference between evening and morning the faintest transfusion of one prevailing tint into another had changed the whole expression of heaven and earth and so imperceptibly and miraculously that a new day was already present to our consciousness our view of the wild cliffs of svжrholt less than two hours before belonged to yesterday though we had stood on deck in full sunshine during all the intervening time had the sensation of a night slipped through our brains in the momentary winking of the eyes or was the old routine of consciousness so firmly stereotyped in our natures that the view of a morning was sufficient proof to them of the preлxistence of a night let those explain the phenomenon who can but i found my physical senses utterly at war with those mental perceptions wherewith they should harmonise the eye saw but one unending day the mind notched the twentyfour hours on its calendar as before before one oclock we reached the entrance of the kiцllefjord which in the prediluvial times must have been a tremendous mountain gorge like that of gondo on the italian side of the simplon its mouth is about half a mile in breadth and its depth is not more than a mile and a half it is completely walled in with sheer precipices of bare rock from three to five hundred feet in height except at the very head where they subside into a stony heap upon which some infatuated mortals have built two or three cabins as we neared the southern headland the face of which was touched with the purest orange light while its yawning fissures lay in deepblue gloom a tall ruin with shattered turrets and crumbling spires detached itself from the mass and stood alone at the foot of the precipice this is the finnkirka or church of the lapps well known to all the northern coasters at first it resembles a tall church with a massive square spire but the two parts separate again and you have a cragperched castle of the middleages with its watchtower the very counterpart of scores in germany and a quaint gothic chapel on the point beyond the vertical strata of the rock worn into sharp points at the top and gradually broadening to the base with numberless notched ornaments and channels fluted by the rain make the resemblance marvellous when seen under the proper effects of light and shade the lustre in which we saw it had the effect of enchantment there was a play of colours upon it such as one sees in illuminated moorish halls and i am almost afraid to say how much i was enraptured by a scene which has not its equal on the whole norwegian coast yet of which none of us had ever heard before we landed a single passenger a government surveyor apparently on the heap of rocks beyond and ran out under the northern headland which again charmed us with a glory peculiarly its own here the colours were a part of the substance of the rock and the sun but heightened and harmonised their tones the huge projecting masses of pale yellow had a mellow gleam like golden chalk behind them were cliffs violet in shadow broad strata of soft red tipped on the edges with vermilion thinner layers which shot up vertically to the height of four or five hundred feet and striped the splendid seawall with lines of bronze orange brown and dark red while great rents and breaks interrupted these marvellous frescoes with their dashes of uncertain gloom i have seen many wonderful aspects of nature in many lands but rockpainting such as this i never beheld a part of its effect may have been owing to atmospheric conditions which must be rare even in the north but without such embellishments i think the sight of this coast will nobly repay any one for continuing his voyage beyond hammerfest we lingered on deck as point after point revealed some change in the dazzling diorama uncertain which was finest and whether something still grander might not be in store but at last nordkyn drew nigh and at three oclock the light became that of day white and colourless the northeast wind blew keenly across the arctic ocean and we were both satisfied and fatigued enough to go to bed it was the most northern point of our voyage about which is further north than i ever was before or ever wish to be again chapter xxvii the varanger fjord arctic life when we awoke after six hours sleep with curtains drawn to keep out the daylight our steamer was deep in the tana fjord which receives the waters of the tana river the largest lapland stream flowing into the arctic ocean the greater part of the day was consumed in calling at two settlements of three houses each and receiving and delivering mails of one letter or less the shores of this fjord are steep hills of bare rock covered with patches of snow to the waters edge the riven walls of cliff with their wonderful configuration and marvellous colouring were left behind us and there was nothing of the grand or picturesque to redeem the savage desolation of the scenery the chill wind blowing direct from nova zembla made us shiver and even the cabin saloon was uncomfortable without a fire after passing the most northern point of europe the coast falls away to the southeast so that on the second night we were again in the latitude of hammerfest but still within the sphere of perpetual sunshine our second night of sun was not so rich in colouring as the first yet we remained on deck long enough to see the orb rise again from his lowest dip and change evening into morning by the same incomprehensible process there was no golden transfiguration of the dreadful shore a wan lustre played over the rocks pictures of eternal death like a settled pallor of despair on natures stony face one of the stations on this coast named makur consisted of a few fishermens huts at the bottom of a dismal rocky bight there was no grass to be seen except some tufts springing from the earth with which the roofs were covered and it was even difficult to see where so much earth had been scraped together the background was a hopelessly barren hill more than half enveloped in snow and this was midsummer and human beings passed their lives here those people surely deserve to enter paradise when they die i remarked to my friend for they live in hell while upon earth not for that he answered but because it is impossible for them to commit sin they cannot injure their neighbours for they have none they cannot steal for there is nothing to tempt them they cannot murder for there are none of the usual incentives to hate and revenge they have so hard a struggle merely to live that they cannot fall into the indulgences of sense so that if there is nothing recorded in their favour there is also nothing against them and they commence the next life with blank books but what a life i exclaimed men may be happy in poverty in misfortune under persecution in lifelong disease even so that they are not wholly deprived of the genial influences of society and nature but what is there here they know no other world said he and this ignorance keeps them from being miserable they do no more thinking than is necessary to make nets and boats catch fish and cook them and build their loghouses nature provides for their marrying and bringing up their children and the pastor whom they see once in a long time gives them their religion ready made god keep them ignorant then was my involuntary prayer may they never lose their blessed stupidity while they are chained to these rocks and icy seas may no dreams of summer and verdure no vision of happier social conditions or of any higher sphere of thought and action flash a painful light on the dumbdarkness of their lives the next day we were in the varanger fjord having passed the fortress of vardцhuus and landed our military committee the norwegian shore was now low and tame but no vegetation except a little brown grass was to be seen the russian shore opposite and some twentyfive or thirty miles distant consisted of high bold hills which through a glass appeared to be partially wooded the varanger fjord to which so important a political interest has attached within the last few years is about seventy miles in depth with a general direction towards the southwest the boundaryline between norwegian and russian finmark strikes it upon the southern side about halfway from the mouth so that threefourths or more of the waters of the fjord belong to norway there is however a wonderful boundaryline in addition drawn by nature between the alien waters that last wave of the gulf stream which washes the north cape and keeps the fjords of finmark open and unfrozen the whole year through sweeps eastward along the coast until it reaches the head of varanger fjord here its power is at last spent and from this point commences that belt of solid ice which locks up the harbours of the northern coast of russia for six months in the year the change from open water to ice is no less abrupt than permanent pastor hvoslef informed me that in crossing from vadsц on the northern coast to pasvik the last norwegian settlement close upon the russian frontier as late as the end of may he got out of his boat upon the ice and drove three or four miles over the frozen sea to reach his destination the little fort of vardцhuus on an island at the northern entrance of the fjord is not a recent defence meant to check russian plans in this quarter it was established by christian iv nearly two and a half centuries ago the king himself made a voyage hither and no doubt at that time foresaw the necessity of establishing by military occupation the claims of denmark to this part of the coast the little fortress has actually done this service and though a single frigate might easily batter it to pieces its existence has kept russia from the ownership of the varanger fjord and the creation as is diplomatically supposed of an immense naval station which though within the arctic waters would at all times of the year be ready for service it is well known that russia has endeavoured to obtain possession of the northern side of the fjord as well as of the lyngen fjord near tromsцe towards which her lapland territory stretches out a long arm england is particularly suspicious of these attempts and the treaty recently concluded between the allied powers and sweden had a special reference thereto the importance of such an acquisition to russia is too obvious to be pointed out and the jealous watchfulness of england is therefore easy to understand but it is a singular thing that the conflicting forces of europe find a fulcrum on a little corner of this dead desolate godforsaken shore about ten oclock we reached vadsц the limit of the steamers route here we had intended taking a boat continuing our voyage to nyborg at the head of the fjord crossing thence to the tana and descending that river in season to meet the steamer in the tana fjord on her return we were behind time however and the wind was light the people informed us that we could scarcely carry out the project so we reluctantly gave it up and went ashore to spend the day vadsц is a town of about inhabitants with a secure though shallow harbour which was crowded with fishing vessels and russian traders from the white sea it lies on the bleak hillside without a tree or bush or a patch of grass large enough to be seen without close inspection and its only summer perfume is that of dried fish i saw in gardens attached to one or two houses a few courageous radishes and some foolhardy potatoes which had ventured above ground without the least chance of living long enough to blossom the snow had been four feet deep in the streets in the beginning of june and in six weeks it would begin to fall again a few forlorn cows were hunting pasture over the hills now and then looking with melancholy resignation at the strings of codfish heads hanging up to dry on the broth of which they are fed during the winter i took a walk and made a sketch during the afternoon but the wind was so chill that i was glad to come back shivering to our quarters we obtained lodgings at the house of a baker named aas who had learned the art of charging and was therefore competent to conduct a hotel in order to reach our room we were obliged to pass successively through the family dwellingroom kitchen and a carpenters workshop but our windows commanded a full view of a grogshop across the way where drunken lapps were turned out with astonishing rapidity it was the marriage month of the lapps and the town was full of young couples who had come down to be joined with their relatives and friends all in their gayest costumes through the intervention of the postmaster i procured two women and a child as subjects for a sketch they were dressed in their best and it was impossible not to copy the leer of gratified vanity lurking in the corners of their broad mouths the summer dress consisted of a loose gown of bright green cloth trimmed on the neck and sleeves with bands of scarlet and yellow and a peculiar headdress shaped like a helmet but with a broader and flatter crest rounded in front this also was covered with scarlet cloth and trimmed with yellow and blue they were greatly gratified with the distinction and all the other lapps as in kautokeino would have willingly offered themselves i found the same physical characteristics here as there a fresh ruddy complexion inclining to tawny bright blue eyes brown hair high cheekbones and mouths of enormous width they are not strikingly below the average size heine says in one of his mad songs in lapland the people are dirty flatheaded and broadmouthed and small they squat round the fire while roasting their fishes and chatter and squall which is as good a description of them as can be packed into a stanza on the present occasion they were all drunk in addition one of them lay for a long time at the door with his legs doubled under him as he fell the others stepping over his body as they went in and out these poor creatures were openly and shamelessly allowed to drug themselves as long as their money lasted no wonder the race is becoming extinct when the means of destruction is so freely offered vadsц although only forty miles from vardц at the mouth of the fjord has a much drier and more agreeable climate and the inhabitants are therefore loud in praise of their place we have no such fogs as at vardц say they our fish dry much better and some years we can raise potatoes for the last four or five years however the winters have been getting more and more severe and now it is impossible to procure hay enough to keep their few cattle through the winter we had on board a german who had been living there five years and who appeared well satisfied with his lot i have married here said he i make a good living with less trouble than in germany and have no wish to return singularly enough there were also two italian organ grinders on board whom i accosted in their native language but they seemed neither surprised nor particularly pleased they dropped hints of having been engaged in some political conspiracy and one of them said with a curious mixture of italian and norsk words jeg voglio ikke ritornare i said the same thing i shall not return as i left vadsц we sailed early the next morning and in the afternoon reached vardц where we lay three hours here we took on board the three officers who had in the meantime made their inspection vardцhuus is a single starshaped fort with six guns and a garrison of twentyseven men during the recent war the garrison was increased to three hundred an unnecessary precaution if there was really any danger of an attack to be apprehended so long as the defences of the place were not strengthened one of the officers who had gone out fishing the night previous caught eightythree splendid cod in the space of two hours it was idle sport however for no one would take his fish as a gift and they were thrown on the shore to rot the difficulty is not in catching but in curing them owing to the dampness of the climate they cannot be hung up on poles to dry slowly like the stockfish of the lofodens but must be first salted and then laid on the rocks to dry whence the term klip cliff fish by which they are known in trade at the mouth of the tana we picked up four englishmen who had been salmon fishing on the river they were sunburnt spotted with mosquito bites and had had little luck the river being full of nets and the fjord of seals between which the best of the salmon are either caught or devoured but they spoke of their experience with true english relish oh it was very jolly said one we were so awfully bitten by mosquitoes then our interpreter always lost everything just before we wanted it think of his losing our fryingpan so that we had to fry in the lids of our kettles he had a habit of falling overboard and getting nearly drowned before we could pull him in we had a rough time of it but it was very jolly i assure you the young fellows meant what they said they were all the better for their roughing and i wish the spindleshanked youths who polk and flirt at newport and saratoga had manliness enough for such undertakings we reached hammerfest on the last day of july and reoccupied our old quarters that night the sun went below the horizon for the first time in eight days but his depth was too slight to make any darkness visible i was quite tired of the unending daylight and would willingly have exchanged the pomp of the arctic midnight for the starlit darkness of home we were confused by the loss of night we lost the perception of time one is never sleepy but simply tired and after a sleep of eight hours by sunshine wakes up as tired as ever his sleep at last is broken and irregular he substitutes a number of short naps distributed through the twentyfour hours for the one natural repose and finally gets into a state of general uneasiness and discomfort a hammerfest merchant who has made frequent voyages to spitzbergen told me that in the latitude of he never knew certainly whether it was day or night and the cook was the only person on board who could tell him at first the nocturnal sunshine strikes you as being wonderfully convenient you lose nothing of the scenery you can read and write as usual you never need be in a hurry because there is time enough for everything it is not necessary to do your days work in the daytime for no night cometh you are never belated and somewhat of the stress of life is lifted from your shoulders but after a time you would be glad of an excuse to stop seeing and observing and thinking and even enjoying there is no compulsive rest such as darkness brings no sweet isolation which is the best refreshment of sleep you lie down in the broad day and the summons arise attends on every reopening of your eyes i never went below and saw my fellowpassengers all asleep around me without a sudden feeling that something was wrong they were drugged or under some unnatural influence that they thus slept so fast while the sunshine streamed in through the portholes there are some advantages of this northern summer which have presented themselves to me in rather a grotesque light think what an aid and shelter is removed from crime how many vices which can only flourish in the deceptive atmosphere of night must be checked by the sober reality of daylight no assassin can dog the steps of his victim no burglar can work in sunshine no guilty lover can hold stolen interviews by moonlight all concealment is removed for the sun like the eye of god sees everything and the secret vices of the earth must be bold indeed if they can bear his gaze morally as well as physically there is safety in light and danger in darkness and yet give me the darkness and the danger let the patrolling sun go off his beat for awhile and show a little confidence in my ability to behave properly rather than worry me with his sleepless vigilance i have described the smells of hammerfest which are its principal characteristic it seemed to me the dreariest place in the world on first landing a week previous but by contrast with what we had in the meantime seen it became rather cheerful and comfortable i was visiting a merchant after our return and noticed with pleasure a stunted ash about eight feet high in an adjoining garden oh said he in a tone of irritated pride we have plenty of trees here there is quite a forest up the valley this forest after some search i found the trees were about six feet high and some of them might have been as thick as my wrist in the square before the merchants house lay a crowd of drunken lapps who were supplied with as much bad brandy as they wanted by a licensed grogshop the russian sailors made use of the same privilege and we frequently heard them singing and wrangling on board their white sea junks they were unapproachably picturesque especially after the days work was over when they generally engaged in hunting in the extensive forests of their beards and exercised the law of retaliation on all the game they caught a long street of turfroofed houses whose inhabitants may be said to be under the sod even before they die leads along the shore of the bay to a range of flakes redolent of drying codfish beyond this you clamber over rocks and shingles to a low grassy headland whereon stands a pillar commemorating the measurement of a meridian line of from the danube to the polar sea which was accomplished by the governments of austria russia and sweden between the years and the pillar marks the northern terminus of the line and stands in lat it is a plain shaft of polished red granite standing on a base of grey granite and surmounted by a bronze globe on which a map of the earth is roughly outlined chapter xxviii the return to darkness norwegian character i do not intend to trace our return step by step down the norwegian coast the splendid weather which prevailed during our upward voyage enabled us to see all the interesting points leaving only those parts which we missed in the few hours devoted to sleep to give a little novelty to our return during the whole trip we had not a drop of rain the rarest good fortune in these latitudes and were therefore twice enabled to enjoy to the fullest extent the sublime scenery of the lofoden isles and the coast of nordland this voyage has not its like in the world the traveller to whom all other lands are familiar has here a new volume of the most wonderful originality and variety opened to him the days are illuminated pages crowded with pictures the forms and hues of which he can never forget after i returned to the zone of darkness and recovered from the stress and tension of three weeks of daylight i first fully appreciated the splendours of the arctic sun my eyes were still dazzled with the pomp of colour and the thousand miles of coast as i reviewed them in memory with their chaos of islandpyramids of shattered rock their colossal cliffs their twisted fjords and long fjeldlevels of eternal snow swam in a sea of saffron and rosy light in comparison with which the pale blue day around me seemed dull and dead my dream of the north in becoming a reality has retained the magical atmosphere of dreams and basks in the same gorgeous twilight which irradiates the scandinavian sagas i was particularly struck during the return with the rapid progress of summer the flying leaps with which she clears her short course among the lofodens the potatoes were coming into blossom and the rye and barley into head the grass was already cut in many places and drying on poles and the green of the woods and meadows showed the dark rich character of southern lands owing to this rapidity of growth all the more hardy varieties of vegetables may be successfully cultivated mr thomas informed me that his peas and beans at kaafjord lat n grew three inches in twentyfour hours and though planted six weeks later than those about christiania came to maturity at the same time he has even succeeded in raising excellent cauliflowers but very few of the farmers have vegetable gardens and those which i saw contained only radishes and lettuce with a few useful herbs one finds the same passion for flowers however as in northern sweden and the poorest are rarely without a rose or a geranium in their windows pastor hvoslef who was again our fellowtraveller for a few hours gave me some interesting information concerning the lapps they are it seems entitled to the right of suffrage and to representation in the storthing equally with the norwegians the local jurisdiction repeats on a small scale what the storthing transacts on a large one being entirely popular in its character except that the vogts and lдnsmen whose powers are somewhat similar to those of our judges and country magistrates are not elected but each district chooses from among its inhabitants a committee to confer upon and arrange all ordinary local matters these committees in turn choose persons to constitute a higher body who control the reciprocal relations of the several districts and intervene in case of difficulties between them the system is necessarily simpler and somewhat more primitive in its character than our local organisations in america but it appears at present to answer every purpose the heavy responsibility resting upon judges in norway the severity of the checks and penalties by which their probity is insured probably contributes to make the administration of the laws more efficacious and easy the lapps are not a difficult people to govern and much of the former antagonism between them and the poorer classes of the norwegians has passed away there is little if any amalgamation of the two races nor will there ever be but there is probably as little conflict between them as is compatible with the difference of blood at tromsцe a tall strong clerical gentleman came on board who proved to be the noted pastor lamers one of the first if not the very first clergyman in norway who has refused to receive the government support or in other words has seceded from the church as a state establishment while adhering to all its fundamental doctrines it is the first step towards the separation of church and state which must sooner or later come in norway and in sweden he has a congregation of three hundred members in tromsцe and is about organising a church at gibostad on the island of senjen he has some peculiar views i believe in relation to the baptism of children and insists that the usual absolution dealt out by the pastors is of no effect without full confession and the specification of particular sins but in other respects he is entirely orthodox retaining even the ceremonial of the eucharist this in the lutheran church of norway comes so near to the roman catholic doctrine of transubstantiation that one cannot easily perceive any difference instead of bread an unleavened wafer is administered to the communicants the priest saying as he gives it this is the true body and blood of jesus christ mr forrester a devout admirer of the church which he thinks identical with that of england in all its essentials says the lutherans reject the romish doctrine of transubstantiation but they hold that of a spiritual and ineffable union of the divine nature with the elements the substance of which remains unchanged this is called consubstantiation verily the difference between tweedledum and tweedledee one being as absurd as the other no one coming from a land where all sects stand upon an equal footing and where every church must depend for existence on its own inherent vitality can fail to be struck with the effete and decrepit state of religion in sweden and norway it is a body of frigid mechanical forms and ceremonies animated here and therewith a feeble spark of spiritual life but diffusing no quickening and animating glow i have often been particularly struck with the horror with which the omission of certain forms was regarded by persons in whom i could discover no trace of any religious principle the church has a few dissensions to combat she has not been weakened by schism but she is slowly ossifying from sheer inertia the reformation needs to be reformed again and perhaps the tardy privileges granted to the haugianer and lдsare the northern methodists may result in producing a body of dissenters large enough to excite emulation action and improvement in norway the pastors have the best salaries and the easiest places of all government officials those who conscientiously discharge their duties have enough to do but were this universally the case one would expect to find the people less filthy stupid and dishonest than they are in many parts of the country a specimen of the intelligence of one who is now a member of the storthing was communicated to me by a gentleman who heard it the clergyman advocated the establishment of telegraph lines in norway not for the sake of sending news said he that is of no consequence but it is well known that no wolf can pass under a telegraph wire and if we can get lines put up throughout the country all the wolves will be obliged to leave of course i do not mean to assert that the norwegian clergymen as a body are not sincere zealous wellinformed men the evil lies rather in that system which makes religion as much a branch of government service as law or diplomacy and which until very recently has given one sect an exclusive monopoly of the care of human souls i had a strong desire to converse with pastor lamers in relation to the stand he has taken but he was surrounded by a crowd of persons during his stay on board and no opportunity presented itself the sensation which his presence produced showed that there are restless elements at work in the mind of the people the stony crust is beginning to heave and split at last even the deckpassengers gathered into little groups and talked earnestly two gentlemen near me were discussing the question of an established church one contending that a variety of sects tended only to confuse perplex and unchristianise the uneducated unthinking class while the other asserted that this very class adhered most tenaciously to whatever faith had been taught them at this moment a woman standing near us exclaimed there were false prophets in all times and there are false prophets now we must beware of them the earnestness of her speech affording a good comment on the argument just produced whatever may be the popular opinion concerning the course of pastor lamers i could not but notice the marked respect displayed by every one who approached him in passing hindцe we saw two magnificent golden eagles wheeling around one of the loftiest cliffs the wind blew strongly from the southwest increasing until we had what sailors call a dry gale in crossing the west fjord but it abated the next day and by the late twilight we recrossed the arctic circle this night there was great rejoicing on board at the discovery of a star we had not seen one for a month and some of the passengers coming from finmark had been more than two months in daylight while we were all gazing upon it as upon some extraordinary phenomenon a flood of yellow lamplight suddenly streamed through the cabin skylight the sky was still brilliant with sunset in the north but it was dark enough to see to sleep we could not yet cover ourselves all over even as with a cloak still there was a shelter and friendly covering for the helpless body our sleep became sound and regular and its old power of restoration was doubly sweet since we had known what it was to be deprived of it our fellowpassengers after leaving carlsoe where the young englishmen stopped to hunt were almost exclusively norwegian and this gave us further opportunities of becoming acquainted with some peculiarities of the national character intelligent norwegians especially those who have travelled are exceedingly courteous gentlemanly and agreeable persons the three officers on board were men of unusual intelligence and refinement and we considered ourselves fortunate in having their company during the entire voyage the landhand lare or country merchants and government officials of the lower ranks exhibit more reserve and not unfrequently a considerable amount of ignorance and prejudice perhaps the most general feature of the norwegian character is an excessive national vanity which is always on the alert and fires up on the slightest provocation say everything you like except that norway in any respect is surpassed by any other country one is assailed with questions about his impressions of the scenery people government c a very natural and pardonable curiosity it is true and one only demands in return that his candour be respected and no offence taken this however is rarely the case if there is no retaliatory answer on the spot you hear a remark days afterwards which shows how your mild censure has rankled in the mind of the hearer my friend was asked by a passenger whether he did not think the women of finmark very beautiful it was impossible to answer in the affirmative the questioner went off in high dudgeon and did not speak to him again for several days in the varanger fjord we had pretty freely expressed our impressions of the desolate coast afterwards on returning past the grand cliff scenery of nordkyn we were admiring some bold formation of the rocks when a norwegian came up and said in a tone of angry irony ah you find a little to admire at last do you you find some beauty in our country after all so in regard to the government the norwegians may be justly proud of their constitution which is as republican in its character as our own there is so much in the administration of the government which every one must heartily commend that they should be less sensitive in regard to minor faults this sensitiveness however is partly accounted for when we remember that for four hundred years norway was a danish province and that only fortythree years ago she leaped at once from subjection to a freedom such as no other country in europe enjoys the intense pride and selfglorification of the people resembles that of a youth who for the first time assumes a dresscoat and standing collar king oscar on his accession to the throne gave the country a separate national flag and nowhere does one see such a display of flags all over the land and all along the shores the colours of norway are flying jealousy of sweden and dislike of the swedes are inherited feelings and are kept alive by a mutual prejudice on the part of the latter people one cannot but smile a little at the present union of sweden and norway when he finds that the countries have separate currencies neither of which will pass at its full value in the other separate tariffs and of course customhouse examinations between the two and if the norwegians had their way would have separate diplomatic representatives abroad yet the strength of norway is undoubtedly in her alliance with sweden alone she would be but a fourthrate power enough has been done to satisfy her national feeling and secure her liberties against assault and it is now time that this unnecessary jealousy and mistrust of a kindred race should cease the swedes have all the honesty which the norwegians claim for themselves more warmth and geniality of character and less selfish sharpness and shrewdness mьgge tells a story of a number of swedes who were at a dinner party in paris where the health of the king of sweden and norway was proposed and drunk with great enthusiasm one glass was observed to be untouched it belonged to a norwegian who when called upon for an explanation said i cannot drink such a toast as this but i will drink the health of the king of norway who is also king of sweden one cannot find fault with a people for their patriotism i have always admired that love of gamle norge which shines through norwegian history song and saga but when it is manifested in such ridiculous extremes one doubts the genuineness of the feeling and suspects it of being alloyed with some degree of personal vanity there are still evils to be eradicated reproaches to be removed reforms to be achieved which claim all the best energies of the best men of the country and positive harm is done by concealing or denying the true state of things chapter xxix drontheim and bergen we spent another day and a half in drontheim before reshipping in the steamer for bergen with the exception of a trip to the lierfoss or falls of the nid however it was by no means a satisfactory sojourn the hotel was full and we could only get quarters in the billiardroom through which other guests were continually passing and repassing two small boys were quite inadequate to the service the table dhote was the scantiest i ever saw and the charges at the rate of three dollars a day the whole of sunday was consumed in an attempt to recover our carrioles which we left behind us on embarking for hammerfest the servants neglected to get them on saturday evening as we had ordered and in the morning the man who had the key of the warehouse went into the country taking it with him the whole day was spent in searching and waiting and it was only by unremitting exertions that we succeeded in putting them on board in the evening owing to this annoyance i was unable to attend service in the cathedral or even to see the inside of it our drive to the lierfoss in the evening was an exquisite enjoyment the valley of the nid behind drontheim is one of the most carefully cultivated spots in norway our road led up the stream overlooking rich levels of grain and hay fields studded with large and handsome farmhouses while the lower slopes of the hills and the moundlike knolls scattered along their bases were framed to the very summit steep as they were the whole scene was like a piece of landscape gardening full of the loveliest effects which were enhanced by the contrast of the grey sterile mountains by which the picture was framed the soft level sunshine streaming through the rifts of broken thunderclouds in the west slowly wandered over the peaceful valley here lighting up a redroofed homestead there a grove in full summer foliage or a meadow of so brilliant an emerald that it seemed to shine by its own lustre as we approached the lierfoss the road was barred with a great number of gates before which waited a troop of ragged boys who accompanied us the whole of the way with a pertinacity equal to that of the little swiss beggars the nid here makes two falls about half a mile apart the lower one being eighty and the upper one ninety feet in height the water is of a dark olivegreen colour and glassy transparency and so deep that at the brink it makes huge curves over the masses of rock in its bed without breaking into the faintest ripple as you stand on a giant boulder above it and contrast the swift silent rush with the thundering volume of ambertinted spray which follows you feel in its full force the strange fascination of falling water the temptation to plunge in and join in its headlong revelry here however i must admit that the useful is not always the beautiful the range of smoky mills driven by a sluice from the fall had better be away the upper fall is divided in the centre by a mass of rock and presents a broader and more imposing picture though the impetus of the water is not so great the coast between drontheim and bergen is on the whole much less striking than that further north but it has some very grand features the outer islands are with few exceptions low and barren but the coast deeply indented with winding fjords towers here and there into sublime headlands and precipitous barriers of rock christiansund where we touched the first afternoon is a singularly picturesque place built on four islands separated by channels in the form of a cross the bare rounded masses of grey rock heave up on all sides behind the houses which are built along the waters edge here and there a tree of superb greenness shines against the colourless background and the mountains of the mainland with their tints of pink and purple complete the picture the sun was burningly hot and the palegreen water reflected the shores in its oily gloss but in severe storms i was told it is quite impossible to cross from one island to another and the different parts of the town sometimes remain for days in a state of complete isolation i rose very early next morning to have a view of molde and the enchanting scenery of the romsdalsfjord the prosperouslooking town with its large square houses its suburban cottages and gardens on the slope of a long green hill crowned with woods was wholly swiss in its appearance but the luminous morning vapors hovering around the alpine peaks in the east entirely hid them from our view in this direction lies the famous romsdal which many travellers consider the grandest specimen of norwegian scenery unfortunately we could not have visited it without taking an entire week and we were apprehensive lest the fine weather which we had now enjoyed for twentyfour days should come to an end before we were done with the bergenstift it is almost unexampled that travellers make the voyage from drontheim to the varanger fjord and back without a cloudy day while we had perpetual daylight the tourists whom we left behind were drenched with continual rains aalesund is another island port smaller than christiansund but full as picturesque the intense heat and clearness of the day the splendour of the sunshine which turned the grassy patches on the rocks into lustrous velvet and the dark dazzling blue of the sea belonged rather to southern italy than to norway as we approached bergen however the sky became gradually overcast and the evening brought us clouds and showers not far from aalesund was the castle of rollo the conqueror of normandy all this part of the coast is viking ground from these fjords went forth their piratical dragons and hither they returned laden with booty to rest and carouse in their strongholds they were the buccaneers of the north in their time bold brave with the virtues which belong to courage and hardihood but coarse cruel and brutal the viking of scandinavian song is a splendid fellow but his original if we may judge from his descendants was a stupid hardheaded lustful and dirty giant whom we should rather not have had for a companion harold haarfager may have learnt in constantinople to wash his face and comb his beautiful hair but i doubt if many of his followers imitated him let us hope that ingeborg changed her dress occasionally and that balders temple was not full of fleas that thorsten vikingsson placed before his guests something better than fladbrцd and rancid butter and that bjцrn and frithiof acted as honestly towards strangers as towards each other the viking chiefs undoubtedly must have learned the comfort of cleanliness and the delights of good living but if such habits were general the nation has greatly degenerated since their time we stayed on deck until midnight notwithstanding the rain to see the grand rock of hornelen a precipice feet high the clouds lifted a little and there was a dim lurid light in the sky as our steamer swept under the awful cliff a vast indistinct mass reaching apparently to the zenith the summit crowned with a pointed tour resembling the cathedral of drontheim and the sides scarred with deep fissures loomed over us now a splintered spire disengaged itself from the gloom and stood defined against the sky lighter streaks marked the spots where portions had slid away but all else was dark uncertain and sublime our friendly captain had the steamers guns discharged as we were abreast of the highest part there were no separate echoes but one tremendous peal of sound prolonged like the note of an organpipe and gradually dying away at the summit in humming vibrations next morning we were sailing in a narrow strait between perpendicular cliffs fluted like basaltic pillars it was raining dismally but we expected nothing else in the neighbourhood of bergen in this city the average number of rainy days in a year is two hundred bergen weather has become a byword throughout the north and no traveller ventures to hope for sunshine when he turns his face thither is it still raining at bergen ask the dutch skippers when they meet a norwegian captain yes blast you is it still blowing at the texel is generally the response we took on board four or five lepers on their way to the hospital at bergen a piece of oilcloth had been thrown over some spars to shield them from the rain and they sat on deck avoided by the other passengers a melancholy picture of disease and shame one was a boy of fourteen upon whose face wartlike excrescences were beginning to appear while a woman who seemed to be his mother was hideously swollen and disfigured a man crouching down with his head between his hands endeavoured to hide the seamed and knotted mass of protruding blue flesh which had once been a human face the forms of leprosy elephantiasis and other kindred diseases which i have seen in the east and in tropical countries are not nearly so horrible for these unfortunates there was no hope some years more or less of a life which is worse than death was all to which they could look forward no cure has yet been discovered for this terrible disease there are two hospitals in bergen one of which contains about five hundred patients while the other which has recently been erected for the reception of cases in the earlier stages who may be subjected to experimental courses of treatment has already one hundred this form of leprosy is supposed to be produced partly by an exclusive diet of salt fish and partly by want of personal cleanliness the latter is the most probable cause and one does not wonder at the result after he has had a little experience of norwegian filth it is the awful curse which falls upon such beastly habits of life i wish the norwegians could be made mussulmen for awhile for the sake of learning that cleanliness is not only next to godliness but a necessary part of it i doubt the existence of filthy christians and have always believed that st jerome was atrociously slandered by the italian painters but is there no responsibility resting upon the clergymen of the country who have so much influence over their flocks and who are themselves clean and proper persons bergen is also as i was informed terribly scourged by venereal diseases certainly i do not remember a place where there are so few men tall strong and wellmade as the people generally are without some visible mark of disease or deformity a physician of the city has recently endeavoured to cure syphilis in its secondary stage by means of inoculation having first tried the experiment upon himself and there is now a hospital where this form of treatment is practiced upon two or three hundred patients with the greatest success as another physician informed me i intended to have visited it as well as the hospital for lepers but the sight of a few cases around the door of the latter establishment so sickened me that i had no courage to undertake the task let me leave these disagreeable themes and say that bergen is one of the most charmingly picturesque towns in all the north its name the mountain denotes one of its most striking features it is built upon two low capes which project from the foot of a low mountain two thousand feet high while directly in its rear lies a lovely little lake about three miles in circumference on the end of the northern headland stands the fortress of berghenhuus with the tall square mass of walkendorfs tower built upon the foundations of the former palace of king olaf kyrre the founder of the city the narrow harbour between is crowded with fishingvessels during the season often numbering from six to eight hundred and beyond it the southern promontory quite covered with houses rises steeply from the water a public grove behind the fortress delights the eye with its darkgreen mounds of foliage near it rise the twin towers of the german church which boasts an age of nearly seven hundred years and the suburbs on the steep mountainsides gradually vanish among gardens and countryvillas which are succeeded by farms and grazing fields lying under the topmost ridges of the bare rock the lake in the rear is surrounded with the country residences of the rich merchants a succession of tasteful dwellings each with its garden and leafy arbours its flowers and fountains forming a rich frame to the beautiful sheet of water avenues of fine old lindens thread this suburban paradise and seats placed at the proper points command views of which one knows not the loveliest everything has an air of ancient comfort taste and repose one sees yet the footsteps of mighty hansa who for three centuries reigned here supreme the northern half of bergen is still called the german quarter and there are very few citizens of education who do not speak the language with one or two exceptions the streets are rough and narrow there are no quaint peculiarities in the architecture the houses being all of wood painted white or some light colour at every door stands a barrel filled with water to be ready in case of fire owing to the great number of fishingvessels and its considerable foreign trade bergen is a much more lively and bustling place than either christiania or drontheim the streets are well populated and the great square at the head of the harbour is always thronged with a motley concourse of fishermen traders and country people drunkenness seems to be a leading vice i saw at least fifty people more or less intoxicated in the course of a short walk one afternoon the grog shops however are rigidly closed at six oclock on saturday evening and remain so until monday morning any violation or evasion of the law being severely punished the same course has been adopted here as in sweden the price of brandy has been doubled by restrictions on its manufacture and every encouragement has been afforded to breweries the beer of christiania is equal in flavour and purity to any in the world and it is now in great demand all over norway the day after our arrival the sky cleared again and we were favoured with superb weather which might well be the case as the people told me it had previously been raining every day for a month the gardens groves and lawns of velvet turf so long moistened now blazed out with splendid effect in the hot august sunshine is there such a green anywhere else in the world asked my friend if anywhere only in england but scarcely there i was obliged to confess yet there was an acquaintance of mine in bergen a hammerfest merchant who in this rare climax of summer beauty looked melancholy and dissatisfied i want to get back to the north said he i miss our arctic summer these dark nights are so disagreeable that i am very tired of them there is nothing equal to our three months of daylight and they alone reconcile us to the winter who will say after this that anything more than the fundamental qualities of human nature are the same in all climates but from the same foundation you may build either a grecian temple or a chinese pagoda the lions of bergen are soon disposed of after you have visited the fortress and admired the sturdy solidity of walkendorfs tower you may walk into the german church which stands open or did when we were there without a soul to prevent you from carrying off some of the queer old carved work and pictures the latter are hideous enough to be perfectly safe and the church though exceedingly quaint and interesting is not beautiful then you may visit the museum which contains an excellent collection of northern fish and some very curious old furniture the collection of antiquities is not remarkable but it should be remembered that the museum has been created within the last twenty years and is entirely the result of private taste and enterprise one of the most singular things i saw was a specimen said to be the only one in existence of a fish called the herringking about twelve feet in length by one in thickness and with something of the serpent in its appearance the old kraaken has not shown himself for a number of years possibly frightened away by the appearance of steamers in his native waters in spite of all the testimony which capell brooke has collected in favour of his existence he is fast becoming a myth bergen we found is antiquated in more respects than one on sending for horses on the morning fixed for our departure we were coolly told that we should have to wait twentyfour hours but after threatening to put the law in force against the skydsskaffer he promised to bring them by one oclock in the afternoon in this city of inhabitants no horses are kept in readiness at the poststation but are furnished by farmers somewhere at a distance in the matter of hotels however bergen stands in the front rank of progress rivalling christiania and drontheim the fare is not so good and the charges are equally high there are two little inns with five or six rooms each and one boardinghouse of the same size we could only get one small room into which all three were packed at a charge of a dollar and a quarter per day while for two wretched meals we paid a dollar and a half each the reader may judge of our fare from the fact that one day our soup was raspberry juice and water and another time cold beer flavoured with pepper and cinnamon add tough beafsteaks swimming in grease and rancid butter and you have the principal ingredients for the first time in my life i found my digestive powers unequal to the task of mastering a new national diet chapter xxx a trip to the vцringfoss after waiting only five hours we obtained three horses and drove away from bergen it was a superb afternoon spotlessly blue overhead with still bluer water below and hills of dark velvety verdure throbbing and sparkling in the sunshine and the breezes from off the fjord we sped past the long line of suburban gardens through the linden avenues which somehow or other suggested to me the days of the hanseatic league past tivoli the hoboken of bergen and on the summit of the hill beyond stopped to take a parting look at the beautiful city she sat at the foot of her guardian mountain across the lake her white towers and red roofs rising in sharp relief against the purple background of the islands which protect her from the sea in colour form and atmospheric effect the picture was perfect norway is particularly fortunate in the position and surroundings of her three chief cities bergen bears away the palm truly but either of them has few rivals in europe our road led at first over wellcultivated hills dotted with comfortable farmhouses a rolling broken country enclosed by rugged and sterile groups of hills after some miles we turned northward into a narrow valley running parallel to the coast line the afternoon sun shining over the shoulder of the mountainridge on our left illuminated with dazzling effect the green pastures in the bosom of the valley and the groves of twinkling birch and sombre fir on the opposite slope i have never seen purer tints in the sunshine never a softer transparency in the shadows the landscape was ideal in its beauty except the houses whose squalor and discomfort were real our first station lay off the road on a hill a very friendly old man promised to get us horses as soon as possible and his wife set before us the best fare the house afforded milk oaten shingles and bad cheese the house was dirty and the aspect of the family bed which occupied one end of the room merely divided by boards into separate compartments for the parents children and servants was sufficient to banish sleep notwithstanding the poverty of the place the old woman set a good value upon her choice provender the horses were soon forthcoming and the man whose apparent kindness increased every moment said to me have i not done well is it not very well that i have brought you horses so soon i assented cheerfully but he still repeated the same questions and i was stupid enough not to discover their meaning until he added i have done everything so well that you ought to give me something for it the naпve manner of this request made it seem reasonable and i gave him something accordingly though a little disappointed for i had congratulated myself on finding at last a friendly and obliging skydsskaffer postmaster in norway towards evening we reached a little village on the shore of the osterfjord here the road terminated and a water station of eighteen miles in length lay before us the fjords on the western coast of norway are narrow shut in by lofty and abrupt mountains and penetrate far into the land frequently to the distance of a hundred miles the general direction of the valleys is parallel to the line of the coast intersecting the fjords at nearly a right angle so that they in connection with these watery defiles divide the mountains into immense irregular blocks with very precipitous sides and a summit tableland varying from two to four thousand feet above the sea level for this reason there is no continuous road in all western norway but alternate links of land and water boats and posthorses the deepest fjords reach very nearly to the spinal ridge of the mountain region and a landroad from bergen to this line would be more difficult to construct than any of the great highways across the alps in proportion to her population and means norway has done more for roads than any country in the world not only her main thoroughfares but even her byways give evidence of astonishing skill industry and perseverance the storthing has recently appropriated a sum of for the improvement of roads in addition to the repairs which the farmers are obliged to make and which constitute almost their only tax as there is no assessment whatever upon landed property there seems a singular incongruity however in finding such an evidence of the highest civilisation in connection with the semibarbaric condition of the people generally the improvement of the means of communication in a country is in the ratio of its social progress as we were obliged to wait until morning before commencing our voyage we set about procuring supper and lodging some dirty beds in a dirty upper room constituted the latter but the former was a doubtful affair the landlord who persisted in calling me dock made a foraging excursion among the houses and after some time laid before us a salted and smoked leg of mutton some rancid butter hard oaten bread and pestilential cheese i ate as a matter of duty towards my body but my companions were less conscientious we deserve no credit for having risen early the next morning neither was there any selfdenial in the fact of our being content with a single cup of coffee the boatmen five in number who had been engaged the evening before took our carrioles apart and stowed them in the stern while we three disposed ourselves very uneasily in the narrow bow as we were about pushing off one of the men stepped upon a stone and shouted in a loud voice come and help us fairies whereat the others laughed heartily the wind was against us but i thought the men hugged the shore much more than was necessary i noticed the same thing afterwards and spoke of it but they stated that there were strong currents in these fjords setting towards the sea the water in fact is but slightly brackish and the ebb and flow of the tides is hardly felt the scenery in the osterfjord is superb mountains feet high inclose and twist it between their interlocking bases cliffs of naked rock overhang it and cataracts fall into it in long zigzag chains of foam here and there a little embayed dell rejoices with settlement and cultivation and even on the wildest steeps where it seems almost impossible for a human foot to find hold the people scramble at the hazard of their lives to reap a scanty harvest of grass for the winter goats pasture everywhere and our boatmen took delight in making the ewes follow us along the cliffs by imitating the bleating of kids towards noon we left the main body of the fjord and entered a narrow arm which lay in eternal shadow under tremendous walls of dark rock the light and heat of noonday were tropical in their silent intensity painting the summits far above with dashes of fierce colour while their bases sank in blue gloom to meet the green darkness of the water again and again the heights enclosed us so that there was no outlet but they opened as if purposely to make way for us until our keel grated the pebbly barrier of a narrow valley where the land road was resumed four miles through this gap brought us to another branch of the same fjord where we were obliged to have our carrioles taken to pieces and shipped for a short voyage at its extremity the fjord narrowed and still loftier mountains overhung it shut in by these like some palmy dell in the heart of the porphyry mountains of the sahara lay bolstadцren a miracle of greenness and beauty a mantle of emerald velvet falling in the softest slopes and swells to the waters edge was thrown upon the valley the barley had been cut and bound to long upright poles to dry rising like golden pillars from the shaven stubble and to crown all above the landingplace stood a twostory house with a jolly fat landlord smoking in the shade and halfadozen pleasantlooking women gossiping indoors can we get anything to eat was the first question the gentlemen can have fresh salmon and potatoes and red wine if they wish it answered the mistress of course we wished it we wished for any food clean enough to be eatable and the promise of such fare was like the falling of manna in the desert the salmon fresh from the stream was particularly fine the fish here is so abundant that the landlord had caught as he informed us in the course of one season we had but two miles of land before another sheet of water intervened and our carrioles were again taken to pieces the postillions and boatmen along this route were great scamps frequently asking more than the legal fare and in one instance threatened to prevent us from going on unless we paid it i shall not bore the reader with accounts of our various little squabbles on the road all of which tended more and more to convince us that unless the norwegians were a great deal more friendly kind and honest a few years ago than they are now they have been more overpraised than any people in the world i must say however that they are bungling swindlers and could only be successful with the greenest of travellers the moment an imposition is resisted and the stranger shows himself familiar with the true charges and methods of travel they give up the attempt but the desire to cheat is only less annoying to one than cheating itself the fees for travelling by skyds are it is true disproportionably low and in many instances the obligation to furnish horses is no doubt an actual loss to the farmer very often we would have willingly paid a small increase upon the legal rates if it had been asked for as a favour but when it was boldly demanded as a right and backed by a falsehood we went not a stiver beyond the letter of the law landing at evanger an intelligent landlord who had four brothers in america gave us return horses to vossevangen and we enjoyed the long twilight of the warm summer evening while driving along the hills which overlook the valley connecting the lakes of vossevangen and evanger it was a lovely landscape ripe with harvest and the air full of mellow balmy odours from the flowers and grain the black spire of vossevangen church standing dark against the dawning moonlight was the welcome termination of our long days journey and not less welcome were our clean and comfortable quarters in the house of a merchant there here we left the main road across norway and made an excursion to the vцringfoss which lies beyond the hardanger fjord about fifty miles distant in a southeastern direction vossevangen in the splendour of a cloudless morning was even more beautiful than as a moonlit haven of repose the compact little village lay half buried in trees clustered about the massive old church with its black pointed tower and roof covered with pitched shingles in the centre of the valley while the mountains around shone bald and bright through floating veils of vapour which had risen from the lake the people were all at work in the fields betimes cutting and stacking the barley the grassfields cut smooth and close and of the softest and evenest green seemed kept for show rather than for use the bottom of the valley along which we drove was filled with an unbroken pine forest inclosing here and there a lake where heaven itself brought down to earth seemed fairer than above while the opposite mountain rose rich with harvest fields and farmhouses there are similar landscapes between fribourg and vevay in switzerland finer perhaps except that all cultivated scenery in norway gains wonderfully in effect from the savage environment of the barren fjelds here cultivation is somewhat of a phenomenon and a rich thickly settled valley strikes one with a certain surprise the norwegians have been accused of neglecting agriculture but i do not see that much more could be expected of them the subjugation of virgin soil as we had occasion to notice is a serious work at the best the grain harvests are uncertain while fish are almost as sure as the season and so the surplus agricultural population either emigrates or removes to the fishing grounds on the coast there is undoubtedly a considerable quantity of wild land which could be made arable but the same means applied to the improvement of that which is at present under cultivation would accomplish far more beneficent results leaving the valley we drove for some time through pine forests and here as elsewhere had occasion to notice the manner in which this source of wealth has been drained of late years the trees were very straight and beautiful but there were none of more than middle age all the fine old timber had been cut away all norway in fact has been despoiled in like manner and the people are but just awaking to the fact that they are killing a goose which lays golden eggs the government so prudently economical that it only allows worth of silver to be quarried annually in the mines of kongsberg lest the supply should be exhausted has i believe adopted measures for the preservation of the forests but i am not able to state their precise character except in valleys remote from the rivers and fjords one now finds very little mature timber the tallest pine hewn on norwegian hills to be the mast of some great admiral i have not yet seen we at last came upon a little lake in a close glen with walls feet high not suspecting that we had ascended much above the sealevel we were surprised to see the gorge all at once open below us revealing a darkblue lake far down among the mountains we stood on the brink of a wall over which the stream at our side fell in a hank of divided cataracts our road was engineered with great difficulty to the bottom of the steep whence a gentler descent took us to the hamlet of vasenden at the head of the lake beyond this there was no road for carrioles and we accordingly gave ours in charge of a bright active and intelligent little postmaster twelve years old he and his mother then rowed us across the lake to the village of graven whence there was a bridleroad across the mountains to a branch of the hardanger fjord they demanded only twelve skillings ten cents for the row of three miles and then posted off to a neighbouring farmhouse to engage horses for us there was a neat white dwelling on the hill which we took to be the parsonage but which proved to be the residence of an army captain on leave whom we found sitting in the door cleaning his gun as we approached he courteously ushered us into the house and made his appearance soon afterwards in a clean shirt followed by his wife with wine and cakes upon a tray i found him to be a man of more than ordinary intelligence and of an earnest and reflective turn of mind rare in men of his profession he spoke chiefly of the passion for emigration which now possesses the norwegian farmers considering it not rendered necessary by their actual condition but rather one of those contagions which spread through communities and nations overcoming alike prudence and prejudice he deplored it as retarding the development of norway personal interest however is everywhere stronger than patriotism and i see no signs of the emigration decreasing for some years to come after waiting a considerable time we obtained two horses and a strapping farmers son for guide the fellow was delighted to find out where we came from and was continually shouting to the people in the fields here these are americans they were born there whereat the people stared saluted and then stared again he shouldered our packs and marched beside the horses with the greatest ease you are strong i remarked yes he replied i am a strong normand making his patriotism an excuse for his personal pride we had a terribly tough pull up the mountain through fine woods to the summit level of the fjeld the view backwards over the lake was enchanting and we lingered long on the steep loth to lose it turning again a desolate lake lay before us heathery swells of the bleak tableland and distant peaks touched with snow once upon the broad level summit of a norwegian fjeld one would never guess what lovely valleys lie under those misty breaks which separate its immense lobes what gashes of life and beauty penetrate its stony heart there are in fact two norways one above a series of detached irregular masses bleak snowy windswept and heathergrown inhabited by herdsmen and hunters and one below a ramification of narrow veins of land and water with fields and forests highways and villages so when we had traversed the upper land for several miles we came to a brink overlooking another branch of the lower land and descended through thick woods to the farms of ulvik on the eyfjord an arm of the hardanger the shores were gloriously beautiful slopes of dazzling turf inclosed the bright blue water and clumps of oak ash and linden in parklike groups studded the fields low red farmhouses each with its hollow square of stables and granaries dotted the hillsides and the people male and female were everywhere out reaping the ripe barley and piling it pillarwise upon tall stakes owing to this circumstance we were obliged to wait some time for oarsmen there was no milk to be had nor indeed anything to eat notwithstanding the signs of plenty on all sides my friend wandering from house to house at last discovered an old man who brought him a bowl of mead in exchange for a cigar late in the afternoon two men came put us into a shabby and leaky boat and pulled away slowly for vik ten miles distant the fjord was shut in by lofty and abrupt mountains often interrupted by deep lateral gorges this is the general character of the hardanger fjord a broad winding sheet of water with many arms but whose extent is diminished to the eye by the grandeur of its shores nothing can be wilder or more desolate than this scenery especially at the junction of the two branches where all signs of habitation are shut out of sight and one is surrounded by mighty precipices of darkred rock vanishing away to the eastward in a gloomy defile it was three hours and a half before we reached vik at the head of a bay on the southern side here however some english fishermen were quartered and we made sure of a supper the landlord of course received their superfluous salmon and they were not the men to spare a potatofield so both were forthcoming and in the satisfaction of appeased hunger we were willing to indorse the opinion of a former english traveller in the guests book this place seems to me a paradise although very probably it is not one the luxury of fishing which i never could understand has taught the norwegians to regard travellers as their proper prey why should a man they think pay l for the privilege of catching fish which he gives away as soon as caught unless he dont know how else to get rid of his money were it not that fishing in norway includes pure air hard fare and healthy exercise i should agree with somebodys definition of angling a rod with a fly at one end and a fool at the other but it is all that and besides furnished us with a good meal more than once wherefore i respect it we were now but eight miles from the vцringfoss and set out betimes the next morning taking with us a bottle of red wine some dry bread and peder halstensen as guide i mention peder particularly because he is the only jolly lively wideawake openhearted norwegian i have ever seen as rollicking as a neapolitan as chatty as an andalusian and as frank as a tyrolese he formed a remarkable contrast to the men with whom we had hitherto come in contact he had long black hair wicked black eyes and a mouth which laughed even when his face was at rest add a capital tenor voice a lithe active frame and something irresistibly odd and droll in his motions and you have his principal points we walked across the birchwooded isthmus behind vik to the eyfjordsvand a lake about three miles long which completely cuts off the further valley the mountains on either side falling to it in sheer precipices feet high we embarked in a crazy leaky boat peder pulling vigorously and singing frie dig ved lifvet life let us cherish with all the contentment on his face which is expressed in mozarts immortal melody peder said i do you know the national song of norway i should think so was his answer stopping short in the midst of a wild fjeldsong clearing his throat and singing with a fervour and enthusiasm which rang wide over the lonely lake minstrel awaken the harp from its slumbers strike for old norway the land of the free high and heroic in soulstirring numbers clime of our fathers we strike it for thee old recollections awake our affections hallow the name of the land of our birth each heart beats its loudest each cheek glows its proudest for norway the ancient the throne of the earthd dost thou know said he becoming more familiar in his address that a lawyer by the name of bjerregaard wrote this song and the storthing at christiania gave him a hundred specie dollars for it that was not too much was it no said i five hundred dollars would have been little enough for such a song yes yes that it would was his earnest assent and as i happened at that moment to ask whether we could see the peaks of the halling jцkeln he commenced a soetersong of life on the lofty fjeld a song of snow and free winds and blue sky by this time we had reached the other end of the lake where in the midst of a little valley of rich alluvial soil covered with patches of barley and potatoes stood the hamlet of sжbц here peder procured a horse for my friend and we entered the mouth of a sublime gorge which opened to the eastward a mere split in the mighty ramparts of the hardangerfjeld peder was continually shouting to the people in the fields look here these are americans these two and the other one is a german this one talks norsk and the others dont we ascended the defile by a rough footpath at first through alder thickets but afterwards over immense masses of rocky ruin which had tumbled from the crags far above and almost blocked up the valley for silence desolation and awful grandeur this defile equals any of the alpine passes in the spring when the rocks split by wedges of ice disengage themselves from the summit and thunder down upon the piled wrecks of ages it must be terribly sublime a bridge consisting of two logs spanned across abutments of loose stones and vibrating strongly under our tread took us over the torrent our road for some distance was now a mere staircase scrambling up down under over and between the chaos of sundered rocks a little further and the defile shut in altogether forming a cul de sac of apparently perpendicular walls from to feet high how are we to get out of this i asked peder yonder said he pointing to the inaccessible summit in front but where does the stream come from that you will soon see lo all at once a clean split from top to bottom disclosed itself in the wall on our left and in passing its mouth we had a glimpse up the monstrous chasm whose darkblue sides falling sheer feet vanished at the bottom in eternal gloom and spray crossing the stream again we commenced ascending over the dйbris of stony avalanches the path becoming steeper and steeper until the faroff summit almost hung over our heads it was now a zigzag ladder roughly thrown together but very firm the red mare which my friend rode climbed it like a cat never hesitating even at an angle of and never making a false step the performance of this noble animal was almost incredible i should never have believed a horse capable of such gymnastics had i not seen it with my own eyes had i not mounted her myself at the most difficult points in order to test her powers you who have climbed the mayenwand in going from the glacier of the rhone to the grimsel imagine a slant higher steeper and composed of loose rocks and you will have an exact picture of our ascent we climbed well and yet it took us just an hour and a half to reach the summit we were now on the great plateau of the hardanger fjeld feet above the sea a wild region lay before us great swells covered with heather sweeping into the distance and given up to solitude and silence a few isolated peaks streaked with snow rose from this upper level and a deep break on our left revealed the top of the chasm through which the torrent made its way at its extremity a mile or more distant rose a light cloud of vapour seeming close at hand in the thin mountain air the thick spongy soil not more than two feet deep rests on a solid bed of rock the entire hardanger fjeld in fact is but a single rock and is therefore always swampy whortleberries were abundant as well as the multeberry rubus chamoemorus which i have found growing in newfoundland and peder running off on the hunt of them was continually leading us astray but at last we approached the wreath of whirling spray and heard the hollow roar of the vцringfoss the great chasm yawned before us another step and we stood on the brink i seized the branch of a tough pine sapling as a support and leaned over my head did not swim the height was too great for that the impression too grand and wonderful the shelf of rock on which i stood projected far out over a gulf feet deep whose opposite side rose in one great escarpment from the bottom to a height of feet above my head on this black wall wet with eternal spray was painted a splendid rainbow forming two thirds of a circle before it melted into the gloom below a little stream fell in one long thread of silver from the very summit like a plumbline dropped to measure the feet on my right hand the river coming down from the level of the fjeld in a torn twisted and boiling mass reached the brink of the gulf at a point about feet below me whence it fell in a single sheet to the bottom a depth of between and feet could one view it from below this fall would present one of the grandest spectacles in the world in height volume of water and sublime surroundings it has no equal the spectator however looks down upon it from a great height above its brink whence it is so foreshortened that he can only guess its majesty and beauty by lying upon your belly and thrusting your head out beyond the roots of the pines you can safely peer into the dread abyss and watch through the vortex of whirling spray in its tortured womb the starry coruscations which radiate from the bottom of the fall like rockets of water incessantly exploding but this view sublime as it is only whets your desire to stand below and see the river with its sprayey crest shining against the sky make but one leap from heaven to hell some persons have succeeded by entering the chasm at its mouth in the valley below in getting far enough to see a portion of the fall the remainder being concealed by a projecting rock and the time will come no doubt when somebody will have energy enough to carry a path to its very foot i envy the travellers who will then visit the vцringfoss a short distance above the fall there are a few cabins inhabited by soeters or herdsmen whither we repaired to procure some fresh milk the house was rude and dirty but the people received us in a friendly manner the powerful housewife laid aside her hayrake and brought us milk which was actually sweet a rare thing in norway dirty but not rancid butter and tolerable cheese when my friend asked for water she dipped a pailful from a neighbouring stream thick with decayed moss and vegetable mould and handed it to him he was nice enough to pick out a rotten root before drinking which one of the children snatched up from the floor and ate yet these people did not appear to be in want they were healthy cheerful and contented and their filthy manner of living was the result of sheer indolence and slovenliness there was nothing to prevent them from being neat and comfortable even with their scanty means but the good gifts of god are always spoiled and wasted in dirty hands when we opened our bottle of wine an exquisite aroma diffused itself through the room a mingled smell of vine blossoms and ripe grapes how could the coarse vintage sent to the north watered and chemically doctored as it is produce such a miracle we tasted superb old chateau latour from the sunniest hill of bordeaux by whatever accident it had wandered thither it did not fall into unappreciative hands even brita halstendsdatter hцl the strong housewife smacked her lips over the glass which she drank after sitting to me for her portrait when the sketch was completed we filled the empty bottle with milk and set out on our return footnotes d lathams translation xxxi sketches from the bergenstift our return from the vцringfoss to the hamlet of sжbц was accomplished without accident or particular incident as we were crossing the eyfjordsvand the stillness of the savage glen yet more profound in the dusk of evening was broken by the sudden thunder of a slide in some valley to the eastward peder stopped in the midst of frie dig ved lifvet and listened ho said he the spring is the time when the rocks come down but that sounds like a big fellow too peder was not so lively on the way back not because he was fatigued for in showing us how they danced on the fjeld he flung himself into the air in a marvellous manner and turned over twice before coming down but partly because he had broken our bottle of milk and partly because there was something on his mind i waited patiently knowing that it would come out at last as indeed it did you see said he hesitatingly some travellers give a drinkmoney to the guide it isnt an obligation you know but then some give it now if you should choose to give me anything dont pay it to the landlord for me because then i wont get it you are not bound to do so you know but some travellers do it and i dont know but you might also now if you should give it directly to me and then i will have it when we reached vik we called peder aside and gave him three marks oh you must pay your bill to the landlord said he but that is your drinkmoney i explained that he exclaimed it is not possible frie dig ved lifvet c and so he sang cut a pigeonwing or two and proceeded to knot and double knot the money in a corner of his pockethandkerchief come and take a swim said peder reappearing i can swim ever since i fell into the water i tumbled off the pier you must know and down i went everything became black before my eyes and i thought to myself peder this is the end of you but i kicked and splashed nevertheless until my eyes opened again wide enough to see where a rope was well after i found i could fall into the water without drowning i was not afraid to swim in fact peder now swam very well and floundered about with great satisfaction in the ice cold water a single plunge was all i could endure after supper the landlady came in to talk to me about america she had a son in california and a daughter in wisconsin and showed me their daguerreotypes and some bits of gold with great pride she was a stout kindly motherly body and paid especial attention to our wants on finding where we came from indeed we were treated in the most friendly manner by these good people and had no reason to complain of our reckoning on leaving this experience confirms me in the belief that honesty and simplicity may still be characteristics of the norwegians in the more remote parts of the country we bade a cordial farewell to vik next morning and set off on our return in splendid sunshine peder was in the boat rejoiced to be with us again and we had no sooner gotten under way than he began singing frie dig ved lifvet it was an intensely hot day and the shores of ulvik were perfectly dazzling the turf had a silken gloss the trees stood darkly and richly green and the water was purest sapphire it is a beautiful bay is it not said the farmer who furnished us with horses after we had left the boat and were slowly climbing the fjeld i thought i had never seen a finer but when heaven and earth are in entire harmony when form colour and atmosphere accord like some rich swell of music whatever one sees is perfect hence i shall not say how beautiful the bay of ulvik was to me since under other aspects the description would not be true the farmers little daughter however who came along to take back one of the horses would have been a pleasant apparition at any time and in any season she wore her sunday dress consisting of a scarlet boddice over a white chemise green petticoat and white apron while her shining flaxen hair was plaited into one long braid with narrow strips of crimson and yellow cloth and then twisted like a garland around her head she was not more than twelve or thirteen years old but tall straight as a young pine and beautifully formed with the promise of early maidenhood in the gentle swell of her bosom her complexion was lovely pink brightened with sunburnt gold and her eyes like the blossoms of the forgetmenot in hue in watching her firm yet graceful tread as she easily kept pace with the horse i could not realise that in a few more years she would probably be no more graceful and beautiful than the women at work in the fields coarse clumsy shapes with frowzy hair leathery faces and enormous hanging breasts in the bergenstift however one sometimes sees a pretty face and the natural grace of the form is not always lost about vossevangen for instance the farmers daughters are often quite handsome but beauty either male or female is in norway the rarest apparition the grownup women especially after marriage are in general remarkably plain except among some of the native tribes of africa i have nowhere seen such overgrown loose pendant breasts as among them this is not the case in sweden where if there are few beauties there are at least a great many passable faces there are marked differences in the blood of the two nations and the greater variety of feature and complexion in norway seems to indicate a less complete fusion of the original stocks we were rowed across the graven lake by an old farmer who wore the costume of the last century a red coat а la frederic the great long waistcoat and white kneebreeches he demanded double the lawful fare which indeed was shamefully small and we paid him without demur at vasenden we found our carrioles and harness in good condition nothing having been abstracted except a ball of twine horses were in waiting apparently belonging to some welltodo farmer for the boys were well dressed and took especial care of them we reached the merchants comfortable residence at vossevangen before sunset and made amends on his sumptuous fare for the privations of the past three days we now resumed the main road between christiania and bergen the same cloudless days continued to dawn upon us for one summer norway had changed climates with spain our oilcloths were burnt up and cracked by the heat our clothes covered with dust and our faces became as brown as those of bedouins for a week we had not a cloud in the sky the superbly clear days belied the old saying of weatherbreeders our road on leaving vossevangen led through pineforests following the course of a stream up a wild valley enclosed by lofty mountains some lovely cataracts fell from the steep on our left but this is the land of cataracts and there is many a one not even distinguished by a name which would be renowned in switzerland i asked my postillion the name of the stream beside us oh said he it has none it is not big enough he wanted to take us all the way through to gudvangen twentyeight miles on our paying double fare predicting that we would be obliged to wait three hours for fresh horses at each intermediate station he waited some time at tvinde the first station in the hope that we would yield but departed suddenly in a rage on seeing that the horses were already coming at this place a stout young fellow who had evidently been asleep came out of the house and stood in the door staring at us with open mouth for a full hour the postmaster sat on the step and did likewise it was the height of harvesttime and the weather favourable almost to a miracle yet most of the harvesters lay upon their backs under the trees as we passed the women appeared to do most of the outdoor as well as the indoor work they are certainly far more industrious than the men who judging from what i saw of them are downright indolent evidences of slow patient plodding toil one sees truly but active industry thrift and honest ambition nowhere the scenery increased in wildness and roughness as we proceeded the summit of hvitnaset whitenose lifted its pinnacles of grey rock over the brow of the mountains on the north and in front pale bluegrey peaks feet high appeared on either hand the next station was a village of huts on the side of a hill everybody was in the fields except one woman who remained to take charge of the station she was a stupid creature but had a proper sense of her duty for she started at full speed to order horses and we afterwards found that she must have run full three english miles in the space of half an hour the emigration to america from this part of bergenstift has been very great and the people exhibited much curiosity to see and speak with us the scenery became at the same time more barren and more magnificent as we approached the last station stalheim which is a miserable little village at the head of the famous naerцdal our farmerpostillion wished to take us on to gudvangen with the same horses urging the same reasons as the former one it would have been better if we had accepted his proposal but our previous experience had made us mistrustful the man spoke truth however hour after hour passed away and the horses came not a few miserable people collected about us and begged money i sketched the oldest ugliest and dirtiest of them as a specimen but regretted it afterwards as his gratitude on receiving a trifle for sitting obliged me to give him my hand hereupon another old fellow not quite so hideous wanted to be taken also lars said a woman to the former are you not ashamed to have so ugly a face as yours go to america oh said he it does not look so ugly in the book his delight on getting the money created some amusement indeed he protested i am poor and want it and you need not laugh the last gush of sunset was brightening the tops of the savage fjeld when the horses arrived we had waited two hours and three quarters and i therefore wrote a complaint in the postbook in my best norsk from the top of a hill beyond the village we looked down into the naerцdal we stood on the brink of a tremendous wall about a thousand feet above the valley on one side the stream we had been following fell in a single cascade feet on the other a second stream issuing from some unseen defile flung its several ribbons of foam from nearly an equal height the valley or rather gorge disappeared in front between mountains of sheer rock which rose to the height of feet the road a splendid specimen of engineering was doubled back and forth around the edge of a spur projecting from the wall on which we stood and so descended to the bottom once below our carrioles rolled rapidly down the gorge which was already dusky with twilight the stream of the most exquisite translucent azuregreen colour rolled between us and the mountain crests towered so far above that our necks ached as we looked upwards i have seen but one valley which in depth and sublimity can equal the naerцdal the pass of the taurus in asia minor leading from cappadocia into cilicia in many places the precipices were feet in perpendicular height and the streams of the upper fjeld falling from the summits lost themselves in evanescent waterdust before they reached the bottom the bed of the valley was heaped with fragments of rock which are loosed from above with every returning spring it was quite dark before we reached gudvangen thoroughly tired and as hungry as wolves my postillion on hearing me complain pulled a piece of dry mutton out of his pocket and gave it to me he was very anxious to learn whether brandy and tobacco were as dear in america as in norway if so he did not wish to emigrate a stout girl had charge of braisteds horse the female postillions always fell to his lot she complained of hard work and poor pay and would emigrate if she had the money at gudvangen we had a boat journey of thirtyfive miles before us and therefore engaged two boats with eight oarsmen for the morrow the people tried hard to make us take more but we had more than the number actually required by law and as it turned out quite as many as were necessary travellers generally supply themselves with brandy for the use of their boatmen from an idea that they will be stubborn and dilatory without it we did so in no single instance yet our men were always steady and cheerful we shipped our carrioles and sent them off in the larger boat delaying our own departure until we had fortified ourselves with a good breakfast and laid in some hard bread and pork omelette for the day the gudvangen fjord down which we now glided over the glassy water is a narrow mountain avenue of glorious scenery the unseen plateaus of the blaa and graa fjelds on either hand spilled their streams over precipices from to feet in height above whose cornices shot the pointed summits of bare grey rock wreathed in shifting clouds feet above the sea pinetrees feathered the less abrupt steeps with patches of dazzling turf here and there and wherever a gentler slope could be found in the coves stood cottages surrounded by potatofields and ripe barley stacked on poles not a breath of air rippled the dark water which was a perfect mirror to the mountains and the strip of sky between them while broad sheets of morning sunshine streaming down the breaks in the line of precipices interrupted with patches of fiery colour the deep rich transparent gloom of the shadows it was an enchanted voyage until we reached the mouth of the aurlands fjord divided from that of gudvangen by a single rocky buttress feet high beyond this point the watery channel is much broader and the shores diminish in grandeur as they approach the sogne fjord of which this is but a lateral branch i was a little disappointed in the scenery of sogne fjord the mountains which enclose it are masses of sterile rock neither lofty nor bold enough in their forms to make impression after the unrivalled scenery through which we had passed the point of vangnжs a short distance to the westward is the framnжs of frithiofs saga and i therefore looked towards it with some interest for the sake of that hero and his northern lily ingeborg there are many bautastones still standing on the shore but one who is familiar with tegners poem must not expect to find his descriptions verified either in scenery or tradition on turning eastward around the point of fronningen we were surprised by the sudden appearance of two handsome houses with orchards and gardens on the sunny side of the bank the vegetation protected in some degree from the seawinds was wonderfully rich and luxuriant there were now occasional pinewoods on the southern shore but the general aspect of this fjord is bleak and desolate in the heat and breathless silence of noonday the water was like solid crystal a faint line as if drawn with a pencil along the bases of the opposite mountains divided them from the equally perfect and palpable mountains inverted below them in the shadows near us it was quite impossible to detect the boundary between the substance and its counterpart in the afternoon we passed the mouth of the northern arms of the fjord which strike into the heart of the wildest and grandest region of norway the valley of justedal with its tremendous glaciers the snowy teeth of the hurunger and the crowning peaks of the skagtolstind our course lay down the other arm to lжrdalsцren at the head of the fjord by five oclock it came in sight at the mouth of a valley opening through the barren flanks on the fille fjeld we landed after a voyage of ten hours and found welcome signs of civilisation in a neat but exorbitant inn our boatmen with the exception of stopping half an hour for breakfast had pulled steadily the whole time we had no cause to be dissatisfied with them while they were delighted with the moderate gratuity we gave them they were tough wellmade fellows possessing a considerable amount of endurance but less actual strength than one would suspect braisted who occasionally tried his hand at an oar could pull them around with the greatest ease english travellers whom i have met inform me that in almost every trial they find themselves stronger than the norwegians this is probably to be accounted for by their insufficient nourishment sour milk and oaten bread never yet fed an athlete the proportions of their bodies would admit of fine muscular development and if they cannot do what their viking ancestors once did it is because they no longer live upon the spoils of other lands as they chapter xxxii hallingdal the countrypeople of norway there are two roads from lжrdalsцren to christiania the eastern one passing through the districts of valders and hadeland by way of the little miцsen lake and the randsfjord while the western after crossing the fille fjeld descends the long hallingdal to ringerike in point of scenery there is little difference between them but as we intended visiting the province of tellemark in southern norway we chose the latter the valley of the fille fjeld which we entered on leaving lжrdalsцren is enclosed by wild barren mountains more isolated and irregular in their forms than the hardanger and dovre fjelds there were occasional precipices and dancing waterfalls but in general the same tameness and monotony we had found on the sogne fjord down the bed of the valley flowed a large rapid stream clear as crystal and of a beautiful beryl tint the cultivation was scanty and the potato fields utterly ruined by disease tainted the air with sickening effluvia the occasional forests on the hillsides were of fir and birch while poplar ash and linden grew in the valley the only fruittrees i saw were some sour red cherries but in the splendour of the day this unfriendly valley shone like a dell of the apennines not a cloud disturbed the serenity of the sky the brown grass and yellow moss on the mountains were painted with sunny gold and the gloss and sparkle of the foliage equalled that of the italian ilex and laurel on the second stage a new and superb road carried us through the rugged defile of saltenaaset this pass is evidently the effect of some mighty avalanche thousands of ages ago the valley is blocked up by tremendous masses of rock hurled one upon the other in the wildest confusion while the shattered peaks from which they fell still tower far above threading this chaos in the shadow of the rocks we looked across the glen upon a braided chain of foam twisted together at the end into a long white cascade which dropped into the gulf below in another place a rainbow meteor suddenly flashed across the face of a dark crag betraying the dusty spray of a fall else invisible on the third stage the road after mounting a difficult steep descended into the valley of borgund in which stands most probably the most ancient church in norway it is a singular fantastic structure bristling with spiky spires and covered with a scale armour of black pitched shingles it is certainly of no more recent date than the twelfth century and possibly of the close of the eleventh the architecture shows the byzantine style in the rounded choir and the arched galleries along the sides the gothic in the windows and pointed gables and the horned ornaments on the roof suggest the pagan temples of the antechristian period a more grotesque affair could hardly be found in christendom it could only be matched among the monstrosities of chinese art with the exception of the church of hitterdal in tellemark a building of similar date this is the best preserved of the few antiquities of norway the entire absence of feudal castles is a thing to be noticed serfdom never existed here and one result of this circumstance perhaps is the ease with which institutions of a purely republican stamp have been introduced our road still proceeded up the bottom of a rough barren valley crossing stony headlands on either side at the station of haug our course turned to the southeast climbing a slope leading to the plateau of the fille fjeld a severe pull for our horses in the intense heat the birch woods gradually diminished in size until they ceased altogether and the naked plain stretched before us in this upper land the air was delicious and inspiring we were more than feet above the sea but the summits to the right and left with their soft gleams of pale gray lilac and purple hues in the sunshine and pure blue in shadow rose to the height of the heat of the previous ten days had stripped them bare of snow and the landscape was drear and monotonous the summits of the norwegian fjelds have only the charm of wildness and bleakness i doubt whether any mountains of equal height exhibit less grandeur in their upper regions the most imposing features of norwegian scenery are its deep valleys its tremendous gorges with their cataracts flung like banners from steeps which seem to lean against the very sky and most of all its winding labyrinthine fjords valleys of the sea in which the phenomena of the valleys of the land are repeated i found no scenery in the bergenstift of so original and impressive a character as that of the lofoden isles the day was sunday and we of course expect to see some evidence of it in the appearance of the people yet during the whole day we found but one clean person the hostess of an inn on the summit of fille fjeld where we stopped to bait our horses she was a young freshfaced woman in the first year of her wifehood and her snowy chemise and tidy petticoat made her shine like a star among the dirty and frowzy creatures in the kitchen i should not forget a boy who was washing his face in a brook as we passed but he was young and didnt know any better otherwise the people lounged about the houses or sat on the rocks in the sun filthy and something else to judge from certain signs at haug forgetting that it was a fast station where there is no tilsigelse money for ordering horses to be paid i handed the usual sum to the landlady saying this is for tilsigelse it is quite right said she pocketing the coin skirting an azure lake we crossed the highest part of the pass nearly four thousand feet above the sea and descended a naked valley to the inn of bjцberg the landlord received us very cordially and as the inn promised tolerable accommodation he easily persuaded us to stop there for the night his wife wore a frightful costume which we afterwards found to prevail throughout all hemsedal and hallingdal it consisted simply of a band across the shoulders above the breasts passing around the arms and over the back of the neck with an immense baggy dangling skirt hanging therefrom to the ancles whether she was fat or lean straight or crooked symmetrical or deformed it was impossible to discern except when the wind blew the only thing to be said in favour of such a costume is that it does not impede the development and expansion of the body in any direction hence i would strongly recommend its adoption to the advocates of reform in feminine dress at home there is certainly none of that weight upon the hips of which they complain in the fashionable costume it is far more baggy loose and hideous than the bloomer with the additional advantage of making all ages and styles of beauty equally repulsive while on the score of health and convenience there is still less to be said against it do not stop at halfway measures oh fair reformers it seems incredible that in a pastoral country like norway it should be almost impossible to procure sweet milk and good butter the cattle are of good quality there is no better grass in the world and the only explanation of the fact is to be found in the general want of cleanliness especially among the inhabitants of the mountain districts which are devoted to pasturage alone knowing this one wonders the less to see no measures taken for a supply of water in the richer graingrowing valleys where it is so easily procurable at bjцberg for instance there was a stream of delicious water flowing down the hill close beside the inn and four bored pinetrunks would have brought it to the very door but instead of that the landlady whirled off to the stream in her revolving dress to wash the dishes or to bring us half a pint to wash ourselves we found water much more abundant the previous winter in swedish lapland leaving bjцberg betimes we drove rapidly down hemsedal enjoying the pure delicious airs of the upper fjeld the scenery was bleak and grey and even the soft pencil of the morning sun failed to impart any charm to it except the nameless fascination of utter solitude and silence the valley descends so gradually that we had driven two norsk miles before the firforests in its bed began to creep up the mountainsides during the second stage we passed the remarkable peak of saaten on the opposite side of the valley the end or cape of a long projecting ridge terminating in a scarped cliff from the very summit of which fell a cascade from three to four hundred feet in height where the water came from it was impossible to guess unless there were a large deposit of snow in the rear for the mountains fell away behind saaten and the jagged cleft headland rose alone above the valley it was a strange and fantastic feature of the landscape and to me a new form in the repertory of mountain aspects we now drove through firwoods balmy with warm resinous odours to ekre where we had ordered breakfast by fцrbud the morning air had given us a healthy appetite but our spirits sank when the only person at the station a stupid girl of twenty dressed in the same bulging hideous sack informed us that nothing was to be had after some persuasion she promised us coffee cheese and bread which came in due time but with the best will we found it impossible to eat anything the butter was rather black than yellow the cheese as detestable to the taste as to the smell the bread made apparently of sawdust with a slight mixture of oatbran and the coffee muddy dregs with some sour cream in a cup and sugarcandy which appeared to have been sucked and then dropped in the ashes the original colour of the girls hands was barely to be distinguished through their coating of dirt and all of us tough old travellers as we were sickened at the sight of her i verily believe that the poorer classes of the norwegians are the filthiest people in europe they are even worse than the lapps for their habits of life allow them to be clean after passing ekre our view opened down the valley over a wild stretch of wooded hills to the blue mountain folds of the hallingdal which crosses the hemsedal almost at right angles and receives its tributary waters the forms of the mountains are here more gradual and those grand sweeps and breaks which constitute the peculiar charms of the scenery of the bergenstift are met with no longer we had a hot ride to the next station where we were obliged to wait nearly an hour in the kitchen our fцrbud not having been forwarded from the former station as soon as the law allowed us to expect a strapping boy of eighteen acted as station master his trowsers reached considerably above his shoulder blades leaving barely room for a waistcoat six inches long to be buttoned over his collar bone the characteristic costumes of norway are more quaint and picturesque in the published illustrations than in the reality particularly those of hemsedal my postillion to this station was a communicative fellow and gave me some information about the value of labour a harvesthand gets from one mark twentyone cents to one and a half daily with food or two marks without most work is paid by the job a strong lumberman may make two and a half marks when the days are long at six skillings five cents a tree a plowman two marks in the winter the usual wages of labourers are two marks a week with board shoemakers tailors and other mechanics average about the same daily when one considers the scarcity of good food and the high price of all luxuries especially tobacco and brandy it does not seem strange that the emigration fever should be so prevalent the norwegians have two traits in common with a large class of americans rampant patriotism and love of gain but they cannot so easily satisfy the latter without sacrificing the former from the village of gцl with its dark pretty church we descended a steep of many hundred feet into hallingdal whose broad stream flashed blue in the sunshine far below us the mountains were now wooded to their very summits and over the less abrupt slopes ripe oats and barleyfields made yellow spots of harvest among the dark forests by this time we were out of smoking material and stopped at the house of a landhandlare or country merchant to procure a supply a riotous sound came from the door as we approached six or eight men all more or less drunk and one woman were inside singing jumping and howling like a pack of bedlamites we bought the whole stock of tobacco consisting of two cigars and hastened out of the den the last station of ten miles was down the beautiful hallingdal through a country which seemed rich by contrast with hemsedal and the barren fjeld our stoppingplace was the village of nжs which we reached in a famished condition having eaten nothing all day there were two landhandlare in the place with one of whom we lodged here we found a few signs of christianity such as gardens and decent dresses but both of the merchants shops swarmed with rumdrinkers i had written and sent off from bjцberg fцrbud tickets for every station as far as kongsberg by the legal regulations the skydsskaffer is obliged to send forward such tickets as soon as received the traveller paying the cost thereof on his arrival notwithstanding we had given our fцrbud twelve hours start and had punctually paid the expense at every station we overtook it at nжs the postmaster came to know whether we would have it sent on by special express or wait until some traveller bound the same way would take it for us i ordered it to be sent immediately astounded at such a question until making the acquaintance of a scotchman and his wife who had arrived in advance of us the mystery was solved they had spent the night at the first station beyond bjцberg where our fцrbud tickets were given to them with the request that they would deliver them they had punctually done so as far as nжs where the people had endeavoured to prevent them from stopping for the night insisting that they were bound to go on and carry the fцrbud the cool impudence of this transaction reached the sublime at every station that day pay had been taken for service unperformed and it was more than once demanded twice over we trusted the repeated assurance of the postmaster at nжs that our tickets had been forwarded at once and paid him accordingly but at the first station next morning we found that he had not done so and this interlinked chain of swindling lasted the whole day we were obliged to wait an hour or two at every post to pay for messengers who probably never went and then to resist a demand for payment at the other end of the station what redress was there we might indeed have written a complaint in imperfect norsk which would be read by an inspector a month afterwards or perhaps it would be crossed out as soon as we left as we saw done in several cases unless a traveller is very well versed in the language and in the laws relating to the skyds system he has no defence against imposition and even in such a case he can only obtain redress through delay the system can only work equitably when the people are honest and perhaps they were so when it was first adopted here i must tell an unpleasant truth there must have been some foundation in the beginning for the wide reputation which the norwegians have for honest simplicity of character but the accounts given by former travellers are undeserved praise if applied at present the people are trading on fictitious capital should i have a written contract i asked of a landlord in relation to a man with whom i was making a bargain oh no said he everybody is honest in norway and the same man tried his best to cheat me said braisted i once heard an old sailor say when a man has a reputation for honesty watch him and there is some knowledge of human nature in the remark norway was a fresh field when laing went thither opportunities for imposition were so rare that the faculty had not been developed he found the people honest and later travellers have been content with echoing his opinion when i first came to the country said an irish gentleman who for ten years past has spent his summers there i was advised as i did not understand the currency to offer a handful in payment and let the people take what was due to them would you do it now i asked no indeed said he and the man who then advised me a norwegian merchant now says he would not do it either an english salmonfisher told me very much the same thing i believe they are honest in their intercourse with each other said he but they do not scruple to take advantage of travellers whenever they can for my own part i must say that in no country of europe except italy have i experienced so many attempts at imposition another englishman who has been farming in norway for several years and who employs about forty labourers has been obliged to procure swedes on account of the peculations of native hands i came to norway with the popular impression concerning the people and would not confess myself so disagreeably undeceived could i suppose that my own experiences were exceptional i found however that they tallied with those of other travellers and the conclusion is too flagrant to be concealed as a general rule i have found the people honest in proportion as they are stupid they are quickwitted whenever the spirit of gain is aroused and the ease with which they pick up little arts of acquisitiveness does not suggest an integrity proof against temptation it is but a negative virtue rather than that stable quality rooted in the very core of a mans nature i may perhaps judge a little harshly but when one finds the love of gain so strongly developed so keen and grasping in combination with the four capital vices of the norwegians indolence filth drunkenness and licentiousness the descent to such dishonest arts as i have described is scarcely a single step there are no doubt many districts where the people are still untempted by rich tourists and sportsmen and retain the virtues once ascribed to the whole population but that there has been a general and rapid deterioration of character cannot be denied the statistics of morality for instance show that one child out of every ten is illegitimate and the ratio has been steadily increasing for the past fifty years would that the more intelligent classes would seriously set themselves to work for the good of gamle norge instead of being content with the poetical flourish of her name the following day from nжs to green was a continuation of our journey down the hallingdal there was little change in the scenery high firwooded mountains on either hand the lower slopes spotted with farms the houses showed some slight improvement as we advanced the people were all at work in the fields cutting the years satisfactory harvest a scorching sun blazed in a cloudless sky the earth was baked and dry and suffocating clouds of dust rose from under our horses hoofs most of the women in the fields on account of the heat had pulled off their bodysacks and were working in shifts made on the same principle which reached to the knees other garments they had none a few recognising us as strangers hastily threw on their sacks or got behind a barleystack until we had passed the others were quite unconcerned one whose garment was exceedingly short no sooner saw us than she commenced a fjeld dance full of astonishing leaps and whirls to the great diversion of the other hands weel done cutty sark i cried but the quotation was thrown away upon her green on the krцder lake which we did not reach until long after dark was an oasis after our previous experience such clean refined friendly people such a neat table such excellent fare and such delicious beds we had certainly never seen before blessed be decency blessed be humanity was our fervent ejaculation and when in the morning we paid an honest reckoning and received a hearty lycksame resa a lucky journey at parting we vowed that the place should always be green in our memories thence to kongsberg we had fast stations and civilised people the country was open well settled and cultivated the scenery pleasant and picturesque and except the insufferable heat and dust we could complain of nothing chapter xxxiii tellemark and the riukan foss kongsberg where we arrived on the th of august is celebrated for its extensive silver mines which were first opened by christian iv in and are now worked by the government they are doubtless interesting to mineralogists but we did not visit them the guidebook says the principal entrance to the mines is through a level nearly two english miles in length from this level you descend by thirtyeight perpendicular ladders of the average length of five fathoms each a very fatiguing task and then find yourself at the bottom of the shaft and are rewarded by the sight of the veins of native silver not a bit of which after all are you allowed to put into your pocket thank you i prefer remaining above ground and was content with having in my possession smelted specimens of the ore stamped with the head of oscar i the goal of our journey was the riukan foss which lies in upper tellemark on the southeastern edge of the great plateau of the hardanger fjeld this cascade disputes with the vцring foss the supremacy of the thousand waterfalls of norway there are several ways from kongsberg thither and in our ignorance of the country we suffered ourselves to be guided by the landlord of our hotel let no traveller follow our example the road he recommended was almost impassable for carrioles and miserably supplied with horses while that through hitterdal by which we returned is broad smooth and excellent we left on the morning after our arrival taking a road which led up the valley of the lauven for some distance and then struck westward through the hills to a little station called moen here as the place was rarely visited by travellers the people were simple honest and friendly horses could not be had in less than two hours and my postillion an intelligent fellow far gone in consumption proposed taking the same horse to the next station fifteen miles further he accepted my offer of increased pay but another who appeared to be the owner of the horses refused demanding more than double the usual rates how is it said i that you were willing to bring us to moen for one and a half marks and will not take us to bolkesjц for less than five it was my turn he answered to furnish posthorses i am bound by law to bring you here at the price fixed by the law but now i can make my own bargain and i want a price that will leave me some profit this was reasonable enough and we finally agreed to retain two of the horses taking the postmasters for a third the region we now traversed was almost a wilderness there were grazingfarms in the valley with a few fields of oats or barley but these soon ceased and an interminable forest enclosed us the road terribly rough and stony crossed spurs of the hills slowly climbing to a wild summitlevel whence we caught glimpses of lakes far below us and the blue mountainranges in the west with the pyramidal peak of the gousta fjeld crowning them bolkesjц which we reached in a little more than two hours is a small hamlet on the western slope of the mountain overlooking a wide tract of lake and forest most of the inhabitants were away in the harvestfields but the skydsshaffer a tall powerful fellow with a grin of ineffable stupidity on his face came forward as we pulled in our horses on the turfy square between the rows of magazines can we get horses at once neeey was his drawling answer accompanied with a still broader grin as if the thing were a good joke how soon in three hours but if we pay fast prices he hesitated scratched his head and drawled in a liten stund a short time which may mean any time from five minutes to as many hours can we get fresh milk neeey can we get butter neeey what can we get nothing fortunately we had foreseen this emergency and had brought a meal with us from kongsberg we took possession of the kitchen a spacious and tolerably clean apartment with ponderous benches against two sides of it and two bedsteads as huge and ugly as those of kings built along the third enormous platters of pewter earthen and stone ware were ranged on shelves while a cupboard fantastically painted contained the smaller crockery there was a heavy red and green cornice above the bed upon which the names of the host and his wife with the date of their marriage were painted in yellow letters the worthy couple lay so high that several steps were necessary to enable them to reach the bed in which process their eyes encountered words of admonition painted upon triangular boards introduced to strengthen the pillars at the head and foot one of these inscriptions ran this is my bed here i take my rest in the night and when morning comes i get up cheerfully and go to work and the other when thou liest down to sleep think on thy last hour pray that god will guard thy sleep and be ready for thy last hour when it comes on the bottom of the cupboard was a representation of two individuals with chalkwhite faces and inky eyes smoking their pipes and clinking glasses the same fondness for decorations and inscriptions is seen in all the houses in tellemark and a great part of hallingdal some of them are thoroughly chinese in gaudy colour and grotesque design in the course of an hour and a half we obtained three strong and spirited stallions and continued our journey towards the tindsц during this stage of twelve or thirteen miles the quality of our carrioles was tested in the most satisfactory manner uphill and down over stock and stone jolted on rock and wrenched in gulley they were whirled at a smashing rate but the tough ash and firmlywelded iron resisted every shock for any other than norwegian horses and vehicles it would have been hazardous travelling we were anxious to retain the same animals for the remaining stage to tinoset at the foot of the lake but the postillions refused and a further delay of two hours was the consequence it was dark when the new horses came and ten miles of forest lay before us we were ferried one by one across the tind elv on a weak loose raft and got our carrioles up a frightful bank on the opposite side by miraculous luck fortunately we struck the postroad from hitterdal at this place for it would have been impossible to ride over such rocky byways as we had left behind us a white streak was all that was visible in the gloom of the forest we kept in the middle of it not knowing whether the road went up down or on a level until we had gone over it at last however the forest came to an end and we saw tind lake lying still and black in the starlight all were in bed at tinoset but we went into the common sleepingroom and stirred the people up promiscuously until we found the housewife who gave us the only supper the house afforded hard oaten bread and milk we three then made the most of two small beds in the morning we took a boat with four oarsmen for mael at the mouth of the westfjorddal in which lies the riukan foss there was no end to our wonderful weather in rainy norway the sky had for once forgotten its clouds one after another dawned the bright egyptian days followed by nights soft starry and dewless the wooded shores of the long tind lake were illuminated with perfect sunshine and its mirror of translucent beryl broke into light waves under the northern breeze yet with every advantage of sun and air i found this lake undeserving of its reputation for picturesque beauty the highest peaks rise to the height of feet but there is nothing bold and decided in their forms and after the splendid fjords of the western coast the scenery appears tame and commonplace our boatmen pulled well and by noon brought us to hakenaes a distance of twentyone miles here we stopped to engage horses to the riukan foss as there is no poststation at mael while the old man put off in his boat to notify the farmers whose turn it was to supply the animals we entered the farmhouse a substantial twostory building the rooms were tolerably clean and well stocked with the clumsy heavy furniture of the country which is mostly made by the farmers themselves every man being his own carpenter cooper and blacksmith there were some odd old stools made of segments of the trunk of a tree the upper part hollowed out so as to receive the body and form a support for the back i have no doubt that this fashion of seat is as old as the time of the vikings the owner was evidently a man in tolerable circumstances and we therefore cherished the hope of getting a good meal but all that the old woman with the best will in the world was able to furnish was milk butter oaten bread and an egg apiece the upper rooms were all supplied with beds one of which displayed remarkable portraits of the crown prince of denmark and his spouse upon the headboard in another room was a loom of primitive construction it was nearly two hours before the old farmer returned with the information that the horses would be at mael as soon as we but we lay upon the bank for some time after arriving there watching the postillions swim them across the mouth of the maan elv leaving the boat which was to await our return the next day we set off up the westfjorddal towards the broad conelike mass of the goustafjeld whose huge bulk feet in height loomed grandly over the valley the houses of mael clustered about its little church were scattered over the slope above the lake and across the river amid the fields of grass and grain stood another village of equal size the bed of the valley dotted with farms and groups of farmhouses appeared to be thickly populated but as a farmers residence rarely consists of less than six buildings sometimes even eight a stranger would naturally overrate the number of inhabitants the production of grain also is much less than would be supposed from the amount of land under cultivation owing to the heads being so light the valley of the maan apparently a rich and populous region is in reality rather the reverse in relation to its beauty however there can be no two opinions deeply sunken between the gousta and another bold spur of the hardanger its golden harvestfields and groves of birch ash and pine seem doubly charming from the contrast of the savage steeps overhanging them at first scantily feathered with firtrees and scarred with the tracks of cataracts and slides then streaked only with patches of grey moss and at last bleak and sublimely bare the deeplychannelled cone of the gousta with its indented summit rose far above us sharp and clear in the thin ether but its base wrapped in forests and wet by many a waterfall sank into the bed of blue vapour which filled the valley there was no arabian nor even byzantine blood in our horses and our attendants a stout fullgrown farmer and a boy of sixteen easily kept pace with their slow rough trot in order to reach tinoset the next day we had determined to push on to the riukan foss the same evening our quarters for the night were to be in the house of the old farmer ole torgensen in the village of dдl halfway between mael and the cataract which we did not reach until five oclock when the sun was already resting his chin on the shoulder of the gousta on a turfy slope surrounded with groves above the pretty little church of dдl we found oles gaard there was no one at home except the daughter a blooming lass of twenty whose neat dress and graceful friendly deportment after the hideous feminines of hallingdal in their ungirdled sacks and shifts so charmed us that if we had been younger more sentimental and less experienced in such matters i should not answer for the consequences she ushered us into the guests room which was neatness itself set before us a bottle of bavarian beer and promised to have a supper ready on our return there were still ten miles to the riukan and consequently no time to be lost the valley contracted squeezing the maan between the interlocking bases of the mountains through which in the course of uncounted centuries it had worn itself a deep groove cut straight and clean into the heart of the rock the loud perpetual roar of the vexed waters filled the glen the only sound except the bleating of goats clinging to the steep pastures above us the mountain walls on either hand were now so high and precipitous that the bed of the valley lay wholly in shadow and on looking back its further foldings were dimly seen through purple mist only the peak of the gousta which from this point appeared an entire and perfect pyramid feet in perpendicular height above the mountain platform from which it rose gleamed with a rich bronze lustre in the setting sun the valley was now a mere ascending gorge along the sides of which our road climbed before us extended a slanting shelf thrust out from the mountain and affording room for a few cottages and fields but all else was naked rock and ragged pine from one of the huts we passed a crippled distorted form crawled out on its hands and knees to beg of us it was a boy of sixteen struck with another and scarcely less frightful form of leprosy in this case instead of hideous swellings and fungous excrescences the limbs gradually dry up and drop off piecemeal at the joints well may the victims of both these forms of hopeless disease curse the hour in which they were begotten i know of no more awful example of that visitation of the sins of the parents upon the children which almost always attends confirmed drunkenness filth and licentiousness when we reached the little hamlet on the shelf of the mountain the last rays of the sun were playing on the summits above we had mounted about feet since leaving the tind lake and the dusky valley yawned far beneath us its termination invisible as if leading downward into a lower world many hundreds of feet below the edge of the wild little platform on which we stood thundered the maan in a cleft the bottom of which the sun has never beheld beyond this the path was impracticable for horses we walked climbed or scrambled along the side of the dizzy steep where in many places a false step would have sent us to the brink of gulfs whose mysteries we had no desire to explore after we had advanced nearly two miles in this manner ascending rapidly all the time a hollow reverberation and a glimpse of profounder abysses ahead revealed the neighbourhood of the riukan all at once patches of lurid gloom appeared through the openings of the birch thicket we were threading and we came abruptly upon the brink of the great chasm into which the river falls the riukan lay before us a miracle of sprayey splendour an apparition of unearthly loveliness set in a framework of darkness and terror befitting the jaws of hell before us so high against the sky as to shut out the colours of sunset rose the top of the valley the level of the hardanger table land on which a short distance further lies the miцsvand a lovely lake in which the maan elv is born the river first comes into sight a mass of boiling foam shooting around the corner of a line of black cliffs which are rent for its passage curves to the right as it descends and then drops in a single fall of feet in a hollow caldron of bare black rock the water is already foam as it leaps from the summit and the successive waves as they are whirled into the air and feel the gusts which for ever revolve around the abyss drop into beaded fringes in falling and go fluttering down like scarfs of the richest lace it is not water but the spirit of water the bottom is lost in a shifting snowy film with starry rays of foam radiating from its heart below which as the clouds shifts break momentary gleams of perfect emerald light what fairy bowers of some northern undine are suggested in those sudden flashes of silver and green in that dim profound which human eye can but partially explore in which human foot shall never be set what secret wonders may still lie hidden and around this vision of perfect loveliness rise the awful walls wet with spray which never dries and crossed by ledges of dazzling turf from the gulf so far below our feet until still further above our heads they lift their irregular cornices against the sky i do not think i am extravagant when i say that the riukan foss is the most beautiful cataract in the world i looked upon it with that involuntary suspension of the breath and quickening of the pulse which is the surest recognition of beauty the whole scene with its breadth and grandeur of form and its superb gloom of colouring enshrining this one glorious flash of grace and brightness and loveliness is indelibly impressed upon my mind not alone during that half hour of fading sunset but day after day and night after night the embroidered spray wreaths of the riukan were falling before me we turned away reluctantly at last when the emerald pavement of undines palace was no longer visible through the shooting meteors of silver foam the depths of westfjorddal were filled with purple darkness only the perfect pyramid of the gousta lifted upon a mountain basement more than feet in height shone like a colossal wedge of fire against the violet sky by the time we reached our horses we discovered that we were hungry and leaving the attendants to follow at their leisure we urged the tired animals down the rocky road the smell of freshcut grain and sweet mountain hay filled the cool evening air darkness crept under the birches and pines and we no longer met the homegoing harvesters between nine and ten our horses took the way to a gaard standing a little off the road but it did not appear to be ole torgensens so we kept on in the darkness however we began to doubt our memory and finally turned back again this time there could be no mistake it was not ole torgensens i knocked at various doors and hallooed loudly until a sleepy farmer made his appearance and started us forward again he kindly offered to accompany us but we did not think it necessary terribly fatigued and hungry we at last saw a star of promise the light of oles kitchen window there was a white cloth on the table in the guests house and oles charming daughter the rose of westfjorddalen did not keep us long waiting roast mutton tender as her own heart potatoes plump as her cheeks and beer sparkling as her eyes graced the board but emptiness void as our own celibate lives was there when we arose in the upper room there were beds with linen fresh as youth and aromatic as spring and the peace of a full stomach and a clear conscience descended upon our sleep in the morning we prepared for an early return to mael as the boatmen were anxious to get back to their barleyfields i found but one expression in the guests book that of satisfaction with ole torgensen and cheerfully added our amen to the previous declarations oles bill proved his honesty no less than his worthy face he brightened up on learning that we were americans why said he there have only been two americans here before in all my life and you cannot be a born american because you speak norsk so well oh said i i have learned the language in travelling is it possible he exclaimed then you must have a powerful intellect by no means said i it is a very easy thing i have travelled much and can speak six other languages now god help us cried he seven languages it is truly wonderful how much comprehension god has given unto man that he can keep seven languages in his head at one time here am i and i am not a fool yet i do not see how it would be possible for me to speak anything but norsk and when i think of you it shows me what wonders god has done will you not make a mark under your name in the book so that i may distinguish you from the other two i cheerfully complied and hereby notify future visitors why my name is italicised in oles book we bade farewell to the good old man and rode down the valley of the maan through the morning shadow of the gousta our boat was in readiness and its couch of fir boughs in the stern became a pleasant divan of indolence after our hard horses and rough roads we reached tinoset by one oclock but were obliged to wait until four for horses the only refreshment we could obtain was oaten bread and weak spruce beer off at last we took the postroad to hitterdal a smooth excellent highway through interminable forests of fir and pine towards the close of the stage glimpses of a broad beautiful and thicklysettled valley glimmered through the woods and we found ourselves on the edge of a tremendous gully apparently the bed of an extinct river the banks on both sides were composed entirely of gravel and huge rounded pebbles masses of which we loosened at the top and sent down the sides gathering as they rolled until in a cloud of dust they crashed with a sound like thunder upon the loose shingles of the bottom feet below it was scarcely possible to account for this phenomenon by the action of spring torrents from the melted snow the immense banks of gravel which we found to extend for a considerable distance along the northern side of the valley seemed rather to be the deposit of an oceanflood hitterdal with its enclosed fields its harvests and groups of picturesque substantial farmhouses gave us promise of good quarters for the night and when our postillions stopped at the door of a prosperouslooking establishment we congratulated ourselves on our luck but never whistle until you are out of the woods the people seemed decidedly not to like the idea of our remaining but promised to give us supper and beds they were stupid but not unfriendly and our causes of dissatisfaction were first that they were so outrageously filthy and secondly that they lived so miserably when their means evidently allowed them to do better the family room with its two cumbrous bedsteads built against the wall and indescribably dirty beds was given up to us the family betaking themselves to the stable as they issued thence in the morning in single garments we were involuntary observers of their degree of bodily neatness and the impression was one we would willingly forget yet a great painted desk in the room contained amid many flourishes the names and character of the host and hostess as follows andres svennogsen bamble and ragnil thorkilsdatter bamble which these two are respectable people over the cupboard studded with earthenware dishes was an inscription in misspelt latin solli deo glorria our supper consisted of boiled potatoes and fried salt pork which having seen the respectable hosts it required considerable courage to eat although we had not seen the cooking fleas darkened the floor and they with the fear of something worse prevented us from sleeping much we did not ask for coffee in the morning but as soon as we could procure horses drove away hungry and disgusted from bamblekaasa and its respectable inhabitants the church of hitterdal larger than that of borgund dates from about the same period probably the twelfth century its style is similar although it has not the same horned ornaments upon the roof and the byzantine features being simpler produce a more harmonious effect it is a charmingly quaint and picturesque building and the people of the valley are justly proud of it the interior has been renovated not in the best style well to make this very long chapter short we passed the beautiful falls of the tind elv drove for more than twenty miles over wild piny hills and then descended to kongsberg where fru hansen comforted us with a good dinner the next day we breakfasted in drammen and in baking heat and stifling dust traversed the civilised country between that city and christiania our norwegian travel was now at an end and as a snobby englishman once said to me of the nile it is a good thing to have gotten over chapter xxxiv norway and sweden we spent four days in christiania after completing our norwegian travels the sky was still perfectly clear and up to the day of our departure no rain fell out of sixty days which we had devoted to norway only four were rainy a degree of good fortune which rarely falls to the lot of travellers in the north christiania from its proximity to the continent and its character as capital of the country is sufficiently advanced in the arts of living to be a pleasant restingplace after the dйsagrйmens and privations of travel in the interior it has two or three tolerably good and very exorbitant hotels and some bankers with less than the usual amount of conscience one of them offered to change some prussian thalers for my friend at only ten per cent less than their current value the vognmand from whom we purchased our carrioles endeavoured to evade his bargain and protested that he had not money enough to repurchase them i insisted however and with such good effect that he finally pulled a roll of notes amounting to several hundred dollars out of his pocket and paid me the amount in full the english travellers whom i met had not fared any better and one and all of us were obliged to recede from our preconceived ideas of norwegian character but enough of an unpleasant theme i would rather praise than blame any day but i can neither praise nor be silent when censure is a part of the truth i had a long conversation with a distinguished norwegian on the condition of the country people he differed with me in the opinion that the clergy were to some extent responsible for their filthy and licentious habits asserting that though the latter were petits seigneurs with considerable privileges and powers the people were jealously suspicious of any attempt to exert an influence upon their lives but is not this a natural result of the preaching of doctrinal religion of giving an undue value to external forms and ceremonies we have a stubborn people said my informant their excessive selfesteem makes them difficult to manage besides their morals are perhaps better than would be inferred from the statistics old habits have been retained in many districts which are certainly reprehensible but which spring from custom rather than depravity i wish they were less vain and sensitive since in that case they would improve more rapidly he stated also that the surprising number of illegitimate births is partly accounted for by the fact that there are a great number of connections which have all the character of marriage except the actual ceremony this is an affair of considerable cost and show and many of the poorer people unable to afford it live together rather than wait hoping that a time may come when they will be able to defray the expenses and legitimate the children who may meanwhile be born in some cases the parties disagree the connection is broken off and each one seeks a new mate whatever palliation there may be in particular instances the moral effect of this custom is unquestionably bad and the volume of statistics recently published by herr sundt who was appointed by the storthing to investigate the subject shows that there is no agricultural population in the world which stands lower in the scale of chastity than that of norway in the course of our conversation the gentleman gave an amusing instance of the very sensitiveness which he condemned i happened casually to speak of the icelandic language the icelandic language he exclaimed so you also in america call it icelandic but you ought to know that it is norwegian it is the same language spoken by the norwegian vikings who colonised iceland the old norsk which originated here and was merely carried thither we certainly have some reason i replied seeing that it now only exists in iceland and has not been spoken in norway for centuries but let me ask why you speaking danish call your language norsk our language as written and printed is certainly pure danish said he but there is some difference of accent in speaking it he did not add that this difference is strenuously preserved and even increased by the norwegians that they may not be suspected of speaking danish while they resist with equal zeal any approach to the swedish often in thoughtlessly speaking of the language as danish i have heard the illhumoured reply our language is not danish but norsk as well might we say at home we speak american not english i had the good fortune to find professor munck the historian of norway at home though on the eve of leaving for italy he is one of the few distinguished literary names the country has produced holberg the comedian was born in bergen but he is generally classed among the danish authors in art however norway takes no mean rank the names of her painters dahl gude and tidemand having a european reputation professor munck is about fifty years of age and a fine specimen of the viking stock he speaks english fluently and i regretted that the shortness of my stay did not allow me to make further drafts on his surplus intelligence in the museum of northern antiquities which is small as compared with that of copenhagen but admirably arranged i made the acquaintance of professor keyser the author of a very interesting work on the religion of northmen a translation of which by mr barclay pennock appeared in new york some three years ago i was indebted to professor munck for a sight of the storthing or national legislative assembly which was then in session the large hall of the university a semicircular room something like our senate chamber has been given up to its use until an appropriate building shall be erected the appearance and conduct of the body strikingly reminded me of one of our state legislatures the members were plain practicallooking men chosen from all classes and without any distinguishing mark of dress the speaker was quite a young man with a moustache schweigaard the first jurist in norway was speaking as we entered the hall is very badly constructed for sound and i could not understand the drift of his speech but was exceedingly struck by the dryness of his manner the norwegian constitution has been in operation fortythree years and its provisions in most respects so just and liberal have been most thoroughly and satisfactorily tested the swedes and a small conservative party in norway would willingly see the powers of the storthing curtailed a little but the people now know what they have got and are further than ever from yielding any part of it in the house of almost every norwegian farmer one sees the constitution with the facsimile autographs of its signers framed and conspicuously hung up the reproach has been made that it is not an original instrument that it is merely a translation of the spanish constitution of a copy of the french constitution of c but it is none the worse for that its framers at least had the wisdom to produce the right thing at the right time and by their resolution and determined attitude to change a subject province into a free and independent state for carefully guarded as it is the union with sweden is only a source of strength and security one peculiarity of the storthing is that a majority of its members are and necessarily must be farmers whence norway is sometimes nicknamed the farmer state naturally they take very good care of their own interests one of their first steps being to abolish all taxes on landed property but in other respects i cannot learn that their rule is not as equitable as that of most legislative bodies mьgge in his recently published nordisches bilderbuch northern picture book gives an account of a conversation which he had with a swedish statesman on this subject the latter was complaining of the stubbornness and ignorance of the norwegian farmers mьgge asked the remainder of the dialogue is too good to be omitted the storthing then consists of a majority of coarse and ignorant people statesman i will not assert that a certain practical understanding cannot be denied to most of these farmers and they often bestow on their sons a good education before giving them the charge of the paternal fields one therefore finds in the country many accomplished men how could there be students in christiania if there were not many farmers sons among them author but does this majority of farmers in the storthing commit absurdities does it govern the country badly burden it with debts or enact unjust laws statesman that cannot exactly be admitted although this majority naturally gives its own interests the preference and shapes the government accordingly the state has no debts on the contrary its treasury is full an abundance of silver its banknotes in demand order everywhere and as you see an increase of prosperity with a flourishing commerce here lies a statement before me according to which in the last six months alone more than a hundred vessels have been launched in different ports author the farmerlegislature then as i remark takes care of itself but is niggardly and avaricious when its own interests are not concerned statesman it is a peculiar state of affairs in very many respects this reproach cannot be made against the farmers if anything is to be done for science or for socalled utilitarian objects they are always ready to give money if a deserving man is to be assisted if means are wanted for beneficial purposes insane asylums hospitals schools and such like institutions the council of state is always sure that it will encounter no opposition on other occasions however these lords of the land are as hard and tough as norwegian pines and button up their pockets so tight that not a dollar drops out author on what occasions statesman why you see shrugging his shoulders those farmers have not the least comprehension of statesmanship as soon as there is any talk of appropriations for increasing the army or the number of officers or the pay of foreign ministers or the salaries of high official persons or anything of that sort you cant do anything with them author to himself god keep them a long time without a comprehension of statesmanship if i were a member of the storthing i would have as thick a head as the rest of them on the th of september braisted and i took passage for gottenburg my friend having already gone home by way of kiel we had a smooth sea and an agreeable voyage and awoke the next morning in sweden on the day after our arrival a fire broke out in the suburb of haga which consumed thirteen large houses and turned more than two hundred poor people out of doors this gave me an opportunity to see how fires are managed here it was full half an hour after the alarmbell was rung before the first engine began to play the water had to be hauled from the canal and the machine of a very small and antiquated pattern contributed little towards stopping the progress of the flames the intervention of a row of gardens alone saved the whole suburb from destruction there must have been from six to eight thousand spectators present scattered all over the rocky knolls which surround gottenburg the fields were covered with piles of household furniture and clothing yet no guard seemed to be necessary for their protection and the owners showed no concern for their security there is a degree of confidence exhibited towards strangers in sweden especially in hotels at poststations and on board the inland steamers which tells well for the general honesty of the people we went on board the steamer werner on the morning of the th but first paid our passage two days afterwards just before reaching carlstad an account book hangs up in the cabin in which each passenger enters the number of meals or other refreshments he has had makes his own bill and hands over the amount to the stewardess in posting the skjutsbonder very often do not know the rates and take implicitly what the traveller gives them i have yet to experience the first attempt at imposition in sweden the only instances i heard of were related to me by swedes themselves a large class of whom make a point of depreciating their own country and character this habit of detraction is carried to quite as great an extreme as the vanity of the norwegians and is the less pardonable vice of the two it was a pleasant thing to hear again the musical swedish tongue and to exchange the indifference and reserve of norway for the friendly genial courteous manner of sweden what i have said about the formality and affectation of manners and the rigidity of social etiquette in the chapters relating to stockholm was meant to apply especially to the capital far be it from me to censure that natural and spontaneous courtesy which is a characteristic of the whole people the more i see of the swedes the more i am convinced that there is no kinder simpler and honester people in the world with a liberal common school system a fairer representation and release from the burden of a state church they would develop rapidly and nobly our voyage from gottenburg to carlstad on the wener lake had but one noteworthy point the falls of trollhдtten even had i not been fresh from the riukanfoss which was still flashing in my memory i should have been disappointed in this renowned cataract it is not a single fall but four successive descents within the distance of half a mile none of them being over twenty feet in perpendicular height the toppц fall is the only one which at all impressed me and that principally through its remarkable form the huge mass of the gotha river squeezed between two rocks slides down a plane with an inclination of about strikes a projecting rock at the bottom and takes an upward curve flinging tremendous volumes of spray or rather broken water into the air the bright emerald face of the watery plane is covered with a network of silver threads of shifting spray and gleams of pale blue and purple light play among the shadows of the rising globes of foam below chapter xxxv a tramp through wermeland and dalecarlia on leaving carlstad our route lay northward up the valley of the klar elv in the province of wermeland and thence over the hills by way of westerdal in dalecarlia to the head of the siljan lake the greater part of this region is almost unknown to travellers and belongs to the poorest and wildest parts of sweden we made choice of it for this reason that we might become acquainted with the people in their true character and compare them with the same class in norway our heavy luggage had all been sent on to stockholm in the charge of an irish friend and we retained no more than could be carried easily in two packs as we anticipated being obliged to perform part of the journey on foot it rained in torrents during the day we spent in carlstad and some lumber merchants of gottenburg who were on their way to fryxendal to superintend the getting down of their rafts predicted that the deluge would last an entire month there was always a month of rainy weather at this season they said and we had better give up our proposed journey we trusted to our combined good luck however and were not deceived for with the exception of two days we had charming weather during the remainder of our stay in sweden having engaged a twohorse cart for the first poststation we left carlstad on the morning of the th of september the clouds were still heavy but gradually rolled into compacter masses giving promise of breaking away the city is built upon a little island at the head of the lake whence we crossed to the mainland by a strong old bridge our road led eastward through a slightly undulating country where broad woods of fir and birch divided the large well cultivated farms the gеrds or mansions which we passed with their gardens and ornamental shrubbery gave evidence of comfort and competence the people were in the harvestfields cutting oats which they piled upon stakes to dry every one we met saluted us courteously with a cheerful and friendly air which was all the more agreeable by contrast with the norwegian reserve at the station prestegеrd we procured a good breakfast of ham eggs and potatoes and engaged two carts to take us further we now turned northward over a lovely rolling country watered with frequent streams a land of soft outlines of woods and swelling knolls to which the stately old houses gave an expression of contentment and household happiness at deye we left our carts shouldered our packs and trudged off on foot up the valley of the klar elv which is here a broad lazy stream filled with tens of thousands of pinelogs waiting to be carried down to the wener by the first freshet the scenery charmed us by its rich and quiet beauty it was without grand or striking features but gently undulating peaceful and homelike we found walking very fatiguing in the hot sun which blazed upon us all the afternoon with a summer heat the handsome residences and gardens which we occasionally passed gave evidence of taste and refinement in their possessors and there was a pleasant grace in the courteous greetings of the country people whom we met towards evening we reached a poststation and were tired enough to take horses again it was after dark before we drew up at ohlsдter in the heart of wermeland here we found a neat comfortable room with clean beds and procured a supper of superb potatoes the landlord was a tall handsome fellow whose friendly manners and frank face breathing honesty and kindness in every lineament quite won my heart were there more such persons in the world it would be a pleasanter place of residence we took horses and boneshattering carts in the morning for a distance of thirteen miles up the valley of the klar elv the country was very picturesque and beautiful well cultivated and quite thickly settled the wood in the sheltered bed of the valley was of remarkably fine growth the birch trees were the largest i ever saw some of them being over one hundred feet in height comfortable residences with orchards and wellkept gardens attached were quite frequent and large sawmills along the river which in some places was entirely concealed by floating rafts of lumber gave an air of industry and animation to the landscape in one place the road was spanned for a considerable distance with triumphal arches of foliage i inquired the meaning of this display of the boy who accompanied us why said he there was a wedding a week ago at the herregеrd gentlemans residence the young herr got married and these arches were put up for him and his bride the herregеrd which we passed soon afterwards was an imposing mansion upon an eminence overlooking the valley beside it was a jernbruk or ironworks from which a tramway some miles in length led to the mines resuming our knapsacks we walked on up the valley the hills on either side increased in height and gloomed darkly under a threatening sky the aspect of the country gradually became wilder though wherever there was cultivation it bore the same evidence of thrift and prosperity after a steady walk of four hours we reached the village of rеda where our road left the beautiful klar elv and struck northwards towards westerdal in dalecarlia we procured a dinner of potatoes and bacon with excellent ale enjoying meanwhile a lovely view over a lake to the eastward which stretched away for ten miles between the wooded hills the evening was cold and raw we drove through pinewoods around the head of the lake and by six oclock reached asplund a miserable little hamlet on a dreary hill the poststation was a forlorn cottage with a single room not of the most inviting appearance i asked if we could get quarters for the night if you will stay of course you can said the occupant an old woman but there is no bed and i can get you horses directly to go on it was a distance of thirteen miles to the next station but we yielded to the old womans hint and set forward the road led through woods which seemed interminable we were jammed together into a little twowheeled cart with the boy between our knees he seemed much disinclined to hurry the horse but soon fell asleep and one of us held him by the collar to prevent his tumbling out while the other took the lines and urged on our slow beast the night was so dark that we had great difficulty in keeping the road but towards eleven oclock we emerged from the woods and found by shaking the boy that we were approaching the station at last this was a little place called laggasen on the northern frontier of wermeland everybody had gone to bed in the hut at which we stopped we entered the kitchen which was at the same time the bedroom and aroused the inmates who consisted of a lonely woman with two or three children she got up in a very scanty chemise lit a wooden splinter and inspected us and in answer to our demand for a bed informed us that we would have to lie upon the floor we were about to do this when she said we could get good quarters at the nore on the top of the hill her earnestness in persuading us to go made me suspect that she merely wanted to get rid of us and i insisted that she should accompany us to show the way after some hesitation she consented and we set out we first crossed a broad swamp on a road made of loose logs then climbed a hill and trudged for some distance across stubblefields until my patience was quite worn out and braisted made use of some powerful maritime expressions finally we reached a house which we entered without more ado the close stifling atmosphere and the sound of hard breathing on all sides showed us that a whole family had been for some hours asleep there our guide thumped on the door and hailed and at length somebody awoke can you give two travellers a bed she asked no was the comfortable reply followed by the yell of an aroused baby and the noises of the older children we retreated at once and opened a battery of reproaches on the old woman for having brought us on a fools errand there is ohlsens she replied very quietly i think i can get you a bed there whereupon we entered another house in the same unceremonious manner but with a better result a plump goodnatured housewife jumped out of bed went to an opposite door and thumped upon it lars she cried come out of that this minute as we entered with a torch of dry fir lars who proved to be a middleaged man got out of bed sleepily picked up his clothes and marched off the hostess then brought clean sheets and pillowcases and by midnight we were sweetly and blissfully stowed away together in the place vacated by poor lars nothing could exceed the kindness and courtesy of the good people in the morning the hostess brought us coffee and her son went off to get us a horse and cart she would make no charge as we had had so little she said and was quite grateful for the moderate sum i gave her we had a wild road over hills covered with pine forests through the breaks in which we now and then caught a glimpse of a long lake to the westward shining with a steelblue gleam in the morning sun there were but few clearings along the road and miles frequently intervened without a sign of human habitation we met however with great numbers of travellers mostly farmers with laden haycarts it was sunday morning and i could not help contrasting these people with those we had seen on the same day three weeks previous whilst crossing the fille fjeld here every one had evidently been washed and combed the men wore clean shirts and stockings and the women chemises of snowy whiteness under their gay boddices they were mostly dalecarlians in the picturesque costume of the province we entered dalecarlia on this stage and the frank fresh faces of these people their unmistakable expression of honesty and integrity and the hearty cordiality of their greetings welcomed us delightfully to the storied ground of sweden towards noon we reached the village of tyngsjц a little settlement buried in the heart of the wild woods a mile or two of the southern slope of a hill had been cleared away and over this a number of dark wooden farmhouses were scattered with oats and potatofields around them an odd little church stood in midst and the rich swell of a hymn sung by sweet swedish voices floated to us over the fields as we drove up to the poststation the master a tall slender man with yellow locks falling upon his shoulders and a face which might be trusted with millions welcomed us with a fine antique courtesy and at once sent off for horses in a little while three farmers came saluting us gracefully and standing bareheaded while they spoke to us one of them who wore a dark brown jacket and kneebreeches with a clean white shirt and stockings had a strikingly beautiful head the face was a perfect oval the eyes large and dark and the jetblack hair parted on the forehead fell in silky waves upon his shoulders he was as handsome and graceful as one of vandyks cavaliers and showed the born gentleman in his demeanour he proposed that we should take one horse as it could be gotten without delay while two which the law obliged us to take and pay for if the farmers chose would have detained us an hour as the women were in church the postmaster himself cooked us some freshlydug potatoes which with excellent butter he set before us i have a kind of ale said he which is called porter if you will try it perhaps you will like it it was in reality so good that we took a second bottle with us for refreshment on the road when i asked how much we should pay he said i dont think you should pay anything there was so little well said i it is worth at least half a rigsdaler oh but that may be too much he answered hesitatingly our postillion was a fine handsome fellow so rosy and robust that it made one feel stronger and healthier to sit beside him he did not spare the horse which was a big capable animal and we rolled along through endless forests of fir and pine as rapidly as the sandy road would allow after we had gone about eight miles he left us taking a shorter footpath through the woods we guessed at our proper direction sometimes taking the wrong road but finally after two hours or more emerged from the woods into westerdal one of the two great valleys from which dalecarlia dalarne or the dales takes its name the day was magnificent clear and with a cold northeast wind resembling the latter part of october at home the broad level valley with its fields and clustered villages lay before us in the pale cold autumnal sunshine with low blue hills bounding it in the distance we met many parties in carts either returning from church or on their way to visit neighbours all were in brilliant sunday costume the men in blue jackets and kneebreeches with vests of red or some other brilliant colour and the women with gay embroidered boddices white sleeves and striped petticoats of blue red brown and purple and scarlet stockings some of them wore in addition an outer jacket of snowy sheepskin with elaborate ornamental stitchwork on the back their faces were as frank and cheerful as their dresses were tidy and they all greeted us with that spontaneous goodness of heart which recognises a brother in every man we had again taken a wrong road and a merry party carefully set us right again one old lady even proposing to leave her friends and accompany us for fear we should go astray again we crossed the westerdal by a floating bridge and towards sunset reached the inn of rеgsveden our destination it was a farmers gеrd standing a little distance off the road an entrance through one of the buildings closed with double doors admitted us into the courtyard a hollow square surrounded with two story wooden dwellings painted dark red there seemed to be no one at home but after knocking and calling for a time an old man made his appearance he was in his second childhood but knew enough to usher us into the kitchen and ask us to wait for the landlords arrival after half an hour our postillion arrived with four or five men in their gayest and trimmest costume the landlord among them they immediately asked who and what we were and we were then obliged to give them an account of all our travels their questions were shrewd and intelligent and their manner of asking coupled as it was with their native courtesy showed an earnest desire for information which we were most willing to gratify by and by the hostess came and we were ushered into a very pleasant room with two beds and furnished with a supper of fresh meat potatoes and mead the landlord and two or three of the neighbours sat with us before the fire until we were too sleepy to answer any more questions a more naturally independent and manly bearing i have never seen than that of our host he was a tall powerful man of middle age with very handsome features which were softened but not weakened in expression by his long blond hair parted on his forehead he had the proper pride which belongs to the consciousness of worth and has no kinship with empty vanity we have come to dalecarlia to see the descendants of the people who gave gustavus vasa his throne said i curious to see whether he would betray any signs of flattered pride his blue eye flashed a little as he sat with his hands clasped over one knee gazing at the fire a light flush ran over his temples but he said nothing some time ago a proposition was made to place a portrait of gustavus vasa in the church at mora no said the dalecarlians we will not have it we do not need any picture to remind us of what our fathers have done the landlady was a little woman who confessed to being fortynine years old although she did not appear to be more than forty i have had a great deal of headache said she and i look much older than i am her teeth were superb as were those of all the women we saw i do not suppose a toothbrush is known in the valley yet the teeth one sees are perfect pearls the use of so much sour milk is said to preserve them there was a younger person in the house whom we took to be a girl of sixteen but who proved to be the sons wife a woman of twentysix and the mother of two or three children the dalecarlians marry young when they are able but even in opposite cases they rarely commit any violation of the laws of morality instances are frequent i was told where a man and woman unable to defray the expense of marriage live together for years in a state of mutual chastity until they have saved a sum sufficient to enable them to assume the responsibilities of married life i know there is no honester and i doubt whether there is a purer people on the earth than these dalecarlians we awoke to another glorious autumnal day the valley was white with frost in the morning and the air deliciously keen and cold but after sunrise heavy white vapours arose from the spangled grass and the day gradually grew milder i was amused at the naпve curiosity of the landlady and her daughterinlaw who came into our room very early that they might see the make of our garments and our manner of dressing as they did not appear to be conscious of any impropriety we did not think it necessary to feel embarrassed our lapland journey had taught us habits of selfpossession under such trying circumstances we had coffee paid an absurdly small sum for our entertainment and took a cordial leave of the good people a boy of fifteen whose eyes teeth and complexion kept my admiration on the stretch during the whole stage drove us through unbroken woods to skamhed ten miles further down the valley here the inn was a little one story hut miserable to behold externally but containing a neat guests room and moreover as we discovered in the course of time a good breakfast while we were waiting there a man came up who greeted us in the name of our lord jesus christ on learning that we came from america are you not afraid to travel so far from home he asked how could you cross the great sea oh i answered there is no more danger in one part of the world than another yes said he god is as near on the water as on the land unconsciously repeating the last words of sir humphrey gilbert christ walked upon the waves and quieted them and he walks yet for them that believe in him hereupon he began repeating some hymns mingled with texts of scripture which process he continued until we became heartily tired i took him at a venture for an overenthusiastic lдsare or reader the name given to the swedish dissenters we had a station of twenty three miles before us to the village of landbobyn which lies in the wooded wilderness between osterdal and westerdal our postillion a fine young fellow of twentytwo over six feet in height put on his best blue jacket and kneebreeches with a leather apron reaching from his shoulders to below his knees this is an article worn by almost all dalecarlians for the purpose of saving their clothes while at work and gives them an awkward and ungraceful air this fellow in spite of a little fear at the bare idea expressed his willingness to go with us all over the world but the spirit of wandering was evidently so easy to be kindled in him that i rather discouraged him we had a monotonous journey of five hours through a forest of pine fir and birch in which deer and elk are frequently met with while the wolf and the bear haunt its remoter valleys the ground was but slightly undulating and the scenery in general was as tame as it was savage landbobyn was a wretched hamlet on the banks of a stream with a few cleared fields about it as the sun had not yet set we determined to push on to kettbo eight or ten miles further and engaged a boy to pilot us through the woods the poststation was a miserable place where we found it impossible to get anything to eat i sat down and talked with the family while our guide recruited himself with a large dish of thick sour milk why do you travel about the earth asked his mother is it that you may spy out the poverty of the people and see how miserably they live no said i it is that i may become acquainted with the people whether they are poor or not but she continued did you ever see a people poorer than we often said i because you are contented and no one can be entirely poor who does not complain she shook her head with a sad smile and said nothing our guide poled us across the river in a rickety boat and then plunged into the woods he was a tall well grown boy of fifteen or sixteen with a beautiful oval face long fair hair parted in the middle and hanging upon his shoulders and a fine manly resolute expression with his jacket girdle kneebreeches and the high crowned and broad brimmed felt hat he wore he reminded me strongly of the picture of gustavus vasa in his dalecarlian disguise in the cathedral of upsala he was a splendid walker and quite put me old pedestrian as i am out of countenance the footpath we followed was terribly rough we stumbled over stock and stone leaped fallen trees crossed swamps on tussocks of spongy moss and climbed over heaps of granite boulders yet while we were panting and exhausted with our exertions to keep pace with him he walked onward as quietly and easily as if the smoothest meadow turf were under his feet i was quite puzzled by the speed he kept up on such a hard path without seeming to put forth any extra strength at sunset he pointed out some clearings on a hill side over the tree tops a mile or two ahead as our destination dusk was gathering as we came upon a pretty lake with a village scattered along its hilly shore the poststation however was beyond it and after some delay the boy procured a boat and rowed us across telling us to go up the hill and we should find the inn he bade us good bye and set out on his return we soon reached a gеrd the owner whereof after satisfying his curiosity concerning us by numerous questions informed us that the inn was still further after groping about in the dark for awhile we found it the landlord and his wife were sitting before the fire and seemed i thought considerably embarrassed by our arrival there was no bed they said and they had nothing that we could eat their house was beyond the lake and they only came over to take charge of the poststation when their turn arrived we were devoured with hunger and thirst and told them we should be satisfied with potatoes and a place on the floor the wifes brother who came in soon afterwards was thereupon despatched across the lake to bring coffee for us and the pleasant goodwife put our potatoes upon the fire to boil we lit our pipes meanwhile and sat before the fire talking with our host and some neighbours who came in they had much to ask about america none of them having ever before seen a native of that country their questions related principally to the cost of living to the value of labour the price of grain the climate and productions and the character of our laws they informed me that the usual wages in dalecarlia were skillings cents a day and that one tunne about lbs of rye cost rigsdaler no doubt you write descriptions of your travels asked the landlord i assented and then perhaps you make books of them he continued whereupon one of the neighbours asked but do you get any money for your books the potatoes were finally done and they with some delicious milk constituted our supper by this time the brother had returned bringing with him coffee a pillow and a large coverlet made entirely of catskins a deep bed of hay was spread upon the floor a coarse linen sheet thrown over it and with the soft fur covering we had a sumptuous bed about midnight we were awakened by an arrival two tailors one of them humpbacked on their way to wermeland came in with a tall strong woman as postillion the fire was rekindled and every thing which the landlord had extracted from us was repeated to the new comers together with a very genial criticism upon our personal appearance and character after an hour or two more hay was brought in and the two tailors and the postillioness lay down side by side we had barely got to sleep again when there was another arrival i am the postgirl said a female voice hereupon everybody woke up and the story of the two foreign travellers was told over again in the course of the conversation i learned that the girl carried the post twenty english miles once a week for which she received rigs annually it is a hard business said the humpbacked tailor yes but i am obliged to do it answered the girl after her departure we were not again disturbed and managed to get some sleep at last we all completed our toilettes in the same room without the least embarrassment and with a travellers curiosity i may be pardoned for noticing the general bodily cleanliness of my various bedfellows especially as the city swedes are in the habit of saying that the country people are shockingly dirty we had coffee and made arrangements with the girl who had brought the tailors to take us back in her cart our host would make no charge for the bed and next to nothing for our fare so i put a banknote in the hand of little pehr his only child telling him to take care of it and spend it wisely when he grew up the delight of the good people knew no bounds pehr must hold up his little mouth to be kissed again and again the mother shook us warmly by the hand and the father harnessed his horse and started with us may the blessing of god be upon all poor honest and contented people our road led between wooded hills to the siljanforss a large ironfoundry upon a stream which flows into the siljan lake it was a lovely morning and our postillion who was a woman of good sense and some intelligence chatted with me the whole way she was delighted to find that we could so easily make ourselves understood when i saw you first in the night said she i thought you must certainly be swedes all the foreigners i saw in stockholm had something dark and cloudy in their countenances but both of you have shining faces she questioned me a great deal about the sacred localities of palestine and about the state of religion in america she evidently belonged to the lдsare who she stated were very numerous in dalecarlia it is a shame said she that we poor people are obliged to pay so much for the support of the church whether we belong to it or not our taxes amount to rigs yearly ten of which in mora parish go to the priest they say he has an income of half a rigs every hour of his life king oscar wishes to make religion free and so it ought to be but the clergy are all against him and the clergy control the bondestеnd house of peasants and so he can do nothing the woman was thirtyone years old and worn with hard labour i asked her if she was married no she answered with a deep sigh looking at the betrothalring on her finger ah she continued we are all poor sweden is a poor country we have only iron and timber not grain and cotton and silk and sugar like other countries as we descended towards the poststation of vik we caught a glimpse of the siljan lake to the south and the tall tower of mora church far to the eastward at vik where we found the same simple and honest race of people we parted with the postillioness and with our host of kettbo who thanked us again in pehrs name as he shook hands for the last time we now had fast horses and a fine road over a long wooded hill which was quite covered with the lingon or swedish cranberry from the further slope we at last looked down upon mora at the head of the siljan lake in the midst of a broad and fertile valley ten miles to the eastward arose the spire of orsa and southward on an island in the lake the tall church of sollerцn you can see three churches at once said our postillion with great pride so we could and also the large stately inn of mora a most welcome sight to us after five days on potato diet chapter xxxvi last days in the north mora in dalecarlia is classic ground it was here that gustavus vasa first harangued the people and kindled that spark of revolution which in the end swept the danes from sweden in the cellar of a house which was pointed out to us on the southern shore of the siljan lake he lay hidden three days in the barn of ivan elfssen he threshed corn disguised as a peasant and on the road by which we had travelled from kettbo in descending to the lake we had seen the mounds of stone heaped over the danes who were slain in his first victorious engagement this district is considered also one of the most beautiful in sweden it has indeed a quiet tranquil beauty which gradually grows upon the eye so that if one is not particularly aroused on first acquaintance he at least carries away a delightful picture in his memory but in order to enjoy properly any swedish landscape whatsoever one should not be too fresh from norway after dinner we called at the parsonage of mora which has given miss fredrika bremer the materials for one of her stories of swedish life the prost herr kjelstrцm was not at home but his wife received us with great cordiality and insisted upon our remaining to tea the magister who called at the same time gave us some information concerning the porphyry quarries at elfdal which we were debating whether we should visit very little is doing at present not more than ten men in all being employed and in his opinion we would hardly be repaid for the journey thither so we determined to turn southward again and gradually make our way to stockholm fru kjelstrцm was one of the few swedes i met who was really an enthusiastic admirer of tegner she knew by heart the greater part of his frithiofs saga the morning after our arrival in mora dawned dark and cloudy with a wailing wind and dashes of rain there were threats of the equinoctial storm and we remembered the prediction of the lumber merchants in carlstad during the night however a little steamer belonging to an iron company arrived offering us the chance of a passage down the lake to leksand while we were waiting on the shore the magister who had come to see us depart gave me some information about the lдsare he admitted that there were many in dalecarlia and said that the policy of persecution which was practiced against them in the beginning was now dropped they were in general ignored by the clerical authorities he looked upon the movement rather as a transient hallucination than as a permanent secession from the established church and seemed to think that it would gradually disappear if left to itself he admitted that the king was in favour of religious liberty but was so guarded in speaking of the subject that i did not ascertain his own views we had on board about sixty passengers mostly peasants from upper elfdal bound on a peddling excursion through sweden with packs of articles which they manufacture at home their stock consisted mostly of pocketbooks purses boxes and various small articles of ornament and use the little steamer was so well laden with their solid forms that she settled into the mud and the crew had hard poling to get her off there was service in mora church and the sound of the organ and choir was heard along the lake many friends and relatives of the wandering elfdalians were on the little wooden pier to bid them adieu gods peace be with thee was a parting salutation which i heard many times repeated at last we got fairly clear and paddled off through the sepiacoloured water watching the softly undulating shores which soon sank low enough to show the blue irregular hills in the distant background mora spire was the central point in the landscape and remained visible until we had nearly reached the other end of the lake the siljan has a length of about twentyfive miles with a breadth of from six to ten the shores are hilly but only moderately high except in the neighborhood of rдttvik where they were bold and beautiful the soft slopes on either hand were covered with the yellow pillars of the ripe oats bound to upright stakes to dry from every village rose a tall midsummer pole yet laden with the withered garlands of swedens fairest festival and bearing aloft its patriotic symbol the crossed arrows of dalecarlia the threatened storm broke and dispersed as we left mora and strong sunbursts between the clouds flashed across these pastoral pictures soon after we left a number of the men and women collected together on the afterdeck and commenced singing hymns which occupation they kept up with untiring fervour during the whole voyage the young girls were remarkable for weight and solidity of figure ugliness of face and sweetness of voice the clear ringing tones with a belllike purity and delicious timbre issued without effort from between their thick beefy lips and there was such a contrast between sound and substance that they attracted my attention more than i should have thought possible some of the men who had heard what we were entered into conversation with us i soon discovered that they were all lдsare and one of them who seemed to exercise a kind of leadership and who was a man of considerable intelligence gave me a good deal of information about the sect they met together privately he said to read the new testament trusting entirely to its inspired pages for the means of enlightenment as to what was necessary for the salvation of their souls the clergy stood between them and the voice of god who had spoken not to a particular class but to all mankind they were liable to a fine of rigs every time they thus met together my informant had once been obliged to pay it himself nevertheless he said they were not interfered with so much at present except that they were obliged to pay tithes as before the king is a good man he continued he means well and would do us justice if he had the power but the clergy are all against him and his own authority is limited now they are going to bring the question of religious freedom before the diet but we have not the least hope that anything will be done he also stated what indeed must be evident to every observing traveller that the doctrines of the lдsare had spread very rapidly and that their numbers were continually increasing the creation of such a powerful dissenting body is a thing that might have been expected the church in sweden had become a system of forms and ceremonies the pure spiritualism of swedenborg in the last century was a natural and gigantic rebound to the opposite extreme but from its lofty intellectuality was unfitted to be the nucleus of a popular protest meanwhile the souls of the people starved on the dry husks which were portioned out to them they needed genuine nourishment they are an earnest reflective race and the religious element is deeply implanted in their nature the present movement so much like methodism in many particulars owes its success to the same genial and allembracing doctrine of an impartial visitation of divine grace bringing man into nearer and tenderer relations to his maker in a word it is the democratic opposed to the aristocratic principle in religion it is fashionable in sweden to sneer at the lдsare their numbers character and sincerity are very generally underestimated no doubt there is much that is absurd and grotesque in their services no doubt they run into violent and unchristian extremes and often merely substitute fanaticism for spiritual apathy but i believe they will in the end be the instrument of bestowing religious liberty upon sweden there was no end to the desire of these people for knowledge they overwhelmed us with questions about our country its government laws climate productions and geographical extent next to america they seemed most interested in palestine and considered me as specially favoured by providence in having beheld jerusalem they all complained of the burdens which fall upon a poor man in sweden in the shape of government taxes tithes and the obligation of supporting a portion of the army who are distributed through the provinces thus dalecarlia they informed me with a population of is obliged to maintain troops the tax on land corresponded very nearly with the statement made by my female postillion the previous day dalecarlia its mines excepted is one of the poorest of the swedish provinces many of its inhabitants are obliged to wander forth every summer either to take service elsewhere or to dispose of the articles they fabricate at home in order after some years of this irregular life to possess enough to enable them to pass the rest of their days humbly at home our fellowpassengers told me of several who had emigrated to america where they had spent five or six years they grew homesick at last and returned to their chilly hills but it was not the bleak firwoods the oatfields or the wooden huts which they missed it was the truth the honesty the manliness and the loving tenderness which dwell in dalecarlian hearts we had a strong wind abeam but our little steamer made good progress down the lake the shores contracted and the white church of leksand rose over the dark woods and between two and three oclock in the afternoon we were moored in the dal river where it issues from the siljan the elfdal peddlers shouldered their immense packs and set out bidding us a friendly adieu as we parted after establishing ourselves in the little inn where we procured a tolerable dinner we called upon the domprost hvasser to whom i had a letter from a countryman who made a pedestrian journey through dalecarlia five years ago the parsonage was a spacious building near the church standing upon the brink of a lofty bank overlooking the outflow of the dal the domprost a hale stout old man with something irresistibly hearty and cheering in his manner gave us both his hands and drew us into the room on seeing that we were strangers he then proceeded to read the letter ho he exclaimed to think that he has remembered me all this time and he has not forgotten that it was just midsummer when he was here presently he went out and soon returned with a basket in one hand and some plates in the other which he placed before us and heaped with fine ripe cherries now it is autumn said he it is no longer midsummer but we have a little of the summers fruit left he presented us to his sister and daughter and to two handsome young magisters who assisted him in his parochial duties we walked in the garden which was laid out with some taste along the brow of the hill a superb drooping birch eighty feet in height was the crowning glory of the place the birch is the characteristic tree of sweden as the fir is of norway the beech of denmark the oak of england and germany the chestnut of italy and the palm of esrypt of northern trees there is none more graceful in outline but in the cold silvery hue of its foliage summer can never find her best expression the parson had a neat little bowlingalley in a grove of pine on a projecting spur of the hill he did not disdain secular recreations his religion was cheerful and jubilant he had found something else in the bible than the lamentations of jeremiah there are so many christians who to judge from the settled expression of their faces suffer under their belief that it is a comfort to find those who see nothing heretical in the fullest and freest enjoyment of life there was an appletree in the garden which was just bursting into blossoms for the second time i called the domprosts attention to it remarking in a line from frithiofs saga hцsten bjuder sin thron til varen autumn offers his throne to the spring what he exclaimed in joyful surprise do you know tegner and immediately continued the quotation there was no resisting the hospitable persuasions of the family we were obliged to take supper and spend the evening with them the daughter and the two magisters sang for us all the characteristic songs of wermeland and dalecarlia which they could remember and i was more than ever charmed with the wild simple original character of the native melodies of sweden they are mostly in the minor key and some of them might almost be called monotonous yet it is monotony or rather simplicity in the notation which sticks to the memory the longings the regrets the fidelity and the tenderness of the people find an echo in these airs which have all the character of improvisations and rekindle in the heart of the hearer the passions they were intended to relieve we at last took leave of the good old man and his friendly household the night was dark and rainy and the magisters accompanied us to the inn in the morning it was raining dismally a slow cold driving rain which is the climax of bad weather we determined however to push onward as far as fahlun the capital of dalecarlia about four swedish miles distant our road was down the valley of the dal elv which we crossed twice on floating bridges through a very rich beautiful and thickly settled country the hills were here higher and bolder than in westerdal dark with forests of fir and pine and swept southeastward in long ranges leaving a broad open valley for the river to wander in this valley from three to five miles in width was almost entirely covered with enclosed fields owing to which the road was barred with gates and our progress was much delayed thereby the houses were neat and substantial many of them with gardens and orchards attached while the unusual number of the barns and granaries gave evidence of a more prosperous state of agriculture than we had seen since leaving the neighborhood of carlstad we pressed forward in the rain and raw wind and reached fahlun towards evening just in time to avoid a drenching storm of the celebrated coppermines of fahlun some of which have been worked for years we saw nothing we took their magnitude and richness for granted on the strength of the immense heaps of dross through which we drove on approaching the town and the desolate appearance of the surrounding country whose vegetation has been for the most part destroyed by the fumes from the smelting works in our sore and sodden condition we were in no humour to go sight seeing and so sat comfortably by the stove while the rain beat against the windows and the darkness fell the next morning brought us a renewal of the same weather but we set out bravely in our open cart and jolted over the muddy roads with such perseverance that we reached hedemora at night the hills diminished in height as we proceeded southward but the scenery retained its lovely pastoral character my most prominent recollection of the days travel however is of the number of gates our numb and bluefaced boypostillions were obliged to jump down and open from hedemora a journey of two days through the provinces of westerеs and uppland brought us to upsala after leaving dalecarlia and crossing the dal river for the fifth and last time the country gradually sank into those long slightly rolling plains which we had traversed last winter between stockholm and gefle here villages were more frequent but the houses had not the same air of thrift and comfort as in dalecarlia the population also changed in character the faces we now saw being less bright cheerful and kindly and the forms less tall and strongly knit we had very fair accommodations at all the poststations along the road and found the people everywhere honest and obliging still i missed the noble simplicity which i had admired so much in the natives of westerdal and on the frontier of wermeland the unaffected kindness of heart which made me look upon every man as a friend the large town of sala where we spent a night was filled with fugitives from upsala where the cholera was making great ravages the violence of the disease was over by the time we arrived but the students all of whom had left had not yet returned and the fine old place had a melancholy air the first thing we saw on approaching it was a funeral professor bergfalk who had remained at his post and to whom i had letters most kindly gave me an entire day of his time i saw the famous codex argenteus in the library the original manuscript of frithiofs saga the journals of swedenborg and linnжus the botanical garden and the tombs of gustavus vasa and john iii in the cathedral but most interesting of all was our drive to old upsala where we climbed upon the mound of odin and drank mead out of the silvermounted drinking horn from which bernadotte oscar and the whole royal family of sweden are in the habit of drinking when they make a pilgrimage to the burial place of the scandinavian gods a cold pale yellow light lay upon the landscape the towers of upsala cathedral and the massive front of the palace rose dark against the sky in the southwest a chill autumnal wind blew over the plains and the yellowing foliage of the birch drifted across the mysterious mounds like those few golden leaves of poetry which the modern bards of the north have cast upon the grave of the grand muscular religion of the earlier race there was no melodious wailing in the wind like that which proclaimed pan is dead through the groves of greece and ionia but a cold rustling hiss as if the serpent of midgard were exulting over the ruin of walhalla but in the stinging aromatic flood of the ambercoloured mead i drank to odin to balder and to freja we reached stockholm on the nd of september in the midst of a furious gale accompanied with heavy squalls of snow the same in which the russian lineofbattle ship lefort foundered in the gulf of finland in the mild calm sunny autumn days which followed the beautiful city charmed us more than ever and i felt half inclined to take back all i had said against the place during the dismal weather of last spring the trees in the djurgеrd and in the islands of mдlar were still in full foliage the dalecarlian boatwomen plied their crafts in the outer harbour the little garden under the norrbro was gay with music and lamps every evening and the brief and jovial summer life of the swedes so near its close clung to the flying sunshine that not a moment might be suffered to pass by unenjoyed in another week we were standing on the deck of the prussian steamer nagler threading the rocky archipelago between stockholm and the open baltic on our way to stettin in leaving the north after ten months of winter and summer wanderings and with scarce a hope of returning again i found myself
