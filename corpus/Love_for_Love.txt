love for love prologue spoken at the opening of the new house by mr betterton the husbandman in vain renews his toil to cultivate each year a hungry soil and fondly hopes for rich and generous fruit when what should feed the tree devours the root th unladen boughs he sees bode certain dearth unless transplanted to more kindly earth so the poor husbands of the stage who found their labours lost upon ungrateful ground this last and only remedy have proved and hope new fruit from ancient stocks removed well may they hope when you so kindly aid well plant a soil which you so rich have made as nature gave the world to mans first age so from your bounty we receive this stage the freedom man was born to youve restored and to our world such plenty you afford it seems like eden fruitful of its own accord but since in paradise frail flesh gave way and when but two were made both went astray forbear your wonder and the fault forgive if in our larger family we grieve one falling adam and one tempted eve we who remain would gratefully repay what our endeavours can and bring this day the firstfruit offering of a virgin play we hope theres something that may please each taste and though of homely fare we make the feast yet you will find variety at least theres humour which for cheerful friends we got and for the thinking party theres a plot weve something too to gratify illnature if there be any here and that is satire though satire scarce dares grin tis grown so mild or only shows its teeth as if it smiled as asses thistles poets mumble wit and dare not bite for fear of being bit they hold their pens as swords are held by fools and are afraid to use their own edgetools since the plaindealers scenes of manly rage not one has dared to lash this crying age this time the poet owns the bold essay yet hopes theres no illmanners in his play and he declares by me he has designed affront to none but frankly speaks his mind and should th ensuing scenes not chance to hit he offers but this one excuse twas writ before your late encouragement of wit epilogue spoken at the opening of the new house by mrs bracegirdle sure providence at first designed this place to be the players refuge in distress for still in every storm they all run hither as to a shed that shields em from the weather but thinking of this change which last befel us its like what i have heard our poets tell us for when behind our scenes their suits are pleading to help their love sometimes they show their reading and wanting ready cash to pay for hearts they top their learning on us and their parts once of philosophers they told us stories whom as i think they called py pythagories im sure tis some such latin name they give em and we who know no better must believe em now to these men say they such souls were given that after death neer went to hell nor heaven but lived i know not how in beasts and then when many years were past in men again methinks we players resemble such a soul that does from bodies we from houses stroll thus aristotles soul of old that was may now be damned to animate an ass or in this very house for ought we know is doing painful penance in some beau and thus our audience which did once resort to shining theatres to see our sport now find us tossed into a tenniscourt these walls but tother day were filled with noise of roaring gamesters and your damme boys then bounding balls and rackets they encompast and now theyre filled with jests and flights and bombast i vow i dont much like this transmigration strolling from place to place by circulation grant heaven we dont return to our first station i know not what these think but for my part i cant reflect without an aching heart how we should end in our original a cart but we cant fear since youre so good to save us that you have only set us up to leave us thus from the past we hope for future grace i beg it and some here know i have a begging face then pray continue this your kind

upon this paper diet aside and taking away the books val and dye hear go you to breakfast theres a page doubled down in epictetus that is a feast for an emperor jere was epictetus a real cook or did he only write receipts val read read sirrah and refine your appetite learn to live upon instruction feast your mind and mortify your flesh read and take your nourishment in at your eyes shut up your mouth and chew the cud of understanding so epictetus advises jere o lord i have heard much of him when i waited upon a gentleman at cambridge pray what was that epictetus val a very rich man not worth a groat jere humph and so he has made a very fine feast where there is nothing to be eaten val yes jere sir youre a gentleman and probably understand this fine feeding but if you please i had rather be at board wages does your epictetus or your seneca here or any of these poor rich rogues teach you how to pay your debts without money will they shut up the mouths of your creditors will plato be bail for you or diogenes because he understands confinement and lived in a tub go to prison for you slife sir what do you mean to mew yourself up here with three or four musty books in commendation of starving and poverty val why sirrah i have no money you know it and therefore resolve to rail at all that have and in that i but follow the examples of the wisest and wittiest men in all ages these poets and philosophers whom you naturally hate for just such another reason because they abound in sense and you are a fool jere ay sir i am a fool i know it and yet heaven help me im poor enough to be a wit but i was always a fool when i told you what your expenses would bring you to your coaches and your liveries your treats and your balls your being in love with a lady that did not care a farthing for you in your prosperity and keeping company with wits that cared for nothing but your prosperity and now when you are poor hate you as much as they do one another val well and now i am poor i have an opportunity to be revenged on them all ill pursue angelica with more love than ever and appear more notoriously her admirer in this restraint than when i openly rivalled the rich fops that made court to her so shall my poverty be a mortification to her pride and perhaps make her compassionate the love which has principally reduced me to this lowness of fortune and for the wits im sure i am in a condition to be even with them jere nay your condition is pretty even with theirs thats the truth ont val ill take some of their trade out of their hands jere now heaven of mercy continue the tax upon paper you dont mean to write val yes i do ill write a play jere hem sir if you please to give me a small certificate of three lines only to certify those whom it may concern that the bearer hereof jeremy fetch by name has for the space of seven years truly and faithfully served valentine legend esq and that he is not now turned away for any misdemeanour but does voluntarily dismiss his master from any future authority over him val no sirrah you shall live with me still jere sir its impossible i may die with you starve with you or be damned with your works but to live even three days the life of a play i no more expect it than to be canonised for a muse after my decease val you are witty you rogue i shall want your help ill have you learn to make couplets to tag the ends of acts dye hear get the maids to crambo in an evening and learn the knack of rhyming you may arrive at the height of a song sent by an unknown hand or a chocolatehouse lampoon jere but sir is this the way to recover your fathers favour why sir sampson will be irreconcilable if your younger brother should come from sea hed never look upon you again youre undone sir youre ruined you wont have a friend left in the world if you turn poet ah pox confound that wills coffeehouse it has ruined more young men than the royal oak lottery nothing thrives that belongs tot the man of the house would have been an alderman by this time with half the trade if he had set up in the city for my part i never sit at the door that i dont get double the stomach that i do at a horse race the air upon bansteaddowns is nothing to it for a whetter yet i never see it but the spirit of famine appears to me sometimes like a decayed porter worn out with pimping and carrying billet doux and songs not like other porters for hire but for the jests sake now like a thin chairman melted down to half his proportion with carrying a poet upon tick to visit some great fortune and his fare to be paid him like the wages of sin either at the day of marriage or the day of death val very well sir can you proceed jere sometimes like a bilked bookseller with a meagre terrified countenance that looks as if he had written for himself or were resolved to turn author and bring the rest of his brethren into the same condition and lastly in the form of a wornout punk with verses in her hand which her vanity had preferred to settlements without a whole tatter to her tail but as ragged as one of the muses or as if she were carrying her linen to the papermill to be converted into folio books of warning to all young maids not to prefer poetry to good sense or lying in the arms of a needy wit before the embraces of a wealthy fool scene ii valentine scandal jeremy scan what jeremy holding forth val the rogue has with all the wit he could muster up been declaiming against wit scan ay why then im afraid jeremy has wit for wherever it is its always contriving its own ruin jere why so i have been telling my master sir mr scandal for heavens sake sir try if you can dissuade him from turning poet scan poet he shall turn soldier first and rather depend upon the outside of his head than the lining why what the devil has not your poverty made you enemies enough must you needs shew your wit to get more jere ay more indeed for who cares for anybody that has more wit than himself scan jeremy speaks like an oracle dont you see how worthless great men and dull rich rogues avoid a witty man of small fortune why he looks like a writ of enquiry into their titles and estates and seems commissioned by heaven to seize hte better half val therefore i would rail in my writings and be revenged scan rail at whom the whole world impotent and vain who would die a martyr to sense in a country where the religion is folly you may stand at bay for a while but when the full cry is against you you shant have fair play for your life if you cant be fairly run down by the hounds you will be treacherously shot by the huntsmen no turn pimp flatterer quack lawyer parson be chaplain to an atheist or stallion to an old woman anything but poet a modern poet is worse more servile timorous and fawning than any i have named without you could retrieve the ancient honours of the name recall the stage of athens and be allowed the force of open honest satire val you are as inveterate against our poets as if your character had been lately exposed upon the stage nay i am not violently bent upon the trade one knocks jeremy see whos there jere goes to the door but tell me what you would have me do what do the world say of me and my forced confinement scan the world behaves itself as it uses to do on such occasions some pity you and condemn your father others excuse him and blame you only the ladies are merciful and wish you well since love and pleasurable expense have been your greatest faults val how now jere nothing new sir i have despatched some half a dozen duns with as much dexterity as a hungry judge does causes at dinnertime val what answer have you given em scan patience i suppose the old receipt jere no faith sir i have put em off so long with patience and forbearance and other fair words that i was forced now to tell em in plain downright english val what jere that they should be paid val when jere tomorrow val and how the devil do you mean to keep your word jere keep it not at all it has been so very much stretched that i reckon it will break of course by tomorrow and nobody be surprised at the matter knocking again sir if you dont like my negotiation will you be pleased to answer these yourself val see who they are scene iii valentine scandal val by this scandal you may see what it is to be great secretaries of state presidents of the council and generals of an army lead just such a life as i do have just such crowds of visitants in a morning all soliciting of past promises which are but a civiller sort of duns that lay claim to voluntary debts scan and you like a true great man having engaged their attendance and promised more than ever you intended to perform are more perplexed to find evasions than you would be to invent the honest means of keeping your word and gratifying your creditors val scandal learn to spare your friends and do not provoke your enemies this liberty of your tongue will one day bring a confinement on your body my friend scene iv valentine scandal jeremy jere o sir theres trapland the scrivener with two suspicious fellows like lawful pads that would knock a man down with pockettipstaves and theres your fathers steward and the nurse with one of your children from twitnam val pox on her could she find no other time to fling my sins in my face here give her this gives money and bid her trouble me no more a thoughtless twohanded whore she knows my condition well enough and might have overlaid the child a fortnight ago if she had had any forecast in her scan what is it bouncing margery with my godson jere yes sir scan my blessing to the boy with this token gives money of my love and dye hear bid margery put more flocks in her bed shift twice a week and not work so hard that she may not smell so vigorously i shall take the air shortly val scandal dont spoil my boys milk bid trapland come in if i can give that cerberus a sop i shall be at rest for one day scene v valentine scandal trapland

traplands health an honester man lives not nor one more ready to serve his friend in distress though i say it to his face come fill each man his glass scan what i know trapland has been a whoremaster

a wag val no faith well mind the widows business fill again pretty round heaving breasts a barbary shape and a jut with her bum would stir an anchoret and the prettiest foot oh if a man could but fasten his eyes to her feet as they steal in and out and play at bopeep under her petticoats ah mr trapland trap verily give me a glass youre a wag and heres to the widow drinks scan he begins to chuckle ply him close or hell relapse into a dun scene vi to them officer off by your leave gentlemen mr trapland if we must do our office tell us we have half a dozen gentlemen to arrest in pall mall and covent garden and if we dont make haste the chairmen will be abroad and block up the chocolatehouses and then our labours lost trap udso thats true mr valentine i love mirth but business must be done are you ready to jere sir your fathers steward says he comes to make proposals concerning your debts val bid him come in mr trapland send away your officer you shall have an answer presently trap mr snap stay within call scene vii valentine scandal trapland jeremy steward who whispers valentine scan heres a dog now a traitor in his wine sirrah refund the sack jeremy fetch him some warm water or ill rip up his stomach and go the shortest way to his conscience trap mr scandal you are uncivil i did not value your sack but you cannot expect it again when i have drunk it scan and how do you expect to have your money again when a gentleman has spent it val you need say no more i understand the conditions they are very hard but my necessity is very pressing i agree to em take mr trapland with you and let him draw the writing mr trapland you know this man he shall satisfy you trap sincerely i am loth to be thus pressing but my necessity val no apology good mr scrivener you shall be paid trap i hope you forgive me my business requires scene viii valentine scandal scan he begs pardon like a hangman at an execution val but i have got a reprieve scan i am surprised what does your father relent val no he has sent me the hardest conditions in the world you have heard of a booby brother of mine that was sent to sea three years ago this brother my father hears is landed whereupon he very affectionately sends me word if i will make a deed of conveyance of my right to his estate after his death to my younger brother he will immediately furnish me with four thousand pounds to pay my debts and make my fortune this was once proposed before and i refused it but the present impatience of my creditors for their money and my own impatience of confinement and absence from angelica force me to consent scan a very desperate demonstration of your love to angelica and i think she has never given you any assurance of hers val you know her temper she never gave me any great reason either for hope or despair scan women of her airy temper as they seldom think before they act so they rarely give us any light to guess at what they mean but you have little reason to believe that a woman of this age who has had an indifference for you in your prosperity will fall in love with your illfortune besides angelica has a great fortune of her own and great fortunes either expect another great fortune or a fool scene ix to them jeremy jere more misfortunes sir val what another dun jere no sir but mr tattle is come to wait upon you val well i cant help it you must bring him up he knows i dont go abroad scene x valentine scandal scan pox on him ill be gone val no prithee stay tattle and you should never be asunder you are light and shadow and show one another he is perfectly thy reverse both in humour and understanding and as you set up for defamation he is a mender of reputations scan a mender of reputations ay just as he is a keeper of secrets another virtue that he sets up for in the same manner for the rogue will speak aloud in the posture of a whisper and deny a womans name while he gives you the marks of her person he will forswear receiving a letter from her and at the same time show you her hand in the superscription and yet perhaps he has counterfeited the hand too and sworn to a truth but he hopes not to be believed and refuses the reputation of a ladys favour as a doctor says no to a bishopric only that it may be granted him in short he is public professor of secrecy and makes proclamation that he holds private intelligence hes here scene xi to them tattle tatt valentine good morrow scandal i am yours that is when you speak well of me scan that is when i am yours for while i am my own or anybodys else that will never happen tatt how inhuman val why tattle you need not be much concerned at anything that he says for to converse with scandal is to play at losing loadum you must lose a good name to him before you can win it for yourself tatt but how barbarous that is and how unfortunate for him that the world shall think the better of any person for his calumniation i thank heaven it has always been a part of my character to handle the reputations of others very tenderly indeed scan ay such rotten reputations as you have to deal with are to be handled tenderly indeed tatt nay but why rotten why should you say rotten when you know not the persons of whom you speak how cruel that is scan not know em why thou never hadst to do with anybody that did not stink to all the town tatt ha ha ha nay now you make a jest of it indeed for there is nothing more known than that nobody knows anything of that nature of me as i hope to be saved valentine i never exposed a woman since i knew what woman was val and yet you have conversed with several tatt to be free with you i have i dont care if i own that nay more im going to say a bold word now i never could meddle with a woman that had to do with anybody else scan how val nay faith im apt to believe him except her husband tattle tatt oh that scan what think you of that noble commoner mrs drab tatt pooh i know madam drab has made her brags in three or four places that i said this and that and writ to her and did i know not what but upon my reputation she did me wrong well well that was malice but i know the bottom of it she was bribed to that by one we all know a man too only to bring me into disgrace with a certain woman of quality scan whom we all know tatt no matter for that yes yes everybody knows no doubt ont everybody knows my secrets but i soon satisfied the lady of my innocence for i told her madam says i there are some persons who make it their business to tell stories and say this and that of one and tother and everything in the world and says i if your grace scan grace tatt o lord what have i said my unlucky tongue val ha ha ha scan why tattle thou hast more impudence than one can in reason expect i shall have an esteem for thee well and ha ha ha well go on and what did you say to her grace val i confess this is something extraordinary tatt not a word as i hope to be saved an errant lapsus linguae come lets talk of something else val well but how did you acquit yourself tatt pooh pooh nothing at all i only rallied with you a woman of ordinary rank was a little jealous of me and i told her something or other faith i know not what come lets talk of something else hums a song scan hang him let him alone he has a mind we should enquire tatt valentine i supped last night with your mistress and her uncle old foresight i think your father lies at foresights val yes tatt upon my soul angelicas a fine woman and so is mrs foresight and her sister mrs frail scan yes mrs frail is a very fine woman we all know her tatt oh that is not fair scan what tatt to tell scan to tell what why what do you know of mrs frail tatt who i upon honour i dont know whether she be man or woman but by the smoothness of her chin and roundness of her hips scan no tatt no scan she says otherwise tatt impossible scan yes faith ask valentine else tatt why then as i hope to be saved i believe a woman only obliges a man to secrecy that she may have the pleasure of telling herself scan no doubt ont well but has she done you wrong or no you have had her ha tatt though i have more honour than to tell first i have more manners than to contradict what a lady has declared scan well you own it tatt i am strangely surprised yes yes i cant denyt if she taxes me with it scan shell be here by and by she sees valentine every morning tatt how val she does me the favour i mean of a visit sometimes i did not think she had granted more to anybody scan nor i faith but tattle does not use to bely a lady it is contrary to his character how one may be deceived in a woman valentine tatt nay what do you mean gentlemen scan im resolved ill ask her tatt o barbarous why did you not tell me scan no you told us tatt and bid me ask valentine val what did i say i hope you wont bring me to confess an answer when you never asked me the question tatt but gentlemen this is the most inhuman proceeding val nay if you have known scandal thus long and cannot avoid such a palpable decoy as this was the ladies have a fine time whose reputations are in your keeping scene xii to them jeremy jere sir mrs frail has sent to know if you are stirring val show her up when she comes scene xiii valentine scandal tattle tatt ill be gone val youll meet her tatt is there not a back way val if there were you have more discretion than to give scandal such an advantage why your running away will prove all that he can tell her tatt scandal you will not be so ungenerous oh i shall lose my reputation of secrecy for ever i shall never be received but upon public days and my visits will never be admitted beyond a drawingroom i shall never see a bedchamber again never be locked in a closet nor run behind a screen or under a table never be distinguished among the waitingwomen by the name of trusty mr tattle more you will not be so cruel val scandal have pity on him hell yield to any conditions tatt any any terms scan come then sacrifice half a dozen women of good reputation to me presently come where are you familiar and see that they are women of quality too the first quality tatt tis very hard wont a baronets lady pass scan no nothing under a right honourable tatt oh inhuman you dont expect their names scan no their titles shall serve tatt alas thats the same thing pray spare me their titles ill describe their persons scan well begin then but take notice if you are so ill a painter that i cannot know the person by your picture of her you must be condemned like other bad painters to write the name at the bottom tatt well first then scene xiv to them mrs frail tatt oh unfortunate shes come already will you have patience till another time ill double the number scan well on that condition take heed you dont fail me mrs frail i shall get a fine reputation by coming to see fellows in a morning scandal you devil are you here too oh mr tattle everything is safe with you we know scan tattle tatt mum o madam you do me too much honour val well lady galloper how does angelica mrs frail angelica manners val what you will allow an absent lover mrs frail no ill allow a lover present with his mistress to be particular but otherwise i think his passion ought to give place to his manners val but what if he has more passion than manners mrs frail then let him marry and reform val marriage indeed may qualify the fury of his passion but it very rarely mends a mans manners mrs frail you are the most mistaken in the world there is no creature perfectly civil but a husband for in a little time he grows only rude to his wife and that is the highest good breeding for it begets his civility to other people well ill tell you news but i suppose you hear your brother benjamin is landed and my brother foresights daughter is come out of the country i assure you theres a match talked of by the old people well if he be but as great a seabeast as she is a landmonster we shall have a most amphibious breed the progeny will be all otters he has been bred at sea and she has never been out of the country val pox take em their conjunction bodes me no good im sure mrs frail now you talk of conjunction my brother foresight has cast both their nativities and prognosticates an admiral and an eminent justice of the peace to be the issue male of their two bodies tis the most superstitious old fool he would have persuaded me that this was an unlucky day and would not let me come abroad but i invented a dream and sent him to artimedorus for interpretation and so stole out to see you well and what will you give me now come i must have something val step into the next room and ill give you something scan ay well all give you something mrs frail well what will you all give me val mines a secret mrs frail i thought you would give me something that would be a trouble to you to keep val and scandal shall give you a good name mrs frail thats more than he has for himself and what will you give me mr tattle tatt i my soul madam mrs frail pooh no i thank you i have enough to do to take care of my own well but ill come and see you one of these mornings i hear you have a great many pictures tatt i have a pretty good collection at your service some originals scan hang him he has nothing but the seasons and the twelve caesars paltry copies and the five senses as illrepresented as they are in himself and he himself is the only original you will see there mrs frail ay but i hear he has a closet of beauties scan yes all that have done him favours if you will believe him mrs frail ay let me see those mr tattle tatt oh madam those are sacred to love and contemplation no man but the painter and myself was ever blest with the sight mrs frail well but a woman tatt nor woman till she consented to have her picture there too for then shes obliged to keep the secret scan no no come to me if youd see pictures mrs frail you scan yes faith i can shew you your own picture and most of your acquaintance to the life and as like as at knellers mrs frail o lying creature valentine does not he lie i cant believe a word he says val no indeed he speaks truth now for as tattle has pictures of all that have granted him favours he has the pictures of all that have refused him if satires descriptions characters and lampoons are pictures scan yes mine are most in black and white and yet there are some set out in their true colours both men and women i can shew you pride folly affectation wantonness inconstancy covetousness dissimulation malice and ignorance all in one piece then i can shew you lying foppery vanity cowardice bragging lechery impotence and ugliness in another piece and yet one of these is a celebrated beauty and tother a professed beau i have paintings too some pleasant enough mrs frail come lets hear em scan why i have a beau in a bagnio cupping for a complexion and sweating for a shape mrs frail so scan then i have a lady burning brandy in a cellar with a hackney coachman mrs frail o devil well but that story is not true scan i have some hieroglyphics too i have a lawyer with a hundred hands two heads and but one face a divine with two faces and one head and i have a soldier with his brains in his belly and his heart where his head should be mrs frail and no head scan no head mrs frail pooh this is all invention have you never a poet scan yes i have a poet weighing words and selling praise for praise and a critic picking his pocket i have another large piece too representing a school where there are huge proportioned critics with long wigs laced coats steinkirk cravats and terrible faces with catcalls in their hands and hornbooks about their necks i have many more of this kind very well painted as you shall see mrs frail well ill come if it be but to disprove you scene xiv to them jeremy jere sir heres the steward again from your father val ill come to him will you give me leave ill wait on you again presently mrs frail no ill be gone come who squires me to the exchange i must call my sister foresight there scan i will i have a mind to your sister mrs frail civil tatt i will because i have a tendre for your ladyship mrs frail thats somewhat the better reason to my opinion scan well if tattle entertains you i have the better opportunity to engage your sister val tell angelica i am about making hard conditions to come abroad and be at liberty to see her scan ill give an account of you and your proceedings if indiscretion be a sign of love you are the most a lover of anybody that i know you fancy that parting with your estate will help you to your mistress in my mind he is a thoughtless adventurer who hopes to purchase wealth by selling land or win a mistress with a losing hand act ii scene i a room in foresights house foresight and servant

recreation lord wheres the comfort of this life if we cant have the happiness of conversing where we like mrs fore but cant you converse at home i own it i think theres no happiness like conversing with an agreeable man i dont quarrel at that nor i dont think but your conversation was very innocent but the place is public and to be seen with a man in a hackney coach is scandalous what if anybody else should have seen you alight as i did how can anybody be happy while theyre in perpetual fear of being seen and censured besides it would not only reflect upon you sister but me mrs frail pooh heres a clutter why should it reflect upon you i dont doubt but you have thought yourself happy in a hackney coach before now if i had gone to knights bridge or to chelsea or to spring garden or barn elms with a man alone something might have been said mrs fore why was i ever in any of those places what do you mean sister mrs frail was i what do you mean mrs fore you have been at a worse place mrs

more charming than i speak you and like me for the beauty which i say you have as much as if i had it myself if i ask you to kiss me you must be angry but you must not refuse me if i ask you for more you must be more angry but more complying and as soon as ever i make you say youll cry out you must be sure to hold your tongue miss o lord i swear this is pure i like it better than our oldfashioned

told you that i loved you val but i can accuse you of uncertainty for not telling me whether you did or not ang you mistake indifference for uncertainty i never had concern enough to ask myself the question scan nor goodnature enough to answer him that did ask you ill say that for you madam ang what are you setting up for goodnature scan only for the affectation of it as the women do for illnature ang persuade your friend that it is all affectation scan i shall receive no benefit from the opinion for i know no effectual difference between continued affectation and reality tatt coming up scandal are you in private discourse anything of secrecy aside to scandal scan yes but i dare trust you we were talking of angelicas love to valentine you wont speak of it tatt no no not a syllable i know thats a secret for its whispered everywhere scan ha ha ha ang what is mr tattle i heard you say something was whispered everywhere scan your love of valentine ang how tatt no madam his love for your ladyship gad take me i beg your pardon for i never heard a word of your ladyships passion till this instant ang my passion and who told you of my passion pray sir scan why is the devil in you did not i tell it you for a secret tatt gadso but i thought she might have been trusted with her own affairs scan is that your discretion trust a woman with herself tatt you say true i beg your pardon ill bring all off it was impossible madam for me to imagine that a person of your ladyships wit and gallantry could have so long received the passionate addresses of the accomplished valentine and yet remain insensible therefore you will pardon me if from a just weight of his merit with your ladyships good judgment i formed the balance of a reciprocal affection val o the devil what damned costive poet has given thee this lesson of fustian to get by rote ang i dare swear you wrong him it is his own and mr tattle only judges of the success of others from the effects of his own merit for certainly mr tattle was never denied anything in his life tatt o lord yes indeed madam several times ang i swear i dont think tis possible tatt yes i vow and swear i have lord madam im the most unfortunate man in the world and the most cruelly used by the ladies ang nay now youre ungrateful tatt no i hope not tis as much ingratitude to own some favours as to conceal others val there now its out ang i dont understand you now i thought you had never asked anything but what a lady might modestly grant and you confess scan so faith your business is done here now you may go brag somewhere else tatt brag o heavens why did i name anybody ang no i suppose that is not in your power but you would if you could no doubt ont tatt not in my power madam what does your ladyship mean that i have no womans reputation in my power scan oons why you wont own it will you aside tatt faith madam youre in the right no more i have as i hope to be saved i never had it in my power to say anything to a ladys prejudice in my life for as i was telling you madam i have been the most unsuccessful creature living in things of that nature and never had the good fortune to be trusted once with a ladys secret not once ang no val not once i dare answer for him scan and ill answer for him for im sure if he had he would have told me i find madam you dont know mr tattle tatt no indeed madam you dont know me at all i find for sure my intimate friends would have known ang then it seems you would have told if you had been trusted tatt o pox scandal that was too far put never have told particulars madam perhaps i might have talked as of a third person or have introduced an amour of my own in conversation by way of novel but never have explained particulars ang but whence comes the reputation of mr tattles secrecy if he was never trusted scan why thence it arises the thing is proverbially spoken but may be applied to him as if we should say in general terms he only is secret who never was trusted a satirical proverb upon our sex theres another upon yours as she is chaste who was never asked the question thats all val a couple of very civil proverbs truly tis hard to tell whether the lady or mr tattle be the more obliged to you for you found her virtue upon the backwardness of the men and his secrecy upon the mistrust of the women tatt gad its very true madam i think we are obliged to acquit ourselves and for my part but your ladyship is to speak first ang am i well i freely confess i have resisted a great deal of temptation tatt and igad i have given some temptation that has not been resisted val good ang i cite valentine here to declare to the court how fruitless he has found his endeavours and to confess all his solicitations and my denials val i am ready to plead not guilty for you and guilty for myself scan so why this is fair heres demonstration with a witness tatt well my witnesses are not present but i confess i have had favours from persons but as the favours are numberless so the persons are nameless scan pooh this proves nothing tatt no i can show letters lockets pictures and rings and if there be occasion for witnesses i can summon the maids at the chocolatehouses all the porters at pall mall and covent garden the doorkeepers at the playhouse the drawers at lockets pontacks the rummer spring garden my own landlady and valet de chambre all who shall make oath that i receive more letters than the secretarys office and that i have more vizormasks to enquire for me than ever went to see the hermaphrodite or the naked prince and it is notorious that in a country church once an enquiry being made who i was it was answered i was the famous tattle who had ruined so many women val it was there i suppose you got the nickname of the great turk tatt true i was called turktattle all over the parish the next sunday all the old women kept their daughters at home and the parson had not half his congregation he would have brought me into the spiritual court but i was revenged upon him for he had a handsome daughter whom i initiated into the science but i repented it afterwards for it was talked of in town and a lady of quality that shall be nameless in a raging fit of jealousy came down in her coach and six horses and exposed herself upon my account gad i was sorry for it with all my heart you know whom i mean you know where we raffled scan mum tattle val sdeath are not you ashamed ang o barbarous i never heard so insolent a piece of vanity fie mr tattle ill swear i could not have believed it is this your secrecy tatt gadso the heat of my story carried me beyond my discretion as the heat of the ladys passion hurried her beyond her reputation but i hope you dont know whom i mean for there was a great many ladies raffled pox ont now could i bite off my tongue scan no dont for then youll tell us no more come ill recommend a song to you upon the hint of my two proverbs and i see one in the next room that will sing it goes to the door tatt for heavens sake if you do guess say nothing gad im very unfortunate scan pray sing the first song in the last new play song set by mr john eccles i a nymph and a swain to apollo once prayed the swain had been jilted the nymph been betrayed their intent was to try if his oracle knew eer a nymph that was chaste or a swain that was true ii apollo was mute and had

though twere to sea in a storm scene ix sir sampson and foresight sir samp i left em together here what are they gone bens a brisk boy he has got her into a corner fathers own son faith hell touzle her and mouzle her the rogues sharp set coming from sea if he should not stay for saving grace old foresight but fall to without the help of a parson ha odd if he should i could not be angry with him twould be but like me a chip of the old block ha thourt melancholic old prognostication as melancholic as if thou hadst spilt the salt or pared thy nails on a sunday come cheer up look about thee look up old stargazer now is he poring upon the ground for a crooked pin or an old horsenail with the head towards him fore sir sampson well have the wedding tomorrow morning sir samp with all my heart fore at ten aclock punctually at ten sir samp to a minute to a second thou shalt set thy watch and the bridegroom shall observe its motions they shall be married to a minute go to bed to a minute and when the alarm strikes they shall keep time like the figures of st dunstans clock and consummatum est shall ring all over the parish scene x to them scandal scan sir sampson sad news fore bless us sir samp why whats the matter scan cant you guess at what ought to afflict you and him and all of us more than anything else sir samp body o me i dont know any universal grievance but a new tax or the loss of the canary fleet unless popery should be landed in the west or the french fleet were at anchor at blackwall scan no undoubtedly mr foresight knew all this and might have prevented it fore tis no earthquake scan no not yet nor whirlwind but we dont know what it may come to but it has had a consequence already that touches us all sir samp why body o me out witht scan something has appeared to your son valentine hes gone to bed upont and very ill he speaks little yet he says he has a world to say asks for his father and the wise foresight talks of raymond lully and the ghost of lilly he has secrets to impart i suppose to you two i can get nothing out of him but sighs he desires he may see you in the morning but would not be disturbed tonight because he has some business to do in a dream sir samp hoity toity what have i to do with his dreams or his divination body o me this is a trick to defer signing the conveyance i warrant the devil will tell him in a dream that he must not part with his estate but ill bring him a parson to tell him that the devils a liar or if that wont do ill bring a lawyer that shall outlie the devil and so ill try whether my blackguard or his shall get the better of the day scene xi scandal foresight scan alas mr foresight im afraid all is not right you are a wise man and a conscientious man a searcher into obscurity and futurity and if you commit an error it is with a great deal of consideration and discretion and caution fore ah good mr scandal scan nay nay tis manifest i do not flatter you but sir sampson is hasty very hasty im afraid he is not scrupulous enough mr foresight he has been wicked and heavn grant he may mean well in his affair with you but my mind gives me these things cannot be wholly insignificant you are wise and should not be overreached methinks you should not fore alas mr scandal humanum est errare scan you say true man will err mere man will err but you are something more there have been wise men but they were such as you men who consulted the stars and were observers of omens solomon was wise but how by his judgment in astrology so says pineda in his third book and eighth chapter fore you are learned mr scandal scan a trifler but a lover of art and the wise men of the east owed their instruction to a star which is rightly observed by gregory the great in favour of astrology and albertus magnus makes it the most valuable science because says he it teaches us to consider the causation of causes in the causes of things fore i protest i honour you mr scandal i did not think you had been read in these matters few young men are inclined scan i thank my stars that have inclined me but i fear this marriage and making over this estate this transferring of a rightful inheritance will bring judgments upon us i prophesy it and i would not have the fate of cassandra not to be believed valentine is disturbed what can be the cause of that and sir sampson is hurried on by an unusual violence i fear he does not act wholly from himself methinks he does not look as he used to do fore he was always of an impetuous nature but as to this marriage i have consulted the stars and all appearances are prosperous scan come come mr foresight let not the prospect of worldly lucre carry you beyond your judgment nor against your conscience you are not satisfied that you act justly fore how scan you are not satisfied i say i am loth to discourage you but it is palpable that you are not satisfied fore how does it appear mr scandal i think i am very well satisfied scan either you suffer yourself to deceive yourself or you do not know yourself fore pray explain yourself scan do you sleep well o nights fore very well scan are you certain you do not look so fore i am in health i think scan so was valentine this morning and looked just so fore how am i altered any way i dont perceive it scan that may be but your beard is longer than it was two hours ago fore indeed bless me scene xii to them mrs foresight mrs fore husband will you go to bed its ten aclock mr scandal your servant scan pox on her she has interrupted my design but i must work her into the project you keep early hours madam

and she whisper my passion for you is grown so violent that i am no longer master of myself i was interrupted in the morning when you had charity enough to give me your attention and i had hopes of finding another opportunity of explaining myself to you but was disappointed all this day and the uneasiness that has attended me ever since brings me now hither at this unseasonable hour mrs fore was there ever such impudence to make love to me before my husbands face ill swear ill tell him scan do ill die a martyr rather than disclaim my passion but come a little farther this way and ill tell you what project i had to get him out of the way that i might have an opportunity of waiting upon you whisper foresight looking in the glass fore i do not see any revolution here methinks i look with a serene and benign aspect pale a little pale but the roses of these cheeks have been gathered many years ha i do not like that sudden flushing gone already hem hem hem faintish my heart is pretty good yet it beats and my pulses ha i have none mercy on me hum yes here they are gallop gallop gallop gallop gallop gallop hey whither will they hurry me now theyre gone again and now im faint again and

mr scandal indeed that would be a great comfort to me hem hem good night scene xiv scandal mrs foresight scan good night good mr foresight and i hope mars and venus will be in conjunction while your wife and i are together mrs fore well and what use do you hope to make of this project you dont think that you are ever like to succeed in your design upon me scan yes faith i do i have a better opinion both of you and myself than to despair mrs fore did you ever hear such a toad harkee devil do you think any woman honest scan yes several very honest theyll cheat a little at cards sometimes but thats nothing mrs fore pshaw but virtuous i mean scan yes faith i believe some women are virtuous too but tis as i believe some men are valiant through fear for why should a man court danger or a woman shun pleasure mrs fore oh monstrous what are conscience and honour scan why honour is a public enemy and conscience a domestic thief and he that would secure his pleasure must pay a tribute to one and go halves with tother as for honour that you have secured for you have purchased a perpetual opportunity for pleasure mrs fore an opportunity for pleasure scan ay your husband a husband is an opportunity for pleasure so you have taken care of honour and tis the least i can do to take care of conscience mrs fore and so you think we are free for one another scan yes faith i think so i love to speak my mind mrs fore why then ill speak my mind now as to this affair between you and me here you make love to me why ill confess it does not displease me your person is well enough and your understanding is not amiss scan i have no great opinion of myself but i think im neither deformed nor a fool mrs fore but you have a villainous character you are a libertine in speech as well as practice scan come i know what you would say you think it more dangerous to be seen in conversation with me than to allow some other men the last favour you mistake the liberty i take in talking is purely affected for the service of your sex he that first cries out stop thief is often he that has stoln the treasure i am a juggler that act by confederacy and if you please well put a trick upon the world mrs fore ay but you are such an universal juggler that im afraid you have a great many confederates scan faith im sound mrs fore oh fie ill swear youre impudent scan ill swear youre handsome mrs fore pish youd tell me so though you did not think so scan and youd think so though i should not tell you so and now i think we know one another pretty well mrs fore o lord whos here scene xv to them mrs frail and ben ben mess i love to speak my mind father has nothing to do with me nay i cant say that neither he has something to do with me but what does that signify if so be that i bent minded to be steered by him tis as thof he should strive against wind and tide mrs frail ay but my dear we must keep it secret till the estate be settled for you know marrying without an estate is like sailing in a ship without ballast ben he he he why thats true just so for all the world it is indeed as like as two cable ropes mrs frail and though i have a good portion you know one would not venture all in one bottom ben why thats true again for mayhap one bottom may spring a leak you have hit it indeed mess youve nicked the channel mrs frail well but if you should forsake me after all youd break my heart ben break your heart id rather the marygold should break her cable in a storm as well as i love her flesh you dont think im falsehearted like a landman a sailor will be honest thof mayhap he has never a penny of money in his pocket mayhap i may not have so fair a face as a citizen or a courtier but for all that ive as good blood in my veins and a heart as sound as a biscuit mrs frail and will you love me always ben nay an i love once ill stick like pitch ill tell you that come ill sing you a song of a sailor mrs frail hold theres my sister ill call her to hear it mrs fore well i wont go to bed to my husband tonight because ill retire to my own chamber and think of what you have said scan well youll give me leave to wait upon you to your chamber door and leave you my last instructions mrs fore hold heres my sister coming towards us mrs frail if it wont interrupt you ill entertain you with a song ben the song was made upon one of our shipscrews wife our boatswain made the song mayhap you may know her sir before she was married she was called buxom joan of deptford scan i have heard of her ben sings ballad set by mr john eccles i a soldier and a sailor a tinker and a tailor had once a doubtful strife sir to make a maid a wife sir whose name was buxom joan for now the time was ended when she no more intended to lick her lips at men sir and gnaw the sheets in vain sir and lie o nights alone ii the soldier swore like thunder he loved her more than plunder and shewed her many a scar sir that he had brought from far sir with fighting for her sake the tailor thought to please her with offering her his measure the tinker too with mettle said he could mend her kettle and stop up evry leak iii but while these three were prating the sailor slyly waiting thought if it came about sir that they should all fall out sir he then might play his part and just een as he meant sir to loggerheads they went sir and then he let fly at her a shot twixt wind and water that won this fair maids heart ben if some of our crew that came to see me are not gone you shall see that we sailors can dance sometimes as well as other folks whistles i warrant that brings em an they be within hearing enter seamen oh here they be and fiddles along with em come my lads lets have a round and ill make one dance ben were merry folks we sailors we hant much to care for thus we live at sea eat biscuit and drink flip put on a clean shirt once a quarter come home and lie with our landladies once a year get rid of a little money and then put off with the next fair wind how dye like us mrs frail oh you are the happiest merriest men alive mrs fore were beholden to mr benjamin for this entertainment i believe its late ben why forsooth an you think so you had best go to bed for my part i mean to toss a can and remember my sweetheart afore i turn in mayhap i may dream of her mrs fore mr scandal you had best go to bed and dream too scan why faith i have a good lively imagination and can dream as much to the purpose as another if i set about it but dreaming is the poor retreat of a lazy hopeless and imperfect lover tis the last glimpse of love to wornout sinners and the faint dawning of a bliss to wishing girls and growing boys theres nought but willing waking love that can make blest the ripened maid and finished man act iv scene i valentines lodging scandal and jeremy scan well is your master ready does he look madly and talk madly jere yes sir you need make no great doubt of that he that was so near turning poet yesterday morning cant be much to seek in playing the madman today scan would he have angelica acquainted with the reason of his design jere no sir not yet he has a mind to try whether his playing the madman wont make her play the fool and fall in love with him or at least own that she has loved him all this while and concealed it scan i saw her take coach just now with her maid and think i heard her bid the coachman drive hither jere like enough sir for i told her maid this morning my master was run stark mad only for love of her mistress i hear a coach stop if it should be she sir i believe he would not see her till he hears how she takes it scan well ill try her tis she here she comes scene ii to them angelica with jenny ang mr scandal i suppose you dont think it a novelty to see a woman visit a man at his own lodgings in a morning scan not upon a kind occasion madam but when a lady comes tyrannically to insult a ruined lover and make manifest the cruel triumphs of her beauty the barbarity of it something surprises me ang i dont like raillery from a serious face pray tell me what is the matter jere no strange matter madam my masters mad thats all i suppose your ladyship has thought him so a great while ang how dye mean mad jere why faith madam hes mad for want of his wits just as he was poor for want of money his head is een as light as his pockets and anybody that has a mind to a bad bargain cant do better than to beg him for his estate ang if you speak truth your endeavouring at wit is very unseasonable scan shes concerned and loves him aside ang mr scandal you cant think me guilty of so much inhumanity as not to be concerned for a man i must own myself obliged to pray tell me truth scan faith madam i wish telling a lie would mend the matter but this is no new effect of an unsuccessful passion ang aside i know not what to think yet i should be vexed to have a trick put upon me may i not see him scan im afraid the physician is not willing you should see him yet jeremy go in and enquire scene iii scandal angelica jenny ang ha i saw him wink and smile i fancy tis a trick ill try i would disguise to all the world a failing which i must own to you i fear my happiness depends upon the recovery of valentine therefore i conjure you as you are his friend and as you have compassion upon one fearful of affliction to tell me what i am to hope for i cannot speak but you may tell me tell me for you know what i would ask scan so this is pretty plain be not too much concerned madam i hope his condition is not desperate an acknowledgment of love from you perhaps may work a cure as the fear of your aversion occasioned his distemper ang aside say you so nay then im convinced and if i dont play trick for trick may i never taste the pleasure of revenge acknowledgment of love i find you have mistaken my compassion and think me guilty of a weakness i am a stranger to but i have too much sincerity to deceive you and too much charity to suffer him to be deluded with vain hopes good nature and humanity oblige me to be concerned for him but to love is neither in my power nor inclination and if he cant be cured without i suck the poison from his wounds im afraid he wont recover his senses till i lose mine scan hey brave woman ifaith wont you see him then if he desire it ang what signify a madmans desires besides twould make me uneasy if i dont see him perhaps my concern for him may lessen if i forget him tis no more than he has done by himself and now the surprise is over methinks i am not half so sorry as i was scan so faith good nature works apace you were confessing just now an obligation to his love ang but i have considered that passions are unreasonable and involuntary if he loves he cant help it and if i dont love i cant help it no more than he can help his being a man or i my being a woman or no more than i can help my want of inclination to stay longer here come jenny scene iv scandal jeremy scan humh an admirable composition faith this same womankind jere what is she gone sir scan gone why she was never here nor anywhere else nor i dont know her if i see her nor you neither jere good lack whats the matter now are any more of us to be mad

master in the meantime if our project succeed no better with his father than it does with his mistress he may descend from his exaltation of madness into the road of common sense and be content only to be made a fool with other reasonable people i hear sir sampson you know your cue ill to your master scene v jeremy sir sampson legend with a lawyer sir samp dye see mr buckram heres the paper

secret ang do you know me valentine val oh very well ang who am i val youre a woman one to whom heavn gave beauty when it grafted roses on a briar you are the reflection of heavn in a pond and he that leaps at you is sunk you are all white a sheet of lovely spotless paper when you first are born but you are to be scrawled and blotted by every gooses quill i know you for i loved a woman and loved her so long that i found out a strange thing i found out what a woman was good for tatt ay prithee whats that val why to keep a secret tatt o lord val oh exceeding good to keep a secret for though she should tell yet she is not to be believed tatt hah good again faith val i would have music sing me the song that i like song set by mr finger i tell thee charmion could i time retrieve and could again begin to love and live to you i should my earliest offring give i know my eyes would lead my heart to you and i should all my vows and oaths renew but to be plain i never would be true ii for by our weak and weary truth i find love hates to centre in a point assignd but runs with joy the circle of the mind then never let us chain what should be free but for relief of either sex agree since women love to change and so do we no more for i am melancholy walks musing jere ill dot sir to scandal scan mr foresight we had best leave him he may grow outrageous and do mischief fore i will be directed by you jere to mrs frail youll meet madam ill take care everything shall be ready mrs frail thou shalt do what thou wilt in short i will deny thee nothing tatt madam shall i wait upon you to angelica

honour mrs fore mr tattle might have used less ceremony scene xvii angelica valentine scandal scan jeremy follow tattle ang mr scandal i only stay till my maid comes and because i had a mind to be rid of mr tattle scan madam i am very glad that i overheard a better reason which you gave to mr tattle for his impertinence forced you to acknowledge a kindness for valentine which you denied to all his sufferings and my solicitations so ill leave him to make use of the discovery and your ladyship to the free confession of your inclinations ang o heavns you wont leave me alone with a madman scan no madam i only leave a madman to his remedy scene xviii angelica valentine val madam you need not be very much afraid for i fancy i begin to come to myself ang ay but if i dont fit you ill be hanged aside val you see what disguises love makes us put on gods have been in counterfeited shapes for the same reason and the divine part of me my mind has worn this mask of madness and this motley livery only as the slave of love and menial creature of your beauty ang mercy on me how he talks poor valentine val nay faith now let us understand one another hypocrisy apart the comedy draws toward an end and let us think of leaving acting and be ourselves and since you have loved me you must own i have at length deserved you should confess it ang sighs i would i had loved you for heavn knows i pity you and could i have foreseen the bad effects i would have striven but thats too late sighs val what sad effects whats too late my seeming madness has deceived my father and procured me time to think of means to reconcile me to him and preserve the right of my inheritance to his estate which otherwise by articles i must this morning have resigned and this i had informed you of today but you were gone before i knew you had been here ang how i thought your love of me had caused this transport in your soul which it seems you only counterfeited for mercenary ends and sordid interest val nay now you do me wrong for if any interest was considered it was yours since i thought i wanted more than love to make me worthy of you ang then you thought me mercenary but how am i deluded by this interval of sense to reason with a madman val oh tis barbarous to misunderstand me longer scene xix to them jeremy ang oh heres a reasonable creature sure he will not have the impudence to persevere come jeremy acknowledge your trick and confess your masters madness counterfeit jere counterfeit madam ill maintain him to be as absolutely and substantially mad as any freeholder in bethlehem nay hes as mad as any projector fanatic chymist lover or poet in europe val sirrah you be i am not mad ang ha ha ha you see he denies it jere o lord madam did you ever know any madman mad enough to own it val sot cant you apprehend ang why he talked very sensibly just now jere yes madam he has intervals but you see he begins to look wild again now val why you thickskulled rascal i tell you the farce is done and i will be mad no longer beats him ang ha ha ha is he mad or no jeremy jere partly i think for he does not know his own mind two hours im sure i left him just now in the humour to be mad and i think i have not found him very quiet at this present whos there one knocks val go see you sot im very glad that i can move your mirth though not your compassion ang i did not think you had apprehension enough to be exceptions but madmen show themselves most by overpretending to a sound understanding as drunken men do by overacting sobriety i was half inclining to believe you till i accidently touched upon your tender part but now you have restored me to my former opinion and compassion jere sir your father has sent to know if you are any better yet will you please to be mad sir or how val stupidity you know the penalty of all im worth must pay for the confession of my senses im mad and will be mad to everybody but this lady jere so just the very backside of truth but lying is a figure in speech that interlards the greatest part of my conversation madam your ladyships woman scene xx valentine angelica jenny ang well have you been there come hither jenny yes madam sir sampson will wait upon you presently aside to angelica val you are not leaving me in this uncertainty ang would anything but a madman complain of uncertainty uncertainty and expectation are the joys of life security is an insipid thing and the overtaking and possessing of a wish discovers the folly of the chase never let us know one another better for the pleasure of a masquerade is done when we come to show our faces but ill tell you two things before i leave you i am not the fool you take me for and you are mad and dont know it scene xxi valentine jeremy val from a riddle you can expect nothing but a riddle theres my instruction and the moral of my lesson jere what is the lady gone again sir i hope you understood one another before she went val understood she is harder to be understood than a piece of egyptian antiquity or an irish manuscript you may pore till you spoil your eyes and not improve your knowledge jere i have heard em say sir they read hard hebrew books backwards maybe you begin to read at the wrong end val they say so of a witchs prayer and dreams and dutch almanacs are to be understood by contraries but theres regularity and method in that she is a medal without a reverse or inscription for indifference has both sides alike yet while she does not seem to hate me i will pursue her and know her if it be possible in spite of the opinion of my satirical friend scandal who says that women are like tricks by sleight of hand which to admire we should not understand act v scene i a room in foresights house angelica and jenny ang where is sir sampson did you not tell me he would be here before me jenny hes at the great glass in the diningroom madam setting his cravat and wig ang how im glad ont if he has a mind i should like him its a sign he likes me and thats more than half my design jenny i hear him madam ang leave me and dye hear if valentine should come or send i am not to be spoken with scene ii angelica sir sampson sir samp i have not been honoured with the commands of a fair lady a great while odd madam you have revived me not since i was fiveandthirty ang why you have no great reason to complain sir sampson that is not long ago sir samp zooks but it is madam a very great while to a man that admires a fine woman as much as i do ang youre an absolute courtier sir sampson sir samp not at all madam odsbud you wrong me i am not so old neither to be a bare courtier only a man of words odd i have warm blood about me yet and can serve a lady any way come come let me tell you you women think a man old too soon faith and troth you do come dont despise fifty odd fifty in a hale constitution is no such contemptible age ang fifty a contemptible age not at all a very fashionable age i think i assure you i know very considerable beaus that set a good face upon fifty fifty i have seen fifty in a side box by candlelight outblossom fiveandtwenty sir samp outsides outsides a pize take em mere outsides hang your sidebox beaus no im none of those none of your forced trees that pretend to blossom in the fall and bud when they should bring forth fruit i am of a longlived race and inherit vigour none of my ancestors married till fifty yet they begot sons and daughters till fourscore i am of your patriarchs i a branch of one of your antedeluvian families fellows that the flood could not wash away well madam what are your commands has any young rogue affronted you and shall i cut his throat or ang no sir sampson i have no quarrel upon my hands i have more occasion for your conduct than your courage at this time to tell you the truth im weary of living single and want a husband sir samp odsbud and tis pity you should odd would she would like me then i should hamper my young rogues odd would she would faith and troth shes devilish handsome aside madam you deserve a good husband and twere pity you should be thrown away upon any of these young idle rogues about the town odd theres neer a young fellow worth hanging that is a very young fellow pize on em they never think beforehand of anything and if they commit matrimony tis as they commit murder out of a frolic and are ready to hang themselves or to be hanged by the law the next morning odso have a care madam ang therefore i ask your advice sir sampson i have fortune enough to make any man easy that i can like if there were such a thing as a young agreeable man with a reasonable stock of good nature and sense for i would neither have an absolute wit nor a fool sir samp odd you are hard to please madam to find a young fellow that is neither a wit in his own eye nor a fool in the eye of the world is a very hard task but faith and troth you speak very discreetly for i hate both a wit and a fool ang she that marries a fool sir sampson forfeits the reputation of her honesty or understanding and she that marries a very witty man is a slave to the severity and insolent conduct of her husband i should like a man of wit for a lover because i would have such an one in my power but i would no more be his wife than his enemy for his malice is not a more terrible consequence of his aversion than his jealousy is of his love sir samp none of old foresights sibyls ever uttered such a truth odsbud you have won my heart i hate a wit i had a son that was spoiled among em a good hopeful lad till he learned to be a wit and might have risen in the state but a pox ont his wit run him out of his money and now his poverty has run him out of his wits ang sir sampson as your friend i must tell you you are very much abused in that matter hes no more mad than you are sir samp how madam would i could prove it ang i can tell you how that may be done but it is a thing that would make me appear to be too much concerned in your affairs sir samp odsbud i believe she likes me aside ah madam all my affairs are scarce worthy to be laid at your feet and i wish madam they were in a better posture that i might make a more becoming offer to a lady of your incomparable beauty and merit if i had peru in one hand and mexico in tother and the eastern empire under my feet it would make me only a more glorious victim to be offered at the shrine of your beauty ang bless me sir sampson whats the matter sir samp odd madam i love you and if you would take my advice in a husband ang hold hold sir sampson i asked your advice for a husband and you are giving me your consent i was indeed thinking to propose something like it in jest to satisfy you about valentine for if a match were seemingly carried on between you and me it would oblige him to throw off his disguise of madness in apprehension of losing me for you know he has long pretended a passion for me sir samp gadzooks a most ingenious contrivance if we were to go through with it but why must the match only be seemingly carried on odd let it be a real contract ang oh fie sir sampson what would the world say sir samp say they would say you were a wise woman and i a happy man odd madam ill love you as long as i live and leave you a good jointure when i die ang ay but that is not in your power sir sampson for when valentine confesses himself in his senses he must make over his inheritance to his younger brother sir samp odd youre cunning a wary baggage faith and troth i like you the better but i warrant you i have a proviso in the obligation in favour of myself body o me i have a trick to turn the settlement upon the issue male of our two bodies begotten odsbud let us find children and ill find an estate ang will you well do you find the estate and leave tother to me sir samp o rogue but ill trust you and will you consent is it a match then ang let me consult my lawyer concerning this obligation and if i find what you propose practicable ill give you my answer sir samp with all my heart come in with me and ill lend you the bond you shall consult your lawyer and ill consult a parson odzooks im a young man odzooks im a young man and ill make it appear odd youre devilish handsome faith and troth youre very handsome and im very young and very lusty odsbud hussy you know how to choose and so do i odd i think we are very well met give me your hand odd let me kiss it tis as warm and as soft as what odd as tother hand give me tother hand and ill mumble em and kiss em till they melt in my mouth ang hold sir sampson youre profuse of your vigour before your time youll spend your estate before you come to it sir samp no no only give you a rentroll of my possessions ah baggage i warrant you for little sampson odd sampsons a very good name for an able fellow your sampsons were strong dogs from the beginning ang have a care and dont overact your part if you remember sampson the strongest of the name pulled an old house over his head at last sir samp say you so hussy come lets go then odd i long to be pulling too come away odso heres somebody coming scene iii tattle jeremy tatt is not that she gone out just now jere ay sir shes just going to the place of appointment ah sir if you are not very faithful and close in this business youll certainly be the death of a person that has a most extraordinary passion for your honours service tatt ay whos that jere even my unworthy self sir sir i have had an appetite to be fed with your commands a great while and now sir my former master having much troubled the fountain of his understanding it is a very plausible occasion for me to quench my thirst at the spring of your bounty i thought i could not recommend myself better to you sir than by the delivery of a great beauty and fortune into your arms whom i have heard you sigh for tatt ill make thy fortune say no more thou art a pretty fellow and canst carry a message to a lady in a pretty soft kind of phrase and with a good persuading accent jere sir i have the seeds of rhetoric and oratory in my head i have been at cambridge tatt ay tis well enough for a servant to be bred at an university but the education is a little too pedantic for a gentleman i hope you are secret in your nature private close ha jere oh sir for that sir tis my chief talent im as secret as the head of nilus tatt ay whos he though a privy counsellor jere o ignorance aside a cunning egyptian sir that with his arms would overrun the country yet nobody could ever find out his headquarters tatt close dog a good whoremaster i warrant him the time draws nigh jeremy angelica will be veiled like a nun and i must be hooded like a friar ha jeremy jere ay sir hooded like a hawk to seize at first sight upon the quarry it is the whim of my masters madness to be so dressed and she is so in love with him shell comply with anything to please him poor lady im sure shell have reason to pray for me when she finds what a happy exchange she has made between a madman and so accomplished a gentleman tatt ay faith so she will jeremy youre a good friend to her poor creature i swear i do it hardly so much in consideration of myself as compassion to her jere tis an act of charity sir to save a fine woman with thirty thousand pound from throwing herself away tatt so tis faith i might have saved several others in my time but igad i could never find in my heart to marry anybody before jere well sir ill go and tell her my masters coming and meet you in half a quarter of an hour with your disguise at your own lodgings you must talk a little madly she wont distinguish the tone of your voice tatt no no let me alone for a counterfeit ill be ready for you scene iv tattle miss prue miss o mr tattle are you here im glad i have found you i have

obvious to vulgar eyes that are indications of a sudden turn of good fortune in the lottery of wives and promise a great beauty and great fortune reserved alone for me by a private intrigue of destiny kept secret from the piercing eye of perspicuity from all astrologers and the stars themselves fore how i will make it appear that what you say is impossible tatt sir i beg your pardon im in haste

deed sir val but where is the bond by which i am obliged to sign this buck sir sampson you have it ang no i have it and ill use it as i would everything that is an enemy to valentine tears the paper sir samp how now val ha ang had i the world to give you it could not make me worthy of so generous and faithful a passion heres my hand my heart was always yours and struggled very hard to make this

again father you and i may make a voyage together now ang well sir sampson since i have played you a trick ill advise you how you may avoid such another learn to be a good father or youll never get a second wife i always loved your son and hated your unforgiving nature i was resolved to try him to the utmost i have tried you too and know you both you have not more faults than he has virtues and tis hardly more pleasure to me that i can make him and myself happy than that i can punish you val if my happiness could receive addition this kind surprise would make it double sir samp oons youre a crocodile fore really sir sampson this is a sudden eclipse sir samp youre an illiterate old fool and im another tatt if the gentleman is in disorder for want of a wife i can spare him mine oh are you there sir im indebted to you for my happiness to jeremy jere sir i ask you ten thousand pardons twas an errant mistake you see sir my master was never mad nor anything like it then how could it be otherwise val tattle i thank you you would have interposed between me and heaven but providence laid purgatory in your way you have but justice scan i hear the fiddles that sir sampson provided for his own wedding methinks tis pity they should not be employed when the match is so much mended valentine though it be morning we may have a dance val anything my friend everything that looks like joy and transport scan call em jeremy ang i have done dissembling now valentine and if that coldness which i have always worn before you should turn to an extreme fondness you must not suspect it val ill prevent that suspicion for i intend to dote to that immoderate degree that your fondness shall never distinguish itself enough to be taken notice of if ever you seem to love too much it must be only when i cant love enough ang have a care of promises you know you are apt to run more in debt than you are able to pay val therefore i yield my body as your prisoner and make your best ont scan the music stays for you dance scan well madam you have done exemplary justice in punishing an inhuman father and rewarding a faithful lover but there is a third good work which i in particular must thank you for i was an infidel to your sex and you have converted me for now i am convinced that all women are not like fortune blind in bestowing favours either on those who do not merit or who do not want em ang tis an unreasonable accusation that you lay upon our sex you tax us with injustice only to cover your own want of merit you would all have the reward of love but few have the constancy to stay till it becomes your due men are generally hypocrites and infidels they pretend to worship but have neither zeal nor faith how few like valentine would persevere even to martyrdom and sacrifice their interest to their constancy in admiring me you misplace the novelty the miracle today is that we find a lover true not that a womans kind
