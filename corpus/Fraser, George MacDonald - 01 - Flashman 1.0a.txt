flashman what happened to flashman the caddish bully of tom browns schooldays after he was expelled in drunken disgrace from rugby school in the late s what kind of man grew out of the foulmouthed swaggering cowardly toady who roasted fags for fun and howled when he was beaten himself for more than a century the fate of historys most notorious schoolboy remained a mystery until in george macdonald fraser decided to discover a vast collection of unpublished manuscripts in a midland saleroom since then the scandalous saga of flashman victorian hero and scoundrel has emerged in a series of bestselling memoirs in which the archcad reviews from the safety of old age his exploits in bed and battle george macdonald fraser served in a highland regiment in india and the middle east worked on newspapers in britain and canada and has written nine other flashman novels and numerous films most notably the three musketeers the four musketeers and the james bond film octopussy by the same

harpercollinspublishers harpercollinspublishers fulham palace road hammersmith london w jb this paperback edition previously published in paperback by fontana reprinted three times first published in great britain by herbert jenkins ltd reissued by collins reprinted by collins harvill for kath explanatory note the great mass of manuscript known as the flashman papers was discovered during a sale of household furniture at ashby leicestershire in the papers were subsequently claimed by mr paget morrison of durban south africa the nearest known living relative of their author a point of major literary interest about the papers is that they clearly identify flashman the school bully of thomas hughes tom browns schooldays with the celebrated victorian soldier of the same name the papers are in fact harry flashmans personal memoirs from the day of his expulsion from rugby school in the late s to the early years of the present century he appears to have written them some time between and when he must have been over eighty it is possible that he dictated them the papers which had apparently lain untouched for fifty years in a tea chest until they were found in the ashby saleroom were carefully wrapped in oilskin covers from correspondence found in the first packet it is evident that their original discovery by his relatives in after the great soldiers death caused considerable consternation they seem to have been unanimously against publication of their kinsmans autobiography one can readily understand why and the only wonder is that the manuscript was not destroyed fortunately it was preserved and what follows is the content of the first packet covering flashmans early adventures i have no reason to doubt that it is a completely truthful account where flashman touches on historical fact he is almost invariably accurate and readers can judge whether he is to be believed or not on more personal matters mr paget morrison knowing of my interest in this and related subjects asked me to edit the papers beyond correcting some minor spelling errors however there has been no editing to do flashman had a better sense of narrative than i have and i have confined myself to the addition of a few historical notes the quotation from tom browns schooldays was pasted to the top page of the first packet it had evidently been cut from the original edition of g m f one fine summer evening flashman had been regaling himself on ginpunch at brownsover and having exceeded his usual limits started home uproarious he fell in with a friend or two coming back from bathing proposed a glass of beer to which they assented the weather being hot and they thirsty souls and unaware of the quantity of drink which flashman had already on board the short result was that flashy became beastly drunk they tried to get him along but couldnt so they chartered a hurdle and two men to carry him one of the masters came upon them and they naturally enough fled the flight of the rest excited the masters suspicions and the good angel of the fags incited him to examine the freight and after examination to convoy the hurdle himself up to the schoolhouse and the doctor who had long had his eye on flashman arranged for his withdrawal next morning thomas hughes tom browns schooldays hughes got it wrong in one important detail you will have read in tom brown how i was expelled from rugby school for drunkenness which is true enough but when hughes alleges that this was the result of my deliberately pouring beer on top of ginpunch he is in error i knew better than to mix my drinks even at seventeen i mention this not in selfdefence but in the interests of strict truth this story will be completely truthful i am breaking the habit of eighty years why shouldnt i when a man is as old as i am and knows himself thoroughly for what he was and is he doesnt care much im not ashamed you see never was and i have enough on what society would consider the credit side of the ledger a knighthood a victoria cross high rank and some popular fame so i can look at the picture above my desk of the young officer in cardigans hussars tall masterful and roughly handsome i was in those days and say that it is the portrait of a scoundrel a liar a cheat a thief a coward and oh yes a toady hughes said more or less all these things and his description was pretty fair except in matters of detail such as the one ive mentioned but he was more concerned to preach a sermon than to give facts but i am concerned with facts and since many of them are discreditable to me you can rest assured they are true at all events hughes was wrong in saying i suggested beer it was speedicut who ordered it up and i had drunk it before i knew what i was properly doing that finished me i was really drunk then beastly drunk says hughes and hes right and when they got me out of the grapes i could hardly see let alone walk they bundled me into a sedan and then a beak hove in sight and speedicut lived up to his name and bolted i was left sprawling in the chair and up came the master and saw me it was old rufton one of arnolds housemasters good god he said its one of our boys drunk i can still see him goggling at me with his great pale gooseberry eyes and white whiskers he tried to rouse me but he might as well have tried to wake a corpse i just lay and giggled at him finally he lost his temper and banged the top of the chair with his cane and shouted take him up chairmen take him to the school he shall go before the doctor for this so they bore me off in procession with old rufton raging behind about disgusting excesses and the wages of sin and old thomas and the chairmen took me to the hospital which was appropriate and left me on a bed to sober up it didnt take me long i can tell you as soon as my mind was clear enough to think what would come of it you know what arnold was like if you have read hughes and he had no use for me at the best of times the least i could expect was a flogging before the school that was enough to set me in a blue funk at the very thought but what i was really afraid of was arnold himself they left me in the hospital perhaps two hours and then old thomas came to say the doctor wanted to see me i followed him downstairs and across to the schoolhouse with the fags peeping round corners and telling each other that the brute flashy had fallen at last and old thomas knocked at the doctors door and the voice crying come in sounded like the crack of doom to me he was standing before the fireplace with his hands behind looping up his coattails and a face like a turk at a christening he had eyes like sabrepoints and his face was pale and carried that disgusted look that he kept for these occasions even with the liquor still working on me a little i was as scared in that minute as ive ever been in my life and when you have ridden into a russian battery at balaclava and been chained in an afghan dungeon waiting for the torturers as i have you know what fear means i still feel uneasy when i think of him and hes been dead sixty years he was live enough then he stood silent a moment to let me stew a little then flashman says he there are many moments in a schoolmasters life when he must make a decision and afterwards wonder whether he was right or not i have made a decision and for once i am in no doubt that i am right i have observed you for several years now with increasing concern you have been an evil influence in the school that you are a bully i know that you are untruthful i have long suspected that you are deceitful and mean i have feared but that you had fallen so low as to be a drunkard that at least i never imagined i have looked in the past for some signs of improvement in you some spark of grace some ray of hope that my work here had not in your case been unsuccessful it has not come and this is the final infamy have you anything to say he had me blubbering by this time i mumbled something about being sorry if i thought for one moment says he that you were sorry that you had it in you to show true repentance i might hesitate from the step that i am about to take but i know you too well flashman you must leave rugby tomorrow if i had had my wits about me i suppose i should have thought this was no bad news but with arnold thundering i lost my head but sir i said still blubbering it will break my mothers heart he went pale as a ghost and i fell back i thought he was going to hit me blasphemous wretch he cried he had a great pulpit trick with phrases like those your mother has been dead these many years and do you dare to plead her name a name that should be sacred to you in defence of your abominations you have killed any spark of pity i had for you my father your father says he will know how to deal with you i hardly think he added with a look that his heart will be broken he knew something of my father you see and probably thought we were a pretty pair he stood there drumming his fingers behind him a moment and then he said in a different voice you are a sorry creature flashman i have failed in you but even to you i must say this is not the end you cannot continue here but you are young flashman and there is time yet though your sins be as red as crimson yet shall they be as white as snow you have fallen very low but you can be raised up again i havent a good memory for sermons and he went on like this for some time like the pious old hypocrite that he was for he was a hypocrite i think like most of his generation either that or he was more foolish than he looked for he was wasting his piety on me but he never realised it anyway he gave me a fine holy harangue about how through repentance i might be saved which ive never believed by the way ive repented a good deal in my time and had good cause but i was never ass enough to suppose it mended anything but ive learned to swim with the tide when i have to so i let him pray over me and when he had finished i left his study a good deal happier than when i went in i had escaped flogging which was the main thing leaving rugby i didnt mind a button i never much cared for the place and the supposed disgrace of expulsion i didnt even think about i left the school next morning in the gig with my box on top and they were damned glad to see me go i expect certainly the fags were id given them toco in my time and who should be at the gate but the bold scud east he even offered me his hand im sorry flashman he said i asked him what he had to be sorry for and damned his impudence sorry youre being expelled says he youre a liar says i and damn your sorrow too he looked at me and then turned on his heel and walked off but i know now that i misjudged him then he was sorry heaven knows why hed no cause to love me and if i had been him id have been throwing my cap in the air and hurrahing but he was soft one of arnolds sturdy fools manly little chaps of course and full of virtue the kind that schoolmasters love yes he was a fool then and a fool twenty years later when he died in the dust at cawnpore with a sepoys bayonet in his back honest scud east that was all that his gallant goodness did for him i didnt linger on the way home i knew my father was in london and i wanted to get over as soon as i could the painful business of telling him i had been kicked out of rugby so i decided to ride to town letting my bags follow and hired a horse accordingly at the george i am one of those who rode as soon as he walked indeed horsemanship and my trick of picking up foreign tongues have been the only things in which you could say i was born gifted and very useful they have been so i rode to town puzzling over how my father would take the good news he was an odd fish the guvnor and he and i had always been wary of each other he was a nabobs grandson you see old jack flashman having made a fortune in america out of slaves and rum and piracy too i shouldnt wonder and buying the place in leicestershire where we have lived ever since but for all their moneybags the flashmans were never the thing the coarse streak showed through generation after generation like dung beneath a rosebush as greville said in other words while other nabob families tried to make themselves pass for quality ours didnt because we couldnt my own father was the first to marry well for my mother was related to the pagets who as everyone knows sit on the right hand of god as a consequence he kept an eye on me to see if i gave myself airs before mother died he never saw much of me being too busy at the clubs or in the house or hunting foxes sometimes but women mostly but after that he had to take some interest in his heir and we grew to know and mistrust each other he was a decent enough fellow in his way i suppose pretty rough and with the devils own temper but well enough liked in his set which was countrysquire with enough money to pass in the west end he enjoyed some lingering fame through having gone a number of rounds with cribb in his youth though its my belief that champion tom went easy with him because of his cash he lived half in town half in country now and kept an expensive house but he was out of politics having been sent to the knackers yard at reform he was still occupied though what with brandy and the tables and hunting both kinds i was feeling pretty uneasy then when i ran up the steps and hammered on the front door oswald the butler raised a great cry when he saw who it was because it was nowhere near the end of the half and this brought other servants they scented scandal no doubt my fathers home i asked giving oswald my coat and straightening my neckcloth your father to be sure mr harry cried oswald all smiles in the saloon this minute he threw open the door and cried out mr harrys home sir my father had been sprawled on a settee but he jumped up when he saw me he had a glass in his hand and his face was flushed but since both those things were usual it was hard to say whether he was drunk or not he stared at me and then greeted the prodigal with what the hell are you doing here at most times this kind of welcome would have taken me aback but not now there was a woman in the room and she distracted my attention she was a tall handsome hussylooking piece with brown hair piled up on her head and a comeandcatchme look in her eye this is the new one i thought for you got used to his string of madames they changed as fast as the sentries at st james she was looking at me with a lazy halfamused smile that sent a shiver up my back at the same time as it made me conscious of the schoolboy cut of my clothes but it stiffened me too all in an instant so that i answered his question pat ive been expelled i said as cool as i could expelled dye mean thrown out what the devil for sir drunkenness mainly mainly good god he was going purple he looked from the woman back to me as though seeking enlightenment she seemed much amused by it but seeing the old fellow in danger of explosion i made haste to explain what had happened i was truthful enough except that i made rather more of my interview with arnold than was the case to hear me you would suppose i had given as good as i got seeing the female eyeing me i acted pretty offhand which was risky perhaps with the guvnor in his present mood but to my surprise he took it pretty well he had never liked arnold of course well im damned he said when i had finished and poured himself another glass he wasnt grinning but his brow had cleared you young dog a pretty state of things indeed expelled in disgrace by gad did he flog you no id have had the hide off your back perhaps i will damme but he was smiling now a bit sour though what dyou make of this judy he said to the woman i take it this is a relative she says letting her fan droop towards me she had a deep husky voice and i shivered again relative eh oh dammit its my son harry girl harry this is judy er miss parsons she smiled at me now still with that halfamused look and i preened myself i was seventeen remember and sized up her points while the father got himself another glass and damned arnold for a puritan hedgepriest she was what is called junoesque broadshouldered and fullbreasted which was less common then than it is now and it seemed to me she liked the look of harry flashman well said my father at last when he had finished fulminating against the folly of putting prigs and scholars in charge of public schools well whats to be done with you eh whatll you do sir now that youve disgraced the home with your beastliness eh i had been thinking this over on my way home and said straight out that i fancied the army the army he growled you mean im to buy you colours so that you can live like a king and ruin me with bills at the guards club i suppose not the guards i said ive a notion for the th light dragoons he stared at this youve chosen a regiment already by gad heres a cool hand i knew the th were at canterbury after long service in india and unlikely for that reason to be posted abroad i had my own notions of soldiering but this was too fast for the guvnor he went on about the expense of buying in and the cost of army life and worked back to my expulsion and my character generally and so back to the army again the port was making him quarrelsome i could see so i judged it best not to press him he growled on dragoons damme dye know what a cornets commission costs damned nonsense never heard the like impudence eh judy miss judy observed that i might look very well as a dashing dragoon eh said my father and gave her a queer look aye like enough he would well see he looked moodily at me in the meantime you can get to your bed he said well talk of this tomorrow for the moment youre still in disgrace but as i left them i could hear him blackguarding arnold again so i went to bed well pleased and relieved into the bargain he was odd fish all right you could never tell how he would take anything in the morning though when i met my father at breakfast there was no talk of the army he was too busy damning brougham who had i gathered made a violent attack on the queen in the house and goggling over some scandal about lady flora hastings in the post to give me much attention and left presently for his club anyway i was content to let the matter rest just now i have always believed in one thing at a time and the thing that was occupying my mind was miss judy parsons let me say that while there have been hundreds of women in my life i have never been one of those who are forever boasting about their conquests ive raked and ridden harder than most no doubt and there are probably a number of middleaged men and women who could answer to the name of flashman if only they knew it thats by the way unless you are the kind who falls in love which ive never been you take your tumbles when youve the chance and the more the better but judy has a close bearing on my story i was not inexperienced with women there had been maids at home and a country girl or two but judy was a woman of the world and that i hadnt attempted not that i was concerned on that account for i fancied myself pretty well i was big and handsome enough for any of them but being my fathers mistress she might think it too risky to frolic with the son as it turned out she wasnt frightened of the guvnor or anyone else she lived in the house the young queen was newly on the throne then and people still behaved as they had under the prince regent and king billy not like later on when mistresses had to stay out of sight i went up to her room before noon to spy out the land and found her still in bed reading the papers she was glad to see me and we talked and from the way she looked and laughed and let me toy with her hand i knew it was only a question of finding the time there was an abigail fussing about the room or id have gone for her then and there however it seemed my father would be at the club that night and playing late as he often did so i agreed to come back and play ecarte with her in the evening both of us knew it wouldnt be cards we would be playing sure enough when i did come back she was sitting prettying herself before her glass wearing a bedgown that would have made me a small handkerchief i came straight up behind her took her big breasts out in either hand stopped her gasp with my mouth and pushed her on to the bed she was as eager as i was and we bounced about in rare style first one on top and then the other which reminds me of something which has stayed in my head as these things will when it was over she was sitting astride me naked and splendid tossing the hair out of her eyes suddenly she laughed loud and clearly the way one does at a good joke i believed then she was laughing with pleasure and thought myself a hell of a fellow but i feel sure now she was laughing at me i was seventeen you remember and doubtless she found it amusing to know how pleased with myself i was later we played cards for forms sake and she won and then i had to sneak off because my father came home early next day i tried her again but this time to my surprise she slapped my hands and said no no my boy once for fun but not twice ive a position to keep up here meaning my father and the chance of servants gossiping i supposed i was annoyed at this and got ugly but she laughed at me again i lost my temper and tried to blackmail her by threatening to let my father find out about the night before but she just curled her lip you wouldnt dare she said and if you did i wouldnt care wouldnt you i said if he threw you out you slut my the brave little man she mocked me i misjudged you at first sight i thought you were just another noisy brute like your father but i see youve a strong streak of the cur in you as well let me tell you hes twice the man you are in bed or out of it i was good enough for you you bitch i said once she said and dropped me a mock curtsey that was enough now get out and stick to servant girls after this i went in a black rage slamming the door and spent the next hour striding about the park planning what i would do to her if i ever had the chance after a while my anger passed and i just put miss judy away in a corner of my mind as one to be paid off when the chance came oddly enough the affair worked to my advantage whether some wind of what had happened on the first night got to my fathers ears or whether he just caught something in the air i dont know but i suspect it was the second he was shrewd and had my own gift of sniffing the wind whatever it was his manner towards me changed abruptly from harking back to my expulsion and treating me fairly offhand he suddenly seemed sulky at me and i caught him giving me odd looks which he would hurriedly shift away as though he were embarrassed anyway within four days of my coming home he suddenly announced that he had been thinking about my notion of the army and had decided to buy me a pair of colours i was to go over to the horse guards to see my uncle bindley my mothers brother who would arrange matters obviously my father wanted me out of the house and quickly so i pinned him then and there while the iron was hot on the matter of an allowance i asked for ј a year to add to my pay and to my astonishment he agreed without discussion i cursed myself for not asking ј but ј was twice what id expected and far more than enough so i was pretty pleased and set off for horse guards in a good humour a lot has been said about the purchase of commissions how the rich and incompetent can buy ahead of better men how the poor and efficient are passed over and most of it in my experience is rubbish even with purchase abolished the rich rise faster in the service than the poor and theyre both inefficient anyway as a rule ive seen ten mens share of service through no fault of my own and can say that most officers are bad and the higher you go the worse they get myself included we were supposed to be rotten with incompetence in the crimea for example when purchase was at its height but the bloody mess they made in south africa recently seems to have been just as bad and they didnt buy their commissions however at this time id no thought beyond being a humble cornet and living high in a crack regiment which was one of the reasons i had fixed on the th dragoons also that they were close to town i said nothing of this to uncle bindley but acted very keen as though i was on fire to win my spurs against the mahrattas or the sikhs he sniffed and looked down his nose which was very high and thin and said he had never suspected martial ardour in me however a fine leg in pantaloons and a penchant for folly seem to be all that is required today he went on and you can ride as i collect anything on legs uncle says i that is of little consequence anyway what concerns me is that you cannot by report hold your liquor youll agree that being dragged from a rugby pothouse reeling i believe is no recommendation to an officers mess i hastened to tell him that the report was exaggerated i doubt it he said the point is were you silent in your drunken state or did you rave a noisy drunkard is intolerable a passive one may do at a pinch at least if he has money money will excuse virtually any conduct in the army nowadays it seems this was a favourite sneer of his i may say that my mothers family while quality were not overrich however i took it all meekly yes he went on ive no doubt that with your allowance you will be able either to kill or ruin yourself in a short space of time at that you will be no worse than half the subalterns in the service if no better ah but wait it was the th light dragoons wasnt it oh yes uncle and you are determined on that regiment why yes i said wondering a little then you may have a little diversion before you go the way of all flesh said he with a knowing smile have you by any chance heard of the earl of cardigan i said i had not which shows how little i had taken notice of military affairs extraordinary he commands the th you know he succeeded to the title only a year or so ago while he was in india with the regiment a remarkable man i understand he makes no secret of his intention to turn the th into the finest cavalry regiment in the army he sounds like the very man for me i said all eagerness indeed indeed well we mustnt deny him the service of so ardent a subaltern must we certainly the matter of your colours must be pushed through without delay i commend your choice my boy im sure you will find service under lord cardigan ah both stimulating and interesting yes as i think of it the combination of his lordship and yourself will be rewarding for you both i was too busy fawning on the old fool to pay much heed to what he was saying otherwise i should have realised that anything that pleased him would probably be bad for me he prided himself on being above my family whom he considered boors with some reason and had never shown much but distaste for me personally helping me to my colours was different of course he owed that as a duty to a blood relation but he paid it without enthusiasm still i had to be civil as butter to him and pretend respect it paid me for i got my colours in the th with surprising speed i put it down entirely to influence for i was not to know then that over the past few months there had been a steady departure of officers from the regiment sold out transferred and posted and all because of lord cardigan whom my uncle had spoken of if i had been a little older and moved in the right circles i should have heard all about him but in the few weeks of waiting for my commission my father sent me up to leicestershire and the little time i had in town i spent either by myself or in the company of such of my relatives as could catch me my mother had had sisters and although they disliked me heartily they felt it was their duty to look after the poor motherless boy so they said in fact they suspected that if i were left to myself i would take to low company and they were right however i was to find out about lord cardigan soon enough in the last few days of buying my uniforms assembling the huge paraphernalia that an officer needed in those days far more than now choosing a couple of horses and arranging for my allowance i still found time on my hands and mistress judy in my thoughts my tumble with her had only whetted my appetite for more of her i discovered i tried to get rid of it with a farm girl in leicestershire and a young whore in covent garden but the one stank and the other picked my pocket afterwards and neither was any substitute anyway i wanted judy at the same time as i felt spite for her but she had avoided me since our quarrel and if we met in the house she simply ignored me in the end it got too much and the night before i left i went to her room again having made sure the guvnor was out she was reading and looking damned desirable in a pale green negligee i was a little drunk and the sight of her white shoulders and red mouth sent the old tingle down my spine again what do you want she said very icy but i was expecting that and had my speech ready ive come to beg pardon i said looking a bit hangdog tomorrow i go away and before i went i had to apologise for the way i spoke to you im sorry judy i truly am i acted like a cad and a ruffian and well i want to make what amends i can thats all she put down her book and turned on her stool to face me still looking mighty cold but saying nothing i shuffled like a sheepish schoolboy i could see my reflection in the mirror behind her and judge how the performance was going and said again that i was sorry very well then she said at last youre sorry you have cause to be i kept quiet not looking at her well then she said after a pause good night please judy i said looking distraught you make it very hard if i behaved like a boor you did it was because i was angry and hurt and didnt understand why why you wouldnt let me i let it trail off and then burst out that i had never known a woman like her before and that i had fallen in love with her and only came to ask her pardon because i couldnt bear the thought of her detesting me and a good deal more in the same strain simple enough rubbish you may think but i was still learning at that the mirror told me i was doing well i finished by drawing myself up straight and looking solemn and saying and that is why i had to see you again to tell you and to ask your pardon i gave her a little bow and turned to the door rehearsing how i would stop and look back if she didnt stop me but she took me at face value for as i put my hand to the latch she said harry i turned round and she was smiling a little and looking sad then she smiled properly and shook her head and said very well harry if you want my pardon for what its worth you have it well say no judy i came striding back smiling like souls awakening oh judy thank you and i held out my hand frank and manly she got up and took it smiling still but there was none of the old wanton glint about her eye she was being stately and forgiving like an aunt to a naughty nephew the nephew had she known it was intent on incest judy i said still holding her hand were parting friends if you like she said trying to take it away goodbye harry and good luck i stepped closer and kissed her hand and she didnt seem to mind i decided like the fool i was that the game was won judy i said again youre adorable i love you judy if only you knew youre all i want in a woman oh judy youre the most beautiful thing all bum belly and bust i love you and i grabbed her to me and she pulled free and got away from me no she said in a voice like steel why the hell not i shouted go away she said pale and with eyes like daggers goodnight goodnight be damned says i i thought you said we were parting friends this aint very friendly is it she stood glaring at me her bosom was what the lady novelists call agitated but if they had seen judy agitated in a negligee they would think of some other way of describing feminine distress i was a fool to listen to you for a moment she says leave this room at once all in good time says i and with a quick dart i caught her round the waist she struck at me but i ducked it and we fell on the bed together i had hold of the softness of her and it maddened me i caught her wrist as she struck at me again like a tigress and got my mouth on hers and she bit me on the lip for all she was worth i yelped and broke away holding my mouth and she raging and panting grabbed up some china dish and let fly at me it missed by a long chalk but it helped my temper over the edge completely i lost control of myself altogether you bitch i shouted and hit her across the face as hard as i could she staggered and i hit her again and she went clean over the bed and on to the floor on the other side i looked round for something to go after her with a cane or a whip for i was in a frenzy and would have cut her to bits if i could but there wasnt one handy and by the time i had got round the bed to her it had flashed across my mind that the house was full of servants and my full reckoning with miss judy had better be postponed to another time i stood over her glaring and swearing and she pulled herself up by a chair holding her face but she was game enough you coward was all she would say you coward its not cowardly to punish an insolent whore says i dyou want some more she was crying not sobbing but with tears on her cheeks she went over to her chair by the mirror pretty unsteady and sat down and looked at herself i cursed her again calling her the choicest names i could think of but she worked at her cheek which was red and bruised with a hares foot and paid no heed she did not speak at all well be damned to you says i at length and with that i slammed out of the room i was shaking with rage and the pain in my lip which was bleeding badly reminded me that she had paid for my blows in advance but she had got something in return at all events she would not forget harry flashman in a hurry the th light dragoons at this time were newly back from india where they had been serving since before i was born they were a fighting regiment and i say it without regimental pride for i never had any but as a plain matter of fact probably the finest mounted troops in england if not in the world yet they had been losing officers since coming home hand over fist the reason was james brudenell earl of cardigan you have heard all about him no doubt the regimental scandals the charge of the light brigade the vanity stupidity and extravagance of the man these things are history like most history they have a fair basis of fact but i knew him probably as few other officers knew him and in turn i found him amusing frightening vindictive charming and downright dangerous he was gods own original fool theres no doubt of that although he was not to blame for the fiasco at balaclava that was raglan and airey between them and he was arrogant as no other man ive ever met and as sure of his own unshakeable tightness as any man could be even when his wrongheadedness was there for all to see that was his great point the key to his character he could never be wrong they say that at least he was brave he was not he was just stupid too stupid ever to be afraid fear is an emotion and his emotions were all between his knees and his breastbone they never touched his reason and he had little enough of that for all that he could never be called a bad soldier some human faults are military virtues like stupidity and arrogance and narrowmindedness cardigan blended all three with a passion for detail and accuracy he was a perfectionist and the manual of cavalry drill was his bible whatever rested between the covers of that book he could perform or cause to be performed with marvellous efficiency and god help anyone who marred that performance he would have made a firstclass drill sergeant only a man with a mind capable of such depths of folly could have led six regiments into the valley at balaclava however i devote some space to him because he played a not unimportant part in the career of harry flashman and since it is my purpose to show how the flashman of tom brown became the glorious flashman with four inches in whos who and grew markedly worse in the process i must say that he was a good friend to me he never understood me of course which is not surprising i took good care not to let him when i met him in canterbury i had already given a good deal of thought to how i should conduct myself in the army i was bent on as much fun and vicious amusement as i could get my contemporaries who praise god on sundays and sneak off to childbrothels during the week would denounce it piously as vicious anyway but i have always known how to behave to my superiors and shine in their eyes a trait of mine which hughes pointed out bless him this i had determined on and since the little i knew of cardigan told me that he prized smartness and show above all things i took some pains over my arrival in canterbury i rolled up to regimental headquarters in a coach resplendent in my new uniform and with my horses led behind and a wagonload of gear cardigan didnt see me arrive unfortunately but word must have been carried to him for when i was introduced to him in his orderly room he was in good humour hawhaw said he as we shook hands it is mr fwashman howdedo sir welcome to the wegiment a good turnout jones he went on to the officer at his elbow i delight to sec a smart officer mr fwashman how tall are you six feet sir i said which was near enough right hawhaw and how heavy do you wide sir i didnt know but i guessed at twelve and a half stone heavy for a light dwagoon said he shaking his head but there are compensations you have a pwoper figure mr fwashman and bear yourself well be attentive to your duties and we shall deal very well together where have you hunted in leicestershire my lord i said couldnt be better says he eh jones very good mr fwashman hope to see more of you hawhaw now no one in my life that i could remember had ever been so damned civil to me except toadeaters like speedicut who didnt count i found myself liking his lordship and did not realise that i was seeing him at his best in this mood he was a charming man enough and looked well he was taller than i straight as a lance and very slender even to his hands although he was barely forty he was already bald with a bush of hair above either ear and magnificent whiskers his nose was beaky and his eyes blue and prominent and unwinking they looked out on the world with that serenity which marks the nobleman whose uttermost ancestor was born a nobleman too it is the look that your parvenu would give half his fortune for that unrufflable gaze of the spoiled child of fortune who knows with unshakeable certainty that he is right and that the world is exactly ordered for his satisfaction and pleasure it is the look that makes underlings writhe and causes revolutions i saw it then and it remained changeless as long as i knew him even through the rollcall beneath causeway heights when the grim silence as the names were shouted out testified to the loss of five hundred of his command it was no fault of mine he said then and he didnt just believe it he knew it i was to see him in a different mood before the day was out but fortunately i was not the object of his wrath quite the reverse in fact i was shown about the camp by the officer of the day a fair young captain named reynolds with a brickred face from service in india professionally he was a good soldier but quiet and no blood at all i was fairly offhand with him and no doubt insolent but he took it without comment confining himself to telling me what was what finding me a servant and ending at the stables where my mare whom i had christened judy by the way and charger were being housed the grooms had judy trimmed up with her best leatherwork and it was the best that the smartest saddler in london could show and reynolds was admiring her when who should ride up but my lord in the devil of a temper he reined in beside us and pointed with a hand that shook with fury to a troop that had just come in under their sergeant to the stable yard captain weynolds he bawled and his face was scarlet is this your twoop reynolds said it was and do you see their sheepskins bawled cardigan these were the saddle sheepskins do you see them sir what colour are they i should like to know will you tell me sir white my lord white you say are you a fool sir are you colourblind they are not white they are yellow with inattention and slovenliness and neglect they are filthy i tell you reynolds stood silent and cardigan raged on this was no doubt very well in india where you learned what you probably call your duty i will not have it here do you understand sir his eye rolled round the stable and rested on judy whose horse is this he demanded i told him and he turned in triumph on reynolds you see sir an officer new joined and he can show you and your other precious fellows from india their duty mr fwashmans sheepskin is white sir as yours should be would be if you knew anything of discipline and good order but you dont sir i tell you mr flashmans sheepskin is new sir said reynolds which was true enough they discolour with age so you make excuses now snapped cardigan hawhaw i tell you sir if you knew your duty they would be cleaned or if they are too old wenewed but you know nothing of this of course your slovenly indian ways are good enough i suppose well they will not do let me tell you these skins will be cwean tomorrow dyou hear sir cwean or ill hold you wesponsible captain weynolds and with that he rode off head in the air and i heard his hawhaw as he greeted someone outside the stable yard i felt quite pleased to have been singled out for what was in effect praise and i fancy i said something of this to reynolds he looked me up and down as though seeing me for the first time and said in that odd welshsounding voice that comes with long service in india yees i can see you will do very well mr flashman lord haw haw may not like us indian officers but he likes plungers and ive no doubt youll plunger very prettily i asked him what he meant by plunging oh says he a plunger is a fellow who makes a great turnout dont you know and leaves cards at the best houses and is sought by the mamas and strolls in the park very languid and is just a hell of a swell generally sometimes they even condescend to soldier a little when it doesnt interfere with their social life goodday mr flashman i could see that reynolds was jealous and in my conceit i was well pleased what he had said though was true enough the regiment was fairly divided between indian officers those who had not left since returning home and the plungers to whom i naturally attached myself they hailed me among them even the noblest and i knew how to make myself pleasant i was not as quick with my tongue as i was to become later but they knew me for a sporting fellow before i had been there long good on a horse good with the bottle and ready for mischief i toadied as seemed best not openly of course but effectively just the same there is a way of toadying which is better than fawning and it consists of acting bluff and hearty and knowing to an inch how far to go and i had money and showed it the indian officers had a bad time cardigan hated them reynolds and forrest were his chief butts and he was forever pestering them to leave the regiment and make way for gentlemen as he put it why he was so down on those who had served in india i was never entirely sure some said it was because they were not of the smart set or well connected and this was true up to a point he was the damnedest snob but i think his hatred of the indian officers ran deeper they were after all real soldiers with service experience and cardigan had never heard a shot outside the shooting range in his twenty years service whatever the cause he made their lives miserable and there were several resignations in my first six months service even for us plungers it was bad enough for he was a devil for discipline and not all the plungers were competent officers i saw how the wind set and studied harder than ever i had at rugby mastering my drill which wasnt difficult and perfecting myself in the rules of camp life i had got an excellent servant named basset a squareheaded oaf who knew everything a soldier ought to know and nothing more and with a genius for bootpolish i thrashed him early in our acquaintance and he seemed to think the better of me for it and treated me as a dog does its master fortunately i cut a good figure on parade and at exercise which was where it counted with cardigan probably only the regimental sergeant major and one or two of the troopsergeants were my equals on horseback and his lordship congratulated me once or twice on my riding hawhaw he would say fwashman sits well i tell you he will make an aide yet i agreed with him flashman was sitting very well in the mess things went well enough they were a fast crowd and the money ran pretty free for apart from parties and the high state which cardigan demanded we should keep there was some heavy gaming all this expense discouraged the indian men which delighted cardigan who was forever sneering at them that if they could not keep up with gentlemen they had better return to farming or set themselves up in trade selling shoes and pots and pans he would say and laugh heartily as though this were the funniest thing imaginable strangely enough or perhaps not strangely his indian prejudice did not extend to the men they were a tough lot and excellent soldiers so far as i could see he was a tyrant to them and never a week passed without a courtmartial for neglect of duty or desertion or drunkenness the last offence was common but not seriously regarded but for the other two he punished hard there were frequent floggings at the rings in the side of the riding school when we all had to attend some of the older officers the indian ones grumbled a good deal and pretended to be shocked but i guessed they would not have missed it myself i liked a good flogging and used to have bets with bryant my particular crony on whether the man would cry out before the tenth stroke or when he would faint it was better sport than most anyway bryant was a queer little creature who attached himself to me early in my career and clung like a leech he was your open toady with little money of his own but a gift of pleasing and being on hand he was smart enough and contrived to cut a decent figure although never splendid and he had all the gossip and knew everybody and was something of a wit he shone at parties and mess nights which we gave for the local society in canterbury where he was very forward he was first with all the news and could recount it in a fashion that amused cardigan not that this was too difficult i found him useful and tolerated him accordingly and used him as a court jester when it suited he was adept in this role too as forrest said if you kicked bryants arse he always bounced most obligingly he had a considerable gift of spite against the indian officers which also endeared him to cardigan oh we were a happy little mess i can tell you and earned him their hatred most of them despised me too along with the other plungers but we despised them for different reasons so we were square there but to only one officer did i take an active dislike which was prophetic and i guessed that he returned it from the first his name was bernier a tall hard hawk of a man with a big nose and black whiskers and dark eyes set very close he was the best blade and shot in the regiment and until i came on the scene the best rider as well he didnt love me for that i suppose but our real hatred dated from the night when he made some reference to nabob families of no breeding and seemed to me to look in my direction i was fairly wineflown or id have kept my mouth shut for he looked like what the americans call a killing gentleman indeed he was very like an american whom i knew later the celebrated james hickok who was also a deadly shot but being part tipsy i said i would rather be a nabob briton and take my chance on breeding than be halfcaste foreign bryant crowed as he always did at my jokes and said bravo flash old england forever and there was general laughter for my usual heartiness and general bluffness had earned me the name of being something of a john bull bernier only halfcaught what i said for i had kept my voice low so that only those nearest heard but someone must have told him later for he never gave me anything but an icy stare from then on and never spoke to me he was sensitive about his foreign name actually he was a french jew if you went back far enough which accounts for it but it was a few months after this incident that i really ran foul of bernier and began to make my reputation the reputation which i still enjoy today i pass over a good deal of what happened in that first year cardigans quarrel with the morning post for example which had the regiment and the public generally in a fine uproar but in which i had no part and come to the famous bernierflashman duel which you will still hear talked about i think of it only with pride and delight even now only two men ever knew the truth of it and i was one it was a year almost to the day after i left rugby that i was taking the air in canterbury in the park and on my way to some mamas house or other to make a call i was in full fig and feeling generally pleased with myself when i spied an officer walking under the trees with a lady arm in arm it was bernier and i looked to see what heifer he was ploughing with in fact she was no heifer but a wickedlooking little blackhaired piece with a turnedup nose and a saucy smile i studied her and the great thought formed in my head i had had two or three mistresses in canterbury off and on but nothing in particular most of the younger officers maintained a paramour in the town or in london but i had never set up any establishment like that i guessed that this was berniers mare of the moment and the more i looked at her the more she intrigued me she looked the kind of plump little puss who would be very knowing in bed and the fact that she was berniers who fancied himself irresistible to women would make the tumbling all the sweeter i wasted no time but found out her direction by inquiry chose my time when bernier was on duty and called on the lady she had a pleasant little retreat very tastefully furnished but in no great style berniers purse was less fat than mine which was an advantage i pursued it she was french herself it turned out so i could be more direct than with an english girl i told her straight out that i had taken a fancy to her and invited her to consider me as a friend a close friend i hinted that i had money she was only a whore after all for all her fashionable airs at first she made a show of being shocked and lalad a good deal but when i made to leave she changed her tune my money aside i think she found me to her fancy she toyed with a fan and looked at me over it with big almondshaped eyes playing the sly minx you have poor opeenion of french girls then says she not i says i charming again ive the highest opinion of you for example whats your name josette she said it very pretty well josette lets drink to our future acquaintance at my expense and i dropped my purse on the table at which her eyes widened it was not a small purse you may think me crude i was but i saved time and trouble and perhaps money too the money that fools waste in paying court with presents before the fun begins she had wine in the house and we drank to each other and talked a good five minutes before i began to tease her into undressing she played it very prettily with much pouting and provocative looks but when she had stripped she was all fire and wickedness and i was so impatient i had her without getting out of my chair whether i found her unusually delectable because she was berniers mistress or because of her french tricks i cant say but i took to visiting her often and in spite of my respect for bernier i was careless it was within a week certainly that we were engaged heavily one evening when there were footsteps on the stair the door flew open and there was the man himself he stood glaring for a moment while josette squeaked and dived beneath the covers and i scrambled to get under the bed in my shirttail the sight of him filled me with panic but he said nothing a moment passed the door slammed and i came out scrabbling for my breeches at that moment i wanted only to put as much distance between myself and him as i could and i dressed in some haste josette began to laugh and i asked her what the devil amused her it is so fonnee she giggled you you half beneath de bed and charles glaring so fierce at your derriere and she shrieked with laughter i told her to hold her tongue and she stopped laughing and tried to coax me back to bed again saying that bernier had undoubtedly gone and sitting up and shaking her tits at me i hesitated between lust and fright until she hopped out and bolted the door and then i decided i might as well have my sport while i could and pulled off my clothes again but i confess it was not the most joyous pleasuring i have taken part in although josette was at her most spirited i suspect she was thrilled by the situation i was in two minds whether to go back to the mess afterwards for i was sure bernier must call me out but to my surprise when i pulled my courage together and went in to dinner he paid me not the slightest notice i couldnt make it out and when next day and the next he was still silent i took heart again and even paid josette another visit she had not seen him so it seemed to me that he intended to do nothing at all i decided that he was a poorspirited thing after all and had resigned his mistress to me not i was sure out of fear of me but because he could not bear to have a trollop who cheated him of course the truth was that he couldnt call me out without exposing the cause and making himself look ridiculous and knowing more of regimental custom than i did he hesitated to provoke an affair of honour over a mistress but he was holding himself in with difficulty not knowing this i took to throwing my chest out again and let bryant into the secret the toady was delighted and soon all the plungers knew it was then only a matter of time before the explosion came as i should have known it would it was after dinner one night and we were playing cards while bernier and one or two of the indian men were talking near by the game was vingtetun and it happened that at that game i had a small joke concerning the queen of diamonds which i maintained was my lucky card forrest had the bank and when he set down my fivecard hand with an ace and the queen of diamonds bryant the spiteful ass sang out hullo hes got your queen flashy thats the biter bit bigod how dye mean said forrest taking up the cards and stakes with flashy its tother way you know says bryant he makes off with other chaps queens aha says forrest grinning but the queen of diamonds is a good englishwoman aint she flash mounting french fillies is your style i hear there was a good deal of laughter and glances in berniers direction i should have kept them quiet but i was fool enough to join in nothing wrong in a french filly i said so long as the jockeys an english one a french trainer is well enough of course but they dont last in a serious race it was feeble enough stuff no doubt even allowing for the port we had drunk but it snapped the straw the next i knew my chair had been dragged away and bernier was standing over me as i sprawled on the floor his face livid and his mouth working what the devil began forrest as i scrambled up and the others jumped up also i was half on my feet when bernier struck me and i lost my balance and went down again for gods sake bernier shouts forrest are you mad and they had to hold him back or he would have savaged me on the ground i think seeing him held i came up with an oath and made to go for him but bryant grabbed me crying no no flash hold off flashy and they clustered round me as well truth is i was nearly sick with fear for the murder was out now the best shot in the regiment had hit me but with provocation fearful or not i have always been quick and clear enough in my thinking in a crisis and there couldnt be any way out except a meeting unless i took the blow which meant an end to my career in the army and in society but to fight him was a quick road to the grave it was a horrible dilemma and in that moment as they held us apart i saw i must have time to think to plan to find a way out i shook them off and without a word stalked out of the mess like a man who must remove himself before he does someone a mischief it took me five minutes of hard thinking and then i was striding back into the mess again my heart was hammering and no doubt i looked pretty furious and if i shook they thought it was anger the chatter died away as i came in i can feel that silence now sixty years after and see the elegant blue figures and the silver gleaming on the table and bernier alone and very pale by the fireplace i went straight up to him i had my speech ready captain bernier i said you have struck me with your hand that was rash for i could take you to pieces with mine if i chose this was blunt english flashman of course but i prefer to fight like a gentleman even if you do not i swung round on my heel lieutenant forrest will you act for me forrest said yes like a shot and bryant looked piqued he expected i would have named him but i had another part for him to play and who acts for you i asked bernier very cool he named tracy one of the indian men and i gave tracy a bow and then went over to the card table as though nothing had happened mr forrest will have the details to attend to i said to the others shall we cut for the bank they stared at me by gad flash youre a cool one cries bryant i shrugged and took up the cards and we started playing again the others all very excited too excited to notice that my thoughts were not on my cards luckily vingtetun calls for little concentration after a moment forrest who had been conferring with tracy came over to tell me that with lord cardigans permission which he was sure must be forthcoming we should meet behind the riding school at six in the morning it was assumed i would choose pistols as the injured party i had the choice i nodded very offhand and told bryant to hurry with the deal we played a few more hands and then i said i was for bed lit my cheroot and strolled out with an airy goodnight to the others as though the thought of pistols at dawn troubled me no more than what i should have for breakfast whatever happened i had grown in popular esteem for this night at least i stopped under the trees on the way to my quarters and after a moment as i had expected bryant came hurrying after me full of excitement and concern he began to babble about what a devil of a fellow i was and what a fighting turk bernier was but i cut him off short tommy says i youre not a rich man eh says he what the tommy says i would you like ten thousand pounds in gods name says he what for for seeing that bernier stands up at our meeting tomorrow with an unloaded pistol says i straight out i knew my man he goggled at me and then began to babble again christ flash are you crazy unloaded why yes or no says i ten thousand pounds but its murder he squealed wed swing for it no thought of honour you see or any of that rot nobodys going to swing i told him and keep your voice down dye hear now then tommy youre a sharp man with the sleight of hand at parties ive seen you you can do it in your sleep for ten thousand my god flash says he i dont dare and he began babbling again but in a whisper this time i let him ramble for a moment for i knew he would come round he was a greedy little bastard and the thought of ten thousand was like aladdins cave to him i explained how safe and simple it would be i had thought it out when first i left the mess go and borrow reynolds duelling pistols first off take em to forrest and tracy and offer to act as loader youre always into everything and theyll be glad to accept and never think twice wont they by god cried he they know im hellish thick with you flashy youre an officer and a gentleman i reminded him now who will imagine for a moment that you would stoop to such a treacherous act eh no no tommy its cut and dried and in the morning with the surgeon and seconds standing by youll load up carefully dont tell me you cant palm a pistol ball oh aye says he like enough but ten thousands pounds i said and he licked his lips jesus he said at length ten thousand phew on your word of honour flash word of honour i said and lit another cheroot ill do it says he my god youre a devil flash you wont kill him though ill have no part in murder captain bernier will be as safe from me as ill be from him i told him now cut along and see reynolds he cut on the word he was an active little rat that ill say for him once committed he went in heart and soul i went to my quarters got rid of basset who was waiting up for me and lay down on my cot my throat was dry and my hands were sweating as i thought of what i had done for all the bluff front i had shown to bryant i was in a deathly funk suppose something went wrong and bryant muffed it it had seemed so easy in that moment of panicky thought outside the mess fear stimulates thought perhaps but it may not be clear thought because one sees the way out that one wants to see and makes headlong for it i thought of bryant fumbling or being too closely overseen and bernier standing up in front of me with a loaded pistol in a hand like a rock and the muzzle pointing dead at my breast and felt the ball tearing into me and myself falling down screaming and dying on the ground i almost shouted out at the horror of it and lay there blubbering in the dark room i would have got up and run but my legs would not let me so i began to pray which i had not done i should say since i was about eight years old but i kept thinking of arnold and hell which is no doubt significant and in the end there was nothing for it but brandy but it might as well have been water i did no sleeping that night but listened to the clock chiming away the quarters until dawn came and i heard basset approaching i had just sense enough left to see that it wouldnt do for him to find me redeyed and shivering so i made believe to sleep snoring like an organ and i heard him say if that dont beat listen to im sound as a babby isnt he the gamecock though and another voice another servants i suppose replied thays all alike bloody fools e wont be snorin tomorrow mornin after berniers done with im ell be sleepin too sound for that right my lad whoever you are i thought if i come through this itll be strange if i cant bring you to the rings at the riding school and well see your backbone when the farriersergeant takes the cat to you well hear how loud you can snore yourself and with that surge of anger i suddenly felt confidence replacing fear bryant would see it through all right and when they came for me i was at least composed if not cheerful when i am frightened i go red in the face not pale as most men do so that in me fear can pass for anger which has been convenient more than once bryant tells me that i went out to the riding school that morning wattled like a turkey cock he said the fellows made sure i was in a fury to kill bernier not that they thought i had a chance and they were quiet for once as we walked across the parade just as the trumpeter was sounding reveille they had told cardigan of the affair of course and some had thought he might intervene to prevent it but when he had heard of the blow he had simply said where do they meet and gone back to sleep again with instructions to be called at five he did not approve of duelling although he duelled himself in famous circumstances but he saw that in this case the credit of the regiment would only be hurt if the affair were patched up bernier and tracy were already there with the surgeon and the mist was hanging a little under the trees our feet thumped on the turf which was still wet with dew as we strode across to them forrest at my side and bryant with the pistol case beneath his arm following on with the others about fifty yards away under the trees by the fence was a little knot of officers and i saw cardigans bald head above his great caped coat he was smoking a cigar bryant and the surgeon called bernier and me together and bryant asked us if we would not resolve our quarrel neither of us said a word bernier was pale and looked fixedly over my shoulder and in that moment i came as near to turning and running as ever i did in my life i felt that my bowels would squirt at any moment and my hands were shuddering beneath my cloak very good then says bryant and went with the surgeon to a little table they had set up he took out the pistols and from the corner of my eye i saw him spark the flints pour in the charges and rummage in the shotcase i darent watch him closely and anyway forrest came just then and led me back to my place when i turned round again the surgeon was stopping to pick up a fallen powder flask and bryant was ramming home a wad in one of the barkers they conferred a moment and then bryant paced over to bernier and presented a pistol to him then he came to me with the other there was no one behind me and as my hand closed on the butt bryant winked quickly my heart came up into my mouth and i can never hope to describe the relief that flooded through my body tingling every limb i was going to live gentlemen you are both determined to continue with this meeting bryant looked at each of us in turn bernier said yes hard and clear i nodded bryant stepped back to be well out of the line of fire the seconds and the surgeon took post beside him leaving bernier and me looking at each other about twenty paces apart he stood sideways to me the pistol at his side staring straight at my face as though choosing his spot he could clip the pips from a card at this distance the pistols fire on one pressure called bryant when i drop my handkerchief you may level your pistols and fire i shall drop it in a few seconds from now and he held up the white kerchief in one hand i heard the click of bernier cocking his pistol his eyes were steady on mine sold again bernier i thought youre all in a stew about nothing the handkerchief fell berniers right arm came up like a railway signal and before i had even cocked my pistol i was looking into his barrel a split second and it shot smoke at me and the crack of the charge was followed by something rasping across my cheek and grazing it it was the wad i fell back a step bernier was glaring at me aghast that i was still on my feet i suppose and someone shouted missed by jesus and another cried angrily for silence it was my turn and for a moment the lust was on me to shoot the swine down where he stood but bryant might have lost his head and it was no part of my design anyway i had it in my power now to make a name that would run through the army in a week good old flashy who stole another mans girl and took a blow from him but was too decent to take advantage of him even in a duel they stood like statues every eye on bernier waiting for me to shoot him down i cocked my pistol watching him come on damn you he shouted suddenly his face white with rage and fear i looked at him for a moment then brought my pistol up no higher than hip level but with the barrel pointing well away to the side i held it negligently almost just for a moment so that everyone might see i was firing deliberately wide i squeezed the trigger what happened to that shot is now regimental history i had meant it for the ground but it chanced that the surgeon had set his bag and bottle of spirits down on the turf in that direction maybe thirty yards off and by sheer good luck the shot whipped the neck off the bottle clean as a whistle deloped by god roared forrest hes deloped they hurried forward shouting the surgeon exclaiming in blasphemous amazement over his shattered bottle bryant slapped me on the back forrest wrung my hand tracy stood staring in astonishment it seemed to him as it did to everyone that i had spared bernier and at the same time given proof of astounding marksmanship as for bernier he looked murder if ever a man did but i marched straight up to him with my hand held out and he was forced to take it he was struggling to keep from dashing his pistol into my face and when i said no hard feelings then old fellow he gave an incoherent snarl and turning on his heel strode off this was not lost on cardigan who was still watching from a distance and presently i was summoned from a boozy breakfast for the plungers celebrated the affair in style and waxed fulsome over the way i had stood up to him and then deloped cardigan had me to his office and there was the adjutant and jones and bernier looking like thunder i wont have it i tell you cardigan was saying ha fwashman come here hawhaw now then shake hands directly i say captain bernier and let me hear that the affair is done and honour satisfied i spoke up its done for me and indeed im sorry it ever happened but the blow was captain berniers not mine but heres my hand again bernier said in a voice that shook why did you delope you have made a mock of me why didnt you take your shot at me like a man my good sir i said i didnt presume to tell you where to aim your shot dont tell me where i should have aimed mine that remark i am told has found its way since into some dictionary of quotations it was in the times within the week and i was told that when the duke of wellington heard it he observed damned good and damned right too so that mornings work made a name for harry flashman a name that enjoyed more immediate celebrity than if i had stormed a battery alone such is fame especially in peacetime the whole story went the rounds and for a time i even found myself pointed out in the street and a clergyman wrote to me from birmingham saying that as i had shown mercy i would surely obtain mercy and parkin the oxford street gunmaker sent me a brace of barkers in silver mountings with my initials engraved good for trade i imagine there was also a question in the house on the vicious practice of duelling and macaulay replied that since one of the participants in the recent affair had shown such good sense and humanity the government while deploring such meetings hoped this might prove a good example my uncle bindley was heard to say that his nephew had more to him than he supposed and even basset went about throwing a chest at being servant to such a cool blade the only person who was critical was my own father who said in one of his rare letters dont be such an infernal fool another time you dont fight duels in order to delope but to kill your adversary so with josette mine by right of conquest and she was in some awe of me i may say and a reputation for courage marksmanship and downright decency established i was pretty well satisfied the only snag was bryant but i dealt with that easily when he had finished toadying me on the day of the duel he got round to asking about his ten thousand he knew i had great funds or at least that my father did but i knew perfectly well i could never have pried ten thousand out of my guvnor i told bryant so and he gaped as though i had kicked him in the stomach but you promised me ten thousand he began to bleat silly promise aint it when you think hard about it says i ten thousand quid i mean whod pay out that much you lying swine shouts he almost crying with rage you swore youd pay me more fool you for believing me i said right by god he snarled well see about this you wont cheat me flashman ill youll what says i tell everyone all about it confess that you sent a man into a duel with an unloaded gun itll make an interesting story youd be confessing to a capital offence had you thought of that not that anyoned believe you but theyd certainly kick you out of the service for conduct unbecoming wouldnt they he saw then how it lay and there was nothing he could do about it he actually stamped and tore his hair and then he tried pleading with me but i laughed at him and he finished up swearing to be even yet youll live to regret this he cried by god ill get you yet more chance of that then you have of getting ten thousand anyway i told him and he slunk off he didnt worry me what id said was gospel true he darent breathe a word for his own safetys sake of course if he had thought at all he would have sniffed something fishy about a ten thousand bribe in the first place but he was greedy and ive lived long enough to discover that there isnt any folly a man wont contemplate if theres money or a woman at stake however if i could congratulate myself on how the matter had turned out and can look back now and say it was one of the most important and helpful incidents of my life there was trouble in store for me very quickly as a result of it it came a few weeks afterwards and it ended in my having to leave the regiment for a while it had happened not long before that the regiment had been honoured by being chosen to escort to london the queens husbandtobe albert when he arrived in this country he had become colonel of the regiment and among other things we had been given a newdesigned uniform and had our name changed to the eleventh hussars that by the way what mattered was that he took a close interest in us and the tale of the duel made such a stir that he took special notice of it and being a prying german busybody found out the cause of it that almost cooked my goose for good his lovely new regiment he found contained officers who consorted with french whores and even fought duels over them he played the devil about this and the upshot was that cardigan had to summon me and tell me that for my own good i would have to go away for a while it has been demanded said he that you weave the wegiment i take it the official intention is that that should be permanent but i intend to interpwet it as tempowawy i have no desire to lose the services of a pwomising officer not for his woyal highness or anyone let me tell you you might go on weave of course but i think it best you should be detached i shall have you posted fwashman to another unit until the fuss has died down i didnt much like the idea and when he announced that the regiment he had chosen to post me to was stationed in scotland i almost rebelled but i realised it would only be for a few months and i was relieved to find cardigan still on my side if it had been reynolds who had fought the duel it would have been a very different kettle offish but i was one of his favourites and one must say it of old lord haw haw if you were his favourite he would stand by you right reason or none old fool i have soldiered in too many countries and known too many peoples to fall into the folly of laying down the law about any of them i tell you what i have seen and you may draw your own conclusions i disliked scotland and the scots the place i found wet and the people rude they had the fine qualities which bore me thrift and industry and longfaced holiness and the young women are mostly great genteel boisterous things who are no doubt bedworthy enough if your taste runs that way the men i found solemn hostile and greedy and they found me insolent arrogant and smart this for the most part there were exceptions as you shall see the best things i found however were the port and the claret in which the scotch have a nice taste although i never took to whisky the place i was posted to was paisley which is near glasgow and when i heard of the posting i as near as a toucher sold out but i told myself i should be back with the th in a few months and must take my medicine even if it meant being away from all decent living for a while my forebodings were realised and more but at least life did not turn out to be boring which was what i had feared most very far from it at this time there was a great unrest throughout britain in the industrial areas which meant very little to me and indeed ive never troubled to read up the particulars of it the working people were in a state of agitation and one heard of riots in the mill towns and of weavers smashing looms and chartists being arrested but we younger fellows paid it no heed if you were countrybred or lived in london these things were nothing to you and all i gathered was that the poor folk were mutinous and wanted to do less work for more money and the factory owners were damned if theyd let them there may have been more to it than this but i doubt it and no one has ever convinced me that it was anything but a war between the two it always has been and always will be as long as one man has what the other has not and devil take the hindmost the devil seemed to be taking the workers by and large with government helping him and we soldiers were the governments sword troops were called out to subdue the agitators and the riot act was read and here and there would be clashes between the two and a few killed i am fairly neutral now with my money in the bank but at that time everyone i knew was damning the workers up and down and saying they should be hung and flogged and transported and i was all for it as the duke would say you have no notion today how high feeling ran the millfolk were the enemy then as though they had been frenchmen or afghans they were to be put down whenever they rose up and we were to do it i was hazy enough as you see on the causes of k all but i saw further than most in some ways and what i saw was this its one thing leading british soldiers against foreigners but would they fight their own folk for most of the troopers of the th for example were of the class and kind of the working people and i couldnt see them fighting their fellows i said so but all i was told was that discipline would do the trick well thought i maybe it will and maybe it wont but whoever is going to be caught between a mob on one side and a file of red coats on the other it isnt going to be old flashy paisley had been quiet enough when i was sent there but the authorities had a suspicious eye on the whole area which was regarded as being a hotbed of sedition they were training up the militia just in case and this was the task i was given an officer from a crack cavalry regiment instructing irregular infantry which is what you might expect they turned out to be good material luckily many of the older ones were peninsular men and the sergeant had been in the nd regiment at waterloo so there was little enough for me to do at first i was billeted on one of the principal millowners of the area a brassbound old moneybags with a long nose and a hard eye who lived in some style in a house at renfrew and who made me welcome after his fashion when i arrived weve no high opeenion o the military sir said he and could well be doing without ye but since thanks to slack government and that damnable reform nonsense were in this sorry plight we must bear with having soldiers aboot us a scandal dye see these wretches at my mill sir i would have the half of them in australia this meenit if it was left to me and let the rest feel their bellies pinched for a week or two wed hear less of their caterwaulin then you need have no fear sir i told him we shall protect you fear he snorted im not feart sir john morrison doesnae tremble at the whine o his ain workers let me tell you as for protecting well see and he gave me a look and a sniff i was to live with the family he could hardly do less in view of what brought me there and presently he took me from his study through the gloomy hall of his mansion to the familys sittingroom the whole house was hellish gloomy and cold and smelled of must and righteousness but when he threw open the sittingroom door and ushered me in i forgot my surroundings mr flashman says he this is mistress morrison and my four daughters he rapped out their names like a rollcall agnes mary elspeth and grizel i snapped my heels and bowed with a great flourish i was in uniform and the goldtrimmed blue cape and pink pants of the th hussars were already famous and looked extremely well on me four heads inclined in reply and one nodded this was mistress morrison a tall beaknosed female in whom one could detect all the fading beauty of a vulture i made a hasty inventory of the daughters agnes buxom and darkly handsome she would do mary buxom and plain she would not grizel thin and mousy and still a schoolgirl no elspeth was like none of the others she was beautiful fairhaired blueeyed and pinkcheeked and she alone smiled at me with the open simple smile of the truly stupid i marked her down at once and gave all my attention to mistress morrison it was grim work i may tell you for she was a sour tyrant of a woman and looked on me as she looked on all soldiers englishmen and men under fifty years of age as frivolous godless feckless and unworthy in this it seemed her husband supported her and the daughters said not a word to me all evening i could have damned the lot of them but instead i set myself to be pleasant modest and even meek where the old woman was concerned and when we went into dinner which was served in great state she had thawed to the extent of a sour smile or two well i thought that is something and i went up in her estimation by saying amen loudly when morrison said grace and struck while the iron was hot by asking presently it was saturday what time divine service was next morning morrison went so far as to be civil once or twice after this but i was still glad to escape at last to my room dark brown tomb though it was you may wonder why i took pains to ingratiate myself with these puritan boors and the answer is that i have always made a point of being civil to anyone who might ever be of use to me also i had half an eye to miss elspeth and there was no hope there without the mothers good opinion so i attended family prayers with them and escorted them to church and listened to miss agnes sing in the evening and helped miss grizel with her lessons and pretended an interest in mistress morrisons conversation which was spiteful and censorious and limited to the doings of her acquaintances in paisley and was entertained by miss mary on the subject of her garden flowers and bore with old morrisons droning about the state of trade and the incompetence of government and among these riotous pleasures of a soldiers life i talked occasionally with miss elspeth and found her brainless beyond description but she was undeniably desirable and for all the piety and fear of hellfire that had been drummed into her i thought there was sometimes a wanton look about her eye and lower lip and after a week i had her as infatuated with me as any young woman could be it was not so difficult dashing young cavalrymen with broad shoulders were rare in paisley and i was setting myself to charm however theres many a slip twixt the crouch and the leap as the cavalry used to say and my difficulty was to get miss elspeth in the right place at the right time i was kept pretty hard at it with the militia during the day and in the evenings her parents chaperoned her like shadows it was more for forms sake than anything else i think for they seemed to trust me well enough by this time but it made things damnably awkward and i was beginning to itch for her considerably but eventually it was her father himself who brought matters to a successful conclusion and changed my whole life and hers and it was because he john morrison who had boasted of his fearlessness turned out to be as timid as a mouse it was on a monday nine days after i had arrived that a fracas broke out in one of the mills a young worker had his arm crushed in one of the machines and his mates made a great outcry and a meeting of workmen was held in the streets beyond the mill gates that was all but some fool of a magistrate lost his head and demanded that the troops be called to quell the seditious rioters i sent his messenger about his business in the first place because there seemed no danger from the meeting although there was plenty of fistshaking and threatshouting by all accounts and in the second because i do not make a practice of seeking sorrow sure enough the meeting dispersed but not before the magistrate had spread panic and alarm ordering the shops to close and windows in the town to be shuttered and god knows what other folly i told him to his face he was a fool ordered my sergeant to let the militia go home and trotted over to renfrew there morrison was in a state of despair he peeped at me round the front door his face ashen and demanded are they comin in goads name and then why are ye not at the head of your troops sir are we tae be murdered for your neglect i told him pretty sharp that there was no danger but that if there had been his place was surely at his mill to keep his rascals in order he whinnied at me ive seldom seen a man in such fright and being a truebred poltroon myself i speak with authority my place is here he yelped defendin my hame and bairns i thought they were in glasgow today i said as i came into the hall my wee elspeths here said he groaning if the mob was tae break in oh for gods sake says i for i was well out of sorts what with the idiot magistrate and now morrison there isnt a mob theyve gone home will they stay hame he bawled oh they hate me mr flashman damn them a what if they were to come here o waes me and my poor wee elspeth poor wee elspeth was sitting on the windowseat admiring her reflection in the panes and perfectly unconcerned catching sight of her i had an excellent thought if youre nervous for her why not send her to glasgow too i asked him very unconcerned are ye mad sir alone on the road a lassie i reassured him i would escort her safely to her mama and leave me here he cried so i suggested he come as well but he wouldnt have that i realised later he probably had his strongbox in the house he hummed and hawed a great deal but eventually fear for his daughter which was entirely groundless as far as mobs were concerned overcame him and we were packed off together in the gig i driving she humming gaily at the thought of a jaunt and her devoted parent crying instruction and consternation after us as we rattled off tak care o my poor wee lamb mr flashman he wailed to be sure i will sir i replied and i did the banks of the clyde in those days were very pretty not like the grimy slums that cover them now there was a gentle evening haze i remember and a warm sun setting on a glorious day and after a mile or two i suggested we stop and ramble among the thickets by the waterside miss elspeth was eager so we left the pony grazing and went into a little copse i suggested we sit down and miss elspeth was eager again that glorious vacant smile informed me i believe i murmured a few pleasantries played with her hair and then kissed her miss elspeth was more eager still then i got to work in earnest and miss elspeths eagerness knew no bounds i had great red clawmarks on my back for a fortnight after when we had finished she lay in the grass drowsy like a contented kitten and after a few pleased sighs she said was that what the minister means when he talks of fornication astonished i said yes it was umhm said she why has he such a down on it it seemed to me time to be pressing on towards glasgow ignorant women i have met and i knew that miss elspeth must rank high among them but i had not supposed until now that she had no earthly idea of elementary human relations she simply did not understand what had taken place between us she liked it certainly but she had no thought of anything beyond the act no notion of consequences or guilt or the need for secrecy in her ignorance and stupidity formed a perfect shield against the world this i suppose is innocence it startled me i can tell you i had a vision of her remarking happily mama youll never guess what mr flashman and i have been doing this evening not that i minded too much for when all was said i didnt care a button for the morrisons opinion and if they could not look after their daughter it was their own fault but the less trouble the better for her own sake i hoped she might keep her mouth shut i took her back to the gig and helped her in and i thought what a beautiful fool she was oddly enough i felt a sudden affection for her in that moment such as i hadnt felt for any of my other women even though some of them had been better tumbles than she it had nothing to do with rolling her in the grass looking at the gold hair that had fallen loose on her cheek and seeing the happy smile in her eyes i felt a great desire to keep her not only for bed but to have her near me i wanted to watch her face and the way she pushed her hair into place and the steady serene look that she turned on me hullo flashy i remember thinking careful old son but it stayed with me that queer empty feeling in my inside and of all the recollections of my life there isnt one that is clearer than of that warm evening by the clyde with elspeth smiling at me beneath the trees almost equally distinct however but less pleasant is my memory of morrison a few days later shaking his fist in my face and scarlet with rage as he shouted ye damned blackguard ye thieving licentious raping devil ill have ye hanged for this as goads my witness my ain daughter in my ain hoose jesus lord ye come sneaking here like the damned viper that ye are and much more of the same until i thought he would have apoplexy miss elspeth had almost lived up to my expectation only it had not been mama she had told but agnes the result was the same of course and the house was in uproar the only calm person was elspeth herself which was no help for of course i denied old morrisons accusation but when he dragged her in to confront me with my infamy as he called it she said quite matteroffact yes it had happened by the river on the way to glasgow i wondered was she simple it is a point on which i have never made up my mind at that i couldnt deny it any longer so i took the other course and damned morrisons eyes asking him what did he expect if he left a handsome daughter within a mans reach i told him we were not monks in the army and he fairly screamed with rage and threw an inkstand at me which fortunately missed by this time others were on the scene and his daughters had the vapours except elspeth and mrs morrison came at me with such murder in her face that i turned tail and ran for dear life i decamped without even having time to collect my effects which were not sent on to me by the way and decided that i had best set up my base in glasgow paisley was likely to be fairly hot and i resolved to have a word with the local commandant and explain as between gentlemen that it might be best if other duties were found for me that would not take me back there it would be somewhat embarrassing of course for he was another of these damned presbyterians so i put off seeing him for a day or two as a result i never called on him at all instead i had a caller myself he was a stiffshouldered briskmannered fellow of about fifty rather dapper in an almost military way with a brown face and hard grey eyes he looked as though he might be a sporting sort but when he came to see me he was all business mr flashman i believe says he my name is abercrombie good luck to you then says i im not buying anything today so close the door as you leave he looked at me sharp head on one side good says he this makes it easier i had thought you might be a smooth one but i see that youre what they call a plunger i asked him what the devil he meant quite simple says he taking a seat as cool as you please we have a mutual acquaintance mrs morrison of renfrew is my sister elspeth morrison is my niece this was an uneasy piece of news for i didnt like the look of him he was too sure of himself by half but i gave him a stare and told him he had a damned handsome niece im relieved that you think so said he id be distressed to think that the hussars were not discriminating he sat looking at me so i took a turn round the room the point is he said that we have to make arrangements for the wedding youll not want to lose time i had picked up a bottle and glass but i set them down sharp at this he had taken my breath away what the hell dye mean says i then i laughed you dont think ill marry her do you good god you must be a lunatic and why says he because im not such a fool i told him suddenly i was angry at this damned little snip and his tone with me if every girl whos ready to play in the hay was to get married wed have damned few spinsters left wouldnt we and dyou suppose id be pushed into a wedding over a trifle like this my nieces honour your nieces honour a millowners daughters honour oh i see the game you see an excellent chance of a match eh a chance to marry your niece to a gentleman you smell a fortune do you well let me tell you as to the excellence of the match said he id sooner see her marry a barbary ape i take it however that you decline the honour of my nieces hand damn your impudence you take it right now get out excellent says he very brighteyed its what i hoped for and he stood up straightening his coat whats that meant to mean curse you he smiled at me ill send a friend to talk to you he will arrange matters i dont approve of meetings myself but ill be delighted in this case to put either a bullet or a blade into you he clapped his hat on his head you know i dont suppose there has been a duel in glasgow these fifty years or more it will cause quite a stir i gaped at the man but gathered my wits soon enough lord says i with a sneer you dont suppose i would fight you no gentlemen fight gentlemen i told him and ran a scornful eye over him they dont fight shopkeepers wrong again says he cheerily im a lawyer then stick to your law we dont fight lawyers either not if you can help it i imagine but youll be hard put to it to refuse a brother officer mr flashman you see although ive no more than a militia commission now i was formerly of the rd foot you have heard of the sutherlands i take it and had the honour to hold the rank of captain i even achieved some little service in the field he was smiling almost benignly now if you doubt my bona fides may i refer you to my former chief colonel colin campbell good day mr flashman he was at the door before i found my voice to hell with you and him ill not fight you he turned then ill enjoy taking a whip to you in the street i really shall your own chief my lord cardigan isnt it will find that happy reading in the times i dont doubt he had me in a cleft stick as i saw at once it would mean professional ruin and at the hands of a damned provincial infantryman and a retired one at that i stood there overcome with rage and panic damning the day i ever set eyes on his infernal niece with my wits working for a way out i tried another tack you may not realise who youre dealing with i told him and asked if he had not heard of the bernier affair it seemed to me that it must be known about even in the wilds of glasgow and i said so i think i recollect a paragraph says he dear me mr flashman should i be overcome should i quail ill just have to hold my pistol steady wont i damn you i shouted wait a moment he stood attentive watching me all right blast you i said how much do you want i thought it might come to that he said your kind of rat generally reaches for its purse when cornered youre wasting time flashman ill take your promise to marry elspeth or your life id prefer the latter but its one or the other make up your mind and from that i could not budge him i pleaded and swore and promised any kind of reparation short of marriage i was almost in tears but i might as well have tried to move a rock marry or die that was what it amounted to for id no doubt he would be damnably efficient with the barkers there was nothing for it in the end i had to give in and say i would marry the girl youre sure you wouldnt rather fight says he regretfully a great pity i fear the conventions are going to burden elspeth with a rotten man but there and he passed on to discussion of the wedding arrangements he had it all pat when at last i was rid of him i applied myself to the brandy and things seemed less bleak at least i could think of no one i would rather be wedded and bedded with and if you have money a wife need be no great encumbrance and presently we should be out of scotland so i need not see her damnable family but it was an infernal nuisance all the same what was i to tell my father i couldnt for the life of me think how he would take it he wouldnt cut me off but he might be damned uncivil about it i didnt write to him until after the business was over it took place in the abbey at paisley which was appropriately gloomy and the sight of the pious long faces of my brides relations would have turned your stomach the morrisons had begun speaking to me again and were very civil in public it was represented as being a sudden lovematch of course between the dashing hussar and the beautiful provincial so they had to pretend i was their beau ideal of a soninlaw but the brute abercrombie was never far away to see i came up to scratch and all in all it was an unpleasant business when it was done and the guests had begun to drink themselves blind as is the scottish custom elspeth and i were seen off in a carriage by her parents old morrison was crying drunk and made a disgusting spectacle my wee lamb he kept snuffling my bonny wee lamb his wee lamb i may say looked entrancing and no more moved than if she had just been out choosing a pair of gloves rather than getting a husband she had taken the whole thing without a murmur neither happy nor sorry apparently which piqued me a little anyway her father slobbered over her but when he turned to me he just let out a great hollow groan and gave place to his wife at that i whipped up the horses and away we went for the life of me i cannot remember where the honeymoon was spent at some rented cottage on the coast i remember but the name has gone and it was lively enough elspeth knew nothing but it seemed that the only thing that brought her out of her usual serene lethargy was a man in bed with her she was a more than willing playmate and i taught her a few of josettes tricks which she picked up so readily that by the time we came back to paisley i was worn out and there the shock was waiting it hit me harder i think than anything had in my life when i opened the letter and read it i couldnt speak at first i had to read it again and again before it made sense lord cardigan has learned of the marriage contracted lately by mr flashman of this regiment and miss morrison of glasgow in view of this marriage his lordship feels that mr flashman will not wish to continue to serve with the th hussars but that he will wish either to resign or to transfer to another regiment that was all it was signed jones cardigans toady what i said i dont recall but it brought elspeth to my side she slid her arms round my waist and asked what was the matter all hells the matter i said i must go to london at once at this she raised a cry of delight and babbled with excitement about seeing the great sights and society and having a place in town and meeting my father god help us and a great deal more drivel i was too sick to heed her and she never seemed to notice me as i sat down among the boxes and trunks that had been brought in from the coach to our bedroom i remember i damned her at one point for a fool and told her to hold her tongue which silenced her for a minute but then she started off again and was debating whether she should have a french maid or an english one i was in a furious rage all the way south and impatient to get to cardigan i knew what it was all about the bloody fool had read of the marriage and decided that elspeth was not suitable for one of his officers it will sound ridiculous to you perhaps but it was so in those days in a regiment like the th society daughters were all very well but anything that smacked of trade or the middle classes was anathema to his lofty lordship well i was not going to have his nose turned up at me as he would find so i thought in my youthful folly i took elspeth home first i had written to my father while we were on honeymoon and had had a letter back saying who is the unfortunate chit for gods sake does she know what she has got so all was well enough in its way on that front and when we arrived there who should be the first person we met in the hall but judy dressed for riding she gave me a tongueinthecheek smile as soon as she saw elspeth the clever bitch probably guessed what lay behind the marriage but i got some of my own back by my introduction elspeth i said this is judy my fathers tart that brought the colour into her face and i left them to get acquainted while i looked for the guvnor he was out as usual so i went straight off in search of cardigan and found him at his town house at first he wouldnt see me when i sent up my card but i pushed his footman out of the way and went up anyway it should have been a stormy interview with high words flying but it wasnt just the sight of him in his morning coat looking as though he had just been inspecting god on parade took the wind out of me when he had demanded to know in his coldest way why i intruded on him i stuttered out my question why was he sending me out of the regiment because of your marriage fwashman says he you must have known very well what the consequences would be it is quite unacceptable you know the lady i have no doubt is an excellent young woman but she is nobody in these circumstances your resignation is imperative but she is respectable my lord i said i assure you she is from an excellent family her father owns a factory he cut in hawhaw it will not do my dear sir did you not think of your position of the wegiment could i answer sir if i were asked and who is mr fwashmans wife oh her father is a gwasgow weaver dont you know but it will ruin me i could have wept at the pure blockheaded snobbery of the man where can i go what regiment will take me if im kicked out of the th you are not being kicked out fwashman he said and was being positively kindly you are wesigning a very different thing hawhaw you are twansferring there is no difficulty i wike you fwashman indeed i had hopes of you but you have destwoyed them with your foolishness indeed i should be extwemely angwy but i shall help in your awwangements i have infwuence at the horse guards you know where am i to go i demanded miserably i have given thought to it let me tell you it would be impwoper to twansfer to another wegiment at home it will be best if you go overseas i think to india yes india i stared at him in horror yes indeed there are caweers to be made there dont you know a few years service there and the matter of your wesigning fwom my wegiment will be forgotten you can come home and be gazetted to some other command he was so bland so sure that there was nothing to say i knew what he thought of me now i had shown myself in his eyes no better than the indian officers whom he despised oh he was being kind enough in his way there were caweers in india all right for the soldier who could get nothing better and who survived the fevers and the heat and the plague and the hostile natives at that moment i was at my lowest the pale haughty face and the soft voice seemed to fade away before me all i was conscious of was a sullen anger and a deep resolve that wherever i went it would not be india not for a thousand cardigans so you wont hey said my father when i told him im damned if i do i said youre damned if you dont chuckled he very amused what else will you do dyou suppose sell out says i not a bit of it says he ive bought your colours and by god youll wear em you cant make me true enough but the day you hand them back on that day the devil a penny youll get out of me how will you live eh and with a wife to support bigad no no harry youve called the tune and you can pay the piper you mean im to go of course youll go look you my son and possibly my heir ill tell you how it is youre a wastrel and a bad lot oh i daresay its my fault among others but thats by the way my father was a bad lot too but i grew up some kind of man you might too for all i know but im certain sure you wont do it here you might do it by reaping the consequences of your own lunacy and that means india dyou follow me but elspeth i said you know its no country for a woman then dont take her not for the first year in any event until youve settled down a bit nice chit she is and dont make piteous eyes at me sir you can do without her a while by all accounts there are women in india and you can be as beastly as you please its not fair i shouted not fair well well this is one lesson youre learning nothings fair you young fool and dont blubber about not wanting to go and leave her shell be safe enough here with you and judy i suppose with me and judy says he very softly and im not sure that the company of a rake and a harlot wont be better for her than yours that was how i came to leave for india how the foundation was laid of a splendid military career i felt myself damnably illused and if i had had the courage i would have told my father to go to the devil but he had me and he knew it even if it hadnt been for the money part of it i couldnt have stood up to him as i hadnt been able to stand up to cardigan i hated them both then i came to think better of cardigan later for in his arrogant pigheaded snobbish way he was trying to be decent to me but my father i never forgave he was playing the swine and he knew it and found it amusing at my expense but what really poisoned me against him was that he didnt believe i cared a button for elspeth there may be better countries for a soldier to serve in than india but i havent seen them you may hear the greenhorns talk about heat and flies and filth and the natives and the diseases the first three you must get accustomed to the fifth you must avoid which you can do with a little common sense and as for the natives well where else will you get such a docile humble set of slaves i liked them better than the scots anyhow their language was easier to understand and if these things were meant to be drawbacks there was the other side in india there was power the power of the white man over the black and power is a fine thing to have then there was ease and time for any amount of sport and good company and none of the restrictions of home you could live as you pleased and lord it among the niggers and if you were welloff and properly connected as i was there was the social life among the best folk who clustered round the governorgeneral and there were as many women as you could wish for there was money to be had too if you were lucky in your campaigns and knew how to look for it in my whole service i never made half as much in pay as i got from india in loot but that is another story i knew nothing of this when we dropped anchor in the highly off calcutta and i looked at the red river banks and sweated in the boiling sun and smelt the stink and wished i was in hell rather than here it had been a damnable fourmonths voyage on board the crowded and sweltering indiaman with no amusement of any kind and i was prepared to find india no better i was to join one of the companys native lancer regiments in the benares district but i never did army inefficiency kept me kicking my heels in calcutta for several weeks before the appropriate orders came through and by that time i had taken fortune by the foreskin in my own way in the first place i messed at the fort with the artillery officers in the native service who were a poor lot and whose messing would have sickened a pig the food was bad to begin with and by the time the black cooks had finished with it you would hardly have fed it to a jackal i said so at our first dinner and provoked a storm among these gentlemen who considered me a johnny newcomer not good enough for the plungers eh says one sorry we have no foiegras for your lordship and we must apologise for the absence of silver plate is it always like this i asked what is it what is the dish your grace asked the wit why its called curry dont you know kills the taste of old meat if thats all it kills im surprised says i disgusted no decent human being could stomach this filth we stomach it said another aint we human beings you know best about that i said if you take my advice youll hang your cook and with that i stalked out leaving them growling after me yet their mess i discovered was no worse than any other in india and better than some the mens messes were indescribable and i wondered how they survived such dreadful food in such a climate the answer was of course that many of them didnt however it was obvious to me that i would be better shifting for myself so i called up basset whom i had brought with me from england the little bastard had blubbered at the thought of losing me when i left the th god knows why gave him a fistful of money and told him to find a cook a butler a groom and half a dozen other servants these people were to be hired for virtually nothing then i went myself to the guard room found a native who could speak english passably well and went out to find a house i found one not far from the fort a pleasant place with a little garden of shrubs and a verandah with screens and my nigger fetched the owner who was a great fat rogue with a red turban we haggled in the middle of a crowd of jabbering blacks and i gave him half what he asked for and settled into the place with my establishment first of all i sent for the cook and told him through my nigger you will cook and cook cleanly youll wash your hands dye see and buy nothingbut the finest meat and vegetables if you dont ill have the cat taken to you until there isnt a strip of hide left on your back he jabbered away nodding and grinning and bowing so i took him by the neck and threw him down and lashed him with my riding whip until he rolled off the verandah screaming tell him hell get that night and morning if his foods not fit to eat i told my nigger and the rest of them may take notice they all howled with fear but they paid heed the cook most of all i took the opportunity to flog one of them every day for their good and my own amusement and to these precautions i attribute the fact that in all my service in india i was hardly ever laid low with anything worse than fever and that you cant avoid the cook was a good cook as it turned out and basset kept the others at it with his tongue and his boot so we did very well my nigger whose name was timbusomethingorother was of great use at first since he spoke english but after a few weeks i got rid of him ive said that i have a gift of language but it was only when i came to india that i realised this my latin and greek had been weak at school for i paid little attention to them but a tongue that you hear spoken about you is a different thing each language has a rhythm for me and my ear catches and holds the sounds i seem to know what a man is saying even when i dont understand the words and my tongue slips easily into any new accent in any event after a fortnight listening to timbu and asked him questions i was speaking hindustani well enough to be understood and i paid him off for one thing i had found a more interesting teacher her name was fetnab and i bought her from a merchant whose livestock consisted of wenches for the british officers and civilian residents in calcutta she cost me rupees which was about guineas and she was a thief s bargain i suppose she was about sixteen with a handsome enough face and a gold stud fixed in her nostril and great slanting brown eyes like most other indian dancing girls she was shaped like an hourglass with a waist that i could span with my two hands fat breasts like melons and a wobbling backside if anything she was a shade too plump but she knew the ninetyseven ways of making love that the hindus are supposed to set much store by though mind you it is all nonsense for the seventyfourth position turns out to be the same as the seventythird but with your fingers crossed but she taught me them all in time for she was devoted to her work and would spend hours oiling herself with perfume all over her body and practising hindu exercises to keep herself supple for nighttime after my first two days with her i thought less and less about elspeth and even josette paled by comparison however i put her to other good uses in between bouts we would talk for she was a great chatterbox and i learned more of the refinements of hindi from her than i would have done from any munshi i give the advice for what it is worth if you wish to learn a foreign tongue properly study it in bed with a native girl id have got more of the classics from an hours wrestling with a greek wench than i did in four years from arnold so this was how i passed my time in calcutta my nights with fetnab my evenings in one of the messes or someones house and my days riding or shooting or hunting or simply wandering about the town itself i became quite a wellknown figure to the niggers because i could speak to them in their own tongue unlike the vast majority of officers at that time even those who had served in india for years were usually too bored to try to learn hindi or thought it beneath them another thing i learned because of the regiment to which i was due to be posted was how to manage a lance i had been useful at sword exercise in the hussars but a lance is something else again any fool can couch it and ride straight but if you are to be any use at all you must be able to handle all nine feet of it so that you can pick a playing card off the ground with the point or pink a running rabbit i was determined to shine among the company men so i hired a native rissalder of the bengal cavalry to teach me i had no thought then of anything beyond tilting at dummies or wild pig sticking and the thought of couching a lance against enemy cavalry was not one that i dwelt on much but those lessons were to save my life once at least so that was more wellspent money they also settled the question of my immediate future in an odd way i was out on the maidan one morning with my rissalder a big lean ugly devil of the pathan people of the frontier named muhammed iqbal he was a splendid horseman and managed a lance perfectly and under his guidance i was learning quickly that morning he had me tilting at pegs and i speared so many that he said grinning that he must charge me more for my lessons we were trotting off the maidan which was fairly empty that morning except for a palankeen escorted by a couple of officers which excited my curiosity a little when iqbal suddenly shouted see huzoor a better target than little pegs and pointed towards a pariah dog which was snuffling about some fifty yards away iqbal couched his lance and went for it but it darted out of his way so i roared tallyho and set off in pursuit iqbal was still ahead of me but i was only a couple of lengths behind when he made another thrust at the pidog which was racing ahead of him swerving and yelping he missed again and yelled a curse and the pidog suddenly turned almost beneath his hooves and leaped up at his foot i dropped my point and by great good luck spitted the beast through the body with a shout of triumph i heaved him twisting and still yelping high into the air and he fell behind me iqbal cried shabash and i was beginning to crow over him when a voice shouted you there you sir come here if you please this moment it came from the palankeen towards which our run had taken us the curtains were drawn and the caller was revealed as a portly fiercelooking gentleman in a frock coat with a sunbrowned face and a fine bald head he had taken off his hat and was waving insistently so i rode across good morning says he very civil may i inquire your name it did not need the presence of the two mounted dandies by the palankeen to tell me that this was a highly senior officer wondering i introduced myself well congratulations mr flashman says he smart a piece of work as ive seen this year if we had a regiment who could all manage a lance as well as you wed have no trouble with damned sikhs and afghans eh bennet indeed not sir said one of the exquisite aides eyeing me mr flashman i seem to know the name are you not lately of the th hussars at home eh whats that said his chief giving me a bright grey eye bigod so he is see his cherrypicker pants i was still wearing the pink breeches of the hussars which strictly i had no right to do but they set off my figure admirably so he is bennet now dammit flashman flashman of course the affair last year youre the deloper well im damned what are you doing here sir in gods name i explained cautiously trying to hint without actually saying so that my arrival in india had followed directly from my meeting with bernier and my questioner whistled and exclaimed in excitement i suppose i was enough of a novelty to rouse his interest and he asked me a good deal about myself which i answered fairly truthfully in my turn i learned as he questioned me that he was general crawford on the staff of the governorgeneral and as such a commander of influence and importance bigod youve had bad luck flashman says he banished from the lofty cherrypickers eh damned nonsense but these blasted militia colonels like cardigan have no sense eh bennet and youre bound for company service are you well the pays good but its a damned shame waste your life teaching the sowars how to perform on galloping field days damned dusty work well well flashman i wish you success good day to you sir and that would have settled that no doubt but for a queer chance i had been sitting with my lance at rest the point six feet above my head and some of the pidogs blood dribbled down onto my hand i gave an exclamation of disgust and turning to iqbal who was sitting silently behind i said khabadar rissaldar larnce sarf karo juldi which is to say look out sergeantmajor take this lance and get it clean quickly and with that i tossed it to him he caught it and i turned back to take my leave of crawford he had stopped in the act of pulling his palankeen curtains here flashman says he how long have you been in india what three weeks you say but you speak the lingo dammit only a word or two sir dont tell me sir i heard several words damned sight more than i learned in thirty years eh bennet too many ees and urns for me but thats damned extraordinary young man howd you pick it up i did more explaining about my gift for languages and he shook his bald head and said hed never heard the like a born linguist and a born lancer bigod rare combination too dam good for company cavalry all ride like pigs anyway look here young flashman i cant think at this time in the morning you call on me tonight dye hear well go into this further hey bennet and presently away he went but i did call on him that evening resplendent in my cherrypicker togs as he called them and he looked at me and said by god emily eden mustnt miss this shed never forgive me to my surprise this was his way of indicating that i should go with him to the governorgenerals palace where he was due for dinner so of course i went and had the privilege of drinking lemonade with their excellencies on their great marble verandah while a splendid company stood about like a small court and i saw more quality in three seconds than in my three weeks in calcutta which was very pleasant but crawford almost spoiled it by telling lord auckland about my duel with bernier at which he and lady emily who was his sister looked rather stiff they were a stuffy pair i thought until i said fairly coolly to crawford that i would have avoided the whole business if i could but it had been forced upon me at this auckland nodded approval and when it came out that i had been under arnold at rugby the old bastard became downright civil lady emily was even more so thank god for cherrypicker pants and when she discovered i was only nineteen years old she nodded sadly and spoke of the fair young shoots on the tree of empire she asked about my family and when she learned i had a wife in england she said so young to be parted how hard the service is her brother observed fairly drily that there was nothing to prevent an officer having his wife in india with him but i muttered something about winning my spurs an inspired piece of nonsense which pleased lady e her brother remarked that an astonishing number of young officers somehow survived the absence of a wifes consolation and crawford chortled but lady e was on my side by now and giving them her shoulder asked where i was to be stationed i told her and since it seemed to me that if i played my cards right i might get a more comfortable posting through her interest governorgenerals aide was actually in my mind i indicated that i had no great enthusiasm for company service dont blame him either said crawford mans a positive pole on horseback shouldnt be wasted eh flashman speaks hindustani too heard him really says auckland that shows a remarkable zeal in study mr flashman but perhaps dr arnold may be to thank for that why must you take mr flashmans credit away from him says lady e i think it is quite unusual i think he should be found a post where his talents can be properly employed do you not agree general own views exactly maam says crawford should have heard him hey rissaldar says he umtiddlyokaro and the fellow understood every word now you can imagine that this was heady stuff to me this morning i had been any old subaltern and here i was hearing compliments from a governorgeneral and general and the first lady of india foolish old trot though she was youre made flashy i thought its the staff for you and aucklands next words seemed to bear out my hopes why not find something for him then says he to crawford general elphinstone was saying only yesterday that he would need a few good gallopers well it wasnt the top of the tree but galloper to a general was good enough for the time being bigod says crawford your excellencys right what dyou say flashman care to ride aide to an army commander hey better than company work at the back of beyond what i naturally said i would be deeply honoured and was starting to thank him but he cut me off youll be more thankful yet when you know where elphinstones servicell take you says he grinning by gad i wish i was your age and had the same chance its a company army mostly of course and a damned good one but it took em a few years of service as it would have taken you to get where they wanted to be i looked all eagerness and lady e sighed and smiled together poor boy she said you must not tease him well it will be out by tomorrow anyway says crawford you dont know elphinstone of course flashman commands the benares division or will do until midnight tonight and then he takes over the army of the indus what about that eh it sounded all right and i made enthusiastic noises aye youre a lucky dog says crawford beaming how many young blades would give their right leg for the chance of service with him in the very place for a dashing lancer to win his spurs bigad a nasty feeling tickled my spine and i asked where that might be why kabul of course says he where else but afghanistan the old fool actually thought i must be delighted at this news and of course i had to pretend to be i suppose any young officer in india would have jumped at the opportunity and i did my best to look gratified and eager but i could have knocked the grinning idiot down i was so angry i had thought i was doing so well what with my sudden introduction to the exalted of the land and all it had won me was a posting to the hottest hardest most dangerous place in the world to judge by all accounts there was talk of nothing but afghanistan in calcutta at that time and of the kabul expedition and most of it touched on the barbarity of the natives and the unpleasantness of the country i could have been sensible i told myself and had myself quietly posted to benares but no i had had to angle round lady emily and now looked like getting my throat cut for my pains thinking quickly i kept my eager smile in place but wondered whether general elphinstone might not have preferences of his own when it came to choosing an aide there might be others i thought who had a better claim nonsense says crawford he would go bail elphinstone would be delighted to have a man who could talk the language and handle a lance like a cossack and lady emily said she was sure he would find a place for me so there was no way out i was going to have to take it and pretend that i liked it that night i gave fetnab the soundest thrashing of her pampered life and broke a pot over the sweepers head i was not even given a decent time to prepare myself general elphinstone received me next day and turned out to be an elderly fussy man with a brown wrinkled face and heavy white whiskers he was kind enough in a doddering way and as unlikely a commander of armies as you could imagine being nearly sixty and not too well either it is a great honour to me says he speaking of his new command but i wish it had fallen on younger shoulders indeed i am sure it should he shook his head and looked gloomy and i thought well heres a fine one to take the field with however he welcomed me to his staff damn him and said it was most opportune he could use me at once since his present aides were used to his service he would keep them with him just now to prepare for the journey he would send me in advance to kabul which meant i supposed that i was to herald his coming and see that his quarters were swept out for his arrival so i had to gather up my establishment hire camels and mules for their transport lay in stores for the journey and generally go to a deal of expense and bother my servants kept well out of my way in those days i can tell you and fetnab went about whimpering and rolling her eyes i told her to shut up or i would give her to the afghans when we got to kabul and she was so terrified that she actually kept quiet however after my first disappointment i realised there was no sense crying over spilt milk and looked on the bright side i was after all to be aide to a general which would be helpful in years to come and gave one great distinction afghanistan was at least quiet for the moment and elphy beys term of command could hardly last long at his age i could take fetnab and my household with me including basset and with elphy beys influence i was allowed to enlist muhammed iqbal in my party he spoke pushtu of course which is the language of the afghans and could instruct me as we went also he was an excellent fellow to have beside you and would be an invaluable companion and guide before we started out i got hold of as much information as i could about matters in afghanistan they seemed to stand damned riskily to me and there were others in calcutta but not auckland who was an ass who shared this view the reason we had sent an expedition to kabul which is in the very heart of some of the worst country in the world was that we were afraid of russia afghanistan was a buffer if you like between india and the turkestan territory which russia largely influenced and the russians were forever meddling in afghan affairs in the hope of expanding southwards and perhaps seizing india itself so afghanistan mattered very much to us and thanks to that conceited scotch buffoon burnes the british government had invaded the country if you please and put our puppet king shah sujah on the throne in kabul in place of old dost mohammed who was suspected of russian sympathies i believe from all i saw and heard that if he had russian sympathies it was because we drove him to them by our stupid policy at any rate the kabul expedition succeeded in setting sujah on the throne and old dost was politely locked up in india so far so good but the afghans didnt like sujah at all and we had to leave an army in kabul to keep him on his throne this was the army that elphy bey was to command it was a good enough army part queens troops part companys with british regiments as well as native ones but it was having its work cut out trying to keep the tribes in order for apart from dosts supporters there were scores of little petty chiefs and tyrants who lost no opportunity of causing trouble in the unsettled times and the usual afghan pastimes of bloodfeud robbery and murderforfun were going ahead full steam our army prevented any big rising for the moment anyway but it was forever patrolling and manning little forts and trying to pacify and buy off the robber chiefs and people were wondering how long this could go on the wise ones said there was an explosion coming and as we started out on our journey from calcutta my foremost thought was that whoever got blown up it should not be me it was just my luck that i was going to end up on top of the bonfire travelling i think is the greatest bore in life so ill not weary you with an account of the journey from calcutta to kabul it was long and hot and damnably dull if basset and i had not taken muhammed iqbals advice and shed our uniforms for native dress i doubt whether we would have survived in desert on scrubby plain through rocky hills in the forests in the little mud villages and camps and towns the heat was horrible and ceaseless your skin scorched your eyes burned and you felt that your body was turning into a dry bag of bones but in the loose robes and pyjamy trousers one felt cooler that is one fried without burning quite black basset iqbal and i rode horses the servants tramped behind with fetnab in a litter but our pace was so slow that after a week we got rid of them all but the cook the servants we turned off amid great lamentations and fetnab i sold to a major in the artillery whose camp we passed through i regretted that for she had become a habit but she was peevish on the journey and too tired and mopish at night to be much fun still i cant recall a wench i enjoyed more we pushed on faster after that west and then northwest over the plains and great rivers of the punjab through the sikh country and up to peshawar which is where india ends there was nothing to remind you of calcutta now here the heat was dry and glaring and so were the people lean ugly jewishlooking creatures armed and ready for mischief by the look of them but none was uglier or looked readier for mischief than the governor of the place a great greybearded ox of a man in a dirty old uniform coat baggy trousers and goldtasselled forage cap he was an italian of all things with the spiky waxed moustache that you see on organgrinders nowadays and he spoke english with a dreadful dago american accent his name was avitabile and the sikhs and afghans were more scared of him than of the devil himself he had drifted to india as a soldier of fortune commanded shah sujahs army and now had the job of keeping the passes open to our people in kabul he did it admirably in the only way those brutes understood by fear and force there were five dead afghans swinging in the sunlight from his gateway arch when we rode through which was both reassuring and unnerving at once no one minded them more than if they had been swatted flies least of all avitabile who had strung them up goddam boy says he how you think i keep the peace if i don keep killing these bastards these are gilzais you know that good gilzais now ive tended to them the bad gilzais are up in the hills between here and kabul watchin the passes and lickin their lips and thinkin but thinkins all they do just now cos of avitabile sure we pay em to be quiet you think that would stop them no sir fear of avitabile and he jerked a huge thumb at his chest fears what stops em but if i stopped hangin em now and then theyd stop bein afraid see he had me to dinner that night and we ate an excellent stew of chicken and fruit on a terrace looking over the dirty rooftops of peshawar with the sounds and smells of the bazaar floating up to us avitabile was a good host and talked all night of naples and women and drink he seemed to take a fancy to me and we got very drunk together he was one of your noisy bellowing drunkards and we sang uproariously i remember but at dawn as we were staggering to our beds he stopped outside my room with his great dirty hand on my shoulder and looked at me with his bright grey eyes and said in a very sober quiet voice boy i think you are another like me at heart a condottieri a rascal maybe with a little honour a little courage i dont know but see now you are going beyond the khyber and some day soon the gilzais and others will be afraid no longer against that day get a swift horse and some afghans you can trust there are some like the kuzzilbashis and if the day comes dont wait to die on the field of honour he said it without a sneer heroes draw no higher wages than the others boy sleep well and he nodded and stumped off down the passage with his gold cap still firmly on his head in my drunken state i took little heed of what he had said but it came back to me later in the morning we rode north into one of the worlds awful places the great pass of the khyber where the track twists among the sunscorched cliffs and the peaks seem to crouch in ambush for the traveller there was some traffic on the road and we passed a commissary train on its way to kabul but most of those we saw were afghan hillmen rangy warriors in skull caps or turbans and long coats with immensely long rifles called jezzails at their shoulders and the khyber knife in their belts muhammed iqbal was gay at returning to his own place and had me airing my halting pushtu on those we spoke to they seemed taken aback to find an english officer who had their own tongue however crudely and were friendly enough but i didnt like the look of them you could see treachery in their dark eyes besides there is something odd about men who look like satan and yet wear ringlets and lovelocks hanging out beneath their turbans we were three nights on the road beyond the khyber and the country got more hellish all the way it beat me how a british army with all its thousands of followers and carts and wagons and guns had ever got over those flinty paths but at last we came to kabul and i saw the great fortress of bala hissar lowering over the city and beyond it to the right the neat lines of the cantonment beside the waters edge where the red tunics showed like tiny dolls in the distance and the sound of a bugle came faintly over the river it was very pretty in the summers evening with the orchards and gardens before us and the squalor of kabul town hidden behind the bala hissar aye it was pretty then we crossed the kabul river bridge and when i had reported myself and bathed and changed into my regimentals i was directed to the general commanding to whom i was to deliver despatches from elphy bey his name was sir willoughby cotton and he looked it for he was round and fat and redfaced when i found him he was being hectored by a tall finelooking officer in faded uniform and i at once learned two things in the kabul garrison there was no sense of privacy or restraint and the most senior officers never thought twice about discussing their affairs before their juniors the biggest damned fool this side of the indus the tall officer was saying when i presented myself i tell you cotton this army is like a bear in a trap if theres a rising where are you stuck helpless in the middle of a people who hate your innards a week from the nearest friendly garrison with a bloody fool like mcnaghten writing letters to that even bloodier fool auckland in calcutta that everythings all right god help us and theyre relieving you god be thanked said cotton and sending us elphy bey wholl be under mcnaghtens thumb and isnt fit to command an escort anyway the worst of it is mcnaghten and the other political asses think we are safe as on salisbury plain burnes is as bad as the rest not that he thinks of anything but afghan women but theyre all so sure theyre right thats what upsets me and who the devil are you this was to me i bowed and presented my letters to cotton who seemed glad of the interruption glad to see you sir says he dropping the letters on the desk elphys herald eh well well flashman did you say now thats odd there was a flashman with me at rugby oh forty years ago any relation my father sir ye dont say well im damned flashys boy and he beamed all over his red face why it must be forty years hes well i trust excellent excellent whatll you have sir glass of wine here bearer of course your father will have spoke of me eh i was quite a card at school got expelled dye know this was too good a chance to miss so i said i was expelled from rugby too sir good god you dont say what for sir drunkenness sir no well damme whod have believed they would kick you out for that theyll be expellin for rape next wouldnt have done in my time i was expelled for mutiny sir yes mutiny led the whole school in revolt splendid well heres your health sir the officer in the faded coat who had been looking pretty sour remarked that expulsion from school was all very well but what concerned him was expulsion from afghanistan pardon me said cotton wiping his lips forgot my manners mr flashman general nott general nott is up from kandahar where he commands we were discussing the state of the army in afghanistan no no flashman sit down this aint calcutta on active service the more you know the better pray proceed nott so i sat a little bewildered and flattered for generals dont usually talk before subalterns while nott resumed his tirade it seemed that he had been offended by some communication from mcnaghten sir william mcnaghten envoy to kabul and head british civilian in the country nott was appealing to cotton to support him in protest but cotton didnt seem to care for the idea it is a simple question of policy said nott the country whatever mcnaghten may think is hostile and we have to treat it as such we do this in three ways through the influence which sujah exerts on his unwilling subjects which is little enough through the force of our army here which with respect is not as allpowerful as mcnaghten imagines since youre outnumbered fifty to one by one of the fiercest warrior nations in the world and thirdly by buying the good will of important chiefs with money am i right talking like a book said cotton fill your glass mr flashman if one of those three instruments of policy fails sujah our strength or our money were done for oh i know im a croaker as mcnaghten would say he thinks we are as secure here as on horse guards hes wrong you know we exist on sufferance and there wont be much of that if he takes up this idea of cutting the subsidy to the gilzai chiefs it would save money said cotton anyway its no more than a thought as i understand it would save money if you didnt buy a bandage when you were bleeding to death said nott at which cotton guffawed aye laugh sir willoughby but this is a serious matter cutting the subsidy is no more than a thought you say very good it may never happen but if the gilzais so much as suspect it might how long will they continue to keep the passes open they sit above the khyber your lifeline remember and let our convoys come and go but if they think their subsidy is in danger theyll look for another source of revenue and that will mean convoys ambushed and looted and a very pretty business on your hands that is why mcnaghtens a fool even to think of cutting the subsidy let alone talk about it what do you want me to do says cotton frowning tell him to drop the notion at all costs he wont listen to me and send someone to talk to the gilzais take a few gifts to old whatshisname at mogala sher afzul he has the other gilzai khans under his thumb im told you know a lot about this country said cotton wagging his head considering this aint your territory someones got to said nott thirty years in the companys service teaches you a thing or two i wish i thought mcnaghten had learned as much but he goes his way happily seeing no farther than the end of his nose well well cotton youre one of the lucky ones youll be getting out in time cotton protested at this that he was a croaker after all i soon discovered that the word was applied to everyone who ventured to criticise mcnaghten or express doubts about the safety of the british force in kabul they talked for a while and cotton was very civil to me and seemed intent on making me feel at home we dined in his headquarters with his staff and there for the first time i met some of the men many of them fairly junior officers whose names were to be household words in england within the next year sekundar burnes with his mincing scotch voice and pretty little moustache george broadfoot another scotsman who sat next to me vincent eyre gentleman jim skinner colonel oliver and various others they talked with a freedom that was astonishing criticising or defending their superiors in the presence of general officers condemning this policy and praising that and cotton and nott joined in there was not much good said about mcnaghten and a general gloom about the armys situation it seemed to me they scared rather easily and i told broadfoot so wait till yeve been here a month or two and yell be as bad as the rest he said brusquely its a bad place and a bad people and if we dont have war on our hands inside a year ill be surprised have you heard of akbar khan no hes the son of the old king dost mohammed that we deposed for this clown sujah and hes in the hills now going from this chief to that gathering support for the day when hell raise the country against us mcnaghten wont believe it of course but hes a gommeril could we not hold kabul i asked surely with a force of five thousand it should be possible against undisciplined savages these savages are good men says he better shots than we are for one thing and were badly placed here with no proper fortifications for the cantonment even the stores are outside the perimeter and an army thats going downhill with soft living and bad discipline forbye we have our families with us and thats a bad thing when the bullets are flying who thinks of his duty when he has his wife and weans to care for and elphy bey is to command us when cotton goes he shook his head youll know him better than i but id give my next years pay to hear he wasnt coming and we had nott instead id sleep at nights anyway this was depressing enough but in the next few weeks i heard this kind of talk on all hands there was obviously no confidence in the military or political chiefs and the afghans seemed to sense this for they were an insolent crowd and had no great respect for us as an aide to elphy bey who was still on his road north i had time on my hands to look about kabul which was a great filthy sprawling place full of narrow lanes and smelling abominably but we seldom went there for the folk hardly made us welcome and it was pleasant out by the cantonment where there was little attention to soldiering but a great deal of horseracing and lounging in the orchards and gossiping on the verandahs over cool drinks there were even cricket matches and i played myself i had been a great bowler at rugby and my new friends made more of the wickets i took than of the fact that i was beginning to speak pushtu better than any of them except burnes and the politicals it was at one of these matches that i first saw shah sujah the king who had come down as the guest of mcnaghten he was a portly brownbearded man who stood gravely contemplating the game and when mcnaghten asked him how he liked it said strange and manifold are the ways of god as for mcnaghten himself i despised him on sight he had a clerks face with a pointed nose and chin and peered through his spectacles suspiciously sniffing at you he was vain as a peacock though and would strut about in his tall hat and frockcoat lording it greatly with his nose turned up it was evident as someone said that he saw only what he wanted to see anyone else would have realised that his army was in a mess for one thing but not mcnaghten he even seemed to think that sujah was popular with the people and that we were honoured guests in the country if he had heard the men in the bazaar calling us kaffirs he might have realised his mistake but he was too lofty to hear however i passed the time pleasantly enough burnes the political agent when he heard about my pushtu took some interest in me and as he kept a splendid table and was an influential fellow i kept in with him he was a pompous fool of course but he knew a good deal about the afghans and would go about from time to time in native dress mixing with the crowds in the bazaar listening to gossip and keeping his nose to the wind generally he had another reason for this of course which was that he was forever in pursuit of some afghan woman or other and had to go to the city to find them i went with him on these expeditions frequently and very rewarding they were afghan women are handsome rather than pretty but they have this great advantage to them that their own men dont care for them overmuch afghan men would as soon be perverts as not and have a great taste for young boys it would sicken you to see them mooning over these painted youths as though they were girls and our troops thought it a tremendous joke however it meant that the afghan women were always hungry for men and you could have your pick of them tall graceful creatures they were with long straight noses and proud mouths running more to muscle than fat and very active in bed of course the afghans didnt care for this which was another score against us where they were concerned the first weeks passed as i say pleasantly and i was beginning to like kabul in spite of the pessimists when i was shaken out of my pleasant rut thanks to my friend burnes and the anxieties of general nott who had gone back to kandahar but left his warnings ringing in sir willoughby cottons ears they must have rung an alarm for when he sent for me to his office in the cantonment he was looking pretty glum with burnes at his elbow flashman says cotton sir alexander here tells me you get along famously with the afghans thinking of the women i agreed hm well and you talk their frightful lingo passably well sir that means a dam sight better than most of us well i daresay i shouldnt do it but on sir alexanders suggestion here burnes gave me a smile which i felt somehow boded no good and since youre the son of an old friend im going to give you some work to do work whichll help your advancement let me say if you do it well dyou see he stared at me a moment and growled to burnes dammit sandy hes devilish young yknow no younger than i was says burnes umph oh well i suppose its all right now look here flashman you know about the gilzais i suppose they control the passes between here and india and are devilish tricky fellows you were with me when nott was talking about their subsidy and how there were rumours that the politicals would cut it dam fools with all respect sandy well it will be cut in time but for the present its imperative they should be told that alls well dyou see sir william mcnaghten has agreed to this fact is hes written letters to sher afzul at mogala and hes the leader of the pack so to speak this seemed to me a pretty piece of duplicity on mcnaghtens part but it was typical of our dealings with the afghans as i was to discover youre going to be our postman like mr rowland hills fellows at home youll take the messages of good will to sher afzul hand em over say how splendid everything is be polite to the old devil hes halfmad by the way set his mind at rest if hes still worried about the subsidy and so forth it will all be in the letters says burnes you must just give any added reassurances that may be needed all right flashman says cotton good experience for you diplomatic mission what its very important says burnes you see if they thought there was anything wrong or grew suspicious it could be bad for us it could be a damned sight worse for me i thought i didnt like this idea above half all i knew of the gilzais was that they were murderous brutes like all country afghans and the thought of walking into their nests up in the hills with not the slightest hope of help if there was trouble well kabul might not be hyde park but at least it was safe for the present and what the afghan women did to prisoners was enough to start my stomach turning at the thought id heard the stories some of this must have showed in my face for cotton asked fairly sharply what was the matter didnt i want to go of course sir i lied but well im pretty raw i know a more experienced officer dont fret yourself says burnes smiling youre more at home with these folk than some men with twenty years in the service he winked ive seen you flashman remember hahha and youve got what they call a fools face no disrespect it means you look honest besides the fact that you have some pushtu will win their confidence but as general elphinstones aide should i not be here elphy aint due for a week snapped cotton dammit man this is an opportunity any young feller in your shoes would be bursting to go i saw it would be bad to try to make further excuses so i said i was all eagerness of course and had only wanted to be sure i was the right man and so forth that settled it burnes took me to the great wall map and showed me where mogala was needless to say it was at the back of nowhere about fifty miles from kabul in hellish hill country south of the jugdulluk pass he pointed out the road we should take assuring me i should have a good guide and produced the sealed packet i was to deliver to the halfmad sher afzul make sure they go into his own hands he told me hes a good friend to us just now but i dont trust his nephew gul shah he was too thick with akbar khan in the old days if theres ever trouble among the gilzais it will come from gul so watch out for him and i dont have to tell you to be careful of old afzul hes sharp when hes sane which he is most of the time hes lord of life and death in his own parish and that includes you not that hes likely to offer you harm but keep on his good side i began to wonder if i could manage to fall ill in the next hour or two jaundice possibly or something infectious cotton set the final seal on it if theres trouble says he you must just ride for it to this fatherly advice he and burnes added a few words about how i should conduct myself if the matter of subsidy was discussed with me bidding me be reassuring at all costs no thought of who should reassure me i may say and dismissed me burnes said they had high hopes of me a sentiment i found it difficult to share however there was nothing for it and next morning found me on the road east with iqbal and an afghan guide on either side and five troopers of the th lancers for escort it was a tiny enough guard to be useless against anything but a stray robber and afghanistan never lacked for those but it gave me some heart and what with the fresh morning air and the thought that all would probably be well and the mission another small stepping stone in the career of lieutenant flashman i felt rather more cheerful the sergeant in charge of the lancers was called hudson and he had already shown himself a steady and capable man before setting out he had suggested i leave behind my sabre they were poor weapons the army swords and turned in your grip and take instead one of the persian scimitars that some of the afghans used they were light and strong and damned sharp he had been very businesslike about it and about such matters as rations for the men and fodder for the horses he was one of those quiet middlesized squareset men who seem to know exactly what they are doing and it was good to have him and iqbal at my back our first days march took us as far as khoordkabul and on the second we left the track at tezeen and went southeast into the hills the going had been rough enough on the path but now it was frightful the land was all sunscorched rock and jagged peaks with stony defiles that were like ovens where the ponies stumbled over the loose stones we hardly saw a living creature for twenty miles after we left tezeen and when night came we were camped on a high pass in the lee of a cliff that might have been the wall of hell it was bitter cold and the wind howled up the pass far away a wolf wailed and we had barely enough wood to keep our fire going i lay in my blanket cursing the day i got drunk at rugby and wishing i were snug in a warm bed with elspeth or fetnab or josette next day we were picking our way up a long stony slope when iqbal muttered and pointed and far ahead on a rocky shoulder i made out a figure which vanished almost as soon as i saw it gilzai scout said iqbal and in the next hour we saw a dozen more of them as we rode upwards we were aware of them in the hills on either side behind boulders or on the ledges and in the last few miles there were horsemen shadowing us on either side and behind then we came out of a defile and the guide pointed ahead to a height crowned with a great grey fortress with a round tower behind its outer wall and a cluster of huts outside its embattled gate this was mogala stronghold of the gilzai chieftain sher afzul i seldom saw a place i liked less at first sight we went forward at a canter and the horsemen who had been following us galloped into the open on either side keeping pace to the fort but not approaching too close to us they rode afghan ponies carried long jezzails and lances and were a toughlooking crowd some wore mail over their robes and a few had spiked helmets they looked like warriors from an eastern fairy tale with their outlandish clothes and fierce bearded faces and of course they were close by the gate was a row of four wooden crosses and to my horror i realised that the blackened twisted things nailed to them were human bodies sher afzul obviously had his own notions of discipline one or two of the troopers muttered at the sight and there were anxious glances at our shadowers who had lined up on either side of the gateway i was feeling a trifle wobbly myself but i thought to hell with these blackamoors we are englishmen and so i said come on lads ride to attention and we clattered under the frowning gateway i suppose mogala is about a quarter of a mile from wall to wall but inside its battlements in addition to its huge keep there were barracks and stables for sher afzuls warriors storehouses and armouries and the house of the khan himself in fact it was more of a little palace than a house for it stood in a pretty garden under the shadow of the outer wall shaded by cypress tress and it was furnished inside like something from burtons arabian nights there were tapestries on the walls carpets on the paved floor intricately carved wood screens in the archways and a general air of luxury he did himself well i thought but he took no chances there were sentries all over the place big men and well armed sher afzul turned out to be a man about sixty with a beard dyed jet black and a lined ugly face whose main features were two fierce burning eyes that looked straight through you he received me civilly enough in his fine presence chamber where he sat on a small throne with his court about him but i couldnt doubt burness assertion that he was halfmad his hands twitched continuously and he had a habit of jerking his turbanned head in a most violent fashion as he spoke but he listened attentively as one of his ministers read aloud mcnaghtens letter and seemed satisfied and he and his people exclaimed with delight over the present that cotton had sent a pair of very handsome pistols by manton in a velvet case with a matching shot pouch and powder flask nothing would do but we must go straight into the garden for the khan to try them out he was a rotten shot but at the fourth attempt he managed to blow the head off a very handsome parrot which sat chained on a perch screeching at the explosions until the lucky shot put an end to it there was loud applause and sher afzul wagged his head and seemed well pleased a splendid gift he told me and i was pleased to find that my pushtu was quite good enough for me to follow him you are the more welcome flashman bahadur in that your guns are true by god it is a soldiers weapon i said i was delighted and had the happy idea of presenting one of my own pistols on the spot to the khans son a bright handsome lad of about sixteen called ilderim he shouted with delight and his eyes shone as he handled the weapon i was off to a good start then one of the courtiers came forward and i felt a prickle up my spine as i looked at him he was a tall man as tall as i was with those big shoulders and the slim waist of an athlete his coat was black and well fitting he wore long boots and there was a silk sash round his waist to carry his sabre on his head he had one of those polished steel casques with vertical prongs and the face under it was strikingly handsome in the rather pretty eastern way which i personally dont like you have seen them straight nose very full lips womans cheeks and jaw he had a forked beard and two of the coldest eyes i ever saw i put him down as a nasty customer and i was right i can kill parrots with a sling he said are the feringhee pistols good for anything else sher afzul damned his eyes more or less for casting doubts on his fine new weapons and thrusting one into the fellows hand told him to try his luck and to my amazement the brute turned straight about drew a bead on one of the slaves working in the garden and shot him on the spot i was shaken i can tell you i stared at the twitching body on the grass and the khan wagging his head and at the murderer handing back the pistol with a shrug of course it was only a nigger he had killed and i knew that among afghans life is dirt cheap they think no more of killing a human being than you and i do of shooting a pheasant or catching a fish but its a trifle unsettling to a man of my temperament to know that he is in the power for guest or no i was in their power of blackguards who kill as wantonly and readily as that that thought more than the killing itself rattled me young ilderim noticed this and rebuked the blackcoated man not for murder mark you but for discourtesy to a guest one does not bite the coin of the honoured stranger gul shah was what he said meaning you dont look a gift horse in the mouth for the moment i was too fascinated at what i had seen to pay much heed but as the khan talking rapidly escorted me inside again i remembered that this gul shah was the customer burnes had warned me about the friend of the archrebel akbar khan i kept an eye on him as i talked with sher afzul and it seemed to me he kept an eye on me in return sher afzul talked sanely enough mostly about hunting and bloodletting of a sterner kind but you couldnt miss the wild gleam in his eye or the fact that his evil temper was never far from the surface he was used to playing the tyrant and only to young ilderim whom he adored was he more than civil he snarled at gul from time to time but the big man looked him in the eye and didnt seem put out that evening we dined in the khans presence chamber sitting about on cushions forking with our fingers into the bowls of stew and rice and fruit and drinking a pleasant afghan liquor which had no great body to it there would be about a dozen there including gul shah and after we had eaten and belched accordingly sher afzul called for entertainment this consisted of a good conjurer and a few weedy youths with native flutes and tomtoms and three or four dancing girls i had pretended to be amused by the conjurer and musicians but one of the dancing girls struck me as being worth more than a polite look she was a glorious creature very tall and longlegged with a sulky cold face and hair that had been dyed bright red and hung down in a tail to her backside it was about all the covering she had for the rest she wore satin trousers clasped low on her hips and two brass breastplates which she removed at sher afzuls insistence he beckoned her to dance close in front of him and the sight of the golden nearnaked body writhing and quivering made me forget where i was for the moment by the time she had finished her dance with the tomtoms throbbing and the sweat glistening on her painted face i must have been eating her alive with my eyes as she salaamed to sher afzul he suddenly grabbed her by the arm and pulled her towards him and i noticed gul shah lean forward suddenly on his cushion sher afzul saw it too for he looked one way and the other grinning wickedly and with his free hand began to fondle the girls body she took it with a face like stone but gul was glowering like thunder sher afzul cackled and said to me you like her flashman bahadur is she the kind of shecat you delight to scratch with here then she is yours and he shoved her so hard towards me that she fell headlong into my lap i caught her and with an oath gul shah was on his feet his hand dropping to his hilt she is not for any frank dog he shouted by god is she not roared sher afzul who says so gul shah told him who said so and there was a pretty little exchange which ended with sher afzul ordering him from the room and it seemed to me that the girls eyes followed him with disappointment as he stamped off sher afzul apologised for the disturbance and said i must not mind gul shah who was an impudent bastard and very greedy where women were concerned did i like the girl her name was narreeman and if she did not please me i was not to hesitate to flog her to my hearts content all this i saw was deliberately aimed at gul shah who presumably lusted after this female himself thus giving sher afzul a chance to torment him it was a dilemma for me i had no desire to antagonise gul shah but i could not afford to refuse sher afzuls hospitality so to speak also the hospitality was very warm and naked and was lying across my lap gasping still from the exertion of her dance and causing me considerable excitement so i accepted at once and waited impatiently while the time wore on with sher afzul talking interminably about his horses and his dogs and his falcons at last it was over and with narreeman following i was conducted to the private room that had been allotted to me it was a beautiful balmy evening with the scents wafting in from the garden and i was looking forward to a sleepless night as it turned out it was a tremendous sell for she simply lay like a side of beef staring at the roof as though i werent there i coaxed at first and then threatened and then taking sher afzuls advice i pulled her across my knees and smartened her up with my riding switch at this she suddenly rounded on me like a panther snarling and clawing and narrowly missed raking my eyes i was so enraged that i laid into her for all i was worth but she fought like fury naked as she was and only when i got home a few good cuts did she try to run for it i hauled her away from the door and after a vicious struggle i managed to rape her the only time in my life i have found it necessary by the way it has its points but i shouldnt care to do it regularly i prefer willing women afterwards i shoved her out id no wish to get a thumbnail in my eye during the night and the guards took her away she had not uttered a word the whole time sher afzul seeing my scratched face in the morning demanded details and he and his toadies crowed which delight when i told them gul shah was not present but i had no doubt willing tongues would bear the tale to him not that i cared and there i made a mistake gul was only a nephew of sher afzul and a bastard at that but he was a power among the gilzais for his fighting skill and was itching to topple old sher afzul and steal his throne it would have been a poor lookout for the kabul garrison if he had succeeded for the gilzais were trembling in the balance all the time about us and gul would have tipped the scale he hated the british and in afzuls place would have closed the passes even if it had meant losing the lakhs that were paid from india to keep them open but afzul although ageing was too tough and clever to be deposed just yet and ilderim though only a boy was well liked and regarded as certain to succeed him and both of them were friendly and could sway the other gilzai chieftains a good deal of this i learned in the next two days in which i and my party were the honoured guests of mogala i kept my eyes and ears open and the gilzais were most hospitable from afzul down to the villagers whose huts crouched outside the wall this i will say for the afghan he is a treacherous evil brute when he wants to be but while he is your friend he is a firstrate fellow the point is you must judge to a second when he is going to cease to be friendly there is seldom any warning looking back though i can say that i probably got on better with the afghans than most britons do i imagine thomas hughes would have said that in many respects of character i resembled them and i wouldnt deny it however it may be i enjoyed those first two days we had horse races and other riding competitions and i earned a good deal of credit by showing them how a persian pony can be put over the jumps then there was hawking in which sher afzul was an adept and tremendous feasting at nights and sher afzul gave me another dancing girl with much cackling and advice on how to manage her which advice proved to be unnecessary but while it was pleasant enough you could never forget that in afghanistan you are walking a knifeedge the whole time and that these were cruel and bloodthirsty savages four men were executed on the second day for armed robbery in front of a delighted crowd in the courtyard and a fifth a petty chieftain was blinded by sher afzuls physician this is a common punishment among the afghans if a man is too important to be slaughtered like an ordinary felon they take away his sight so that he can do no more harm it was a sickening business and one of my troopers got into a fight with a gilzai over it calling them filthy foreigners which they could not understand a blind man is a dead man was how they put it and i had to make excuses to sher afzul and instruct sergeant hudson to give the trooper a punishment drill in all this i had nearly forgotten gul shah and the narreeman affair which was careless i had my reminder on the third morning when i was least expecting it sher afzul had said we must go boarhunting and we had a good hours sport in the thicketed gullies of the mogala valley where the wild pigs bred there were about twenty of us including hudson muhammed iqbal and myself with sher afzul directing operations it was exciting work but difficult in that close country and we were frequently separated muhammed iqbal and i made one sortie which took us well away from the main body into a narrow defile where the forest ended and there they were waiting for us four horsemen with spears couched who made not a sound but thundered straight down on us instinctively i knew they were guls people bent on murdering me and no doubt compromising sher afzul with the british at the same time iqbal being a pathan and loving a fight gave a yell of delight come on huzoor and went for them i didnt hesitate if he wanted to take on odds it was his affair i wheeled my pony and went hellforleather for the forest with one eye cocked over my shoulder for safety whether he realised i was leaving him alone i dont know it wouldnt have made any difference to him like me he had a lance but in addition he had a sword and pistol in his belt so he got rid of the lance at once hurling it into the chest of the leading gilzai and driving into the other three with his sabre swinging he cut one down but the other two swerved past him it was me they wanted i dug my spurs in as they came tearing after me with iqbal wheeling after them in turn he was bawling at me to turn and fight the fool but i had no thought but to get away from those hellish lancepoints and the wolflike bearded faces behind them i rode like fury and then the pony stumbled and i went over his head crashing into the bushes and finishing up on pile of stones with all the breath knocked out of me the bushes saved me for the gilzais couldnt come at me easily they had to swerve round the clump and i scrambled behind a tree one of the ponies reared up and nearly knocked the other off balance the rider yelled and had to drop his lance to save being thrown and then iqbal was on them howling his warcry the gilzai who was clutching his ponys mane was glaring at me and cursing and suddenly the snarling face was literally split down the middle as iqbals sabre came whistling down on his head shearing through cap and skull as if they had been putty the other rider who had been trying to get in a thrust at me round the treetrunk wheeled as iqbal wrenched his sword free and the pair of them closed as their ponies crashed into each other for one cursing frantic moment they were locked together iqbal trying to get his point into the others side and the gilzai with his dagger out thrusting at iqbals body i heard the thuds as the blows struck and iqbal shouting huzoor huzoor and then the ponies parted and the struggling men crashed into the dust from behind my tree i suddenly noticed that my lance was lying within a yard of me where it had dropped in my fall why i didnt follow the instinct of a lifetime and simply run for it and leave them to fight it out i dont know probably i had some thought of possible disgrace anyway i darted out and grabbed the lance and as the gilzai struggled uppermost and raised his bloody knife i jammed the lancepoint squarely into his back he screamed and dropped the knife and then lurched into the dust kicking and clutching and died iqbal tried to struggle up but he was done for his face was grey and there was a great crimson stain welling through his shirt he was glaring at me and as i ran to him he managed to rear up on one elbow soor kabaj he gasped ya huzoor soor kabaj then he groaned and fell back but as i knelt over him his eyes opened for a moment and he gave a little moan and spat in my face as best he could so he died calling me son of a swine in hindi which is the muslims crowning insult i saw his point of view of course so there i was and there also were five dead men at least four were dead and the one whom iqbal had sabred first was lying a little way up the defile groaning with the side of his skull split i was shaken by my fall and the scuffle but it came to me swiftly that the quicker that one breathed his last the better so i hurried up with my lance took a rather unsteady aim and drove it into his throat and i had just jerked it out and was surveying the shambles when there was a cry and a clatter of hooves and sergeant hudson came galloping out of the wood he took it in at a glance the corpses the bloodstained ground and the gallant flashy standing in the middle the sole survivor but like the competent soldier he was as soon as he realised that i was all right he went round the bodies to make sure no one was playing possum he whistled sadly over iqbal and then said quietly orders sir i was getting my wind and my senses back and wondering what to do next this was guls work i was sure but what would sher afzul do about it he might argue that here was his credit destroyed with the british anyway and make the best of a bad job by cutting all our throats this was a happy thought but before i had time to digest it there was a crashing and hallooing in the woods and out came the rest of the hunting party with afzul at their head perhaps my fear sharpened my wits it often does but i saw in a flash that the best course was to take a damned high hand so before they had done more than shout their astonishment and call on the name of god and come piling off their ponies i had strode forward to where afzul was sitting his horse and i shook the bloody lance point under his nose gilzai hospitality i roared look on it my servant murdered myself escaped by a miracle is this gilzai honour he glared at me like someone demented his mouth working horribly and for a minute i thought we were done for then he covered his face with his hands and began bawling about shame and disgrace and the guests who had eaten his salt he was mad enough at the moment i think and probably a good thing too for he kept wailing on in the same strain and tearing at his beard and finally he rolled out of the saddle and began beating at the ground his creatures hurried round him lamenting and calling on allah all except young ilderim who simply gazed at the carnage and said this is gul shahs doing my father this brought old afzul up short and he set off on a new tack raving about how he would tear out guls eyes and entrails and hang him on hooks to die by inches and more excellent ideas i turned my back on him and mounted the pony which hudson had brought and at this afzul came hurrying up to me and grabbed my boot and swore with froth on his lips that this assault on my person and his honour would be most horribly avenged my person is my affair says i very britishofficerlike and your honour is yours i accept your apology he raved some more at this and then began imploring me to tell him what he could do to put things right he was in a rare taking for his honour and no doubt his subsidy and swore that anything i named should be done only let him and his be forgiven my life my sons life tribute treasure flashman bahadur hostages i will go to mcnaghten huzoor and humble myself i will pay he went babbling on until i cut him short by saying that we did not accept such things as payment for debts of honour but i saw that i had better go a little easier while his mood lasted so i ended by saying that but for the death of my servant it was a small matter and we would put it from our minds but you shall have pledges of my honour cries he aye you shall see that the gilzai pay the debt in gods name my son my son ilderim i will give as a hostage to you carry him to mcnaghten huzoor as a sign of his fathers faith let me not be shamed flashman huzoor in my old age now this business of hostages was a common one with the afghans and it seemed to me that it had great advantages in this case with ilderim in my keeping it wasnt likely that this hysterical old lunatic when his madness took a new turn would try any mischief and young ilderim looked pleased enough at the idea he was probably thinking of the excitement of going to kabul and seeing the great queens army and riding with it too as my protйgй so there and then i took sher afzul at his word and swore that the dishonour would be wiped out and ilderim would ride with me until i released him at this the old khan grew maudlin and hauled out his khyber knife and made ilderim swear on it that he would be my man which he did and there was general rejoicing and sher afzul went round and kicked all the corpses of the gilzais and called on god to damn them good and proper after which we rode back to mogala and i resisted the old khans entreaties to stay longer in proof of friendship i had orders i said and must go back to kabul it would not do i added for me to linger when i had so important a hostage as the son of the khan of mogala to take back he took this most seriously and swore that his son would go as befitted a prince and gave him a dozen gilzai riders as escort to stay with him and me so there was more oathswearing and sher afzul finished up in excellent humour vowing it was an honour to the gilzais to serve such a splendid warrior as flashman huzoor who had accounted for four enemies singlehanded and who would forever be dear to the gilzais for his courage and magnanimity as proof of which he would send me gul shahs ears nose eyes and other essential organs as soon as he could lay hold of them so we left mogala and i had collected a personal following of afghan tribesmen and a reputation as a result of the mornings work the twelve gilzais and ilderim were the best things i found in afghanistan and the nickname bloody lance which sher afzul conferred did me no harm either incidentally as a result of all this sher afzul was keener than ever to maintain his alliance with the british so my mission was a success as well i was pretty pleased with myself as we set off for kabul of course i had not forgotten that i had also made an outstanding enemy in gul shah how bitter an enemy i was to find out in time any excitement that the affair at mogala might have caused in kabul when we got back and told our tale was overshadowed by the arrival on the same day of the new army commander general elphinstone my chief and sponsor i was piqued at the time for i thought i had done pretty well and was annoyed to find that no one thought my skirmish with the gilzais and securing of hostages worth more than a cocked eyebrow and an oh really but looking back i can say that all unwittingly kabul and the army were right to regard elphys arrival as an incident of the greatest significance it opened a new chapter it was a prelude to events that rang round the world elphy ably assisted by mcnaghten was about to reach the peak of his career he was going to produce the most shameful ridiculous disaster in british military history no doubt thomas hughes would find it significant that in such a disaster i would emerge with fame honour and distinction all quite unworthily acquired but you having followed my progress so far wont be surprised at all let me say that when i talk of disasters i speak with authority i have served at balaclava cawnpore and little big horn name the biggest born fools who wore uniform in the nineteenth century cardigan sale custer raglan lucan i knew them all think of all the conceivable misfortunes that can arise from combinations of folly cowardice and sheer bad luck and ill give you chapter and verse but i still state unhesitatingly that for pure vacillating stupidity for superb incompetence to command for ignorance combined with bad judgement in short for the true talent for catastrophe elphy bey stood alone others abide our question but elphy outshines them all as the greatest military idiot of our own or any other day only he could have permitted the first afghan war and let it develop to such a ruinous defeat it was not easy he started with a good army a secure position some excellent officers a disorganised enemy and repeated opportunities to save the situation but elphy with the touch of true genius swept aside these obstacles with unerring precision and out of order wrought complete chaos we shall not with luck look upon his like again however i tell you this not as a preface to a history of the war but because if you are to judge my career properly and understand how the bully expelled from rugby became a hero you have to know how things were in that extraordinary year of the story of the war and its beginnings is the background of the picture although dashing harry flashman is the main figure in the foreground elphy came to kabul then and was met with great junketings and packed streets sujah welcomed him at the bala hissar the army in the cantonment two miles outside the city paraded for him the ladies of the garrison made much of him mcnaghten breathed a sigh of relief at seeing willoughby cottons back and there was some satisfaction that we had got such a benevolent and popular commander only burnes it seemed to me on that first day when i reported to him did not share the gaiety i suppose it is right to rejoice he told me stroking in his conceited way at his little black moustache but you know elphys arrival changes nothing sujah is no firmer on his throne and the defences of the cantonment are no better simply because elphy turns the light of his countenance on us oh i daresay it will be all right but it might have been better if calcutta had sent us a stronger brisker man i suppose i should have resented this patronising view of my chief a little but when i saw elphy bey later in the day there was no doubt that burnes was right in the weeks since i had parted from him in calcutta and he had not been in the best of health then he had gone downhill there was this wasted shaky look about him and he preferred not to walk much his hand trembled as he shook mine and the feel of it was of a bundle of dry sticks in a bag however he was pleased to see me you have been distinguishing yourself among the gilzais flashman he said sir alexander burnes tells me you have won hostages of importance that is excellent news especially to our friend the envoy and he turned to mcnaghten who was sitting by drinking tea and holding his cup like an old maid mcnaghten sniffed the gilzais need not concern us very much i think says he they are great brigands of course but only brigands i would rather have hostages for the good behaviour of akbar khan shall we send mr flashman to bring some says elphy smiling at me to show i shouldnt mind mcnaghtens snub he seems to have gifts in that direction and he went on to ask for details of my mission and told me that i must bring young ilderim khan to meet him and generally behaved very civilly to me but it was an effort to remember that this frail old gentleman with his pleasant small talk was the commander of the army he was too polite and vague even in those few minutes and deferred too much to mcnaghten to inspire confidence as a military leader how would he do do you think if there was any trouble with the afghans says burnes later well lets hope we dont have to find out in the next few weeks while i was in fairly constant attendance on elphy i found myself sharing his hope it was not just that elphy was too old and feeble to be much use as an active leader he was under mcnaghtens thumb from the start and since mcnaghten was determined to believe that all was well elphy had to believe it too and neither of them got on with shelton a rude boor of a man who was elphys secondincommand and this dissension at the top made for uneasiness and mistrust further down if that was not bad enough the situation of the army made it worse the cantonment was a poor place for a garrison to be without proper defences with its principal stores outside its walls and some of the principal officers burnes himself for example quartered two miles away in kabul city but if protests were made to mcnaghten and they were especially by active men like broadfoot they were dismissed as croaking and it was pointed out sharply that the army was unlikely to be called on to fight anyway when this kind of talk gets abroad there is no confidence and the soldiers get slack which is dangerous anywhere but especially in a strange country where the natives are unpredictable of course elphy pottering about the cantonment and mcnaghten with his nose deep in correspondence with calcutta saw nothing to indicate that the peaceful situation was an uneasy one nor did most of the army who were ignorantly contemptuous of the afghans and had treated the kabul expedition as a holiday from the first but some of us did a few weeks after elphys arrival burnes obtained my detachment from the staff because he wanted to make use of my pushtu and my interest in the country oh dear elphy complained sir alexander is so busy about everything he takes my aides away even as though i could readily spare them but there is so much to do and i am not well enough to be up to it but i was not sorry to go being about elphy was like being an orderly in a medical ward burnes was keen that i should get about and see as much of the country as i could improve my command of the language and become known to as many influential afghans as possible he gave me a number of little tasks like the mogala one it was carrying messages really but it was valuable experience and i travelled to towns and villages about kabul meeting douranis and kohistanis and baruzkis and so on and getting the feel of the place as burnes put it soldierings all very well he told me but the men who make or break the army in a foreign country are we politicals we meet the men who count and get to know em and sniff the wind were the eyes and ears aye and the tongues without us the military are blind deaf and dumb so although boors like shelton sneered at young pups gadding about the hills playing at niggers i listened to burnes and sniffed the wind i took ilderim with me a good deal and sometimes his gilzais too and they taught me some of the lore of the hills and the ways of the people who mattered and what tribes were better to deal with and why and how the kohistanis were more friendly disposed to us than the abizai were and which families were at feud with each other and how the feeling ran about the persians and the russians and where the best horses could be obtained and how millet was grown and harvested all the trivial information which is the small change of a countrys life i dont pretend that i became an expert in a few weeks or that i ever knew afghanistan but i picked up a little here and there and began to realise that those who studied the country only from the cantonment at kabul knew no more about it than you would learn about a strange house if you stayed in one room of it all the time but for anyone with eyes to look beyond kabul the signs were plain to see there was mischief brewing in the hills among the wild tribes who didnt want shah sujah for their king and hated the british bayonets that protected him in his isolation in the bala hissar fortress rumours grew that akbar khan son of old dost mohammed whom we had deposed had come down out of the hindu kush at last and was gathering support among the chiefs he was the darling of the warrior clans they said and presently he would sweep down on kabul with his hordes fling sujah from his throne and either drive the feringhees back to india or slaughter them all in their cantonment it was easy if you were mcnaghten to scoff at such rumours from your pleasantly furnished office in kabul it was something else again to be up on the ridges beyond jugdulluk or down towards ghuznee and hear of councils called and messengers riding of armed assemblies harangued by holy men and signal fires lit along the passes the covert smiles the ready assurances the sight of swaggering ghazis armed to the teeth and with nothing apparent to do the growing sense of unease it used to make the hairs crawl on my neck for dont mistake me i did not like this work riding with my gilzais and young ilderim i was made welcome enough and they were infallible eyes and ears for having eaten the queens salt they were ready to serve her against their own folk if need be but it was dangerous for all that even in native dress i would meet black looks and veiled threats in some places and hear the british mocked and akbars name acclaimed as a friend of the gilzais and a slight celebrity ilderim lost no opportunity of announcing me as bloody lance i was tolerated but i knew the toleration might snap at any moment at first i went about in a continual funk but after a while one became fatalistic possibly it came from dealing with people who believe that every mans fortune is unchangeably written on his forehead so the clouds began to gather on the mountains and in kabul the british army played cricket and elphinstone and mcnaghten wrote letters to each other remarking how tranquil everything was the summer wore on the sentries drowsed in the stifling heat of the cantonment burnes yawned and listened idly to my reports dined me royally and took me off whoring in the bazaar and one bright day mcnaghten got a letter from calcutta complaining at the cost of keeping our army in kabul and looked about for economies to make it was unfortunate that he happened about this time to be awaiting his promotion and transfer to the governorship of bombay i think the knowledge that he was leaving may have made him careless at any rate seeking means of reducing expenditure he recalled the idea which had appalled general nott and decided to cut the gilzais subsidy i had just come back to kabul from a visit to kandahar garrison and learned that the gilzai chiefs had been summoned and told that instead of rupees a year for keeping the passes open they were now to receive ilderims fine young face fell when he heard it and he said there will be trouble flashman huzoor he would have been better offering pork to a ghazi than cheat the gilzais of their money he was right of course he knew his own people the gilzai chiefs smiled cheerfully when mcnaghten delivered his decision bade him good afternoon and rode quietly out of kabul and three days later the munitions convoy from peshawar was cut to ribbons in the khoordkabul pass by a force of yelling gilzais and ghazis who looted the caravan butchered the drivers and made off with a couple of tons of powder and ball mcnaghten was most irritated but not concerned with bombay beckoning he was not going to alarm calcutta over a skirmish as he called it the gilzais must be given a drubbing for kicking up this kind of row said he and hit on another bright idea he would cut down expense by sending a couple of battalions back to india and they could take a swipe at the gilzais on their way home two birds with one stone the only trouble was that his two battalions had to fight damned nearly every inch of the way as far as gandamack with the gilzais potting at them from behind rocks and sweeping down in sudden cavalry charges this was bad enough but what made it worse was that our troops fought badly even under the command of general sale the tall handsome fighting bob who used to invite his men to shoot him when they felt mutinous clearing the passes was a slow costly process i saw some of it for burnes sent me on two occasions with messages to sale from mcnaghten telling him to get on with it it was a shocking experience the first time i set off thinking it was something of a joyride which it was until the last halfmile into sales rearguard which was george broadfoots camp beyond jugdulluk everything had been peaceful as you please and i was just thinking how greatly exaggerated had been the reports arriving in kabul from sale when out of a sidenullah came a mounted party of ghazis howling like wolves and brandishing their knives i just clapped in my spurs put my head down and cut along the track as if all the fiends of hell were behind me which they were i tumbled into broadfoots camp halfdead with terror which he fortunately mistook for exhaustion george had the bad taste to find it all rather funny he was one of those nerveless clods and was in the habit of strolling about under the snipers fire polishing his spectacles although his red coat and even redder beard made him a marked man he seemed to think everyone else was as unconcerned as he was too for he sent me back to kabul that same night with another note in which he told burnes flatly that there wasnt a hope of keeping the passes open by force they would have to negotiate with the gilzais i backed this up vehemently to burnes for although i had had a clear run back to kabul it was obvious to me that the gilzais meant business and at all the way stations there had been reports of other tribesmen massing in the hills above the passes burnes gave me some rather odd looks as i made my report he thought i was scared and probably exaggerating at any rate he made no protest when mcnaghten said broadfoot was an ass and sale an incompetent and that they had better get a move on if they were to have cleared a way to jallalabad which was about twothirds of the way from kabul to peshawar before winter set in so sales brigade was left to struggle on and burnes wrote that the country was in the main very tranquil well he paid for his folly a week or two later it was now well into october he sent me off again with a letter to sale little progress was being made in clearing the passes the gilzais were as active as ever and outshooting our troops all the time and there were growing rumours of trouble brewing in kabul itself burnes had sense enough to show a little concern although mcnaghten was still as placidly blind as ever while elphy bey simply looked from one to the other nodding agreement to whatever was said but even burnes showed no real urgency about it all he just wanted to nag at sale for not keeping the gilzais quiet this time i went with a good escort of my gilzais under young ilderim on the theory that while they were technically sworn to fight their own kinsfolk they would be unlikely in practice to get into any shooting scrapes with them however i never put this to the test for it became evident as we rode eastward through the passes that the situation was worse than anyone in kabul had realised and i decided that i at any rate would not try to get through to sale the whole country beyond jugdulluk was up and the hills were swarming with hostile afghans all either on their way to help beat up sales force or else preparing for something bigger there was talk among the villagers of a great jehad or holy war in which the feringhees would be wiped out it was on the eve of breaking out they said sale was now hopelessly cut off there was no chance of relief from jallalabad or even from kabul oh kabul was going to be busy enough looking after itself i heard this shivering round a campfire on the soorkab road and ilderim shook his head in the shadows and said it is not safe for you to go on flashman huzoor you must return to kabul give me the letter for sale although i have eaten the queens salt my own people will let me through this was such obvious common sense that i gave him the letter without argument and started back for kabul that same night with four of the gilzai hostages for company at that hour i wanted to get as many miles as possible between me and the gathering afghan tribes but if i had known what was waiting for me in kabul i would have gone on to sale and thought myself lucky riding hard through the next day we came to kabul at nightfall and i never saw the place so quiet bala hissar loomed over the deserted streets the few folk who were about were grouped in little knots in doorways and at street corners there was an air of doom over the whole place no british soldiers were to be seen in the city itself and i was glad to get to the residency where burnes lived in the heart of the town and hear the courtyard gates grind to behind me the armed men of burness personal guard were standing to in the yard while others were posted on the residency walls the torches shone on beltplates and bayonets and the place looked as though it was getting ready to withstand a siege but burnes himself was sitting reading in his study as cool as a minnow until he saw me at the sight of my evident haste and disorder i was in afghan dress and pretty filthy after days in the saddle he started up what the deuce are you doing here says he i told him and added that there would probably be an afghan army coming to support my story my message to sale he snapped where is it have you not delivered it i told him about ilderim and for once the dapper little dandy forgot his carefully cultivated calm good god says he youve given it to a gilzai to deliver a friendly gilzai i assured him a hostage you remember are you mad says he his little moustache all aquiver dont you know that you cant trust an afghan hostage or not ilderim is a khans son and a gentleman in his own way i told him in any event it was that or nothing i couldnt have got through and why not you speak pushtu youre in native dress god knows youre dirty enough to pass it was your duty to see that message into sales own hand and bring an answer my god flashman this is a pretty business when a british officer cannot be trusted now look you here sekundar says i but he came up straight like a little bantam and cut me off sir alexander if you please says he icily as though id never seen him with his breeches down chasing after some big afghan bint he stared at me and took a pace or two round the table i think i understand says he i have wondered about you lately flashman whether you were to be fully relied on or well it shall be for a courtmartial to decide courtmartial what the devil for wilful disobedience of orders says he there may be other charges in any event you may consider yourself under arrest and confined to this house we are all confined anyway the afghans are allowing no one to pass between here and the cantonment well in gods name doesnt that bear out what ive been telling you i said the countrys all up to the eastward man and now here in kabul there is no rising in kabul says he merely a little unrest which i propose to deal with in the morning he stood there cocksure little ass in his carefully pressed linen suit with a flower in his buttonhole talking as though he was a schoolmaster promising to reprimand some unruly fags it may interest you to know you who turn tail at rumours that i have twice this evening received direct threats to my life i shall not be alive by morning it is said well well we shall see about that aye maybe you will says i and as to your fine talk that i turn tail at rumours you may see about that too maybe akbar khan will come to show you himself he smiled at me not pleasantly he is in kabul i have even had a message from him and i am confident that he intends no harm to us a few dissidents there are of course and it may be necessary to read them a lesson however i trust myself for that there was no arguing with his complacency but i pitched into him hard on his threat of a courtmartial for me you might have thought that any sensible man would have understood my case but he simply waved my protests aside and finished by ordering me to my room so i went in a rare rage at the selfsufficient folly of the man and heartily hoping that he would trip over his own conceit always so clever always so sure that was burnes i would have given a pension to see him at a loss for once but i was to see it for nothing it came suddenly just before breakfasttime when i was rubbing my eyes after a pretty sleepless night which had dragged itself away very slowly and very silently for kabul it was a grey morning and the cocks were crowing suddenly i became aware of a distant murmur growing to a rumble and hurried to the window the town lay still with a little haze over the houses the guards were still on the wall of the residency compound and in the distance coming closer the noise was identifiable as the tramping of feet and the growing clamour of a mob there was a shouted order in the courtyard a clatter of feet on the stairs and burness voice calling for his brother young charlie who lived in the residency with him i snatched my robe from its peg and hurried down winding my puggaree on to my head as i went as i reached the courtyard there was the crack of a musket shot and a wild yell from beyond the wall a volley of blows hammered on the gate and across the top of the wall i saw the vanguard of a charging horde streaming out from between the nearest houses bearded faces flashing knives they surged up to the wall and fell back yelling and cursing while the guards thrust at them with their musket butts for a moment i thought they would charge again and sweep irresistibly over the wall but they hung back a jostling shrieking crowd shaking their fists and weapons while the guardsmen lining the wall looked anxiously back for orders and kept their thumbs poised on their musketlocks burnes strolled out of the front door and stood in full view at the top of the steps he was as fresh and calm as a squire taking his first sniff of the morning but at the sight of him the mob redoubled its clamour and rolled up to the wall yelling threats and insults while he looked right and left at them smiling and shaking his head no shooting havildar says he to the guard commander it will all quieten down in a moment death to sekundar yelled the mob death to the feringhee pig jim broadfoot who was georges younger brother and little charlie burnes were at sekundars elbow both looking mighty anxious but burnes himself never lost his poise suddenly he raised his hand and the mob beyond the wall fell quiet he grinned at that and touched his moustache in that little confident gesture he had and then he began to talk to them in pushtu his voice was quiet and must have carried only faintly to them but they listened for a little as he coolly told them to go home and stop this folly and reminded them that he had always been their friend and had done them no harm it might have succeeded for he had the gift of the gab but showoff that he was he carried it just too far and patronised them and first there were murmurs and then the clamour swelled up again more savage than before suddenly one afghan started forward and hurled himself on to the wall knocking down a sentry the nearest guard drove at the afghan with his bayonet someone in the crowd fired his jezzail and with one hellish roar the whole mob swept forward scrambling up the wall the havildar yelled an order there was the ragged crash of a volley and the courtyard was full of struggling men crazy afghans with their knives hacking and the guard falling back stabbing with their bayonets and going down beneath the rush there was no holding them i saw broadfoot grab burnes and hustle him inside the house and a moment later i was inside myself slamming the side door in the face of a yelling ghazi with a dozen of his fellows bounding at his heels it was a stout door thank god like the others in the residency otherwise we should all have been butchered within five minutes blows shattered on the far side of it as i slipped the bar home and as i hurried along the passage to the main hallway i could hear above the shrieking and shooting outside the crash and thud of countless fists and hilts on panels and shutters it was like being inside a box with demented demons pounding on the lid suddenly above the din there was the crash of an ordered volley from the courtyard and then another and as the yelling subsided momentarily the havildars voice could be heard urging the remnant of the guard into the house little bloody odds it would make i thought they had us cornered and it was a case of having our throats cut now or later burnes and the others were in the hallway and sekundar as usual was showing off affecting carelessness in a tight spot wake duncan with thy knocking he quoted cocking his head on one side at the pounding of the mob how many of the guard are inside jim broadfoot said about a dozen and burnes said thats splendid that makes lets see twelve and the servants and us three hullo heres flashman mornin flash sleep well apologise for this rude awakening about twentyfive id say twenty fighting men anyway few enough says broadfoot examining his pistols the niggersll be inside before long we cant cover every door and window sekundar a musket ball crashed through a shutter and knocked a cloud of plaster off the opposite wall everyone ducked except burnes nonsense says he cant cover em from down here i grant you but we dont have to now jim take the guard all of em upstairs and have em shoot down from the balconies thatll clear these mad fellows away from the sides of the house there aint many guns among them i fancy so you can get a good sight of them without fear of being hit much up you go laddie look sharp broadfoot clattered away and a moment later the redcoated jawans were mounting the stairs with burnes shouting shabash to encourage them while he belted his sword over his suit and stuck a pistol in his belt he seemed positively to be enjoying himself the bloody ass he clapped me on the shoulder and asked didnt i just wish id galloped on to sale after all but never a word of acknowledgement that my warning had proved correct i reminded him of it and pointed out that if he had listened then we shouldnt be going to get our throats cut now but he just laughed and straightened his buttonhole dont croak so flashy says he i could hold this house with two men and a whores protector there was a sound of ragged firing over our heads you see jims setting about em already come on charlie lets see the fun and he and his brother hurried upstairs leaving me alone in the hall what about my bloody courtmartial i shouted after him but he never heard well his plan worked at first broadfoots men did clear away the rascals from round the walls shooting down from the upper windows and balcony and when i joined them on the upper floor there were about twenty ghazi corpses in the courtyard a few shots came the other way and one of the jawans was wounded in the thigh but the main mob had now retreated to the street and contented themselves with howling curses from the cover of the wall excellent bahut achha said burnes puffing a cheroot and peering out of the window you see charlie theyve drawn off and presently elphy will be wondering down in the cantonment what all the rows about and send someone to see wont he send troops then says little charlie of course a battalion probably thats what id send since its elphy though hes as likely to send a brigade eh jim broadfoot squatting at the other window peered along his pistol barrel fired swore and said so long as he sends someone dont you fret says burnes here flashy have a cheroot then you can try your hand at potting off some of these chaps beyond the wall id say elphyll be on the move inside two hours and well be out of here in three good shot jim thats the style burnes was wrong of course elphy didnt send troops indeed so far as ive been able to learn he did nothing at all if even a platoon had arrived in that first hour i believe the mob would have melted before them as it was they began to pluck up courage and started clambering the wall again and sneaking round to the rear where the stables gave them cover we kept up a good fire from the windows i shot three myself including an enormously fat man at which burnes said choose the thin ones flashy that chap couldnt have got in the front door anyway but as two hours passed he joked rather less and actually made another attempt to talk to our attackers from the balcony but they drove him inside with a shot or two and a volley of missiles meanwhile some of the ghazis had set fire to the stables and the smoke began to drift into the house burnes swore and we all strained our eyes peering across the rooftops towards the cantonment but still no sign of help appeared and i felt the pumping of fear again in my throat the howling of the mob had risen again louder than ever some of the jawans were looking scared and even burnes was frowning blast elphy bey says he hes cutting it dooced fine and i believe these brutes have got muskets from somewhere at last listen he was right there were as many shots coming from outside as from inside the house they were smacking into the walls and knocking splinters from the shutters and presently another jawan gave a yelp and staggered back into the room with his shoulder smashed and blood pouring down his shirt hm says burnes this is gettin warm like montrose at the fair eh charlie charlie gave him the ghost of a smile he was scared stiff and trying not to show it how many rounds have you got flashy says burnes i had only six left and charlie had none the ten jawans had barely forty among them how about you jim shouts burnes to broadfoot who was at the far window broadfoot shouted something back but in the din i didnt catch it and then broadfoot stood slowly up and turned towards us looking down at his shirtfront i saw a red spot there and suddenly it grew to a great red stain and broadfoot took two steps back and went head first over the window sill there was a sickening crash as he hit the courtyard and a tremendous shriek from the mob the firing seemed to redouble and from the rear where the smoke of the burning stables was pouring in on us came the measured smashing of a ram at the back door burnes fired from his window and ducked away he squatted down near me spun his pistol by the guard whistled for a second or two through his teeth and then said charlie flashy i think its time to go where the hell to says i out of here says he charlie cut along to my room youll find native robes in the wardrobe bring em along lively now when charlie had gone he said to me its not much of a chance but its all we have i think well try it at the back door the smoke looks pretty thick dont you know and with all the confusion we might get clear away ah good boy charlie now send the havildar across to me while burnes and charlie struggled into their gowns and puggarees burnes talked to the havildar who agreed that the mob probably wouldnt hurt him and his men not being feringhees but would concentrate on looting the place but you sahib they will surely kill he said go while ye can and god go with you and remain with you and yours says burnes shaking his hand shabash and salaam havildar all ready flash come on charlie and with burnes in the lead and myself last we cut out down the staircase across the hall and through the passage towards the kitchen from the back door out of sight to our right there came a crackling of breaking timber i took a quick glance through a loophole and saw the garden almost alive with ghazis just about in time says burnes as we reached the kitchen door i knew it led into a little fencedoff pen where the swilltubs were kept once we got into that and provided we werent actually seen leaving the house we stood a fair chance of getting away burnes slipped the bar quietly from the door and opened it a crack luck of the devil says he come on juldi we slipped out after him the pen was empty it consisted of two high screen walls running from either side of the door there was no one in sight through the opening at the other end and the smoke was billowing down in great clouds now with the mob kicking up the most hellish din on either side of us pull her to flashy snapped burnes and i shut the door behind us thats it now try to batter the damned thing down arid he jumped at the closed door hammering with his fists open unbelieving swine he bawled feringhee pigs your hour has come this way brothers death to the bastard sekundar seeing his plan we hammered along with him and presently round the end of the pen came a handful of ghazis to see what was what all they saw of course was three of the faithful trying to break down a door so they joined in and after a moment we left off burnes cursing like blazes and went out of the pen ostensibly to seek another entrance to hammer at there were afghans all over the garden and round the burning stables most of them it seemed to me were just berserk and running about and yelling for no particular reason waving their knives and spears and presently there was a tremendous howl and a crash as the back door caved in and a general move in that direction the three of us kept going for the stable gate past the burning building it was a creepy feeling hurrying through the confused crowd of our enemies and i was in dread that little charlie who was new to native dress and not nearly as dark as burnes and i would do something to be spotted but he kept his hood well forward over his face and we got outside the gate in safety where the hangerson were congregated yelling and laughing as they watched the residency hoping no doubt to see the bodies of the hated feringhees launched from the upper windows may dogs defile the grave of the swine burnes roared sekundar spitting towards the residency and the bystanders gave him a cheer so far so good he added to me now shall we stroll down to the cantonments and have a word with elphy ready charlie best foot forward then and try to swagger like a regular badmash take your cue from flashy here aint he the ugliestlookin bashiebazouk you ever saw with burnes in the lead we pushed out boldly into the street sekundar thrusting aside the stragglers who got in the way like any yusufzai bully i wanted to tell him to go easy for it seemed to me he must attract attention and his face was all too familiar to the kabulis but they gave way before him with a curse or two and we won clear to the end of the street without being spotted now thought i were home in a canter the crowd was still fairly thick but not so noisy and every stride was taking us nearer the point where at worst we could cut and run for it towards the cantonment and then burnes the overconfident fool ruined the whole thing we had reached the end of the street and he must pause to yell another curse against the feringhees by way of a final brag i could imagine him showing off later to the garrison wives telling them how hed fooled the afghans by roaring threats against himself but he overdid it having called himself the grandson of seventy pariah dogs at the top of his voice he muttered something in an undertone to charlie and laughed at his own witticism the trouble is an afghan doesnt laugh like an englishman he giggles highpitched but burnes guffawed i saw a head turn to stare at us and grabbing burnes by one arm and charlie by the other i was starting to hurry them down the street when i was pushed aside and a big brute of a ghazi swung burnes round by the shoulder and peered at him jao hubshi snarled burnes and hit his hand aside but the fellow still stared and then suddenly shouted mashallah brothers it is sekundar burnes there was an instants quiet and then an almighty yell the big ghazi whipped out his khyber knife burnes locked his arm and snapped it before he could strike but then about a dozen others were rushing in on us one jumped at me and i hit him so hard with my fist that i overbalanced i jumped up clawing for my own sword and saw burnes throwing off the wounded ghazi and shouting run charlie run there was a sidealley into which charlie who was nearest might have escaped but he hesitated standing whitefaced while burnes jumped between him and the charging afghans sekundar had his khyber knife out now he parried a blow from the leader closed with him and shouted again get out charlie cut man and then as charlie still hesitated petrified burnes yelled in an agonised voice run baby please run they were the last words he spoke a khyber knife swept down on his shoulder and he reeled back blood spouting then the mob was on top of him hacking and striking he must have taken half a dozen mortal cuts before he even hit the ground charlie gave a frenzied cry and ran towards him they cut him down before he had gone three steps i saw all this because it happened in seconds then i had my own hands full i jumped over the man i had hit and dived for the alley but a ghazi was there first screaming and slashing at me i had my own sword out and turned his cut but the way was blocked and the mob was howling at my heels i turned slashing frantically and they gave back an instant i got my back to the nearest wall as they surged in again the knives flashed before my eyes i thrust at the snarling faces and heard the screams and curses and then something hit me a dreadful blow in the stomach and i went down before the rush of bodies a foot stamped on my hip and even as i thought oh sweet jesus this is death i had one fleeting memory of being trampled in the scrimmage in the schoolhouse match something smashed against my head and i waited for the horrible bite of sharp steel and then i remember nothing more when i came to my senses i was lying on a wooden floor my cheek against the boards my head seemed to be opening and shutting with pain and when i tried to raise it i found that my face was stuck to the boards with my own dried blood so that i cried out with the pain as it pulled free the first thing i noticed was a pair of boots of fine yellow leather on the floor about two yards away above them were pyjamy trousers and the skirt of a black coat and then a green sash and two lean hands hooked into it by the thumbs and above all a dark grinning face with pale grey eyes under a spiked helmet i knew the face from my visit to mogala and even in my confused state i thought this is bad news it was my old enemy gul shah he sauntered over and kicked me in the ribs i tried to speak and the first words that came out in a hoarse whisper were im alive for the moment said gul shah he squatted down beside me smiling his wolfs smile tell me flashman what does it feel like to die what dye mean i managed to croak he jerked his thumb out in the street yonder you were down with the knives at your neck and only my timely intervention saved you from the same fate as sekundar burnes they cut him to pieces by the way eightyfive pieces to be exact they have been counted you see but you flashman must have known what it was like to die in that moment tell me i am curious i guessed there was no good coming from these questions the evil look of the brute made my skin crawl but i thought it best to answer it was bloody horrible says i he laughed with his head back rocking on his heels and others laughed with him i realised there were perhaps half a dozen others ghazis mostly in the room with us they came crowding round to leer at me and if anything they looked even nastier than gul shah when he had finished laughing he leaned over me it can be more horrible says he and spat in my face he reeked of garlic i tried to struggle up demanding to know why he had saved me and he stood up and kicked me again yes why he mocked me i couldnt fathom it i didnt want to but i thought id pretend to act as though it were all for the best im grateful to you sir says i for your timely assistance you shall be rewarded all of you and indeed we will says gul shah stand him up they dragged me to my feet twisting my arms behind me i told them loudly that if they took me back to the cantonment they would be handsomely paid and they roared with laughter any paying the british do will be in blood says gul shah yours first of all what for damn you i shouted why do you suppose i stopped the ghazis from quartering you says he to preserve your precious skin perhaps to hand you as a peace offering to your people he stuck his face into mine have you forgotten a dancing girl called narreeman you pigs bastard just another slut to the likes of you to be defiled as you chose and then forgotten you are all the same you feringhee swine you think you can take our women our country and our honour and trample them all under foot we do not matter do we and when all is done when our women are raped and our treasure stolen you can laugh and shrug your shoulders you misbegotten pariah curs he was screaming at me with froth on his lips i meant her no harm i was beginning and he struck me across the face he stood there glaring at me and panting he made an effort and mastered himself she is not here he said at last or i would give you to her and she would give you an eternity of suffering before you died as it is we shall do our poor best to accommodate you look says i whatever ive done i beg your pardon for it i didnt know you cared for the wench i swear ill make amends any way you like im a rich man a really rich man i went on to offer him whatever he wanted in ransom and as compensation to the girl and it seemed to quiet him for a minute go on says he when i paused this is good to listen to i would have done but just the cruel sneer told me he was mocking me and i fell silent so we are where we began says he believe me flashman i would make you die a hundred deaths but time is short there are other throats besides yours and we are impatient people but we shall make your passing as memorable as possible and you shall tell me again what it is like to die bring him along they dragged me from the room along a passage and i roared for help and called gul shah every filthy name i could lay tongue to he strode on ahead heedless and presently threw open a door they ran me across the threshold and i found i was in a low vaulted chamber perhaps twenty yards long i had halfexpected racks and thumbscrews or some such horrors but the room was entirely bare the one curious feature of it was that half way it was cut in two by a deep culvert perhaps ten feet wide and six deep it was dry and where it ran into the walls on either side the openings were stopped up with rubble this had obviously been done only recently but i could not imagine why gul shah turned to me are you strong flashman damn you i shouted youll pay for this you dirty nigger are you strong he repeated answer or ill have your tongue cut out one of the ruffians grabbed my jaw in his hairy paw and brought the knife up to my mouth it was a convincing argument strong enough damn you i doubt that smiled gul shah we have executed two rascals here of late neither of them weaklings but we shall see to one of his crew he said bring mansur i should explain this new entertainment of mine he went on gloating at me it was inspired partly by the unusual shape of this chamber with its great trench in the middle and partly by a foolish game which your british soldiers play doubtless you have played it yourself which will add interest for you and us yah mansur come here as he spoke a grotesque figure waddled into the room for a moment i could not believe it was a man for he was no more than four feet high but he was terrific he was literally as broad as he was long with huge knotted arms and a chest like an apes his enormous torso was carried on massive legs he had no neck that i could see and his yellow face was as flat as a plate with a hideous nose spread across it a slit of a mouth and two black button eyes his body was covered in dark hair but his skull was as smooth as an egg he wore only a dirty loincloth and as he shuffled across to gul shah the torchlight in that windowless room gave him the appearance of some hideous nibelung dragging itself through dark burrows beneath the earth a fine manikin is he not said gul shah regarding the hideous imp your soul must be as handsome flashman which is fitting for he is your executioner he snapped an order and the dwarf with a glance at me and a contortion of his revolting mouth which i took to be a grin suddenly bounded into the culvert and with a tremendous spring leaped up the other side catching the edge and flipping up like an acrobat that done he turned and faced us arms outstretched a disgusting yellow giantinminiature the men who held me now dragged my arms in front of me and bound my wrists tightly with a stout rope one of them then took the coil and carried it across to the dwarfs side of the culvert the manikin made a hideous bubbling noise and held his wrist up eagerly and they were bound as mine had been so we stood on opposite edges of the culvert bound to ends of the same rope with the slack of it lying in the great trench between us there had been no further word of explanation and in the hellish uncertainty of what was to come my nerve broke i tried to run but they hauled me back laughing and the dwarf mansur capered on his side of the culvert and snapped his fingers in delight at my terror let me go you bastards i roared and gul shah smiled and clapped his hands you start at shadows he sneered behold the substance yah asaf one of his ruffians came to the edge of the trench bearing a leather sack tied at the neck cautiously undoing it and holding it by the bottom he suddenly upended it into the culvert to my horror half a dozen slim silver shapes that glittered evilly in the torchlight fell writhing into the gap they plopped gently to the floor of the culvert and then slithered with frightening speed towards the sides but they could not climb up at us so they glided about their strange prison in deadly silence you could sense the vicious anger in them as they slid about beneath us their bite is death said gul shah is all now plain flashman it is what you call a tugofwar you against mansur one of you must succeed in tugging the other into the trench and then it takes a few moments for the venom to kill believe me the snakes will be kinder than narreeman would have been help i roared although god knows i expected none but the sight of those loathsome things the thought of their slimy touch of the stab of their fangs i thought i should go mad i raged and pleaded and that afghan swine clapped his hands and yelled with laughter the dwarf mansur hopped in eagerness to begin and presently gul shah stepped back snapped an order to him and said to me pull for your life flashman and present my salaams to shaitan i had retreated as far as i could go from the culverts edge and was standing halfparalysed when the dwarf snapped his wrists impatiently at the rope the jerk brought me to my senses as i have said before terror is a wonderful stimulant i braced my bootheels on the rough stone floor and prepared to resist with all my strength grinning the dwarf scuttled backwards until the rope stretched taut between us i guessed what his first move would be and was ready for the sudden jerk when it came it nearly lifted me off my feet but i turned with the rope across my shoulder and gave him heave for heave the rope drummed like a bowstring and then relaxed he leered across at me and made a dribbling piping noise then he bunched his enormous shoulder muscles and leaning back began to pull steadily by god he was strong i strained until my shoulders cracked and my arms shuddered but slowly inch by inch my heels slithered across the rough surface towards the edge of the trench the ghazis urged him on with cries of delight gul shah came to the brink so that he could watch me as i was drawn inexorably to the limit i felt one of my heels slip into space my head seemed to be bursting with the effort and my ears roared and then the tearing pain in my wrists relaxed and i was sprawled on the very edge exhausted with the dwarf prancing and laughing on the other side and the rope slack between us the ghazis were delighted and urged him to give me a quick final jerk into the culvert but he shook his head and backed away again snapping the rope at me i glanced down the snakes seemed almost to know what was afoot for they had concentrated in a writhing hissing mass just below me i scrambled back wet with fear and rage and hurled my weight on the rope to try to heave him off balance but for all the impression i made it might have been anchored to a tree he was playing with me there was no question he was far the stronger of us two and twice he hauled me to the lip and let me go again gul shah clapped his hands and the ghazis cheered then he snapped some order to the dwarf and i realised with sick horror that they were going to make an end in despair i rolled back again from the edge and got to my feet my wrists were torn and bloody and my shoulder joints were on fire and when the dwarf pulled on the rope i staggered forward and in doing so i nearly got him for he had expected a stronger resistance and almost overbalanced i hauled for dear life but he recovered in time glaring and piping angrily at me as he stamped his feet for a hold when he had finally settled himself he started to draw again on the rope but not with his full strength for he pulled me in only an inch at a time this i supposed was the final hideous refinement i struggled like a fish on a line but there was no resisting that steady dreadful pull i was perhaps ten feet from the lip when he turned away from me as a tugofwar team will when it has its opponents on the run and i realised that if i was to make any last desperate bid it must be now while i had a little space to play with i had almost unbalanced him by an accidental yielding could i do it deliberately with the last of my strength i dug my heels in and heaved tremendously it checked him and he glanced over his shoulder surprise on the hideous face then he grinned and exerted his strength lunging away on the rope my feet slipped go with god flashman said gul shah ironically i scrabbled for a foothold found it only six feet from the edge and then bounded forward the leap took me to the very lip of the culvert and the dwarf mansur plunged forward on his face as the rope slackened but he was up like a jackinthebox gibbering with rage in an instant planting his feet he gave a savage heave on the rope that almost dislocated my shoulders and flung me face down then he began to pull steadily so that i was dragged forward over the floor closer and closer to the edge while the ghazis cheered and roared and i screamed with horror no no i shrieked stop him wait anything ill do anything stop him my hands were over the edge now and then my elbows suddenly there was nothing beneath my face and through my streaming tears i saw the bottom of the culvert with the filthy worms gliding across it my chest and shoulders were clear in an instant i should overbalance i tried to twist my head up to appeal to the dwarf and saw him standing on the far edge grinning evilly and coiling the slack rope round his right hand and elbow like a washerwoman with a clothes line he glanced at gul shah preparing to give the final pull that would launch me over and then above my own frantic babbling and the roaring in my ears i heard the crash of a door flung open behind me and a stir among the watchers and a voice upraised in pushtu the dwarf was standing stockstill staring beyond me towards the door what he saw i didnt know and i didnt care halfdead with fear and exhaustion as i was i recognised that his attention was diverted that the rope was momentarily slack between us and that he was on the very lip of the trench it was my last chance i had only the purchase of my body and legs on the stone my arms were stretched out ahead of me i jerked them suddenly back sobbing with all my strength it was not much of a pull but it took mansur completely unawares he was watching the doorway his eyes round in his gargoyle face too late he realised that he had let his attention wander too soon the jerk slight as it was unbalanced him and one leg slipped over the edge he shrieked and tried to throw himself clear but his grotesque body landed on the very edge and he hung for a moment like a seesaw then with a horrible piping squeal he crashed sprawling into the culvert he was up again with a bound and springing for the rim but by the grace of god he had landed almost on top of one of those hellish snakes and even as he came upright it struck at his bare leg he screamed and kicked at it and the delay gave a second brute the chance to fix itself in his hand he lashed out blindly making a most ghastly din and staggered about with at least two of the things hanging from him he ran in his dreadful waddling way in a little circle and fell forward on his face again and again the serpents struck at him he tried feebly to rise and then collapsed his misshapen body twitching i was dead beat with exertion and shock i could only lie heaving like a bellows gul shah strode to the edge of the culvert and screamed curses at his dead creature then he turned pointing to me and shouted fling that bastard in beside him they grabbed me and ran me to the pits edge for i could make no resistance but i remember i protested that it wasnt fair that i had won and deserved to be let go they held me on the edge hanging over the pit and waited for the final word from my enemy i closed my eyes to blot out the sight of the snarling faces and those dreadful reptiles and then i was pulled back and the hands fell away from me wondering i turned wearily they had all fallen silent gul shah with the rest of them a man stood in the doorway he was slightly under s middle height with the chest and shoulders of a wrestler and a small neat head that he turned from side to side taking in the scene he was simply dressed in a grey coat clasped about with a belt of chain mail and his head was bare he was plainly an afghan with something of the pretty look that was so repulsive in gul shah but here the features were stronger and plumper he carried an air of command but very easily without any of the strutting arrogance that so many of his race affected he came forward nodding to gul shah and eyeing me with polite interest i noticed with astonishment that his eyes oriental though they were in shape were of vivid blue that and the slightly curly dark hair gave him a european look which suited his bluff sturdy figure he sauntered to the edge of the culvert clicked his tongue ruefully at the dead dwarf and asked conversationally what has happened here he sounded like a vicar in a drawingroom he was so mild but gul shah kept mum so i burst out these swine have been trying to murder me he gave me a brilliant smile but without success cried he i felicitate you plainly you have been in terrible danger but have escaped by your skill and bravery a notable feat and what a tale for your childrens children it was really too much twice in hours i had been on the brink of violent death i was battered exhausted and smeared with my own blood and here i was conversing with a lunatic i almost broke down in tears and i certainly groaned oh jesus the stout man raised an eyebrow the christian prophet why who are you then im a british officer i cried i have been captured and tortured by these ruffians and theyd have killed me too with their hellish snakes whoever you are you must in the hundred names of god he broke in a feringhee officer plainly there has almost been a very serious accident why did you not tell them who you were i gaped at him my head spinning one of us must be mad they knew i croaked gul shah knew impossible says the stout fellow shaking his head it could not be my friend gul shah would be incapable of such a thing there has been an unfortunate error look i said reaching out towards him you must believe me i am lieutenant flashman on the staff of lord elphinstone and this man has tried to do me to death not for the first time ask him i shouted how i came here ask the lying treacherous bastard never try to flatter gul shah said the stout man cheerfully hell believe every word of it no there has been a mistake regrettably but it has not been irreparable for which god be thanked and my timely arrival to be sure and he smiled at me again but you must not blame gul shah or his people they did not know you for what you were now as he said those words he ceased to be a waggish madman his voice was as gentle as ever but there was no mistaking the steel underneath suddenly things became real again and i understood that the kindly smiling man before me was strong in a way that folk like gul shah could never be strong and dangerous and with a great surge of relief i realised too that with him by i was safe gul shah must have sensed it also for he roused himself and growled that i was his prisoner feringhee officer or not and he would deal with me no he is my guest said the stout man reprovingly he has met with a mishap on his way here and needs refreshment and care for his wounds you have mistaken again gul shah now we shall have his wrists unbound and i shall take him to such entertainment as befits a guest of his importance my bonds were cut off in a moment and two of the ghazis the same evilsmelling brutes that a few moments ago had been preparing to hurl me to the snakes supported me from that hellish place i could feel gul shahs eyes boring into my back but he said not a word it seemed to me that the only explanation was that this must be the stout mans house and under the strict rules of musselman hospitality his word was law but in my exhausted state i couldnt attempt to make sense of it all and was only glad to stagger after my benefactor they took me to a wellfurnished apartment and under the stout mans supervision the crack in my head was bathed the blood washed from my torn wrists and oiled bandages applied and then i was given strong mint tea and a dish of bread and fruit although my head ached damnably i was famishing not having eaten all day and while i ate the stout man talked you must not mind gul shah he said sitting opposite me and toying with his small beard he is a savage what gilzai isnt and now that i think on your name i connect you with the incident at mogala some time ago bloody lance is it not and he gave me that toothflashing smile again i imagine you had given him cause for resentment there was a woman i said i didnt know she was his woman which wasnt true but that was by the way there is so often a woman he agreed but i imagine there was more to it than that the death of a british officer at mogala would have been convenient politically for gul yes yes i see how it may have been but that is past he paused and looked at me reflectively and so is the unfortunate incident in the cellar today it is best believe me that it should be so not only for you personally but for all your people here what about sekundar burnes and his brother said i your soft words wont bring them back a terrible tragedy he agreed i admired sekundar let us hope that the ruffians who slew him will be apprehended and meet with a deserved judgement ruffians says i good god man those were akbar khans warriors not a gang of robbers i dont know who you are or what your influence may be but youre behind the times where news is concerned when they murdered burnes and sacked his residency that was the beginning of a war if the british havent marched from their cantonment into kabul yet they soon will and you can bet on that i think you exaggerate he said mildly this talk of akbar khans warriors for example look you i said dont try to tell me i rode in from the east last night the tribes are up along the passes from here to jugdulluk and beyond thousands of em theyre trying to wipe out sales force theyll be here as soon as akbar has a mind to take kabul and slit shah sujahs throat and seize his throne and god help the british garrison and loyalists like yourself who help them as youve helped me i tried to tell burnes this and he laughed and wouldnt heed me well there you are i stopped all that talk had made me thirsty when i had taken some tea i added believe it or not as you like he sat quiet for a moment and then remarked that it was an alarming story but that i must be mistaken if it were as you say the british would have moved by now either out of kabul or into the bala hissar fort where they would be safe they are not fools after all you dont know elphy bey thats plain says i or that ass mcnaghten they dont want to believe it you see they want to think alls well they think akbar khan is still skulking away in the hindu kush they refuse to believe the tribes are rallying to him ready to sweep the british out of afghanistan he sighed it may be as you say such delusions are common or they may be right and the danger smaller than you think he stood up but i am a thoughtless host your wound is paining you and you need rest flashman huzoor i shall weary you no longer here you can have peace and in the morning we can talk again among other things of how to return you safely to your people he smiled and the blue eyes twinkled we want no more mistakes from hotheads like gul shah now god be with you i struggled up but i was so weak and weary that he insisted i be seated again i told him i was deeply grateful for all his kindness that i would wish to reward him but he laughed and turned to go i mumbled some more thanks to him and it occurred to me that i still didnt know who he was or how he had the power to save me from gul shah i asked him and he paused in the curtained doorway as to that he said i am the master of this house my close friends call me bakbook because i incline to talk others call me by various names as they choose he bowed you may call me by my given name which is akbar khan good night flashman huzoor and a pleasant rest there are servants within call if you need them and with that he was gone leaving me gaping at the doorway and feeling no end of a fool in fact akbar khan did not return next day or for a week afterwards so i had plenty of time to speculate i was kept under close guard in the room but comfortably enough they fed me well and allowed me to exercise on a little closed verandah with a couple of armed barukzis to keep an eye on me but not a word would anyone say in answer to my questions and demands for release i couldnt even discover what was going on in kabul or what our troops were doing or what akbar khan himself might be up to or most important of all why he was keeping me prisoner then on the eighth day akbar returned looking very spruce and satisfied when he had dismissed the guards he inquired after my wounds which were almost better asked if i was well cared for and so forth and then said that if there was anything i wished to know he would do his best to inform me well i lost no time in making my wishes known and he listened smiling and stroking his short black beard at last he cut me off with a raised hand stop stop flashman huzoor i see you are like a thirsty man we must quench you a little at a time sit down now and drink a little tea and listen i sat and he paced slowly about the room a burly springy figure in his green tunic and pyjamys which were tucked into short riding boots he was something of a dandy i noticed there was gold lace on the tunic and silver edging to the shirt beneath it but again i was impressed by the obvious latent strength of the man you could see it even in his stance with his broad chest that looked always as though he was holding a deep breath and his long powerful hands first he said i keep you here because i need you how you shall see later not today second all is well in kabul the british keep to their cantonment and the afghans snipe at them from time to time and make loud noises the king of afghanistan shah sujah here he curled his lip in amusement sits doing nothing among his women in the bala hissar and calls to the british to help him against his unruly people the mobs rule kabul itself each mob under its leader imagining that it alone has frightened the british off they do a little looting and a little raping and a little killing their own people mark you and are content for the moment there you have the situation which is most satisfactory oh yes and the hill tribes hearing of the death of sekundar burnes and of the rumoured presence in kabul of one akbar khan son of the true king dost mohammed are converging on the capital they smell war and plunder now flashman huzoor you are answered well of course in answering half a dozen questions he had posed a hundred others but one above all i had to be satisfied about you say the british keep to their cantonment i cried but what about burness murder dyou mean theyve done nothing in effect nothing says he they are unwise for their inaction is taken as cowardice you and i know they are not cowards but the kabuli mobs dont and i fear this may encourage them to greater excesses than they have committed already but we shall see however all this leads me to my purpose in visiting you today apart from my desire to inquire into your welfare and he grinned again that infectious smile which seemed to mock but which i couldnt dislike you understand that if i satisfy your curiosity here and there i also have questions which i would wish answered ask away says i rather cautious you said at our first meeting or at least you implied that elfistan sahib and mcloten sahib were how shall i put it sometimes less than intelligent was that a considered judgement elphinstone sahib and mcnaghten sahib says i are a pair of born bloody fools as anyone in the bazaar will tell you the people in the bazaar have not the advantage of serving on elfistan sahibs staff says he drily that is why i attach importance to your opinion now are they trustworthy this was a deuced odd question from an afghan i thought and for a moment i nearly replied that they were english officers blast his eyes but you would have been wasting your time talking that way to akbar khan yes theyre trustworthy i said one more than the other which would you trust with your horse or your wife i take it you have no children i didnt think long about this id trust elphy bey to do his best like a gentleman i said but it probably wouldnt be much of a best thank you flashman says he that is all i need to know now i regret that i must cut short our most interesting little discussion but i have many affairs to attend to i shall come again and we shall speak further now hold on i began for i wanted to know how long he intended to keep me locked up and a good deal more but he turned me aside most politely and left and there i was for another two weeks damn him with no one but the silent barukzis for company i didnt doubt what he had told me about the situation in kabul was true but i couldnt understand it it made no sense a prominent british official murdered and nothing done to avenge him as it proved this was exactly what had happened when the mob looted the residency and i sekundar was hacked to bits old elphy and mcnaghten had gone into the vapours but theyd done virtually nothing they had written notes to each other wondering whether to march into the city or move into the bala hissar fort or bring sale who was still bogged down by the gilzais at gandamack back to kabul in the end they did nothing and the kabuli mobs roamed the city as akbar said doing what they pleased and virtually besieging our people in the cantonment elphy could of course have crushed the mobs by firm action but he didnt he just wrung his hands and took to his bed and mcnaghten wrote him stiff little suggestions about the provisioning of the cantonment for the winter meanwhile the kabulis who at first had been scared stiff when they realised what they had done in murdering burnes got damned uppish and started attacking the outposts near the cantonment and shooting up our quarters at night one attempt and only one was made to squash them and that foultempered idiot brigadier shelton bungled it handsomely he took a strong force out to beymaroo and the kabulis just a damned drove of shopkeepers and stable hands mark you not real afghan warriors chased him and his troops back to the cantonment after that there was nothing to be done morale in the cantonment went to rockbottom and the countryside afghans who had been watching to see what would happen decided they were on a good thing and came rampaging into the city the signs were that if the mobs and the tribesmen really settled down to business they could swarm over the cantonment whenever they felt like it all this i learned later of course colin mackenzie who was through it all said it was pathetic to see how old elphy shillyshallied and changed his mind and mcnaghten still refused to believe that disaster was approaching what had begun as mob violence was rapidly developing into a general uprising and all that was wanting on the afghan side was a leader who would take charge of events and of course unknown to elphy and mcnaghten and the rest of them there was such a leader watching events from a house in kabul biding his time and every now and then asking me questions for after a fortnights lapse akbar khan came to me again polite and bland as ever and talked about it and about speculating on such various matters as british policy in india and the rate of march of british troops in cold weather he came ostensibly to gossip but he pumped me for all he was worth and i let him pump there was nothing else i could do he began visiting me daily and i got tired of demanding my release and having my questions deftly ignored but there was no help for it i could only be patient and see what this jovial clever gentleman had in mind for me of what he had in mind for himself i was getting a pretty fair idea and events proved me right finally more than a month after burness murder akbar came and told me i was to be released i could have kissed him almost for i was fed up with being jailed and not even an afghan bint to keep me amused he looked mighty serious however and asked me to be seated while he spoke to me on behalf of the leaders of the faithful he had three of his pals with him and i wondered if he meant them one of them his cousin sultan jan he had brought before a leerylooking cove with a fork beard the others were called muhammed din a finelooking old lad with a silver beard and khan hamet a oneeyed thug with the face of a horsethief they sat and looked at me and akbar talked first my dear friend flashman says he all charm i must tell you that you have been kept here not only for your own good but for your peoples their situation is now bad why i do not know but elfistan sahib has behaved like a weak old woman he has allowed the mobs to rage where they will he has left the deaths of his servants unavenged he has exposed his soldiers to the worst fate of all humiliation by keeping them shut up in cantonments while the afghan rabble mock at them now his own troops are sick at heart they have no fight in them he paused picking his words the british cannot stay here now he went on they have lost their power and we afghans wish to be rid of them there are those who say we should slaughter them all needless to say i do not agree and he smiled for one thing it might not be so easy it is never easy said old muhammed din these same feringhees took ghuznee fort i saw them by god and for another what would the harvest be went on akbar the white queen avenges her children no there must be a peaceful withdrawal to india this is what i would prefer myself i am no enemy of the british but they have been guests in my country too long one of em a month too long says i and he laughed you are one feringhee flashman who is welcome to stay as long as he chooses says he but for the rest they have to go they came to put sujah on the throne says i they wont leave him in the lurch they have already agreed to do so said akbar smoothly myself i have arranged the terms of withdrawal with mcloten sahib youve seen mcnaghten indeed the british have agreed with me and the chiefs to march out to peshawar as soon as they have gathered provisions for the journey and struck their camp sujah it is agreed remains on the throne and the british are guaranteed safe conduct through the passes so we were quitting kabul i didnt mind but i wondered how elphy and mcnaghten were going to explain this away to calcutta inglorious retreat pushed out by niggers dont look well at all of course the bit about sujah staying on the throne was all my eye once we were out of the way theyd blind him quietly and pop him in a fortress and forget about him and the man who would take his place was sitting watching how i took the news well says i at last there it is but what have i to do with it i mean ill just toddle off with the rest wont i akbar leaned forward i have made it sound too simple perhaps there are problems for example mcloten has made his treaty to withdraw not only with myself but with the douranis the gilzais the kuzzilbashies and so on all as equals now when the british have gone all these factions will be left behind and who will be the master shah sujah according to you he can rule only if he has a united majority of the tribes supporting him as things stand that would be difficult for they eye each other askance oh mcloten sahib is not the fool you think him he has been at work to divide us well cant you unite them youre dost mohammeds son aint you and all through the passes a month ago i heard nothing but akbar khan and what a hell of a fellow he was he laughed and clapped his hands how gratifying oh i have a following it is true you have all afghanistan growls sultan jan as for sujah i have what i have akbar interrupted him suddenly chilly it is not enough if i am to support sujah as he must be supported there was a moment of silence not very comfortable and akbar went on the douranis dislike me and they are powerful it would be better if their wings were clipped theirs and a few others this cannot be done after the british have left with british help it can be done in time oho i thought now we have it what i propose is this says akbar looking me in the eye mcloten must break his treaty so far as the douranis are concerned he must assist me in their overthrow in return for this i will allow him for with the douranis and their allies gone i shall have the power to stay in kabul another eight months in that time i shall become sujahs vizier the power at his elbow the country will be so quiet then so quiet that the cheep of a kandahar mouse will be heard in kabul that the british will be able to withdraw in honour is not this fair the alternative now is a hurried withdrawal which no one here can guarantee in safety for none has the power to restrain the wilder tribes and afghanistan will be left to warring factions i have observed in the course of a dishonest life that when a rogue is outlining a treacherous plan he works harder to convince himself than to move his hearers akbar wanted to cook his afghan enemies goose that was all and perfectly understandable but he wanted to look like a gentleman still to himself will you carry my proposal secretly to mcloten sahib flashman he asked if hed asked me to carry his proposal of marriage to queen victoria id have agreed so of course i said aye at once you may add that as part of the bargain i shall expect a down payment of twenty lakhs of rupees he added and four thousand a year for life i think mcloten sahib will find this reasonable since i am probably preserving his political career and your own too thinks i sujahs vizier indeed once the douranis were out of the way it would be farewell sujah and long live king akbar not that i minded after all i would be able to say i was on nodding terms with a king even if he was only a king of afghanistan now went on akbar you must deliver my proposals to mcloten sahib personally and in the presence of muhammed din and khan hamet here who will accompany you if it seems he flashed his smile that i dont trust you my friend let me say that i trust no one the reflection is not personal the wise son croaked khan hamet opening his mouth for the first time mistrusts his mother doubtless he knew his own family best i pointed out that the plan might appear to mcnaghten to be a betrayal of the other chiefs and his own part in it dishonourable akbar nodded and said gently i have spoken with mcloten sahib remember he is a politician he seemed to think that was answer enough so i let it be then akbar said you will tell mcloten that if he agrees as i think he will he must come to meet me at mohammeds fort beyond the cantonment walls the day after tomorrow he must have a strong force at hand within the cantonment ready to emerge at the word and seize the douranis and their allies who will be with me thereafter we will dispose matters as seems best to us is this agreed and he looked at his three fellows who nodded agreement tell mcloten sahib said sultan jan with a nasty grin that if he wills he may have the head of amenoolah khan who led the attack on sekundar burness residency also that in this whole matter we of the barukzis have the friendship of the gilzais if both gilzais and barukzis were in the plot it seemed to me that akbar was on solid ground mcnaghten would think so too but to me sitting looking at those four faces bland akbar and his trio of villains the whole thing stank like a dead camel i would have trusted the parcel of them as much as gul shahs snakes however i kept a straight face and that afternoon the guard at the cantonments main gate was amazed by the sight of lieutenant flashman clad in the mail of a barukzi warrior and accompanied by muhammed din and khan hamet riding down in state from kabul city they had thought me dead a month ago chopped to bits with burnes but here i was larger than life the word spread like fire and when we reached the gates there was a crowd waiting for us with tall colin mackenzie at their head where the devil have you come from he demanded his blue eyes wide open i leaned down so that no one else should hear and said akbar khan he stared at me hard to see if i was mad or joking and then said come to the envoy at once and cleared a way through the crowd for us there was a great hubbub and shouting of questions but mackenzie shepherded us all three straight to the envoys quarters and into mcnaghtens presence cant it wait mackenzie says he peevishly im just about to dine but a dozen words from mackenzie changed his tune he stared at me through his spectacles perched as always on the very tip of his nose my god flashman alive and from akbar khan you say and who are these and he indicated my companions once you suggested i should bring you hostages from akbar sir william says i well here they are if you like he didnt take it well but snapped to me to come in directly to dinner with him the two afghans of course wouldnt eat at an unbelievers table so they waited in his office where food was brought to them muhammed din reminded me that akbars message must be delivered only in their presence so i contented myself by telling mcnaghten that i felt as though i was loaded with explosives but that it must wait till after dinner however as we ate i was able to give him an account of burness murder and my own adventures with gul shah i told it very plain and offhand but mcnaghten kept exclaiming good god all the way through and at the tale of my tugofwar his glasses fell into his curry mackenzie sat watching me narrowly pulling at his fair moustache and when i was done and mcnaghten was spluttering his astonishment mackenzie just said good work flash this was praise from him for he was a tough cold ramrod of a man and reckoned the bravest in the kabul garrison except maybe for george broadfoot if he told my tale and he would flashys stock would rise to new heights which was all to the good over the port mcnaghten tried to draw me about akbar but i said it must wait until we joined the two afghans not that i minded much but it made mcnaghten sniffy which was always excuse enough for me he said sarcastically that i seemed to have gone native altogether and that i did not need to be so nice but mackenzie said shortly that i was right which put his excellency into the sulks he muttered that it was a fine thing when important officials could be bearded by military whippersnappers and the sooner we got to business the better it would be so we adjourned to his study and presently muhammed and hamet came in greeted the envoy courteously and received his cool nod in reply he was a conceited prig sure enough then i launched into akbars proposal i can see them still mcnaughten sitting back in his cane chair legs crossed fingertips together staring at the ceiling the two silent afghans their eyes fixed on him and the tall fair mackenzie leaning against the wall puffing a cheroot watching the afghans no one said a word as i talked and no one moved i wondered if mcnaghten understood what i was saying he never twitched a muscle when i was finished he waited a full minute slowly took off his glasses and polished them and said quietly most interesting we must consider what the sirdar akbar has said his message is of the greatest weight and importance but of course it is not to be answered in haste only one thing will i say now the queens envoy cannot consider the suggestion of bloodshed contained in the offer of the head of amenoolah khan that is repugnant to me he turned to the two afghans you will be tired sirs so we will detain you no longer tomorrow we will talk again it was still only early evening so he was talking rot but the two afghans seemed to understand diplomatic language they bowed gravely and withdrew mcnaghten watched the door close on them then he sprang to his feet saved at the eleventh hour cried he divide and conquer mackenzie i had dreamed of something precisely like this his pale worn face was all smiles now i knew i knew that these people were incapable of keeping faith with one another behold me proved right mackenzie studied his cigar you mean youll accept accept of course i shall accept this is a heavensent opportunity eight months eh much can happen in that time we may never leave afghanistan at all but if we do it will be with credit he rubbed his hands and set to among the papers on his desk this should revive even our friend elphinstone eh mackenzie i dont like it says mackenzie i think its a plot mcnaghten stopped to stare at him a plot then he laughed short and sharp oho a plot let me alone for that trust me for that i dont like it a bit says mackenzie and why not pray tell me why not isnt it logical akbar must be cock o the walk so out must go his enemies the douranis hell use us to be sure but it is to our own advantage theres a hole in it says mac hell never serve as vizier to sujah hes lying in that at least what of it i tell you mackenzie it doesnt matter one per cent whether he or sujah rules in kabul we shall be secured by this let them fight among themselves as they will it makes us all the stronger akbar isnt to be trusted mac was beginning but mcnaghten poohpoohed him you dont know one of the first rules of politics that a man can be trusted to follow his own interest i see perfectly well that akbar is after undisputed power among his own people well whos to blame him and i tell you i believe you wrong akbar khan in our meetings he has impressed me more than any other afghan i have met i judge him to be a man of his word the douranis are probably saying that too says i and had the icy spectacles turned on me for my pains but mackenzie took me up fast enough and asked me what i thought i dont trust akbar either says i mind you i like the chap but he aint straight flashman probably knows him better than we do says mac and mcnaghten exploded now really captain mackenzie i believe i can trust my own judgement do you know against even that of such a distinguished diplomatist as mr flashman here he snorted and sat down at his desk i should be interested to hear precisely what akbar khan has to gain by treachery towards us what purpose his proposal can have other than that which is apparent well can you tell me mac just stubbed out his cheroot if i could tell you sir if i could see a definite trick in all this id be a happier man dealing with afghans its what i dont see and dont understand that worries me lunatic philosophy says mcnaghten and wouldnt listen to another word he was sold on akbars plan plain enough and so determined that next morning he had muhammed and hamet in and signified his acceptance in writing which they were to take back to akbar khan i thought that downright foolish for it was concrete evidence of mcnaghtens part in what was after all a betrayal one or two of his advisers tried to dissuade him from putting pen to paper at least but he wouldnt budge trouble is the mans desperate mackenzie told me akbars proposal came at just the right moment when mcnaghten felt the last ray of hope was gone and he was going to have to skulk out of kabul with his tail between his legs he wants to believe akbars offer is above board well young flash i dont know about you but when we go out to see akbar tomorrow im taking my guns along i was feeling pretty nervous about it myself and i wasnt cheered by the sight of elphy bey when mcnaghten took me along to see him that afternoon the old fellow was lying on a daybed on his verandah while one of the garrison ladies i forget who was reading the scriptures to him he couldnt have been more pleased to see me and was full of praise for my exploits but he looked so old and wasted in his nightcap and gown that i thought my god what chance have we with this to command us mcnaghten was pretty short with him for when elphy heard of akbars plan he looked down in the mouth and asked if mcnaghten wasnt afraid of some treachery none at all says mcnaghten i wish you to have two regiments and two guns got ready quickly and quietly for the capture of mohammed khans fort where we shall met sirdar akbar tomorrow morning the rest you can leave to me elphy looked unhappy about this it is all very uncertain says he fretting i fear they are not to be trusted you know it is a very strange plot to be sure oh my god says mcnaghten if you think so then let us march out and fight them and i am sure we shall beat them i cant my dear sir william says old elphy and it was pathetic to hear his quavering voice the troops arent to be counted on you see well then we must accept the sirdars proposals elphy fretted some more and mcnaghten was nearly beside himself with impatience finally he snapped out i understand these things better than you and turned on his heel and stamped off the verandah elphy was much distressed and lamented on about the sad state of affairs and the lack of agreement i suppose he is right and he does understand better than i at least i hope so but you must take care flashman all of you must take care between him and mcnaghten i felt pretty down but evening brought my spirits up for i went to lady sales house where there was quite a gathering of the garrison and wives and found i was something of a lion mackenzie had told my story and they were all over me even lady sale a vinegary old dragon with a tongue like a carving knife was civil captain mackenzie has given us a remarkable account of your adventures says she you must be very tired come and sit here by me i poohpoohed the adventures of course but was told to hold my tongue we have little enough to our credit says lady sale so we must make the most of what we have you at least have behaved with courage and common sense which is more than can be said for some older heads among us she meant poor old elphy of course and she and the other ladies lost no time in taking his character to pieces they did not think much of mcnaghten either and i was surprised at the viciousness of their opinions it was only later that i understood that they were really frightened women they had cause to be however everyone seemed to enjoy slanging elphy and the envoy and it was quite a jolly party i left about midnight it was snowing and bright moonlight and as i walked to my billet i found myself thinking of christmastime in england and the coachride back from rugby when the half ended and warm brandypunch in the hall and the roaring fire in the diningroom grate with father and his cronies talking and laughing and warming their backsides i wished i was there with my young wife and tat the thought of her my innards tightened by god i hadnt had a woman in weeks and there was nothing to be had in the cantonments that was something i would speedily put right after we had finished our business with akbar in the morning and things were back to normal perhaps it was reaction from listening to those whining females but it seemed to me as i went to sleep that mcnaghten was probably right and our plot with akbar was all for the best i was up before dawn and dressed in my afghan clothes it was easier to hide a brace of pistols beneath them than in a uniform i buckled on my sword and rode over to the gate where mcnaghten and mackenzie were already waiting with a few native troopers mcnaghten in his frock coat and top hat was sitting a mule and damning the eyes of a bombay cavalry cornet it seemed the escort was not ready and brigadier shelton had not yet assembled the troops who were to overpower the douranis you may tell the brigadier there is never anything ready or right where he is concerned mcnaghten was saying it is all of a piece we are surrounded by military incompetents well it wont do i shall go out to the meeting and shelton must have his troops ready to advance within the half hour must i say is that understood the cornet scuttled off and mcnaghten blew his nose and swore to mackenzie he would wait no longer mac urged him to hold on at least till there was some sign that shelton was moving but mcnaghten said oh he is probably in his bed still but ive sent word to le geyt he will see the thing attended to ah here are trevor and lawrence now gentlemen there has been time enough wasted forward i didnt like this the plan had been that akbar and the chiefs including the douranis should be assembled near mohammeds fort which was less than a quarter of a mile from the cantonment gates once mcnaghten and akbar had greeted each other shelton was to emerge from the cantonment at speed and the douranis would be surrounded and overcome between our troops and the other chiefs but shelton wasnt ready we didnt even have an escort and it seemed to me that the five of us and the native troopers who were only half a dozen or so strong might have an uncomfortable time before shelton came on the scene young lawrence thought so too for he asked mcnaghten as we trotted through the gate if it would not be better to wait mcnaghten snapped his head off and said we could simply talk to akbar until shelton emerged when the thing would be done suppose theres treachery says lawrence wed be better to have the troops ready to move at the signal i cant wait any longer cries mcnaghten and he was shaking but whether with fear or cold or excitement i didnt know and i heard him mutter to lawrence that he knew there might be treachery but what could he do we must just hope akbar would keep faith with us anyway mcnaghten would rather risk his own life than be disgraced by scuttling hangdog out of kabul success will save our honour says he and make up for all the rest we rode out across the snowy meadow towards the canal it was a sparkling clear morning bitterly cold kabul city lay straight ahead grey and silent to our left kabul river wound its oily way beneath the low banks and beyond it the great bala hissar fort seemed to crouch like a watchdog over the white fields we rode in silence now our hooves crunching the snow from the four in front of me the white trails of breath rose over their shoulders everything was very quiet we came to the canal bridge and just beyond it was the slope running down from mohammeds fort beside the river the slope was dotted with afghans in the centre where a blue bokhara carpet was spread on the snow was a knot of chieftains with akbar in their midst their followers waited at a distance but i reckoned there must be fifty men in view barukzis gilzais douranis yes by god and ghazis that was a nasty sight were mad i thought riding into this why even if shelton advances at the double we could have our throats cut before hes half way here i looked back over my shoulder to the cantonment but there was no sign of sheltons soldiers mind you at this stage that was just as well we rode to the foot of the slope and what i was shivering with was not the cold akbar rode down to meet us on a black charger and himself very spruce in a steel backandbreast like a cuirassier with his spiked helmet wrapped about with a green turban he was all smiles and called out greetings to mcnaghten sultan jan and the chiefs behind were all looking as jovial as father christmas and nodding and bowing towards us this looks damned unhealthy muttered mackenzie the chiefs were advancing straight to us but the other afghans on the slopes on either side seemed to me to be edging forward i gulped down my fear but there was nothing for it but to go on now akbar and mcnaghten had met and were shaking hands in the saddle one of the native troopers had been leading a lovely little white mare which he now took forward and mcnaghten presented it to akbar who received it with delight seeing him so cheerful i tried to tell myself it was all right the plot was laid mcnaghten knew what he was doing i really had nothing to fear the afghans were round us now anyway but they seemed friendly enough still only mackenzie showed by the cock of his head and his cold eye that he was ready to drop his hand on his pistol butt at the first sign of a false move well well cries akbar shall we dismount we did and akbar led mcnaghten on to the carpet lawrence was right at their heels and looking pretty wary he must have said something for akbar laughed and called out lawrence sahib need not be nervous were all friends here i found myself with old muhammed din beside me bowing and greeting me and i noticed that mackenzie and trevor too were being engaged in friendly conversation it was all so pally that i could have sworn there was something up but mcnaghten seemed to have regained his confidence and was chatting away smoothly to akbar something told me not to stand still but to keep on the move i walked towards mcnaghten to hear what was passing between him and akbar and the ring of afghans seemed to draw closer to the carpet youll observe also that im wearing the gift of pistols received from lawrence sahib akbar was saying ah there is flashman come up old friend and let me see you mcloten sahib let me tell you that flashman is my favourite guest when he comes from you prince says mcnaghten he is my favourite messenger ah yes says akbar flashing his smile he is a prince of messengers then he turned to look mcnaghten in the eye and said i understand that the message he bore found favour in your excellencys sight the buzz of voices around us died away and it seemed that everyone was suddenly watching mcnaghten he seemed to sense it but he nodded in reply to akbar it is agreed then says akbar it is agreed says mcnaghten and akbar stared him full in the face for a few seconds and then suddenly threw himself forward clapping his arms round mcnaghtens body and pinning his hands to his sides take them he shouted and i saw lawrence who had been just behind mcnaghten seized by two afghans at his elbows mackenzies cry of surprise sounded beside me and he started forward towards mcnaghten but one of the barukzis jumped between waving a pistol trevor ran at akbar but they wrestled him down before he had gone a yard i take some pride when i think back to that moment while the others started forward instinctively to aid mcnaghten i alone kept my head this was no place for flashman and i saw only one way out i had been walking towards akbar and mcnaghten remember and as soon as i saw the sirdar move i bounded ahead not at him but past him and so close that my sleeve brushed his back just beyond him on the edge of the carpet stood the little white mare which mcnaghten had brought as a gift there was a groom at her head but i was too fast for him i mounted in one flying leap and the little beast reared in astonishment sending the groom flying and causing the others to give back from her flashing forehooves she curvetted sideways before i got her under control with a hand in her mane one wild glance round for a way out was all i had time for but it showed me the way on all sides afghans were running in towards the group on the carpet the knives were out and the ghazis were yelling blue murder straight downhill ahead of me they seemed thinnest i jammed my heels into the mares sides and she leaped forward striking aside a ruffian in a skullcap who was snatching at her head the impact caused her to swerve and before i could check her she was plunging towards the struggling crowd in the centre of the carpet she was one of your purebred mettlesome bitches all nerves and speed and all i could do was clamp my knees to her flanks and hang on one split second i had to survey the scene before she was in the middle of it mcnaghten with two afghans holding his arms was being pushed headlong down the hill his tall hat falling from his head his glasses gone and his mouth open in horror mackenzie i saw being thrown like a bolster over the flanks of a horse with a big barukzi in the saddle and lawrence was being served the same way he was fighting like a mad thing trevor i didnt see but i think i heard him as my little mare drove into the press like a thunderbolt there was a horrid bubbling scream and an exultant yell of ghazi voices i had no time for anything but clinging to the mare yet even in my terror i noticed akbar sabre in hand thrusting back a ghazi who was trying to come at lawrence with a knife mackenzie was shouting and another ghazi thrust at him with a lance but akbar cool as you please struck the lance aside with his sword and shouted with laughter lords of my country are you he yelled youll protect me will you mackenzie sahib then my mare had bounded past them i had a few yards to steady her and to move in and i set her head downhill seize him shouted akbar take him alive hands grabbed at the mares head and at my legs but we had the speed thank god and burst through them straight downhill across the canal bridge there was the level stretch beside the river and beyond lay the cantonment once over the bridge on this mare there wasnt a mounted afghan who could come near me gasping with fear i clung to the mane and urged her forward it must have taken longer to seize my mount burst through the press and take flight than i had imagined for i was suddenly aware that mcnaghten and the two afghans who were carrying him off were twenty yards down the hill and almost right in my path as they saw me bearing down on them one of them sprang back grasping a pistol from his belt there was no way of avoiding the fellow and i lugged out my sword with one hand holding on grimly with the other but instead of shooting at me he levelled his piece at the envoy for gods sake mcnaghten cried and then the pistol banged and he staggered back clutching at his face i rode full tilt into the man who had shot him and the mare reared back on her haunches there was a mob around us now slashing at mcnaghten as he fell and bounding over the snow at me i yelled in rage and panic and swung my sword blindly it whistled through the empty air and i nearly overbalanced but the mare righted me and i slashed again and this time struck something that crunched and fell away the air was full of howls and threats i lunged furiously and managed to shake off a hand that was clutching at my left leg something cracked into the saddle beside my thigh and the mare shrieked and bounded forward another leap another blind slash of my sword and we were clear with the mob cursing and streaming at our heels i put my head down and my heels in and we went like a derby winner in the last furlong we were down the slope and across the bridge when i saw ahead of me a little party of horsemen trotting slowly in our direction in front i recognised le geyt this was the escort that was to have guarded mcnaghten but of shelton and his troops there was no sign well they might just be in time to convoy his corpse if the ghazis left any of it i stood up in the stirrups glancing behind to make sure the pursuit was distanced and hallooed but the only effect was that the cowardly brutes turned straight round and made for the cantonment at full pelt le geyt did make some effort to rally them but they paid no heed well i am a poltroon myself but this was ridiculous it costs nothing to make a show when all is said acting on the thought i wheeled my mare sure enough the nearest afghans were a hundred yards in my rear and had given up chasing me as far again beyond them a crowd was milling round the spot where mcnaghten had fallen even as i watched they began to yell and dance and i saw a spear upthrust with something grey stuck on the end of it just for an instant i thought well burnes will get the job now and then i remembered burnes was dead say what you like the political service is a chancy business i could make out akbar in his glittering steel breastplate surrounded by an excited crowd but there was no sign of mackenzie or lawrence by god i thought im the only survivor and as le geyt came spurring up to me i rode forward a few paces on impulse and waved my sword over my head it was impressively bloody from having hit somebody in the scramble akbar khan i roared and on the hillside faces began to turn to look down towards me akbar khan you forsworn treacherous dog le geyt was babbling at my elbow but i paid no heed come down you infidel i shouted come down and fight like a man i was confident that he wouldnt even if he could hear me which was unlikely but some of the nearer afghans could there was a move in my direction come away sir do cries le geyt see they are advancing they were still a safe way off you dirty dog i roared have you no shame you that call yourself sirdar you murder unarmed old men but will you come and fight with bloody lance and i waved my sabre again for gods sake cries le geyt you cant fight them all havent i just been doing that says i by god ive a good mind he grabbed me by the arm and pointed the ghazis were advancing straggling groups of them were crossing the bridge i didnt see any guns among them but they were getting uncomfortably close sending your jackals are you i bawled its you i want you afghan bastard well if you wont you wont but therell be another day with which i wheeled about and we made off for the cantonment gate before the ghazis got within charging distance they can move fast when they want to at the gate all was chaos there were troops hastily forming up and servants and hangerson scattering everywhere shelton was wrestling into his swordbelt and bawling orders red in the face he caught sight of me my god flashman what is this where is the envoy dead says i cut to bits and mackenzie with him for all i know he just gaped who what how akbar khan cut em up sir says i very cool and i added we had been expecting you and the regiment but you didnt come there was a crowd round us officers and officials and even a few of the troops who had broken ranks didnt come says shelton in gods name sir i was coming this moment this was the time appointed by the general this astonished me well he was late says i damned late there was a tremendous hubbub about us and cries of massacre all dead but flashman my god look at him the envoys murdered and so on le geyt pushed his way through them and we left shelton roaring to his men to stand fast till he found what the devil was what he spurred up beside me demanding to know what had taken place and when i told him all of it damning akbar for a treacherous villain we must see the general at once says he how the devil did you come off alive flashman you may well ask sir cries le geyt look here and he pointed to my saddle i remembered having felt a blow near my leg in the skirmish and when i looked there was a khyber knife with its point buried in the saddle bag one of the ghazis must have thrown it two inches either way and it would have disabled me or the mare just the thought of what that would have meant blew all the brag i had been showing clean away i felt ill and weak le geyt steadied me in the saddle and they helped me down at elphys front door while the crowd buzzed around i straightened up and as shelton and i mounted the steps i heard le geyt saying he cut his way through the pack ofem and even then he would have ridden back in alone if i hadnt stopped him he would i tell you just to come at akbar that lifted my spirits a little and i thought aye give a dog a good name and hes everyones pet then shelton thrusting everyone aside had us in elphys study and was pouring out his tale or rather my tale elphy listened like a man who cannot believe what he sees and hears he sat appalled his sick face grey and his mouth moving and i thought again what in gods name have we got for a commander oddly enough it wasnt the helpless look in the mans eyes the droop of his shoulders or even his evident illness that affected me it was the sight of his skinny ankles and feet and bedroom slippers sticking out beneath his gown they looked so ridiculous in one who was a general of an army when we had done he just stared and said my god what is to be done oh sir william sir william what a calamity after a few moments he pulled himself together and said we must take counsel what to do then he looked at me and said flashman thank god you at least are safe you come like randolph murray the single bearer of dreadful news tell my orderly to summon the senior officers if you please and then have the doctors look at you i believe he thought i was wounded i thought then and i think now that he was sick in mind as well as in body he seemed as my wifes relatives would have said to be wandered we had proof of this in the next hour or two the cantonment of course was in a hubbub and all sorts of rumours were flying one believe it or not was that mcnaghten had not been killed at all but had gone into kabul to continue discussions with akbar and in spite of having heard my story this was what elphy came round to believing the old fool always fixed on what he wanted to believe rather than what common sense suggested however his daydream didnt last long akbar released lawrence and mackenzie in the afternoon and they confirmed my tale they had been locked up in mohammed khans fort and had seen mcnaghtens severed limbs flourished by the ghazis later the murderers hung what was left of him and trevor on hooks in the butchers stalls of the kabul bazaar looking back i believe that akbar would rather have had mcnaghten alive than dead there is still great dispute about this but its my belief that akbar had deliberately lured mcnaghten into a plot against the douranis to test him when mcnaghten accepted akbar knew he was not to be trusted he never intended to hold power in afghanistan in league with us he wanted the whole show for himself and mcnaughtens bad faith gave him the opportunity to seize it but he would rather have held mcnaghten hostage than kill him for one thing the envoys death could have cost akbar all his hopes and his life a more resolute commander than elphy anyone in fact would have marched out of the cantonment to avenge it and swept the killers out of kabul we could have done it too the troops that elphy had said he couldnt rely on were furious over mcnaghtens murder they were itching for a fight but of course elphy wouldnt have it he must shillyshally as usual so we skulked all day in the cantonment while the afghans themselves were actually in a state of fear in case we might attack them this i learned later mackenzie reckoned if we had shown face the whole lot would have cut and run anyway this is history at the time i only knew what i had seen and heard and i didnt like it a bit it seemed to me that having slaughtered the envoy the afghans would now start on the rest of us and having seen elphy wringing his hands and croaking i couldnt see what was to stop them perhaps it was the shock of my morning escape but i was in the shivering dumps for the rest of the day i could feel those khyber knives and imagine the ghazis yelling as they cut us to bits i even wondered if it might not be best to get a fast horse and make off from kabul as quickly as i could but that prospect was as dangerous as staying but by the next day things didnt look quite so bad akbar sent some of the chiefs down to express his regrets for mcnaghtens death and to resume the negotiations as if nothing had happened and elphy ready to clutch at anything agreed to talk he didnt see what else he could do he said the long and short of it was that the afghans told us we must quit kabul at once leaving our guns behind and also certain married officers and their wives as hostages it doesnt seem credible now but elphy actually accepted he offered a cash subsidy to any married officer who would go with his family as hostages to akbar there was a tremendous uproar over this men were saying they would shoot their wives sooner than put them at the mercy of the ghazis there was a move to get elphy to take action for once by marching out and occupying the bala hissar where we could have defied all afghanistan in arms but he couldnt make up his mind and nothing was done the day after mcnaghtens death there was a council of officers at which elphy presided he was in terribly poor shape on top of everything else he had had an accident that morning he had decided to be personally armed in view of the emergency and had sent for his pistols his servant had dropped one while loading it and the pistol had gone off the ball had passed through elphys chair nicking his backside but doing no other damage shelton who could not abide elphy made the most of this the afghans murder our people try to make off with our wives order us out of the country and what does our commander do shoots himself in the arse doubtless in an attempt to blow his brains out he cant have missed by much mackenzie who had no great regard for elphy either but even less for shelton suggested he might try to be helpful instead of sneering at the old fellow shelton rounded on him i will sneer at him mackenzie says he i like sneering at him and after this to show what he thought he took his blankets into the council and lay on them throughout puffing at a cheroot and sniffing loudly whenever elphy said anything unusually foolish he sniffed a good deal i was at the council in view of my part in the negotiations i suppose and for pure folly it matches anything in my military career and i was with raglan in the crimea remember it was obvious from the first that elphy wanted to do anything that the afghans said he must do he desired to be convinced that nothing else was possible with poor sir william gone we are at a nonplus here he kept repeating looking around dolefully for someone to agree with him we can serve no purpose that i can see by remaining in afghanistan there were a few spoke out against this but not many pottinger a smart sort of fellow who had succeeded by default to burness job was for marching into the bala hissar it was madness he said to attempt to retreat through the passes to india in midwinter with the army hampered by hundreds of women and children and camp followers anyway he didnt trust akbars safe conduct he warned elphy that the sirdar couldnt stop the ghazis cutting us up in the passes even if he wanted to it seemed good sense to me i was all for the bala hissar myself so long as someone else led the way and flashy was at his post beside elphy bey with the rest of the army surrounding us but the voices were all against pottinger it wasnt that they agreed with elphy but they didnt fancy staying in kabul through the winter under his conmmand they wanted rid of him and that meant getting him and the army back to india god knows what hell do if we stay here someone muttered make akbar political officer probably a quick march through the passes says another theyll let us go rather than risk trouble they argued on until at last they were too tired and dispirited to talk any further elphy sat glooming round in the silence but not giving any decision and finally shelton got up ground out his cheroot and snaps well i take it we go upon my word we must have a clear direction is it your wish sir that i take order for the army to remove to india with all possible speed elphy sat looking miserable his fingers twitching together in his lap it will be for the best perhaps he said at last i could wish it were otherwise and that you had a commander not incapacitated by disease will you be so kind brigadier shelton as to take what order you think most fitting so with no proper idea of what lay ahead or how we should go with the army dispirited and the officers divided and with a commander announcing hourly that he was not fit to lead us the decision was taken we were to quit kabul it took about a week to conclude the agreement with the afghans and even longer to gather up the army and all its followers and make it even halffit for the road as elphys aide i had my hands full carrying his orders and then other orders to countermand the first ones and listening to his bleating and sheltons snarling one thing i was determined on that flashy at any rate was going to get back to india whoever else did not i had my idea about how this should be done and it did not consist of taking my simple chance with the rest the whole business of getting the army to pull up its roots and provisioned and equipped for the journey proved to be such a mess that i was confident most of them would never see jallalabad beyond the passes where sale was now holding out and we could count ourselves safe so i looked out sergeant hudson who had been with me at mogala and was as reliable as he was stupid i told him i wanted twelve picked lancers formed into a special detail under my command not my gilzais for in the present state of the country i doubted whether they would be prepared to get their throats cut on my behalf the twelve would make as good an escort as i could hope for and when the time came for the army to founder we could cut loose and make jallalabad on our own i didnt tell hudson this of course but explained that this troop and i would be employed on the march as a special messenger corps since orders would be forever passing up and down the column i told elphy the same thing and added that we could also act as mounted scouts and general busybodies he looked at me like a tired cow this will be dangerous work flashman says he i fear it will be a perilous journey and this will expose you to the brunt of it never say die sir says i very manful well come through and anyway there aint an afghan of the lot of them thats a match for me oh my boy says he and the silly old bastard began piping his eye my boy so young so valiant oh england says he looking out of the window what dost thou not owe to thy freshest plants so be it flashman god bless you i wanted rather more insurance than that so i made certain that hudson packed our saddlebags with twice as much hardtack as we would need supplies were obviously going to be short and i believed in getting our blow in first in addition to the lovely little white mare i had taken from akbar i picked out another afghan pony for my own use if one mount sank i should have the other these were the essentials for the journey but i had an eye to the luxuries as well confined to the cantonment as we were i had not had a woman for an age and i was getting peckish to make it worse in that christmas week a messenger had come through from india with mails among them was a letter from elspeth i recognised the handwriting and my heart gave a skip when i opened it i got a turn for it began to my most beloved hector and i thought by god shes cheating on me and has sent me the wrong letter by mistake but in the second line was a reference to achilles and another to ajax so i understood she was just addressing me in terms which she accounted fitting for a martial paladin she knew no better it was a common custom at that timein the more romantic females to see their soldier husbands and sweethearts as greek heroes instead of the whoremongering drunken clowns most of them were however the greek heroes were probably no better so it was not so far off the mark it was a commonplace enough letter i suppose with news that she and my father were well and that she was desolate without her true love and counted the hours till my triumphant return from the cannons mouth and so on god knows what young women think a soldier does for a living but there was a good deal about how she longed to clasp me in her arms and pillow my head on her breast and so on and thinking about that same breast and the spirited gallops we had taken together i began to get feverish closing my eyes i could imagine her soft white body and fetnabs and josettes and what with dreaming to this tune i rapidly reached the point where even lady sale would have had to cut and run for it if she had happened to come within reach however i had my eye on younger game in the excellent shape of mrs parker the merry little wife of a captain in the th light cavalry he was a serious doting fellow about twenty years older than she and as fondly in love as only a middleaged man with a young bride can be betty parker was pretty enough in a plump way but she had buck teeth and if there had been afghan women to hand i would hardly have looked at her with kabul city out of all bounds there was no hope of that so i went quickly to work in that week after christmas i could see she fancied me which was not surprising in a woman married to parker and i took the opportunity at one of lady sales evenings for the old dragon kept open house in those days to show that whoever was dismayed she was full of spirit to play loo with betty and some others and press knees with her beneath the table she didnt seem to mind by half so i tested the ground further later on i waited till i could find her alone and gave her tits a squeeze when she least expected it she jumped and gasped but since she didnt swoon i guessed that all was well and would be better the trouble was parker there was no hope of doing anything while we remained in kabul and he was sure to stick close as a mother hen on the march but chance helped me as she always does if you keep your wits about you although she ran it pretty fine and it was not until a couple of days before we were due to depart that i succeeded in removing the inconvenient husband it was at one of those endless discussions in elphys office where everything under the sun was talked about and nothing done in between deciding that our men must not be allowed to wear rags round their legs against the snow as the afghans did to keep off frostbite and giving instructions what fodder should be carried along for his foxhounds elphy bey suddenly remembered that he must send the latest instructions about our departure to nott at kandahar it would be best he said that general nott should have the fullest intelligence of our movements and mackenzie coming as near to showing impatience as i ever knew him agreed that it was proper that one half of the british force in afghanistan should know what the other half was doing excellent says elphy looking pleased but not for long who shall we send to kandahar with the despatches he wondered worrying again any good galloper will do says mac no no says elphy he must be a man in whom we can repose the most perfect trust an officer of experience is required and he went rambling on about maturity and judgement while mac drummed his fingernails on his belt i saw a chance here ordinarily i never intruded an opinion being junior and not caring a damn anyway but now i asked if i might say a word captain parker is a steady officer says i if it aint out of place for me to say so and hes as sure in the saddle as i am sir didnt know that says mac but if you say hes a horseman he must be let it be parker then says he to elphy elphy hummed a bit he is married you know mackenzie his wife would be deprived of his sustaining presence on our journey to india which i fear may be an arduous one the old fool was always too considerate by half she will be a prey to anxiety for his safety hell be as safe on the road to kandahar as anywhere says mac and hell ride all the harder there and back the fewer loving couples we have on this march the better mac was a bachelor of course one of these iron men who are married to the service and have their honeymoon with a manual of infantry drill and a wet towel round their heads if he thought sending off parker would cut down the number of loving couples he was going to be mistaken i reckoned it would increase it so elphy agreed shaking his head and chuntering and i rounded off the mornings work later by saying to mac when we were outside that i was sorry for naming parker and that id forgotten he was a married man you too says mac has elphy infected you with his disease of worrying over everything that dont matter and forgetting those that do let me tell you flash we shall spend so much time wagging our heads over nonsenses like parker and elphys dogs and lady mcnaghtens chestofdrawers that well be lucky if we ever see jallalabad he stepped closer and looked at me with those uncomfortable cold eyes of his you know how far it is ninety miles have you any notion how long it will take with an army fourteen thousand strong barely a quarter of em fighting troops and the rest a great rabble of hindoo porters and servants to say nothing of women and children and well be marching through a foot of snow on the worst ground on earth with the temperature at freezing why man with an army of highland ghillies i doubt if it could be done in under a week if were lucky we might do it in two if the afghans let us alone and the food and firing hold out and elphy doesnt shoot himself in the other buttock id never seen mackenzie in such a taking before usually he was as cool as a trout but i suppose being a serious professional and having to work with elphy had worn him thin i wouldnt say this to anybody but you or george broadfoot if he were here says he but if we come through itll be by pure luck and the efforts of one or two of us like you and me aye and shelton hes a surly devil but hes a fighting soldier and if elphy will let him alone he might get us to jallalabad there now ive told you what i think and its as near to croaking as i hope ill ever get he gave me one of his wintry smiles and youre worried about parker having heard this i was worried only about me i knew mackenzie he wasnt a croaker and if he thought our chances were slim then slim they were of course i knew from working in elphys office that things werent shaping well the afghans were hampering us at every turn in getting supplies together and there were signs that the ghazis were moving out of kabul along the passes pottinger was sure they were going to lie in wait for us and try to cut us up in the really bad defiles like khoordkabul and jugdulluk but i had reasoned that an army fourteen thousand strong ought to be safe even if a few fell by the wayside mac had put it in a different light and i began to feel again that looseness low down in my guts and the sick sensation in my throat i tried to tell myself that soldiers like shelton and mackenzie yes and sergeant hudson werent going to be stopped by a few swarms of afghans but it was no good burnes and iqbal had been good soldiers too and that hadnt saved them i could still hear the hideous chunk of those knives into burness body and think of mcnaghten swinging dead on a hook and trevor screaming when the ghazis got him i came near to vomiting and half an hour back i had been scheming so that i could tumble mrs parker in a tent on the way back to jallalabad that reminded me of what afghan women do to prisoners and it didnt bear thinking about i was hard put to it to keep a good face on things at lady sales last gathering two nights before we left betty was there and the look she gave me cheered me up a little her lord and master would be half way to kandahar by now and i toyed with the notion of dropping in at her bungalow that night but with so many servants about the cantonment it would be too risky better to wait till were on the road thinks i and nobody knows one tent from another in the dark lady sale spent the evening as usual railing about elphy and the general incompetence of the staff there never was such a set of yeaandnays the only certain thing is that our chiefs have no mind for two minutes on end they seem to think of nothing but contradicting each other when harmony and order are most needed she said it with satisfaction sitting in her last chair while they fed her furniture into the stove to keep the room tolerably warm everything had gone except her chestofdrawers which was to provide fuel to cook her meals before our departure we sat round on the luggage which was piled about the walls or squatted on the floor while the old harpy sat looking down her beaky nose her mittened hands folded in front the strange thing was that no one thought of her as a croaker although she complained unendingly she was so obviously confident that she would get to jallalabad in spite of elphys bungling that it cheered people up captain johnson informs me says she sniffing that there is food and fodder for ten days at the most and that the afghans have no intention of providing us with an escort through the passes better without em says shelton the fewer we see the better ill like it indeed and who then is to guard us from the badmashes and brigands lurking in the hills good god maam cries shelton arent we an army we can protect ourselves i hope you may hope so indeed i am not so sure that some of your native troops will not take the first opportunity to make themselves scarce we shall be quite without friends and food and firewood she then went on to tell us cheerfully that the afghans certainly meant to try to destroy our whole force in her opinion that they meant to get all our women into their possession and that they would leave only one man alive who is to have his legs and hands cut off and is to be placed at the entrance of the khyber pass to deter all feringhees from entering the country again my best wishes to the afghan who gets her growled shelton as we were leaving if hes got any sense hell stick her up in the khyber thatll keep the feringhees out with a vengeance the next day i spent making sure that my picked lancers were all in order that our saddlebags were full and that every man had sufficient rounds and powder for his carbine and then came the last night and the chaos of lastminute preparations in the dark for shelton was determined to be off before first light so that we might pass khoordkabul in the first days march which meant covering fifteen miles possibly there has been a greater shambles in the history of warfare than our withdrawal from kabul probably there has not even now after a lifetime of consideration i am at a loss for words to describe the superhuman stupidity the truly monumental incompetence and the bland blindness to reason of elphy bey and his advisers if you had taken the greatest military geniuses of the ages placed them in command of our army and asked them to ruin it utterly as speedily as possible they could not i mean it seriously have done it as surely and swiftly as he did and he believed he was doing his duty the meanest sweeper in our train would have been a fitter commander shelton was not told that we would march on the morning of the th january until evening on the th he laboured like a madman through the night loading up the huge baggage train assembling the troops within the cantonment in their order of march and issuing orders for the conduct and disposal of the entire force it is a few words on paper as i remember it there was a black night of drifting snow with storm lanterns flickering troops tramping unseen in the dark a constant babble of voices the neighing and whining of the great herd of baggage animals the rumble of wagons messengers dashing to and fro great heaps of luggage piled high outside the houses harassed officers demanding to know where suchandsuch a regiment was stationed and where soandso had gone bugle calls ringing in the night wind feet stamping children crying and on the lighted verandah of his office shelton redfaced and dragging at his collar with his staff scurrying about him while he tried to bring some order out of the inferno and as the sun came up from the seeah sung hills it seemed that he had done it the army of afghanistan was standing ready to march everyone was dead tired of course strung out through the length of the cantonment with everything loaded and all the troops fallen in and armed and shelton shouting his last orders in a voice gone hoarse while elphy bey finished an unhurried breakfast of devilled ham omelette and a little pheasant and while he was making his final toilet with his staff and servants fussing round him and the army waiting in the cold i rode out to the cantonment gate to see what was happening over towards kabul the city was alive with crowds on the rooftops and scattered over the snowy ground from bala hissar to the river they were there to watch the feringhees go but they seemed quiet enough just now the snow was falling gently it was damned cold in the cantonments the bugles shrilled together and forward was the command and with a great creaking and groaning and shuffling and bellowing the march began first out came mackenzie with his jezzailchis the wild hill marksmen who were devoted to him like me he was wearing poshteen cloak and turban with his pistols stuck in his belt and he looked the genuine afridi chief with his long moustache and his ugly rascals behind him then brigadier anquetil with the th the only british infantry regiment in the army very dapper in their shakos and red coats with white crossbelts they looked fit to sweep away all the hordes of afghanistan and my spirits rose at the sight of them they had a few fifes playing yankee doodle of all things and stepped out smartly a squadron of sikh cavalry escorting the guns and sappers and miners came next and then in a little group the english women and families all on camels or ponies the children and older ladies travelling in camel howdahs the younger women riding and of course lady sale was to the fore wearing an enormous turban and riding a tiny afghan pony sidesaddle i was saying to lady mcnaghten that i believe we wives would make the best troopers of all she cries out what do you think mr flashman id take your ladyship into my troop any time says i at which she simpered horribly but the other horses might be jealous i says to myself quietly at which the lancers set up a great laugh there were about thirty white women and children from tiny babies to grandmothers and betty parker gave me a knowing smile and a wave as she trotted past thinks i wait till tonight therell be one snug blanketroll on the jallalabad road anyway then came shelton blown and weary but cursing as loud as ever on his charger and the three indian regiments of foot black faces red coats and white trousers their naked feet churning up the slush and behind them the herd for that was what it was of baggage animals lowing and roaring with their tottering bundles and creaking carts there were hundreds of camels and the stench was furious they and the mules and ponies churned the cantonment road into a sea of liquid chocolate through which the hordes of camp followers and their families waded up to the knee babbling and shouting there were thousands of them men women and children with no order whatever their few belongings carried on their backs and all in great consternation at the thought of the march back to india no proper provision had been made for feeding them on the way or quartering them at night they were apparently just to forage what they could and sleep in the drifts this great brown mob surged by and then came the rearguard of indian infantry and a few cavalry troops the great procession was all strung out across the plain to the river a sprawling humming mass that stumbled slowly through the snow steam rose from it like smoke and then last of all elphy beys entourage came out to canter up the line and take its place with the main body beside shelton but elphy was already beset by doubts and i heard him debating loudly with grant whether it might not be better to delay setting off indeed he actually sent a messenger to stop the vanguard at the river but mackenzie deliberately disobeyed and pushed on elphy wrung his hands and cried he mustnt do it tell mackenzie to stop i say but by that time mac was over the bridge so elphy had to give up and come along with the rest we were no sooner out of the compound than the afghans were in the crowds that had been watching had moved round slowly keeping a safe distance from us but now they rushed into the cantonments yelling and burning looting what was left in the houses and even opening fire on the rearguard there was some rough work at the gates and a few indian troopers were knocked from their saddles and butchered before the rest got clear one effect of this was to cause a panic among the porters and campfollowers many of whom flung away their loads and ran for dear life the snow on either side of the road was soon dotted with bundles and sacks and it has been reckoned that a good quarter of our stores were lost this way before we had even reached the river with the mob hanging on the heels of the column we got across marched past the bala hissar and turned on to the jallalabad road we were travelling at a snails pace but already some of the indian servants were beginning to fall out plumping down and wailing in the snow while the bolder spirits among the afghan spectators came close to jeer and pelt us with stones there was some scuffling and a shot or two but in the main the kabulis just seemed glad to let us go and so far we were glad enough to be going if we had even dreamed what lay ahead we would have turned back as one even if all afghanistan had been pursuing but we did not know on elphys instructions mackenzie and i and our troops kept up a constant patrol along the flanks of the column to discourage the afghans from coming too close and prevent straggling some bodies of afghans were moving along with us but well out on either side of the road and we kept a sharp eye on them one of these groups drawn up on a little knoll took my eye i decided to keep well clear of them until i heard my name called and who should be sitting at their head large as life but akbar khan my first instinct was to turn tail for the column but he rode a little forward from his companions calling to me and presently i edged my pony up to within a short pistol shot of him he was all in his steel backandbreast with his spiked helmet and green turban and smiling all over his face what the devil do you want says i beckoning sergeant hudson up beside me to bid you god speed and a good journey old friend says he quite cheerful also to give you a little advice if its the kind you gave trevor and mcnaghten i dont need it says i as god is my judge says he that was no fault of mine i would have spared him as i would spare all of you and be your friend for this reason flashman huzoor i regret to see you marching off before the escort is ready that i was assembling for your safety weve seen some of your escorts before says i well do very well on our own he rode closer shaking his head you do not understand i and many of us wish you well but if you go off to jallalabad before i have taken proper measures for your protection on the march why then it is no fault of mine if you meet disaster i cannot control the ghazis or the gilzais he seemed serious and quite sincere to this day i cannot be sure whether akbar was a complete knave or a fairly honest man caught up in a stream of circumstances which he could not resist but i wasnt trusting him in a hurry after what had happened what dye want us to do says i sit down in the snow and wait for you to round up an escort while we freeze to death i wheeled my pony round if you have any proposals to make send them to elfistan sahib but i doubt if hell listen to em man alive your damned kabulis have been sniping at our rearguard already hows that for keeping faith i was for riding off but he suddenly spurred up closer yet flashman says he speaking very fast and low dont be a fool unless elfistan sahib lets me help him by providing an escort in exchange for hostages you may none of you reach jallalabad you can be one of those hostages i swear on the grave of my mother you would be safe if elfistan sahib will wait it shall be arranged tell him this and let him send you out again with a reply he was so earnest that i was halfconvinced i imagine now that what he was chiefly interested in was hostages but it is also possible that he genuinely believed that he could not control his tribesmen and that we should be massacred in the passes if that happened afghanistan might well see another british army the following year and it would be shooting as it came at the time however i was more concerned about his interest in me why should you want to preserve my life says i what do you owe me we have been friends says he grinning that sudden grin of his also i admired the compliments you paid me as you rode away from mohammed khans fort the other day they werent meant to flatter you says i the insults of an enemy are a tribute to the brave laughs he think on what i have said flashman and tell elfistan sahib he waved and rode back up the hill and the last i saw of his troop they were following slowly on our flank the tips of their spears winking on the snowy hillside all that afternoon we toiled on and we were long short of khoordkabul when night came freezing down the afghans hung on our flanks and when men aye and women and children dropped by the wayside they were pounced on as soon as the column had passed and murdered the afghans saw that our chiefs were not prepared to fight back so they snapped at our heels making little sorties on the baggage train cutting up the native drivers and scattering into the rocks only when our cavalry approached already the column was falling into utter disorder the main body gave no thought to the thousands of native campfollowers who were bitterly affected by the cold and want of food hundreds fell by the way so that in our wake there was a litter not only of bundles and baggage but of corpses and this was within a twentyminute gallop of kabul i had taken akbars message to elphy when i rejoined the column and it sent him into a great taking he dithered and consulted his staff and eventually they decided to push on it will be for the best bleated elphy but we should maintain our relations with the sirdar in the meantime you shall ride to him tomorrow flashman and convey my warmest good wishes that is the proper way of it the stupid old bastard seemed oblivious of the chaos around him already his force was beginning to wither at the edges when we camped it was a question of the troops simply lying down on the snow in huddled groups for warmth while the unfortunate niggers wailed and whimpered in the dark there were some fires but no field kitchens or tents for the men much of the baggage was already lost the order of march had become confused some regiments had food and others none and everyone was frozen to the bone the only ones fairly well off were the british women and their children the dragon lady sale saw to it that their servants pitched little tents or shelters long after dark her sharp high voice could be heard carping on above the general moan and whimper of the campfollowers my troopers and i were snug enough in the lee of some rocks but i had left them at dusk to help with the ladies tents and in particular to see where betty was installed she seemed quite gay despite the cold and after i had made sure that elphy was down for the night i returned to the little group of wagons where the women were it was now quite dark and starting to snow but i had marked her little tent and found it without difficulty i scratched on the canvas and when she called out who was there i asked her to send away her servant who was in the tent with her for warmth i wanted to talk to her i said keeping my voice down the native woman who served her came snuffling out presently and i helped her into the dark with my boot i was too cockahoop to care whether she gossiped or not she was probably too frightened like the rest of the niggers to worry about anything except her own skin that night i crawled under the low canvas which was only about two feet high and heard betty move in the darkness there was a pile of blankets covering the floor of the tent and i felt her body beneath them what is it mr flashman says she just a friendly call says i sorry i couldnt send in a card she giggled in the dark you are a great tease she whispered and very wrong to come in like this but i suppose the conditions are so unusual and it is kind of you to look after me capital says i and without wasting more time i dived under the blankets and took hold of her she was still halfdressed against the cold but gripping that young body sent the fire running through me and in a moment i was on top of her with my mouth on hers she gave a gasp and then a yelp and before i knew it she was writhing away striking at me and squeaking like a startled mouse how dare you she squealed oh how dare you get away get away from me this instant and lunging in the dark she caught me a great crack on the eye what the devil says i whats the matter oh you brute she hissed for she had the sense to keep her voice down you filthy beastly brute get out of my tent at once at once dyou hear i could make nothing of this and said so what have i done i was only being friendly what are you acting so damned missish for oh base says she you you oh come now says i youre in very high ropes to be sure you werent so proper when i squeezed you the other night squeezed me says she as though i had uttered some unmentionable word aye squeezed like this and i reached over and with a quick fumble in the dark caught one of her breasts to my amazement she didnt seem to mind oh that she says what an evil creature you are you know that is nothing all gentlemen do that in affection but you you monstrous beast presume on my friendship to try to oh oh i could die of shame if i had not heard her i shouldnt have believed it god knows i have learned enough since of the inadequacies of education given to young englishwomen but this was incredible well says i if youre accustomed to gentlemen doing that to you in affection you know some damned queer gentlemen you you foul person says she in indignation it is no more than shaking hands good god says i where on earth were you brought up at this by the sound of it she buried her face in the blankets and began to weep mrs parker says i i beg your pardon i have made a mistake and i am very sorry for it the quicker i got out of this the better or she might start shouting rape round the camp ill say this for her ignorant and full of amazing misconceptions as she was she had appeared angry rather than frightened and had kept her abuse of me down to a whisper she had her own reputation to think about of course i shall go says i and started crawling for the flap but i may tell you i added that in polite society it aint usual for gentlemen to squeeze ladies tits whatever you may have been told and it aint usual either for ladies to let gentlemen do it it gives the gentlemen a wrong impression you know my apologies again good night she gave one last muffled squeak and then i was out in the snow i had never heard anything like it in my life but i didnt know then how astonishingly green young women could be and what odd notions they could get anyway i had been well set down for certain by the looks of it i should have to contain my enthusiasm until we reached india again and that as i huddled down in my blankets beside my troopers with the cold getting keener every minute was no consolation at all looking back on it now i suppose it is funny enough but lying shivering there and thinking of the pains i had been at to get captain parker out of the way i could have twisted mrs bettys pretty neck for her it was a bitter biting night and there was little sleep to be had for if the cold was not bad enough the niggers kept up a great whining and wailing to wake the dead and by morning not a few of the poor devils were dead for they had no more than a few rags of clothing to cover them dawn broke on a scene that was like something from an icy hell everywhere there were brown corpses lying stiff in the drifts and the living crackled as they struggled up in their frozen clothes i saw mackenzie actually crying over the body of a tiny native child he was holding her in his arms and when he saw me he cried out what are we to do these people are all dying and those that dont will be slaughtered by those wolves on the hillside yonder but what can we do what indeed says i let em be theres no help for it he was remarkably concerned it seemed to me over a nigger and he was such a ramrod of a man too if only i could take her with me says he laying the small body back in the snow you couldnt take em all says i come on man lets get some breakfast he saw this was sensible advice and we were lucky enough to get some hot mutton at elphys tent getting the column under way was tremendous work half the sepoys were too frostbitten to be able to lift their muskets and the other half had deserted in the night skulking back to kabul we had to flog them into line which warmed everyone up but the camp followers needed no such urging they were crowding ahead in panic in case they should be left behind and threw anquetils vanguard into tremendous confusion at this point a great cloud of mounted ghazis suddenly came yelling out of a nullah in the hillside and rode into the mob cutting down everything in their way soldiers and civilians and made off with a couple of anquetils guns before he could stop them he made after them though with a handful of cavalry and there was a warm skirmish he couldnt get back the guns but he spiked them while the th stood fast and did nothing lady sale damned them for cowards and hangbacks the old baggage should have been in command instead of elphy but i didnt blame the th myself i was farther down the column and in no hurry to get near the action until anquetil was riding back when i brought my lancers up at the canter the guns were going to be no use to us anyway we blundered along the road for a mile or two with troops of afghans hanging on our flanks and every now and then swooping down at a weak part of the column cutting up a few folk snatching at the stores and riding off again shelton kept roaring for everyone to hold his place and not be drawn in pursuit and i took the opportunity to damn his eyes and demand to know what we were soldiers for if not to fight our enemies when we saw them in front of us steady on old flash says lawrence who was with shelton just then its no use chasing em and getting cut up in the hills theyll be too many for you its too bad i bawled slapping my sabre are we just to wait for em to chew us up as they please then why lawrence i could clear that hillside with twenty frenchmen or old ladies bravo cries lady sale clapping her hands you hear gentlemen there was a knot of the staff round elphys palankeen with shelton in the middle of them and they were none too pleased to hear the old dragon crowing at them shelton bristled up and told me to hold my place and do as i was told at your orders sir says i mighty stiff and elphy joined in no no flashman says he the brigadier is right we must preserve order this in the middle of a column that was a great sprawling mass of troops and people and animals with no direction at all and their baggage scattered mackenzie coming up told me that my party and his jezzailchis must flank the column closely watching the likely places and driving in hard when the afghans appeared what the americans call riding herd you can guess what i thought of this but i agreed heartily with mac especially when it came to picking out the most likely spots for attack so that i could keep well clear of them it was simple enough really for the afghans would only come where we were not and at this time they were less interested in killing soldiers than in cutting up the unarmed niggers and pillaging the baggage animals they made pretty good practice at this during the morning running in and slitting a throat and running off again i did pretty well hallooing to my lancers and thundering along the line of march mostly near the headquarters section only once when i was down by the rearguard did i come face to face with a ghazi the fool must have mistook me for a nigger in my poshteen and turban for he came yelling down on a party of servants close by and cut up an old woman and a couple of brats there was a troop of shahs cavalry not far off so i couldnt hang back the ghazi was on foot so i let out a great roar and charged him hoping he would sheer off at the sight of a mounted soldier he did too and like an ass i tried to ride him down thinking it would be safe enough to have a swipe at him but the brute whipped round and slashed at me with his khyber knife and only by the grace of god did i take the cut on my sabre i drove on past him and wheeled just in time to see one of my lancers charging in to skewer him beautifully still i had a good hack at him for luck and was able to trot up the line presently looking stern and with my point impressively bloody it had been a lesson to me though and i took even greater care to be out of distance whenever they made a sortie out of the hills it was nerveracking work and it was all i could do to maintain a boldlooking front as the morning wore on the brutes were getting braver all the time and apart from their charges there was an uncomfortable amount of sniping taking place at last elphy got fed up and ordered a halt which was the worst thing he could have done shelton swore and stamped and said we must push on it was our only hope to get through khoordkabul before dark but elphy insisted we must stop and try and make some sort of peace with the afghan leaders and so stop the slow bleeding to death of the army at the hands of the harassing tribesmen i was for this and when pottinger spotted a great mass of afghans far up the slope with akbar at their head he had no difficulty in persuading elphy to send out messengers to him by god i was sorry to be on hand when that happened for of course elphys eye lighted on me there was nothing i could do about it of course when he said i must ride to akbar and demand to know why the safeconduct was not being observed i had to listen to his orders as though my guts were not dissolving inside me and say very good sir in a steady voice it was no easy task i can tell you for the thought of riding out to meet those ruffians chilled me to the backbone what was worse pottinger said i should go alone for the afghans might mistake a party for an attacking force i could have kicked pottingers fat backside for him he was so damned full of selfimportance standing there looking like jesus christ with his lovely brown beard and whiskers but i just had to nod as though it was all in the days work there was a fair crowd round for the womenfolk and english families naturally clung as close to elphys presence as they could much to sheltons annoyance and half the officers in the main body had come up to see what was happening i noticed betty parker in a camel howdah looking bewildered and mimmish until she caught my eye when she looked quickly away so i made the best of it as i wheeled my pony i shouted out to gentleman jim skinner if i dont come back jim settle akbar khan for me will you then i clapped in the spurs and went at the slope hellforleather the faster i went the less chance i stood of getting picked off and i had a feeling that the closer i got to akbar khan the safer i should be well it was right enough no one came near me and the ghazi parties on the hill just stared as i swept by as i came up towards where akbar sat his horse before his host for there must have been five or six hundred of them he waved to me which was a cheering sight back again prince of messengers he sings out what news from elfistan sahib i pulled up before him feeling safer now that i was past the ghazi outliers i didnt believe akbar would let me be harmed if he could help it no news says i but he demands to know if this is how you keep faith setting on your men to pillage our goods and murder our people did you not tell him says he jovial as ever he himself broke faith by leaving kabul before the escort was ready for him but here it is and he gestured at the ranks behind him and he may go forward in peace and safety if this was true it was the best news i had heard in months and then glancing past him at the ranks behind i felt as though i had been kicked in the stomach immediately in his rear and glaring at me with his wolf smile was my old enemy gul shah seeing him there was like a dash of cold water in the face here was one afghan who did not want to see flashman at least depart in peace and safety akbar saw my look and laughed then he brought his horse up closer to mine so that we were out of earshot and said have no fear of gul shah he no longer makes mistakes such as the one which was almost so unfortunate for yourself i assure you flashman you need not mind him besides his little snakes are all back in kabul youre wrong says i there are a damned lot of them sitting either side of him akbar threw back his head and laughed again flashing those white teeth i thought the gilzais were friends of yours says he some of them says i not gul shahs it is a pity says akbar for you know that gul is now khan of mogala no oh the old man died as old men will gul has been very close to me as you know and as a reward for faithful service i granted him the lordship and ilderim i asked who is ilderim a friend of the british it is not fashionable flashman greatly though i deplore it and i need friends myself strong friends like gul shah well it didnt matter to me but i was sorry to see gul shah advanced and sorrier still to see him here watching me the way a snake watches a mouse but gul is difficult to please you know akbar went on he and many others would gladly see your army destroyed and it is all i can do to hold them back oh my father is not yet king again in afghanistan my power is limited i can guarantee you safeconduct from the country only on conditions and i fear that my chiefs will make those conditions harsher the longer elfistan sahib resists them as i understand it says i your word is pledged already my word will that heal a cut throat i talk of what is i expect elfistan sahib to do the same i can see him safe to jallalabad if he will deliver up six hostages to me here and promises me that sale will leave jallalabad before your army reaches it he cant promise that i protested sale isnt under his command now hell hold jallalabad till he is given orders from india to leave akbar shrugged these are the terms believe me old friend elfistan sahib must accept them he must and he thumped his fist against my shoulder and for you flashman if you are wise you will be one of the six hostages you will be safer with me than down yonder he grinned and reined back his pony now go with god and come again soon with a wise answer well i knew better than to expect any such thing from elphy bey and sure enough when i carried akbars message to him he croaked and dithered in his best style he must consider he said and in the meantime the army was so exhausted and confused that we should march no farther that day it was only two oclock shelton flew into a great passion at this and stormed at elphy that we must press on one more good march would take us through khoordkabul pass and what was more important out of the snow for beyond the pass the ground dropped away if we spent another night in the freezing cold said shelton the army must die so they argued and wrangled and elphy had his way we stayed where we were thousands of shivering wretches on a snowswept road with nearly half our food already gone no fuel left and some of the troops even reduced to burning their muskets and equipment to try to keep a tiny flicker of warmth in their numb bodies the niggers died in droves that night for the mercury was far below freezing and the troops kept alive only by huddling together in huge groups burrowing in among each other like animals i had my blankets and enough dried meat in my saddlebags not to go hungry the lancers and i slept in a tight ring as the afghans do with our cloaks above hudson had seen to it that each man carried a flask of rum and so we kept out the cold tolerably well in the morning we were covered with snow and when i clambered out and saw the army thinks i this is as far as well go most of them were too frozen to move at first but when the afghans were seen gathering on the slopes in the dawn light the campfollowers flew into a panic and blundered off down the road in a great mob shelton managed to heave the main body of troops up in their wake and so we stumbled on like a great wounded animal with no brain and no heart while the crackle of that hellish sniping started afresh and the first casualties of the day began to totter from the ranks to die in the drifts on either side from other accounts of that frightful march that i have read mostly mackenzies and lawrences and lady sales i can fit a few of my recollections into their chronicle but in the main it is just a terrible bloody nightmare even now more than sixty years after ice and blood and groans and death and despair and the shrieks of dying men and women and the howling of the ghazis and gilzais they rushed and struck and rushed and struck again mostly at the campfollowers until it seemed there was a slashed brown body every yard of the way the only place of safety was in the heart of sheltons main body where the sepoys still kept some sort of order i suggested to elphy when we set off that i and my lancers should ride guard on the womenfolk and he agreed at once it was a wise move on my part for the attacks on the flanks were now so frequent that the work we had been doing yesterday was becoming fatally dangerous mackenzies jezzailchis were cut to ribbons stemming the sorties as we neared khoordkabul the hills rose up on either side and the mouth of that awful pass looked like a gateway into hell its walls were so stupendous that the rocky bottom was in perpetual twilight the dragging tread of the army the bellowing of the beasts the shouts and groans and the boom of shots echoed and rang from its cliffs the afghans were on the ledges and when anquetil saw them he halted the vanguard because it seemed certain death to go on there was more consulting and arguing around elphy until akbar and his people were seen among the rocks near the pass mouth then i was sent off again and it was to tell him that at last elphy had seen reason we would give up six hostages on condition that akbar called off his killers he agreed clapping me on the shoulders and swearing that all should now be well i should come as one of the hostages he said and a merry time we would have of it i was torn two ways about this the farther away i could keep from gul shah the better on the other hand how safe would it be to remain with the army it was settled for me for elphy himself called on mackenzie lawrence and pottinger to give themselves over to akbar they were among the best we had and i suppose he thought akbar would be the more impressed by them anyway if akbar kept his word it did not matter much who remained with the army since it would not have to fight its way to jallalabad lawrence and pottinger agreed at once mac took a little longer he had been a trifle cool with me i suppose because my lancers had not shared the fighting that day and his folk had been so badly mauled but he said nothing and when elphy put it to him he didnt answer but stood staring out over the snow he was in a sad pass with his turban gone and his hair all awry his poshteen spattered with blood and a drying wound on the back of his hand presently he drew his sword and dropped it point first into the ground and walked over without a word to join pottinger and lawrence watching his tall figure moving away i felt a little chill touch me being a ruffian perhaps i know a good man when i see one better than most and mac was one of the mainstays of our force a damned prig mind you and given to immense airs but as good a soldier for what thats worth as ive met akbar wanted shelton as well but shelton wouldnt have it i trust that black bastard as far as id trust a pidog says he anyway whos to look after the army if im gone i shall be in command still says elphy taken aback aye says shelton thats what i mean this started another bickering match of course which ended with shelton turning on his heel and stumping off and elphy whining about discipline and then the order to march sounded again and we turned our faces towards khoordkabul at first it was well enough and we were unmolested it looked as though akbar had his folk under control and then suddenly the jezzails began to crack from the ledges and men began to fall and the army staggered blindly in the snow they were pouring fire into the pass at almost pointblank range and the niggers began to scream and run and the troops broke their ranks with shelton bawling and then in a moment everyone was running or riding full tilt through that hellish defile it was just a great wild rush and the devil take the hindmost i saw a camel with two white women and two children shot and it staggered into the snow and threw them out an officer ran to help and went down with a ball in his belly and then the crowd surged over them all i saw a gilzai mounted warrior seize on a little girl of about six and swing her up screaming to his saddlebow and make off she kept shrieking mummy mummy as he bore her away sepoys were throwing down their muskets and running blindly forward and i saw an officer of the shahs cavalry riding in among them belabouring them with the flat of his sword and yelling his head off baggage was being flung recklessly away the drivers were abandoning their animals no one had any thought but to rush through the pass as fast as possible away from that withering fire i cant say i wasted much time myself i put my head down to my ponys neck dug in my heels and went like billybedamned threading through the pack and praying to god i wasnt hit by a stray ball the afghan ponies are as surefooted as cats and she never stumbled once where my lancers were i had no idea not that i cared it was every man for himself and i wasnt too particular who i rode over in my flight it was nip and tuck like a steeplechase with the shots crashing and echoing and thousands of voices yelling only once did i check for an instant when i saw young lieutenant stuart shot out of his saddle he rolled into a drift and lay there screaming but it would have done no good to stop no good to flashy anyway and that was what mattered how long it took to make the passage i dont know but when the way began to widen and the mass of fugitives ahead and around began to slow down i reined in to take stock the firing had slackened and anquetils vanguard were forming up to cover the flight of those still coming behind presently there was a great mob streaming out of the defile troops and people all mixed together and when they reached the light of day they just collapsed in the snow dead beat three thousand people died in khoordkabul they say most of them niggers and we lost all our remaining baggage when we made camp beyond the eastern limit of the pass we were in the middle of a snowstorm all order was completely lost stragglers kept coming in after dark and i remember one woman who arrived having carried her baby on foot the whole way lady sale had been shot in the arm and i can see her now holding her hand out to the surgeon and shutting her eyes tight while he cut the ball out she never flinched the tough old bitch there was a major struggling with his hysterical wife who wanted to go back for her lost child he was weeping and trying to stop the blows she was aiming wildly at his chest no no jenny he kept saying shes gone pray to jesus to look after her another officer i forget who had gone snowblind and kept walking about in circles until someone led him away then there was a british trooper reeling drunk on an afghan pony and singing a barrackroom song where he had got the liquor god knows but there was plenty of it apparently for presently he fell into the snow and lay there snoring he was still there next morning frozen dead night was hell again with the darkness full of crying and groaning there was only a handful of tents left and the english women and children all crowded into one of them i wandered about all night for it was freezing too bitterly to sleep and anyway i was in a fearful funk i could see now that the whole army was going to be destroyed and myself with it being a hostage with akbar would be no better for i had convinced myself by this that when he had finished butchering the army he would kill his prisoners too there was only one hope that i could see and that was to wait with the army until we were clear of the snow and then strike out by night on my own if the afghans spotted me i would ride for it next day we hardly advanced at all partly because the whole force was so frozen and starved as to be incapable of going far but also because akbar sent a messenger into camp saying that we should halt so that he could have provisions brought up elphy believed him in spite of sheltons protests shelton almost went on his knees to elphy urging that if we could only keep going till we were out of the snow we might come through yet but elphy doubted if we could get even that far our only hope is that the sirdar taking pity on our plight will succour us at this late hour says he you know shelton he is a gentleman he will keep his word shelton just walked away in disgust and rage the supplies never came of course but the following day comes another messenger from akbar suggesting that since we were determined to march on the wives and families of the british officers should be left in his care it was just this suggestion made back in kabul that had provoked such indignation but now every married man leaped at it whatever anyone might say openly however much elphy might talk as though he still expected to march to jallalabad everyone knew that the force as it stood was doomed frostbitten starving cluttered still with campfollowers like brown skeletons who refused to die with its women and children slowing it down with the ghazis and gilzais sniping and harrying death stared the army in the face with akbar at least the women and children would stand a chance so elphy agreed and we watched the little convoy on the last of the camels set off into the snow the married men going along with their wives i remember betty riding bareheaded looking very pretty with the morning sun shining on her hair and lady sale her wounded arm in a sling poking her head out of a camel howdah to rebuke the nigger who was trotting alongside carrying the last of her belongings in a bundle but i didnt share the general satisfaction that they were leaving us i was keeping as well out of harms way as i could by staying next to elphy but even that was not going to be safe for long i still had dried mutton enough left in my saddlebags and sergeant hudson seemed to have a secret store of fodder for his horse and those of the lancers who survived there were about half a dozen left of my original party i think but i didnt count but even clinging to elphys palankeen on the pretext of riding bodyguard i was in no doubt of what must happen eventually in the next two days the column was under constant attack in about ten miles we lost the last of the campfollowers and in one terrible affray which i heard behind us but took good care not to see the last of the sepoy units were fairly wiped out to tell the truth my memories of that period are hazy i was too exhausted and afraid to pay much heed some things though are clear in my mind images like coloured pictures in a magic lantern that i shall never forget once for example elphy had all the officers of the force line up at the rearguard to show a united front as he called it to our pursuers we stood there for a full half hour like so many scarecrows while they jeered at us from a distance and one or two of us were shot down i remember grant the adjutantgeneral clapping his hands over his face and shouting im hit im hit and falling down in the snow and the young officer next to me a boy with yellow sidewhiskers covered with frost saying oh poor old fellow i saw an afghan boy once chuckling to himself as he stabbed and stabbed again at a wounded sepoy the boy was not over ten years old and i remember the glazed look in the eyes of dying horses a pair of brown feet marching in front of me that left bloody footprints on the ice i remember elphys grey face with his jowls wobbling and the rasping sound of sheltons voice and the staring eyes in the dark faces of the few indians that were left soldiers and campfollowers but mostly i remember the fear that cramped my stomach and seemed to turn my legs to jelly as i listened to the crackle of firing before and behind the screams of stricken men and the triumphant screeching of the afghans i know now that when we were five days out from kabul and had reached jugdulluk the army that had been fourteen thousand strong was just over three thousand of whom a bare five hundred were fighting troops the rest apart from a few hostages in the hands of the enemy were dead and it was here that i came to my senses in a barn at jugdulluk where elphy had made his quarters it was as though i came out of a dream to hear him arguing with shelton and some of the staff over a proposal that had come from akbar that elphy and shelton should go to see him under a flag of truce to negotiate what they were to negotiate god knows but shelton was dead against it he stood there his red cheeks fallen in but his moustache still bristling swearing that he would go on for jallalabad if he had to do it alone but elphy was for negotiating he would go and see akbar and shelton must come too he would leave anquetil to command the army aye thought i and somehow my brain was as clear as ice again this is where flashman takes independent action they would never come back from akbar of course he would never let such valuable hostages go if i too let myself fall into akbars hands i would be in imminent danger from his henchman gul shah if i stayed with the army on the other hand i would certainly die with it one obvious course suggested itself i left them wrangling and slipped out in search of sergeant hudson i found him dressing his horse which was so thin and jaded now it looked like a rundown london hack hudson says i you and i are riding out he never blinked yes sir says he where to sir india says i not a word to anyone these are special orders from general elphinstone very good sir says he and i left him knowing that when i came back he would have our beasts ready saddlebags as full as he could manage and everything prepared i went back to elphys barn and there he was preparing to leave to see akbar he was fussing as hard as ever over such important matters as the whereabouts of his fine silver flask which he intended to take as a gift to the sirdar this while the remnants of his army were dying in the snow round jugdulluk flashman says he gathering his cloak round him and pulling his woollen cap over his head i am leaving you for only a little time but in these desperate days it is not wise to count too far ahead i trust i find you well enough in a day or two my boy god bless you and god rot you you old fool i thought you wont find me in a day or two not unless you ride a damned sight faster than i think you can he sniffed some more about his flask and shuffled out helped by his valet shelton wasnt yet ready apparently and the last words i heard elphy say were it is really too bad they should be his epitaph i raged inwardly at the time when i thought of how he had brought me to this now in my maturer years i have modified my view whereas i would have cheerfully shot him then now i would hang draw and quarter him for a bungling useless selfish old swine no fate could be bad enough for him hudson and i waited for night and then we simply saddled up and slipped off into the dark striking due east it was so easy i could have laughed no one challenged us and when about ten minutes out we met a party of gilzais in the dark i gave them good night in pushtu and they left us alone there was no moon but light enough for us to pick our way easily enough through the snowy rocks and after we had ridden a couple of hours i gave the order to halt and we bedded down for the night in the lee of a little cliff we had our blankets and with no one to groan around us i slept the best sleep i had had in a week when i woke it was broad day and sergeant hudson had a little fire going and was brewing coffee it was the first hot drink i had tasted in days he even has a little sugar for it where the devil did you come by this hudson says i for there had been nothing but dried mutton and a few scraps of biscuit on the last few days of the march foraged sir says he cool as you please so i asked no more questions but sipped contentedly as i lay in my blankets hold on though i said as he dropped more sticks on his fire suppose some damned ghazi sees your smoke well have the whole pack of em down on us beg pardon sir says he but this hardwood dont make no smoke worth mentioning and neither it did when i came to look at it a moment later he was begging my pardon again and asking if i intended we should ride on shortly or perhaps rest for that day where we were he pointed out that the ponies were used up what with lack of fodder but that if they were rested and given a good feed next morning we should be out of the snow soon and into country where we might expect to come by grazing i was in two minds about this for the more distance we put between ourselves and akbars ruffians and gul shah especially the better i would like it on the other hand both the beasts and ourselves would be the better of rest and in this broken country it didnt seem likely that we would be spotted except by sheer chance so i agreed and found myself considering this sergeant hudson for the first time for beyond noting that he was a steady man i had given him not much notice before after all why should one notice ones men very much he was about thirty i suppose powerfully built with fair hair that had a habit of falling over one eye when he would brush it away he had one of those square tough faces that you see on working men with grey eyes and a cleft in his chin and he did everything very deft and smartly by his accent i would have said he was from somewhere in the west but he was well spoken enough and although he knew his place was not at all your ordinary trooper halfyokel halfguttersnipe it seemed to me as i watched him tending the fire and presently rubbing down the ponies that i had made a lucky choice in him next morning we were up and off before dawn hudson having given the beasts the last of the fodder which he confessed he had been hoarding in his bags just in case we was going to need one last good days gallop using the sun i set off southeast which meant we had the main road from kabul to india somewhere away to our right it was my intention to follow this line until we came to the river soorkab which we would ford and follow along its southern bank to jallalabad about sixty miles away that should keep us well clear of the road and of any wandering bands of afghans i was not greatly concerned about what tale we would tell when we got there god knew how many folk had become separated from the main army like hudson and myself or how many would eventually turn up at jallalabad i doubted if the main force would ever get there and that would give everyone too much to think about to worry about a few strays like us at need i could say we had become separated in the confusion hudson wasnt likely to blab my remark about being despatched on orders from elphy and god knew when elphy would return to india if he ever did so i was in excellent fettle as we threaded our way through the little snowy passes and well before noon we crossed the soorkab and made capital speed along its southern shore it was rocky enough to be sure but there were occasional places where we could raise a gallop and it seemed to me that at this rate we should soon be out of the snows and on to easier drier going i pressed on hard for this was gilzai country and mogala where gul shah lorded it when he was at home was not far away the thought of that grim stronghold with the crucifixes at the gates cast a shadow over my mind and at that moment sergeant hudson edged his pony up beside mine sir says he i think were being followed what dye mean says i nastily startled who is it dunno says he but i can feel it if you know what i mean sir he looked round us we were on a fairly clear stretch with the river rumbling away to our left and broken hills to our right mebbe this way isnt as lonely as we thought id been long enough in the hills to know that when a seasoned soldier has that instinct he is generally right a less experienced and less nervous officer might have poohpoohed his fears but i knew better at once we turned away from the river and up a narrow gully into the hill country if there were afghans behind us we would let them pass on while we took a long loop into the hills we could still hold our course for jallalabad but midway between the soorkab and the main road it was slower going of course but after an hour or so hudson said he felt we were clear of whoever had been behind us still i kept well away from the river and then another interruption came from far away to our right very faint on the afternoon air came the sound of firing it was ragged but there was enough of it to suggest that a fairsized force was involved by god says hudson its the army sir the same thought struck me it might be that the army or what was left of it would have got this far on the road i guessed that gandamack would be somewhere up ahead of us and as i knew that the soorkab swings south in that area we had no choice but to ride towards the firing if we were not to risk running into our mysterious pursuers on the river so we pushed on and always that damned firing came closer i guessed it couldnt be more than a mile off now and was just about to call to sergeant hudson who had forged ahead when he turned in his saddle and waved to me in great excitement he had come to a place where two great rocks reared up at the mouth of a gully that ran down steeply in the direction of the kabul road between them we had a clear view down from the heights and as i reined in and looked i saw a sight i shall never forget beneath us and about a mile away lay a little cluster of huts with smoke rising from them that i guessed must be gandamack village close by where the road swung north again was a gentle slope strewn with boulders rising to a flat summit about a hundred yards across that whole slope was crawling with afghans their yells came clearly up the gully to us on the summit of the slope was a group of men maybe a company strong at first seeing their blue poshteens i took them for afghans but then i noticed the shakos and sergeant hudsons voice shaking with excitement confirmed me thats the th look at em sir its the th poor devils they were in a ragged square back to back on the hilltop and even as we watched i saw the glitter of bayonets as they levelled their pieces and a thin volley crashed out across the valley the afghans yelled louder than ever and gave back but then they surged in again the khyber knives rising and falling as they tried to hack their way into the square another volley and they gave back yet again and i saw one of the figures on the summit flourishing a sword as though in defiance he looked for all the world like a toy soldier and then i noticed a strange thing he seemed to be wearing a long red white and blue weskit beneath his posh teen i must have said something of this to hudson for he shouted out by god its the colours damn the black bastards give it to em th give em hot hell shut up you fool says i although i neednt have worried for we were too far away to be heard but hudson stopped shouting and contented himself with swearing and whispering encouragement to the doomed men on the hilltop for they were doomed even as we watched the grey and black robed figures came charging up the slope again from all sides another volley cracked out and then the wave had broken over them it boiled and eddied on the hilltop the knives and bayonets flashing and then it rolled slowly back with one great wailing yell of triumph and on the hilltop there were no figures standing up of the man with the colours round his waist there was no sign all that remained was a confusion of vague shapes scattered among the rocks and a haze of powder smoke that presently drifted off into nothing on the frosty air somehow i knew that i had just seen the end of the army of afghanistan of course one would have expected the th to be the last remnant as the only british regiment in the force but even without that i would have known this was what elphy beys fine army of more than fourteen thousand had come to in just a week there might be a few prisoners there would be no other survivors i was wrong as it turned out one man dr brydon cut his way out and brought the news to jallalabad but there was no way of knowing this at the time there is a painting of the scene at gandamack which i saw a few years ago and it is like enough the real thing as i remember it no doubt it is very fine and stirs martial thoughts in the gloryblown asses who look at it my only thought when i saw it was you poor bloody fools and i said so to the disgust of other viewers but i was there you see shivering with horror as i watched unlike the good londoners who let the roughnecks and jailbirds keep their empire for them they are good enough for getting cut up at the gandamacks which fools like elphy and mcnaghten bring em to and no great loss to anybody sergeant hudson was staring down with tears running over his cheeks i believe given a chance he would have gone charging down to join them all he would say was bastards black bastards until i gave him the right about pretty sharp and we hurried away on our path letting the rocks shut off the hellish sight behind us i was shaken by what we had seen and to get as far away from gandamack as we could was the thought that drove me on that day at a dangerous pace we clattered along the rocky paths and our ponies scrambled down the scree in such breakneck style that i go cold to look back on it only darkness stopped us and we were well on our way next morning before i would rein in by this time we had left the snowline far behind us and feeling the sun again raised my spirits once more it was as certain as anything could be that we were the only survivors of the army of afghanistan still moving eastward in good order this was a satisfactory thought why shouldnt i be frank about it now that the army was finished there was little chance of meeting hostile tribesmen farther east than the point where it had died so we were safe and to come safe out of a disaster is more gratifying than to come safe out of none at all of course it was a pity about the others but wouldnt they have felt the same gratification in my place there is great pleasure in catastrophe that doesnt touch you and anyone who says there isnt is a liar havent you seen it in the face of a bearer of bad news and heard it in the unctuous phrases at the church gate after a funeral so i reflected and felt mighty cheery and perhaps this made me careless at any rate moralists will say i was well served for my thoughts as our ponies trotted onwards for what interrupted them was the sudden discovery that i was looking along the barrel of a jezzail into the face of one of the biggest ugliest afridi badmashes i have ever seen he seemed to grow out of the rocks like a genie and a dozen other ruffians with him springing out to seize our bridles and swordarms before we could say galloping jesus khabadar sahib says the big jezzailchi grinning all over his villainous face as though i needed telling to be careful get down he added and his mates hauled me from the saddle and held me fast whats this says i trying to brave it out we are friends on our way to jallalabad what do you want with us the british are everyones friends grins he and they are all going to jallalabad or were and his crew cackled with laughter you will come with us and he nodded to my captors who had a thong round my wrists and tied to my own stirrup in a trice there was no chance of putting up a fight even if all the heart had not gone out of me for a moment i had hoped they were just broken men of the hills who might have robbed us and let us go but they were intent on holding us prisoner for ransom that was the best i could hope for i played a desperate card i am flashman huzoor cries i the friend of akbar khan sirdar hell have the heart and guts of anyone who harms bloody lance allah protect us says the jezzailchi who was a humorist in his way like all his lousy kind guard him close raisul or hell stick you on his little spear as he did to the gilzais at mogala he hopped into my saddle and grinned down at me you can fight bloody lance can you walk also and he set the pony off at a brisk trot making me run alongside and shouting obscene encouragement they had served hudson the same way and we had no choice but to stumble along jeered at by our ragged conquerors it was too much to have come so far to have endured so much to have escaped so often to be so close to safety and now this i wept and swore called my captor every filthy name i could lay tongue to in pushtu urdu english and persian pleaded with him to let us go in return for a promise of great payment threatened him with the vengeance of akbar khan beseeched him to take us to the sirdar struggled like a furious child to break my bonds and he only roared so hard with laughter that he almost fell from the saddle say it again he cried how many lakhs of rupees yallah i shall be made for life what was that noseless bastard offspring of a leprous ape and a gutterdescended sow what a description note it raisul my brother for i have no head for education and i wish to remember continue flashman huzoor share the riches of your spirit with me so he mocked me but he hardly slackened pace and soon i could neither swear nor plead nor do anything but stumble blindly on my wrists were burning with pain and there was a leaden fear in my stomach i had no idea where we were going and even after darkness fell the brutes still kept going until hudson and i dropped from sheer fatigue then we rested a few hours but at dawn they had us up again and we staggered on through the hot hellish day resting only when we were too exhausted to continue and then being forced up and dragged onwards at the stirrups it was just before dusk when we halted for the last time at one of those rock forts that are dotted on half the hillsides of afghanistan i had a vision of a gateway with a rickety old gate swung back on rusty hinges and beyond it an earth courtyard they did not take us so far but cut the thongs that held us and shoved us through a narrow door in the gatehouse wall there were steps leading down and a most fearsome stink coming up but they pushed us headlong down and we stumbled on to a floor of mixed straw and filth and god knows what other debris the door slammed shut and there we were too worn out to move i suppose we lay there for hours groaning with pain and exhaustion before they came back bringing us a bowl of food and a chatti of water we were famished and fell on it like pigs while the big jezzailchi watched us and made funny remarks i ignored him and presently he left us there was just light enough from a high grating in one wall for us to make out our surroundings so we took stock of the cellar or dungeon whichever it was i have been in a great variety of jails in my life from mexico to australia america russia and dear old england and i never saw a good one yet that little afghan hole was not too bad all round but it seemed dreadful at the time there were bare walls pretty high and a roof lost in shadow and in the middle of the filthy floor two very broad flat stones like a platform that i didnt like the look of for above them swinging down from the ceiling was a tangle of rusty chains and at the sight of them a chill stabbed through me and i thought of hooded black figures and the inquisition and torture chambers that i had gloated over in forbidden books at school its very different when you are actually in one i told hudson what i thought of them and he just grunted and spat and then begged my pardon i told him not to be such a damned fool that we were in a frightful fix and he could stop behaving as though we were on horse guards ive never been one to stand on ceremony anywhere and here it was just ridiculous but it took hudson time to get used to talking to an officer and at first he just listened to me nodding and saying yes sir and very good sir until i swore with exasperation for i was in a funk of course and poured out my fears to him i didnt know why they were holding us although ransom seemed most likely there was a chance akbar might get to hear of our plight which was what i hoped but at the back of my mind was the awful thought that gul shah might hear of us just as easily hudson of course didnt understand why i should be so horrified at this until i told him the whole story about narreeman and how akbar had rescued me from guls snakes in kabul heavens how i must have talked but when i tell you that we were in the cellar a week together without ever so much as seeing beyond the door and myself in a sweat of anxiety about what our fate might be you will understand that i needed an audience your real coward always does and the worse his fear the more he blabs i babbled something sickening in that dungeon to hudson of course i didnt tell him the story as ive told it here the bloody lance incident for example i related in a creditable light but i convinced him at least that we had every reason to fear if gul shah got wind that we were in afghan hands it was difficult to tell how he took it mostly he just listened staring at the wall but from time to time he would look at me very steady as though he was weighing me up at first i hardly noticed this any more than one does notice a common trooper looking at one but after a while it made me feel uncomfortable and i told him pretty sharp to leave off if he was scared at the fix we were in he didnt show it and i admit there were one or two occasions when i felt a sneaking regard for him he didnt complain and he was very civil in his speech and would ask me very respectfully to translate what the afridi guards said when they brought us our food for he had no pushtu or hindustani this was little enough and we had no way of telling how true it was the big jezzailchi was the most talkative but mostly he would only recall how badly the british had been cut up on the march from kabul so that not a single man had been left alive and how there would soon be no feringhees left in afghanistan at all akbar khan was advancing on jallalabad he said and would put the whole garrison to the sword and then they would sweep down through the khyber and drive us out of india in a great jehad that would establish the true faith from peshawar to the sea and so on all bloody wind and water as i told hudson but he considered it very thoughtfully and said he didnt know how long sale could hold out in jallalabad if they laid proper siege to it i stared at this an ordinary trooper passing opinion on a generals business what do you know about it says i not much sir says he but with respect to general elphinstone im powerful glad its general sale thats laying in jallalabad and not him is that so and be damned to you says i and whats your opinion of general elphinstone if you please id rather not say sir says he and then he looked at me with those grey eyes he wasnt with the th at gandamack was he sir nor a lot of the officers wasnt where were they sir how should i know and what concern is that of yours he sat looking down for a moment none at all sir says he at last beg pardon for asking i should damned well think so says i anyway whatever you think of elphy bey you can rely on general sale to give akbar the right about turn if he shows his nose at jallalabad and i wish to god we were there too and away from this hellish hole and these stinking afridis whether its ransom or not they dont mean us any good i can tell you i didnt think much of hudsons questions about gandamack and elphy at the time if i had done i would have been as much amused as angry for it was like a foreign language to me then but i understand it now although half our modern generals dont they think their men are a different species still fortunately a lot of em are but not in the way the generals think well another week went by in that infernal cell and both hudson and i were pretty foul by now and well bearded for they gave us nothing to wash or shave with my anxieties diminished a little as they will when nothing happens but it was damned boring with nothing to do but talk to hudson for we had little in common except horses he didnt even seem interested in women we talked occasionally of escape but there was little chance of that for there was no way out except through the door which stood at the top of a narrow flight of steps and when the afridis brought our food one of them always stood at the head of them covering us with a huge blunderbuss i wasnt in any great hurry to risk a peppering from it and when hudson talked of trying a rush i ordered him to drop it where would we have got to afterwards anyway we didnt even know where we were except that it couldnt be far to the kabul road but it wasnt worth the risk i said if i had known what was in store for us id have chanced that blunderbuss and a hundred like it but i didnt god ill never forget it never it was late one afternoon and we were lying on the straw dozing when we heard the clatter of hooves at the gate outside and a jumble of voices approaching the door of the cell hudson jumped up and i came up on my elbow my heart in my mouth wondering who it might be it might be a messenger bringing news of ransom for i believed the afridis must be trying that game and then the bolts scraped back and the door burst open and a tall man strode in to the head of the steps i couldnt see his face at first but then an afridi bustled past him with a flaring torch which he stuck in a crevice in the wall and its light fell on the newcomers face if it had been the devil in person id have been better pleased for it was a face i had seen in nightmares and i couldnt believe it was true the face of gul shah his eye lit on me and he shouted with joy and clapped his hands i believe i cried out in horror and scrambled back against the wall flashman he cried and came half down the steps like a big cat glaring at me with a hellish grin now god is very good when i heard the news i could not believe it but it is true and it was just by chance aye by the merest chance that word reached me you were taken he sucked in his breath never taking his glittering eyes from me i couldnt speak the man struck me dumb with cold terror then he laughed again and the hairs rose on my neck at the sound of it and here there is no akbar khan to be importunate says he he signed to the afridis and pointed at hudson take that one away above and watch him and as two of them rushed down on hudson and dragged him struggling up the steps gul shah came down into the room and with his whip struck the hanging shackles a blow that set them rattling set him and he points at me here we have much to talk about i cried out as they flung themselves on me and struggled helplessly but they got my arms over my head and set a shackle on each wrist so that i was strung up like a rabbit on a poulterers stall then gul dismissed them and came to stand in front of me tapping his boot with his whip and gloating over me the wolf comes once to the trap says he at last but you have come twice i swear by god you will not wriggle out of it this time you cheated me once in kabul by a miracle and killed my dwarf by foul play not again flashman and i am glad aye glad it fell out so for here i have time to deal with you at my leisure you filthy dog and with a snarl he struck me backhanded across the face the blow loosened my tongue for i cried out dont for gods sake what have i done didnt i pay for it with your bloody snakes pay sneers he you havent begun to pay do you want to know how you will pay flashman i didnt so i didnt answer and he turned and shouted something towards the door it opened and someone came in standing in the shadows it was my great regret last time that i must be so hurried in disposing of you says gul shah i think i told you then did i not that i would have wished the woman you defiled to share in your departure by great good fortune i was at mogala when the word of your capture came so i have been able to repair the omission come says he to the figure at the top of the steps and the woman narreeman advanced slowly into the light i knew it was she although she was cloaked from head to foot and had the lower half of her face shrouded in a flimsy veil i remembered the eyes like a snakes that had glared up at me the night i took her in mogala they were staring at me again and i found them more terrifying than all guls threats she didnt make a sound but glided down the steps to his side you do not greet the lady says gul you will you will but of course she is a mere slut of a dancing girl although she is the wife of a prince of the gilzai he spat the words into my face wife i croaked i never knew believe me sir i never knew if i it was not so then says gul it is so now aye though she has been fouled by a beast like you she is my wife and my woman none the less it only remains to wipe out the dishonour oh christ please listen to me says i i swear i meant no harm how was i to know she was precious to you i didnt mean to harm her i swear i didnt ill do anything anything you wish pay anything you like gul leered at me nodding while the womans basilisk eyes stared at me you will pay indeed no doubt you have heard that our afghan women are delicately skilled in collecting payment i see from your face that you have narreeman is very eager to test that skill she has vivid recollections of a night at mogala vivid recollections of your pridehe leaned forward till his face was almost touching mine lest she forget it she wishes to take certain things from you very slowly and cunningly for a remembrance is it not just you had your pleasure from her pain she will have hers from yours it will take much longer and be infinitely more artistic a womans touch he laughed that will be for a beginning i didnt believe it it was impossible outrageous horrible it was enough to strike me mad just listening to it you cant i shrieked no no no you cant please please dont let her touch me it was a mistake i didnt know i didnt mean to hurt her i yelled and pleaded with him and he crowed with delight and mocked me while she never moved a muscle but still stared into my face this will be better than i had hoped says he afterwards we may have you flayed or perhaps roasted over hot embers or we may take out your eyes and remove your fingers and toes and set you to some slavework in mogala yes that will be best for you can pray daily for death and never find it is the price too high for your nights pleasure flashman i was trying to close my ears to this horror trying not to believe it and babbling to him to spare me he listened grinning and then turned to the woman and said but business before pleasure my dove we will let him think of the joyous reunion that you two will have let him wait for how long he must wonder about that i think in the meantime there is a more urgent matter he turned back to me it will not abate your suffering in the slightest if you tell me what i wish to know but i think you will tell me anyway since your pathetic and cowardly army was slaughtered in the passes the sirdars army has advanced towards jallalabad but we have no word of nott and his troops at kandahar it is suggested that they have orders to march on kabul on jallalabad we require to know well it took a moment for me to clear my mind of the hellish pictures he had put there and understand his question i dont know i said i swear to god i dont know liar said gul shah you were an aide to elfistan you must know i dont i swear i dont i shouted i cant tell you what i dont know can i i am sure you can says he and motioning narreeman aside he flung off his poshteen and stood in his shirt and pyjamy trousers skullcap on head and whip in hand he reached out and wrenched my shirt from my back i screamed as he swung the whip and leaped as it struck me god i never knew such pain it was like a fiery razor he laughed and swung again and again it was unbearable searing bars of burning agony across my shoulders my head swam and i shrieked and tried to hurl myself away but the chains held me and the whip seemed to be striking into my very vitals stop i remember shrieking and over and over again stop he stepped back grinning but all i could do was mouth and mumble at him that i knew nothing he lifted the whip again i couldnt face it no i screamed not me hudson knows the sergeant who was with me im sure he knows he told me he knew it was all i could think of to stop that hellish lashing the havildar knows but not the officer says gul no flashman not even in the british army i think you are lying and the fiend set about me again until i must have fainted from the pain for when i came to my senses with my back raging like a furnace he was picking his robe from the floor you have convinced me says he sneering such a coward as i know you to be would have told me all he knew at the first stroke you are not brave flashman but you will be even less brave soon he signed to narreeman and she followed him up the steps at the door he paused to mock me again think on what i have promised you says he i hope you will not go mad too soon after we begin the door slammed shut and i was left sagging in my chains sobbing and retching but the pain on my back was as nothing to the terror in my mind it wasnt possible i kept saying they cant do it but i knew they would for some awful reason which i cannot define even now a recollection came to me of how i had tortured others oh puny feeble little tortures like roasting fags at school i babbled aloud how sorry i was for tormenting them and prayed that i might be spared and remembered how old arnold had once said in a sermon call on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved god how i called i roared like a bull calf and got nothing back not even echoes i would do it again too in the same position for all that i dont believe in god and never have but i blubbered like an infant calling on christ to save me swearing to reform and crying gentle jesus meek and mild over and over again its a great thing prayer nobody answers but at least it stops you from thinking suddenly i was aware of people moving into the cell and shrieked in fear closing my eyes but no one touched me and when i opened them there was hudson again chained up beside me with his arms in the air staring at me in horror my god sir says he what have the devils done to you theyre torturing me to death i roared oh dear saviour and i must have babbled on for when i stopped he was praying too the lords prayer i think very quietly to himself we were the holiest jail in afghanistan that night there was no question of sleep even if my mind had not been full of the horrors ahead i could not have rested with my arms fettered wide above my head every time i sagged the rusty manacles tore cruelly at my wrists and i would have to right myself with my legs aching from standing my back was smarting and i moaned a good deal hudson did his best to cheer me up with the kind of drivel about not being done yet and keeping ones head up which is supposed to raise the spirits in time of trouble it has never done a damned thing for mine all i could think of was that womans hating eyes coming closer and gul smiling savagely behind her and the knife pricking my skin and then slicing oh jesus i couldnt bear it i would go raving mad i said so at the top of my voice and hudson says come on sir we aint dead yet you bloody idiot i yelled at him what do you know you clod they arent going to cut your bloody pecker off i tell you ill have to die first i must they havent done it yet sir says he nor they wont while i was up yonder i see that half them afridis have gone off to join up wi the others at jallalabad i reckon an there aint above half a dozen left besides your friend and the woman if i can just i didnt heed him i was too done up to think of anything except what they would do to me when the night wore away and except for one visit at noon next day when the jezzailchi came to give us some water and food no one came near us before evening they left us in our chains hanging like stuck pigs and my legs seemed to be on fire one minute and numb the next i heard hudson muttering to himself from time to time as though he was working at something but i never minded then just when the light was beginning to fade i heard him gasp with pain and exclaim done it by god i turned to look and my heart bounded like a stag he was standing with only his left arm still up in the shackle the right one bloody to the elbow was hanging at his side he shook his head fiercely and i was silent he worked his right hand and arm for a moment and then reached up to the other shackle the wristpieces were kept apart by a bar but the fastening of the manacles was just a simple bolt he worked at it for a moment and it fell open he was free he came over to me an ear cocked towards the door if i let you loose sir can you stand i didnt know if i could but i nodded and two minutes later i was crouched on the floor groaning with the pain in my shoulders and legs that had been cramped in one position so long he massaged my joints and swore softly over the weals that gul shahs whip had left filthy nigger bastard says he lookee sir weve got to look sharp they dont take us unawares when they come in weve got to be standing up with the chains on our wrists pretendin were still trussed up like what then says i why sir theyll think were helpless wont they we can take em by surprise much good thatll do says i you say theres half a dozen apart from gul shah they wont all come says he for gods sake sir its our only hope i didnt think it was much of one and said so hudson said well it was better than being sliced up by that afghan tart wasnt it begging my pardon sir and i couldnt disagree but i guessed we would only get slaughtered for our pains at best well says he we can make a bloody good fight of it we can die like englishmen stead of like dogs what difference does it make whether you die like an englishman or like a bloody eskimo says i and he just stared at me and then went on chafing my arms pretty soon i could stand and move as well as ever but we took care to stay close by the chains and it was as well we did suddenly there was a shuffling at the door and we barely had time to take our positions hands up on the shackles when it was thrown back leave it to me sir whispered hudson and then drooped in his fetters i did the same letting my head hang but watching the door out of the corner of my eye there were three of them and my heart sank first came gul shah with the big jezzailchi carrying a torch and behind was the smaller figure of narreeman all my terrors came rushing back as they descended the steps it is time flashman says gul shah sticking his sneering face up to mine wake up you dog and prepare for your last love play and he laughed and struck me across the face i staggered but held right to the chains hudson never moved a muscle now my precious says gul to narreeman he is here and he is yours she came forward to his side and the big jezzailchi having placed the torch came on her other side grinning like a satyr he stood about a yard in front of hudson but his eyes were fixed on me the woman narreeman had no veil now she was turbanned and cloaked and her face was like stone then she smiled and it was like a tigress showing its teeth she hissed something to gul shah and held out her hand towards the dagger at his belt fear had me gripped or i would have let go the chains and rushed blindly past them gul put his hand on his hilt and slowly for my benefit began to slide the blade from its sheath hudson struck his right hand shot down to the big jezzailchis waist band there was a gleam of steel a gasp and then a hideous shriek as hudson drove the mans own dagger to the hilt in his belly as the fellow dropped hudson tried to spring at gul shah but he struck against narreeman and they both went sprawling gul leaped back snatching at his sabre and i let go my chains and threw myself out of harms way gul swore and aimed a cut at me but he was wild and hit the swinging chains in that moment hudson had scrambled to the dying jezzailchi grabbed the sabre from his waist and was bounding up the steps to the door for a moment i thought he was deserting me but when he reached the doorway it was to slam the door to and shoot the inside bolt then he turned sabre in hand and gul who had sprung to pursue him halted at the foot of the steps for a moment the four of us were stock still and then gul bawls out mahmud shadman idderao juldi watch the woman sings out hudson and i saw narreeman in the act of snatching up the bloody dagger he had dropped she was still on hands and knees and with one step i caught her a flying kick in the middle that flung her breathless against the wall out of the tail of my eye i saw hudson spring down the steps sabre whirling and then i had thrown myself at narreeman catching her a blow on the head as she tried to rise and grabbing her wrists as the steel clashed behind me and the door reechoed to pounding from outside i dragged her arms behind her back and held them twisting for all i was worth you bitch i roared at her and wrenched so that she screamed and went down pinned beneath me i held her so got my knee on the small of her back and looked round for hudson he and gul were going at it like trojans in the middle of the cell thank god they teach good swordsmanship in the cavalry even to lancers for gul was as active as a panther his point and edge whirling everywhere while he shouted oaths and threats and bawled to his rascals to break in the door was too stout for them though hudson fought coolly as if he was in the gymnasium guarding every thrust and sweep then shuffling in and lunging so that gul had to leap back to save his skin i stayed where i was for i darent leave that hellcat for a second and if i had gul might have had an instant to take a swipe at me suddenly he rushed hudson slashing right and left and the lancer broke ground that was what gul wanted and he sprang for the steps intent on getting to the door hudson was right on his heels though and gul had to swing round halfway up the steps to avoid being run through from behind he swerved outside hudsons thrust slipped on the steps and for a moment they were locked halflying on the stairway gul was up like a rubber ball swinging up his sabre for a cut at hudson who was caught all asprawl the sabre flashed down ringing on the stone and striking sparks and the force of the blow made gul overbalance for a moment he was crouched over hudson and before he could recover i saw a glittering point rise out of the centre of his back he gave a choked awful cry straightened up his head hanging back and crashed down the steps to the cell floor he lay there writhing mouth gaping and eyes glaring then he was still hudson scrambled down the steps his sabre red to the forte i let out a yell of triumph bravo hudson bravo shabash he took one look at gul dropped his sabre and to my amazement began to pull the dead man out of the middle of the floor to the shadowy side of the cellar he laid him flat on his back then hurried over to me make her fast sir says he and while i trussed narreemans arms with the jezzailchis belt hudson stuffed a gag into her mouth we dropped her on the straw and hudson says only once chance sir take the sabre the clean one and stand guard over that dead bugger put your point to his throat an when i open the door tell em youll slaughter their chief unless they do as we say they wont see hes a corpse in this light an the bints silenced now sir quick there could be no argument the door was creaking under the afridis hammering i ran to guls side snatching up his sabre on the way and stood astride him the point on his breast hudson took one look round leaped up the steps whipped back the bolt and regained the cell floor in a bound the door swung open and in surged the lads of the village halt roars i another move and ill send gul shah to make his peace with shaitan back you sons of owls and pigs they bore up sharp five or six of them hairy brutes at the head of the steps when they saw gul apparently helpless beneath me one lets out an oath and another a wail not another inch i shouted or ill have his life they stayed where they were gaping but for the life of me i didnt know what to do next hudson spoke up urgently horses sir were right by the gate tell em to bring two no three ponies to the door and then all get back to the other side o the yard i bawled the order at them sweating in case they didnt do it but they did i suppose i looked desperate enough for anything stripped to the waist matted and bearded and glaring like a lunatic it was fear not rage but they werent to know that there was a great jabbering among them and then they scrambled back through the doorway i heard them yelling and swearing out in the dark and then a sound that was like music the clatter of ponies hooves tell em to keep outside sir an well away says hudson and i roared it out with a will hudson ran to narreeman swung her up into his arms with an effort and set her feet on the steps walk damn you says he and grabbing up his own sabre he pushed her up the steps the point at her back he disappeared through the doorway there was a pause and then he shouts right sir come out quick like an bolt the door i never obeyed an order more gladly i left gul shah staring up sightlessly and raced up the steps pulling the door to behind me it was only as i looked round the courtyard at hudson astride one pony with narreeman bound and writhing across the other at the little group of afghans across the yard fingering their knives and muttering only then did i realise that we had left our hostage but hudson was there as usual tell em ill spill the bints guts all over the yard if they stir a finger ask em how their masterll like that an what hell do to em afterwards and he dropped his point over narreemans body it held them even without my repetition of the threat and i was able to scramble aboard the third pony the gate was before us hudson grabbed the bridle of narreemans mount we drove in our heels and in a clatter of hooves we were out and away under a glittering moon down the path that wound from the forts little hill to the open plain when we reached the level i glanced back hudson was not far behind although he was having difficulty with narreeman for he had to hold her across the saddle of the third beast behind the ugly shape of the fort was outlined against the sky but there was no sign of pursuit when he came up with me he said i reckon down yonder well strike the kabul road sir we crossed it on the way in think we can chance it sir i was so trembling with reaction and excitement that i didnt care of course we should have stayed off the road but i was for anything that would get that damned cellar far behind us so i nodded and we rode on with luck there would be no one moving on the road at night and anyway only on the road could we hope to get our bearings we reached it before very long and the stars showed us the eastern way we were a good three miles from the fort now and it seemed if the afridis had come out in pursuit that they had lost us hudson asked me what we should do with narreeman at this i came to my senses again as i thought back to what she had been preparing to do my gorge rose and all i wanted to do was tear her apart give her to me says i dropping my reins and taking a grip on the sabre hilt he had one hand on her sliding her out of the saddle she slipped down on to the ground and wriggled up on her knees her hands tied behind her the gag across her mouth she was glaring like a mad thing as i moved my pony round hudson suddenly reined into my way hold on sir says he what are you about im going to cut that bitch to pieces says i out of my way here now sir says he you cant do that cant i by god not while im here sir says he very quiet i didnt credit my ears at first it wont do sir says he shes a woman youre not yourself sir what wi the floggin they gave you an all well let her be sir cut her hands free an let her go i started to rage at him for a mutinous dog but he just sat there not to be moved shaking his head so in the end i gave in it occurred to me that what he could do to gul shah he might easily do to me and he jumped down and loosed her hands she flew at him but he tripped her up and remounted sorry miss says he but you dont deserve better you know she lay there gasping and staring hate at us a proper handsome hellcat it was a pity there wasnt time and leisure or id have served her as i had once before for i was feeling more my old self again but to linger would have been madness so i contented myself with a few slashes at her with my long bridle and had the satisfaction of catching her a ringing cut over the backside that sent her scurrying for the rocks then we turned east and drove on down the road towards india it was bitter cold and i was halfnaked but there was a poshteen over the saddle and i wrapped up in it hudson had another and covered his tunic and breeches with it between us we looked a proper pair of bashibazouks but for hudsons fair hair and beard we camped before dawn in a little gully but not for long for when the sun came up i recognised that we were in the country just west of futtehabad which is a bare twenty miles from jallalabad itself i wouldnt feel safe till we had its walls around us so we pushed on hard only leaving the road when we saw dustclouds ahead of us that indicated other travellers we took to the hills for the rest of the day skirting futtehabad and lay up by night for we were both all in in the morning we pressed on but kept away from the road for when we took a peep down at it there were afghans thick on it all travelling east there was more movement in the hills now but no one minded a pair of riders for hudson shrouded his head in a rag to cover his blond hair and i always looked like a khyberi badmash anyway but as we drew nearer to jallalabad i got more and more anxious for by what we had seen on the road and the camps we saw dotted about in the gullies i knew we must be moving along with an army this was akbars host pushing on to jallalabad and presently in the distance we heard the rattle of musketry and knew that the siege must be already under way well this was a pretty fix only in jallalabad was there safety but there was an afghan army between us and it with what we had been through i was desperate for a moment i thought of bypassing jallalabad and making for india but that meant going through the khyber and with hudson looking as much like an afghan as a berkshire hog we could never have made it i cursed myself for having picked a companion with fair hair and somerset complexion but how could i have foreseen this there was nothing for it but to push on and see what the chances were of getting into jallalabad and of avoiding detection on the way it was a damned risky go for soon we came into proper encampments with afghans as thick as fleas everywhere and hudson nearly suffocating inside the turban rag which hooded his whole head once we were hailed by a party of pathans and i answered with my heart in my mouth they seemed interested in us and in my panic all i could think to do was start singing that old pathan song that goes theres a girl across the river with a bottom like a peach and alas i cannot swim they laughed and let us alone but i thanked god they werent nearer than twenty yards or they might have realised that i wasnt as afghan as i looked at a distance it couldnt have lasted long i was sure that in another minute someone would have seen through our disguise but then the ground fell away before us and we were sitting our ponies at the top of a slope running down to the level and on the far side of it maybe two miles away was jallalabad with the kabul river at its back it was a scene to remember on the long ridge on either side of us there were afghans lining the rocks and singing out to each other or squatting round their fires down in the plain there were thousands of them grouped any old way except near jallalabad where they formed a great halfmoon line facing the city there were troops of cavalry milling about and i saw guns and wagons among the besiegers from the front of the halfmoon you could see little prickles of fire and hear the poppop of musketry and farther forward almost up to the defences there were scores of little sangars dotted about with whiterobed figures lying behind them it was a real siege no question and as i looked at that tremendous host between us and safety my heart sank we could never get through it mind you the siege didnt seem to be troubling jallalabadbad unduly even as we watched the popping increased and we saw a swarm of figures running hellforleather back from before the earthworks jallalabad isnt a big place and had no proper walls but the sappers had got some goodlooking ramparts out before the town at this the afghans on the heights on either side of us set up a great jeering yell as though to say they could have done better than their retreating fellows from the scatter of figures lying in front of the earthworks it looked as though the besiegers had been taking a pounding much good that was to us but then hudson sidled his pony up to mine and says theres our way in sir i followed his glance and saw below and to our right about a mile from the foot of the slope and maybe as far from the city a little fort on an eminence with the union jack fluttering over its gate and flashes of musketry from its walls some of the afghans were paying attention to it but not many it was cut off from the main fortifications by afghan outposts on the plain but they obviously werent caring much about it just now we watched as a little cloud of afghan horsemen swooped down towards it and then sheered off again from the firing on its walls if we ride down slow sir says hudson to where them niggers are lying round sniping we could make a dash for it and get shot from our saddles for our pains thinks i no thank ee but i had barely had the thought when someone hails us from the rocks on our left and without a word we put our ponies down the slope he bawled after us but we kept going and then we hit the level and were riding forward through the afghans who were lying spread out among the rocks watching the little fort the horsemen who had been attacking were wheeling about to our left yelling and cursing and one or two of the snipers shouted to us as we passed them by but we kept on and then there was just the last line of snipers and beyond it the little fort threequarters of a mile off on top of its little hill with its flag flying now sir snaps hudson and we dug in our heels and went like fury flying past the last sangars the afghans there yelled out in surprise wondering what the devil we were at and we just put our heads down and made for the fort gate i heard more shouting behind us and thundering hooves and then shots were whistling above us from the fort dammit oh jesus thinks i theyll shoot us for afghans and we cant stop now with the horsemen behind us hudson flung off his poshteen and yelled rising in his stirrups at the sight of the blue lancer tunic and breeches there was a tremendous yelling behind but the firing from the fort stopped and now it was just a race between us and the afghans our ponies were about used up but we put them to the hill at top speed and as the walls drew near i saw the gate open i whooped and rode for it with hudson at my heels and then we were through and i was slipping off the saddle into the arms of a man with enormous ginger whiskers and a sergeants stripes on his arm damme he roars who the hell are ye lieutenant flashman says i of general elphinstones army and his mouth opened like a cods wheres your commanding officer blow me says he im the commanding officer so fars there is one sergeant wells bombay grenadiers sir but we thought you was all dead it took us a little time to convince him and to learn what was happening while his sepoys cracked away from the parapet overhead at the disappointed afghans he took us into the little tower sat us on a bench gave us pancakes and water which was all they had and told us how the afghans had been besieging jallalabad three days now in everincreasing force and his own little detachment had been cut off in this outlying fort for that time its a main good place for them to mount guns dye see sir if they could run us out says he so capn little es back o the tower ere wi is ead stove in by a bullet sir said as we ad to old out no matter what to the last man sergeant e sez an then e died that was yesterday evenin sir theyd bin ittin us pretty ard sir an ave bin since i dunno as we can last out much longer cos the waters runnin low an they damn near got over the wall last night sir but cant they relieve you from jallalabad for gods sake says i i reckon they got their ands full sir says he shaking his head they can old out there long enough ol bob sale genl sale i should say aint worried about that but makin a sortie to relieve us ud be another matter oh christ says i out of the frying pan into the fire he stared at me but i was past caring there seemed no end to it there was some evil genie pursuing me through afghanistan and he meant to get me in the end to have come so far yet again and to be dragged down within sight of safety there was a palliasse in the corner of the tower and i just went and threw myself down on it my back was still burning i was halfdead with fatigue i was trapped in this hellish fort i swore and wept with my face in the straw careless of what they thought i heard them muttering hudson and the sergeant and the latters voice saying well strike me es a rum one and they must have gone outside for i heard them no more i lay there and must have fallen asleep out of sheer exhaustion for when i opened my eyes again it was dark in the room i could hear the sepoys outside talking but i didnt go out i got a drink from the pannikin on the table and lay down again and slept until morning some of you will hold up your hands in horror that a queens officer could behave like this and before his soldiers too to which i would reply that i do not claim as ive said already to be anything but a coward and a scoundrel and ive never playacted when it seemed pointless it seemed pointless now possibly i was a little delirious in those days from shock afghanistan youll admit hadnt been exactly a bank holiday outing for me but as i lay in that tower listening to the occasional crackle of firing outside and the yelling of the besiegers i ceased to care at all for appearances let them think what they would we were all surely going to be cut up and what do good opinions matter to a corpse however appearances still mattered to sergeant hudson it was he who woke me after that first night he looked poucheyed and filthy as he leaned over me his tunic all torn and his hair tumbling into his eyes how are you sir says he damnable says i my backs on fire i aint going to be much use for a while i fear hudson well sir says he lets have a look at your back i turned over groaning and he looked at it not too bad says he skins only broke here an there and not mortifying for the rest its just welts he was silent a moment thing is sir we need every musket we can raise the sangars are closer this morning an the niggers are massing looks like a proper battle sir sorry hudson says i rather weak i would if i could you know but whatever my back looks like i cant do much just yet i think theres something broken inside he stood looking down at me yes sir says he at length i think there is and then he just turned and walked out i felt myself go hot all over as i realised what he meant by that for a moment i almost jumped off the palliasse and ran after him but i didnt for at that moment there was a sudden yelling on the parapets and the musketry crashed out and sergeant wells was bawling orders but above all i heard the bloodcurdling shrieks of the ghazis and i knew they were rushing the wall it was all too much for me i lay shuddering on the straw while the sounds of fighting raged outside it seemed to go on forever and every moment i expected to hear the afghan warcries in the yard hear the rush of feet and see the bearded horrors dashing in the door with their khyber knives i could only hope to god that they would finish me off quickly as i say i may genuinely have had a shock or even a fever at this time although i doubt it i believe it was just simple fear that was almost sending me out of my mind at all events i have no particular idea of how long that fight lasted or when it stopped and the next assault began or even how many days and nights passed by i dont recall eating and drinking although i suppose i must have or even answering the calls of nature that incidentally is one effect that fear does not have on me i do not wet or foul myself it has been a near thing once or twice i admit at balaclava for example when i rode with the light brigade you know how george paget smoked a cigar all the way to the guns well my bowels moved all the way to the guns but there was nothing inside me but wind since i hadnt eaten for days but in that fort at the very end of my tether i seemed to lose my sense of time delirium funkens had me in its grip i know hudson came in to me i know he talked but i cant remember what he said except for a few isolated passages and those i think were mostly towards the end i do remember him telling me wells had been killed and myself replying thats bad luck by god is he much hurt for the rest my waking moments were less clear than my dreams and those were vivid enough i was back in the cell with gul shah and narreeman and gul was laughing at me and changing into bernier with his pistol raised and then into elphy bey saying we shall have to cut off all your essentials flashman im afraid there is no help for it i shall send a note to sir william and narreemans eyes grew greater and greater until i saw them in elspeths face elspeth smiling and very beautiful but fading in her turn to become arnold who was threatening to flog me for not knowing my construe unhappy boy i wash my hands of you you must leave my pit of snakes and dwarves this very day and he reached out and took me by the shoulder his eyes were burning like coals and his fingers bit into my shoulder so that i cried out and tried to pull them free and found myself scrabbling at hudsons fingers as he knelt beside my couch sir says he youve got to get up what time is it says i and what dye want leave me cant you leave me be im ill damn you its no go sir you cant stay here any longer you must stand up and come outside with me i told him to go to the devil and he suddenly lunged forward and seized me by the shoulders get up he snarled at me and i realised his face was far more haggard than id ever seen it drawn and fierce like an animals get up youre a queens officer by god an youll behave like one youre not ill mr precious flashman youre plain whitelivered thats all your sickness but youll get up an look like a man even if you arent one and he started to drag me from the straw i struck out at him calling him a mutinous dog and telling him id have him flogged through the army for his insolence but he stuck his face into mine and hissed oh no you wont not now nor never because you an me aint going back where theres drumheads an floggings or anything dye see were stuck here an well die here because theres no way out were done for lieutenant this garrison is finished we havent got nothing to do except die damn you then what dye want me for go and die in your own way and leave me to die in mine i tried to push him away oh no sir it aint as easy as that im all thats left to fight this fort me and a score of brokendown sepoys and you and were going to fight it mr flashman to the last inch dye hear you bloody fight it i shouted at him youre so confounded brave youre a bloody soldier all right im not im afraid damn you and i cant fight any more i dont care if the afghans take the fort and jallalabad and the whole of india the tears were running down my cheeks as i said it now go to hell and let me alone he knelt there staring at me and pushed the hair out of his eyes i know it he said i halfknew it from the minute we left kabul an i was near sure back in that cellar the way you carried on but i was double certain sure when you wanted to kill that poor afghan bitch men dont do that but i couldnt ever say so youre an officer and a gentleman as they say but it doesnt matter now sir does it were both going so i can speak my mind well i hope you enjoy doing it says i youll kill a lot of afghans that way maybe i will sir says he but i need you to help and you will help for im going to stick out here as long as i can you poor ninny says i what goodll that do if they kill you in the end this much good that ill stop those niggers mounting guns on this hill theyll never take jallalabad while we hold out and every hour gives general sale a better chance thats what im going to do sir one meets them of course ive known hundreds give them a chance to do what they call their duty let them see a hope of martyrdom theyll fight their way on to the cross and bawl for the man with the hammer and nails my best wishes says i im not stopping you yes you will sir if i let you i need you theres twenty sepoys out there wholl fight all the better if theres an officer to sick em on they dont know what you are not yet he stood up anyway im not arguing sir youll get up now or ill drag you out and ill cut you to bits with a sabre a piece at a time his face was dreadful to see just then those grey eyes in that drawn worn skin he meant it not a doubt of it so just get up sir will you i got up of course i was well enough in body my sickness was purely moral i went outside with him into a courtyard with half a dozen or so sepoy bodies laid in a row with blankets over them near the gate the living ones were up on the parapet they looked round as hudson and i went up the rickety ladder to the roof their black faces tired and listless under their shakos their skinny black hands and feet ridiculous protruding from red uniform jackets and white trousers the roof of the tower was no more than ten feet square and just a little higher than the walls surrounding it they were no more than twenty yards long the place was less a fort than a toy castle from the tower roof i could see jallalabad a mile away apparently unchanged except that the afghan lines seemed to be closer on our own front they were certainly nearer than they had been and hudson hustled me quickly under cover before the afghans could get a bead on us we were watching them a great crowd of horsemen and hillmen on foot milling about out of musket shot when hudson pointed out to me a couple of cannon that had been rolled up on their right flank they had been there since dawn he said and he expected they would start up as soon as powder and shot had been assembled we were just speculating when this might be or rather hudson was for i wasnt talking to him when there was a great roar from the horsemen and they started to roll forward towards our fort hudson thrust me down the ladder across the yard and up to the parapet a musket was shoved into my hands and i was staring through an embrasure at the whole mob surging at us i saw then that the ground outside the walls was thick with dead before the gate they were piled up like fish on a slab the sight was sickening no doubt but not so sickening as the spectacle of those devils whooping in towards the fort i reckoned there were about forty of them with footmen trailing along behind all waving their knives and yelling hudson shouted to hold fire and the sepoys behaved as though theyd been through this before as they had when the chargers were within fifty yards and not showing any great enthusiasm it seemed to me hudson bawled fire the volley crashed out and about four went down which was good shooting at this they wavered but still came on and the sepoys grabbed up their spare muskets rolling their eyes at hudson he roars fire again and another half dozen were toppled at which the whole lot sheered off there they go yells hudson reload handily now by god says he if they had the bottom for one good charge they could bowl us over like ninepins this had occurred to me there were hundreds of afghans out yonder and barely twenty men in the fort with a determined rush they could have carried the walls and once inside they would have chewed us up in five minutes but i gathered that this had been their style all along halfhearted charges that had been beaten off and only one or two that had reached the fort itself they had lost heavily i believe that they didnt much care about our little place really but would rather have been with their friends attacking jallalabad where the loot was sensible fellows but it was not going to last i could see that for all that our casualties had not been heavy the sepoys were about done there was only a little flour left for food and barely a pannikin of water a man in the big butt down by the gate hudson watched it like a hawk there were three more charges that day or maybe four and none more successful than the first we banged away and they cleared out and my mind began to go dizzy again i slumped beside my embrasure with a poshteen draped over me to try to keep off the hellish heat flies buzzed everywhere and the sepoy on my right moaning to himself incessantly by night it was as bad the cold came so bitter that i sobbed to myself at the pain of it there was a huge moon lighting everything in brilliant silver but even when it set the dark wasnt sufficient to enable the afghans to creep up on us thank god there were a few alarms and shots but that was all dawn came and the snipers began to crack away at us we kept down beneath the parapet and the shots chipped flakes off the tower behind us i must have been dozing for i was shaken awake by an almighty crash and a thunderous explosion there was a great cloud of dust swirling about and as it cleared i saw that a corner of the tower had gone and a heap of rubble was lying in the courtyard the cannon shouts hudson theyre using the cannon out across the plain there it was sure enough one of their big guns directed at the fort with a mob of afghans jostling round it five minutes it took them to reload and then the place shook as if an earthquake had hit it and there was a gaping hole in the wall beside the gate the sepoys began to wail and hudson roared at them to stand fast there was another terrific crash and then another the air was full of flying dust and stones a section of the parapet along from me gave way and a screaming sepoy went down with it i launched myself for the ladder slipped and rolled off into the debris and something must have struck my head for the next thing i knew i was standing up not knowing where i was looking at a ruined wall beyond which there was an empty plain with figures running towards me they were a long way away and it took me a moment to realise that they were afghans they were charging sure enough and then i heard a musket crack and there at the ruined wall was hudson fumbling with a ramrod and swearing the side of his face caked with blood he saw me and bawled come on come on lend a hand man i walked towards him my feet weighing a ton apiece a redcoated figure was moving in the shadow of the wall beside the gate it was one of the sepoys curiously the wall had been shot in on either side but the gate was still standing with the flag trailing at its staff on top and the cords hanging down as the shrieks of the ghazis drew nearer a thought entered my head and i stumbled over towards the gate and laid hold of the cords give in i said and tugged at the cords give in and make em stop i pulled at the cords again and then there was another appalling crash the gates opened as though a giant hand had whirled them inwards the arch above them fell and the flagstaff with it the choking dust swirled up and i blundered through it my hands out to grab the colours that were now within reach i knew quite clearly what i wanted to do i would gather up the flag and surrender it to the afghans and then they would let us alone hudson even in that hellish din and horror must have guessed somehow what was in my mind for i saw him crawling towards the colours too or perhaps he was trying to save them i dont know but he didnt manage it another round shot ploughed into the rubble before me and the dirty blueclad figure was suddenly swept away like a rag doll into an engulfing cloud of dust and masonry i staggered forward over the stones touched the flagstaff and fell on my knees the cloth of the flag was within reach and i caught hold of it and pulled it up from the rubbish from somewhere there came a volley of musketry and i thought well this is the finish and not half as bad as i thought it would be but bad enough for all that and god i dont want to die yet there was a thunder like a waterfall and things were falling on me a horrible pain went through my right leg and i heard the shriek of a ghazi almost in my car i was lying face down clutching at the flag mumbling here take the bloody thing i dont want it please take it i give in the musketry crashed again the roaring noise grew louder and then sight and hearing died there are a few wakenings in your life that you would wish to last forever they are so blissful too often you wake in a bewilderment and then remember the bad news you went to sleep on but now and then you open your eyes in the knowledge that all is well and safe and right and there is nothing to do but lie there with eyes gently shut enjoying every delicious moment i knew it was all fine when i felt the touch of sheets beneath my chin and a soft pillow beneath my head i was in a british bed somewhere and the rustling sound above me was a punkah fan even when i moved and a sudden anguish stabbed through my right leg i wasnt dismayed for i guessed at once that it was only broken and there was still a foot to waggle at the end of it how i had got there i didnt care obviously i had been rescued at the last minute from the fort wounded but otherwise whole and brought to safety far away i could hear the tiny popping of muskets but here there was peace and i lay marvelling at my own luck revelling in my present situation and not even bothering to open my eyes i was so contented when i did it was to find myself in a pleasant whitewashed room with the sun slanting through wooden shutters and a punkah wallah dozing against the wall automatically twitching the string of his big fan i turned my head and found it was heavily bandaged i was conscious that it throbbed at the back but even that didnt discourage me i had got clear away from pursuing afghans and relentless enemies and beastlyminded women and idiot commanders i was snug in bed and anyone who expected any more from flashy well let him wish he might get it i stirred again and my leg hurt and i swore at which the punkah wallah jumps up squeaking and ran from the room crying that i was awake presently there was a bustling and in came a little spectacled man with a bald head and a large canvas jacket followed by two or three indian attendants awake at last says he well well this is gratifying dont move sir still still youve a broken leg here and a broken head there lets have peace between em what he beamed at me took my pulse looked at my tongue told me his name was bucket pulled his nose and said i was very well considering fractured femur sir thigh bone nasty but uncomplicated few months and youll be bounding over the jumps again but not yet no had a nasty time of it eh ugly cuts about your back neer mind well hear about that later now abdul says he run and tell major havelock the patients awake juldi jao pray dont move sir whats that yes a little drink better head still thats right nothing to do for the present but lie properly still he prattled on but i wasnt heeding him oddly enough it was the sight of the blue coat beneath the canvas jacket that put me in mind of hudson what had become of him my last recollection was of seeing him hit and probably killed but was he dead he had better be for my sake for the memory of our latter relations was all too vivid in my mind and it suddenly rushed in on me that if hudson was alive and talked i was done for he could swear to my cowardice if he wanted to would he dare would he be believed he could prove nothing but if he was known as a steady man and i was sure he would be he might well be listened to it would mean my ruin my disgrace and while i hadnt cared a button for these things when i believed death was closing in on me and everyone else in that fort well i cared most damnably for them now that i was safe again oh god says i to myself let him be dead the sepoys if any survived dont know and wouldnt talk if they did or be believed but hudson he must be dead charitable thoughts youll say aye its a hard world and while bastards like hudson have their uses they can be most inconvenient too i wanted him to be dead then as much as i ever wanted anything my suspense must have been written on my face for the little doctor began to babble soothingly to me and then the door opened and in walked sale his big kind stupid face all beaming as red as his coat and behind him a tall flintyfaced pulpitlooking man there were others peeping round the lintel as sale strode forward and plumped down into a chair beside the bed leaning forward to take my hand in his own he held it gently in his big paw and gazed at me like a cow in milk my boy says he almost in a whisper my brave boy hullo thinks i this dont sound too bad at all but i had to find out and quickly sir says i and to my astonishment my voice came out in a hoarse quaver it had been so long unused i suppose sir how is sergeant hudson sale gave a grunt as though he had been kicked bowed his head and then looked at the doctor and the gravedigger fellow with him they both looked damned solemn his first words says the little doctor hauling out a handkerchief and snorting into it sale shook his head sadly and looked back at me my boy says he it grieves me deeply to tell you that your comrade sergeant hudson is dead he did not survive the last onslaught on pipers fort he paused staring at me compassionately and then says he died like a true soldier and nicanor lay dead in his harness says the gravedigger chap taking a look at the ceiling he died in the fullness of his duty and was not found wanting thank god says i god help him i mean god rest him that is luckily my voice was so weak that they couldnt hear more than a mumble i looked downcast and sale squeezed my hand i think i know says he what his comradeship must have meant to you we understand you see that you must have come together from the ruins of general elphinstones army and we can guess at the hardships oh my boy they are written all too plainly on your body that you must have endured together i would have spared you this news until you were stronger he made a gesture and brushed his eye no sir says i speaking a little stronger i wanted to know now it is what i would have expected of you says he wringing my hand my boy what can i say it is a soldiers lot we must console ourselves with the thought that we would as gladly sacrifice ourselves for our comrades as they do for us and we do not forget them non omnis moriar says the gravedigger such men do not wholly die amen says the little doctor sniffing really all they needed was an organ and a church choir but we must not disturb you too soon says sale you need rest he got up take it in the knowledge that your troubles are over and that you have done your duty as few men would have done it aye or could have done it i shall come again as soon as i may in the meantime let me say what i came to tell you that i rejoice from my heart to see you so far recovered for your delivery is the finest thing that has come to us in all this dark catalogue of disasters god bless you my boy come gentlemen he stumped out with the others following the gravedigger bowed solemnly and the little doctor ducked his head and shooed the nigger attendants before him and i was left not only relieved but amazed by what sale had said oh the everyday compliments of people like elphy bey are one thing but this was sale after all the renowned fighting bob whose courage was a byword and he had said my deliverance was the finest thing and that i had done my duty as few could have done it why he had talked as though i was a hero to be reverenced with that astonishing pussyfooting worship which for some reason my century extended to its idols they treated us as though we were too delicate to handle normally like old chinese pots well i had thought when i woke up that i was safe and in credit but sales visit made me realise that there was more to it than i had imagined i didnt find out what though until the following day when sale came back again with the gravedigger at his elbow he was major havelock by the way a biblemoth of the deepest dye and a great name now old bob was in great spirits and entertained me with the latest news which was that jallalabad was holding out splendidly that a relief force under pollock was on its way and that it didnt matter anyway because we had the measure of the afghans and would probably sally out and break the siege whenever we felt like it havelock looked a bit sour at this i gathered he didnt hold a high opinion of sale nobody did apart from admiring his bravery and was none too sure of his capabilities when it came to raising sieges and this says bob beaming with enthusiasm this we owe to you aye and to the gallant band who held that little fort against an army my word havelock did i not say to you at the time that there never was a grander thing it may not pay for all to be sure the catastrophe of afghanistan will call forth universal horror in england but at least we have redeemed something we hold jallalabadbad and well drive this rabble of akbars from our gates aye and be back in kabul before the year is out and when we do and he swung round on me again it will be because a handful of sepoys led by an english gentleman defied a great army alone and to the bitter end he was so worked up by his own eloquence that he had to go into the corner and gulp for a little while havelock nodded solemnly regarding me it had the flavour of heroism says he and heaven knows there has been little enough of that to date they will make much of it at home well im not often at a nonplus but this left me speechless heroism well if they cared to think so let em i wouldnt contradict them and it struck me that if i did if i were idiot enough to let them know the truth as i am writing it now they would simply have thought me crazy as a result of my wounds god alone knew what i was supposed to have done that was so brave but doubtless i should learn in time all i could see was that somehow appearances were heavily on my side and who needs more than that give me the shadow every time and you can keep the substance its a principle ive followed all my life and it works if you know how to act on it what was obvious was that nothing must now happen to spoil sales lovely dream for him it would have been cruel to the old fellow so i addressed myself to the task at once we did our duty sir says i looking uncomfortable and havelock nodded again while old bob came back to the bed and i have done mine says he fumbling in his pocket for i conceived it no less in sending my latest despatch to lord ellenborough who now commands in delhi to include an account of your action ill read it says he because it speaks more clearly than i can at present and will enable you to see how others judged your conduct he cleared his throat and began humph lets see afghans in strength demands that i surrender aye aye sharp engagement by dennie ah here we have it i had despatched a strong guard under captain little to pipers fort commanding an eminence some way from the city where i feared the enemy might establish gun positions when the siege began pipers fort was totally cut off from us and received the full force of the enemys assault in what manner it resisted i cannot say in detail for of its garrison only five now survive four of them being sepoys and the other an english officer who is yet unconscious with his wounds but will as i trust soon recover how he came in the fort i know not for he was not of the original garrison but on the staff of general elphinstone his name is flashman and it is probable that he and dr brydon are the only survivors of the army so cruelly destroyed at jugdulluk and gandamack i can only assume that he escaped the final massacre and so reached pipers fort after the siege began he looked at me you shall correct me my boy if i go wrong but it is right you should know what i have told his excellency youre very kind sir says i humbly too kind by a damned sight if you only knew the siege continued slowly on our own front as i have already informed you says sale reading on but the violence of the assaults on pipers fort was unabated captain little was slain with his sergeant but the garrison fought on with the utmost resolution lieutenant flashman as i learn from one of the sepoys was in a case more suited to a hospital than to a battlefield for he had evidently been prisoner of the afghans who had flogged him most shockingly so that he was unable to stand and must lie in the fort tower his companion sergeant hudson assisted most gallantly in the defence until lieutenant flashman despite his wounds returned to the action charge after charge was resisted and the enemy most bloodily repulsed to us in jallalabad this unexpected check to the sirdars advance was an advantage beyond price it may well have been decisive well hudson thinks i that was what you wanted and you got it for all the good it did you meanwhile sale laid off for a minute took a wipe at his eye and started in again trying not to quaver i suspect he was enjoying his emotion but there was no way in which we could succour pipers fort at this time and the enemy bringing forward cannon the walls were breached in several places i had now resolved on a sortie to do what could be done for our comrades and colonel dennie advanced to their relief in a sharp engagement over the very ruins of the fort for it had been pounded almost to pieces by the guns the afghans were entirely routed and we were able to make good the position and withdraw the survivors of the garrison which had held it so faithfully and well i thought the old fool was going to weep but he took a great pull at himself and proceeded with what grief do i write that of these there remained only five the gallant hudson was slain and at first it seemed that no european was left alive then lieutenant flashman was found wounded and unconscious by the ruins of the gate where he had taken his final stand in defence not only of the fort but of his countrys honour for he was found in the last extremity with the colours clutched to his broken body his face to the foemen defiant even unto death hallelujah and goodnight sweet prince says i to myself what a shame i hadnt a broken sword and a ring of my slain around me but i thought too soon the bodies of his enemies lay before him says old bob at first it was thought he was dead but to our great joy it was discovered that the flame of life still flickered i cannot think that there was ever a nobler deed than this and i only wish that our countrymen at home might have seen it and learned with what selfless devotion their honour is protected even at the ends of the earth it was heroic and i trust that lieutenant flashmans name will be remembered in every home in england whatever may be said of the disasters that have befallen us here his valour is testimony that the spirit of our young manhood is no whit less ardent than that of their predecessors who in pitts words saved europe by their example well thinks i if thats how we won the battle of waterloo thank god the french dont know or we shall have them at us again who ever heard such humbug but it was glorious to listen to mind you and i glowed at the thought of it this was fame i didnt understand then how the news of kabul and gandamack would make england shudder and how that vastly conceited and indignant public would clutch at any straw that might heal their national pride and enable them to repeat the old and nonsensical lie that one englishman is worth twenty foreigners but i could still guess what effect sales report would have on a new governorgeneral and through him on the government and country especially by contrast with the accounts of the inglorious shambles by elphy and mcnaghten that must now be on their way home all i must do was be modest and manly and wait for the laurel wreaths sale had shoved his copy of the letter back in his pocket and was looking at me all moist and admiring havelock was stern i guessed he thought sale was laying it on a deal too thick but he couldnt say so it was up to me so i looked sale in the eye man to man youve done us great credit sir says i thankee for the garrison its no less then they deserve but for myself well you make it sound a bit too much like st george and the dragon if you dont mind my saying so i just well pitched in with the rest sir that was all even havelock smiled at this plain manly talk and sale nearly burst with pride and said it was the grandest thing by heaven and the whole garrison was full of it then he sobered down and asked me to tell him how i had come to pipers fort and what had happened to separate hudson and me from the army elphy was still in akbars hands along with shelton and mackenzie and the married folk but for the rest they had thought them all wiped out except brydon who had come galloping in alone with a broken sabre trailing from his wrist with havelocks eye on me i kept it brief and truthful we had come adrift from the army in the fighting about jugdulluk i said had escaped by inches through the gullies with ghazis pursuing us and had tried to rejoin the army at gandamack but had only been in time to see it slaughtered i described the scene accurately with old bob groaning and damning and havelock frowning like a stone idol and then told how we had been captured and imprisoned by afridis they had flogged me to make me give information about the kandahar force and other matters but thank god i had told them nothing and had managed to slip my fetters the same night i had released hudson and together we had cut our way past our captors and escaped i said nothing of narreeman least said soonest mended but concluded with an account of how we had skulked through the afghan army and then ridden into the fort hellforleather there i left it and old bob exclaimed again about courage and endurance but what reassured me most was that havelock without a word shook my right hand in both of his i can say that i told it well offhand but not overmodest just a blunt soldier reporting to his seniors it calls for nice judgement this art of bragging you must be plain but not too plain and you must smile only rarely letting them guess more than you say is the kernel of it and looking uncomfortable when they compliment you they spread the tale of course and in the next few days i dont suppose there was an officer of the garrison who didnt come in to shake hands and congratulate me on coming through safe george broadfoot was among the first all red whiskers and spectacles beaming and telling me what a devil of a fellow i was and this from broadfoot mind you whom the afghans called a brave among braves to have people like him and mayne and fighting bob making much of me well it was firstrate i can tell you and my conscience didnt trouble me a bit why should it i didnt ask for their golden opinions i just didnt contradict em who would it was altogether a splendid few weeks while i lay nursing my leg the siege of jallalabad petered out and sale finally made another sortie that scattered the afghan army to the winds a few days after that pollock arrived with the relief force from peshawar and the garrison band piped them in amongst universal cheering of course i was on hand they carried me out on to the verandah and i saw pollock march in later that evening sale brought him to see me and expounded my gallantries once again to my great embarrassment of course pollock swore it was tremendous and vowed to avenge me when he marched on to kabul sale was going with him to clear the passes brink akbar to book if possible and release the prisoners who included lady sale should they still be alive you can stay here and take your wellearned repose while your leg mends says fighting bob at which i decided a scowl and a mutter might be appropriate id rather come along says i damn this infernal leg why hold on laughs sale wed have to carry you in a palankeen havent you had enough of afghanistan not while akbar khans above ground says i id like to take these splints and make him eat em they laughed at this and broadfoot who was there cries out hes an old warhorse already our flashy ye want tae be in at the death dont ye ye great carl aye well ye can leave akbar tae us forbye i doubt if the action well find about kabul will be lively enough for your taste they went off and i heard broadfoot telling pollock what a madman i was when it came to a fight when we were fighting in the passes it was flashman every time that was sent out as galloper to us with messages ye would see him fleein over the sangars like a daft ghazi and aye wi a pack o hostiles howling at his heels he minded them no more than flies that was what he made out of the one inglorious occasion when i had been chased for my life into his encampment but you will have noticed no doubt that when a man has a reputation good or bad folk will always delight in adding to it there wasnt a man in afghanistan who knew me but who wanted to recall having seen me doing something desperate and broadfoot quite sincerely was like all the rest pollock and sale didnt catch akbar as it turned out but they did release the prisoners he had taken and the armys arrival in kabul quieted the country there was no question of serious reprisals having been once bitten we were not looking for trouble a second time the one prisoner they didnt release though was old elphy bey he had died in captivity worn out and despairing and there was a general grief in which i for one didnt share no doubt he was a kindly old stick but he was a damned disaster as a commander he above all others murdered the army of afghanistan and when i reckon up the odds against my own survival in that mess well it wasnt elphys fault that i came through but while all these stirring things were happening while the afghans were skulking back into their hills and sale and pollock and nott were showing the flag and blowing up kabul bazaar for spite while the news of the catalogue of disasters was breaking on a horrified england while the old duke of wellington was damning aucklands folly for sending an army to occupy rocks sands deserts ice and snow while the general public and palmerston were crying out for vengeance and the prime minister was retorting that he wasnt going to make another war for the sake of spreading the study of adam smith among that pathans while all this was happening i was enjoying a triumphal progress back to india with my leg still splinted i was being borne south as the hero or at least the most convenient of a few heroes of the hour it is obvious now that the delhi administration regarded me as something of a godsend as greville said later of the afghan war there wasnt much cause for triumph in it but ellenborough in delhi was shrewd enough to see that the best way to put a good gloss on the whole horrible nonsense was to play up its few creditable aspects and i was the first handy one so while he was trumpeting in orders of the day about the illustrious garrison who had held jallalabad under the noble sale he found room to beat the drum about gallant flashman and india took its cue from him while they drank my health they could pretend that gandamack hadnt happened i got my first taste of this when i left jallalabad in a palankeen to go down the khyber with a convoy and the whole garrison turned out to hurrah me off then at peshawar there was old avitabile the italian rascal who welcomed me with a guard of honour kissed me on both cheeks and made me and himself riotously drunk in celebration of my return that night was memorable for one thing i had my first woman for months for avitabile had in a couple of lively afghan wenches and we made splendid beasts of ourselves it isnt easy i may say handling a woman when your leg is broken but where theres a will theres a way and in spite of the fact that avitabile was almost sick laughing at the spectacle of me getting my wench buckled to i managed most satisfactorily from there it was the same all the way at every town and camp there were garlands and congratulations and smiling faces and cheering until i could almost believe i was a hero the men gripped my hand full of emotion and the women kissed me and sniffled colonels had my health drunk in their messes company men slapped me on the shoulder an irish subaltern and his young wife got me to stand godfather to their new son who was launched into life with the appalling name of flashman otoole and the ladies of the church guild at lahore presented me with a silk scarf in red white and blue with a scroll embroidered steadfast at ludhiana a clergyman preached a tremendous sermon on the text greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends he admitted in a roundabout way that i hadnt actually laid down mine but it hadnt been for want of trying and had been a damned near thing altogether better luck next rime was about his view of it and meanwhile hosannah and hurrah for flashy and let us now sing who would true valour see all this was nothing to delhi where they actually had a band playing hail the conquering hero comes and ellenborough himself helped me out of the palankeen and supported me up the steps there was a tremendous crowd all cheering like billyo and a guard of honour and an address read out by a fat chap in a red coat and a slapup dinner afterwards at which ellenborough made a great speech which lasted over an hour it was dreadful rubbish about thermopylae and the spanish armada and how i had clutched the colours to my bleeding breast gazing proudly with serene and noble brow oer the engorged barbarian host like christian before apollyon or roland at roncesvalles i forget which but i believe it was both he was a fearful orator full of bombast from shakespeare and the classics and i had no difficulty in feeling like a fool long before he was finished but i sat it out staring down the long white table with all delhi society gaping at me and drinking in ellenboroughs nonsense i had just sense enough not to get drunk in public and by keeping a straight face and frowning i contrived to look noble i heard the women say as much behind their fans peeping at me and no doubt wondering what kind of a mount i would make while their husbands thumped the table and shouted bravo whenever ellenborough said something especially foolish then at the end damned if he didnt start singing for hes a jolly good fellow at which the whole crowd rose and roared their heads off and i sat redfaced and trying not to laugh as i thought of what hudson would have said if he could have seen me it was too bad of course but they would never have made such a fuss about a sergeant and even if they had he couldnt have carried it off as i did insisting on hobbling up to reply and having ellenborough say that if i must stand it should be his shoulder i should lean on and by god he would boast about it ever after at this they roared again and with his red face puffing claret beside me i said that this was all too much for one who was only a simple english gentleman and that what i had done was my duty no more or less as i hoped became a soldier and while i didnt believe there was any great credit to me in it well if they said there was it wasnt due to me but to the country that bore me and to the old school where i was brought up as a christian i hoped by my masters and while they were so kind to me they must not forget those others who had carried the flag and were carrying it still and who would beat the afghans back to where they came from and prove what everyone knew that englishmen never would be slaves and well what i had done hadnt been much but it had been my best and i hoped i would always do it so god bless them all and let them drink with me to the health of our gallant comrades still in the field your simple honesty no less than your manly aspect and your glorious sentiments won the admiration and love of all who heard you ellenborough told me afterwards flashman i salute you furthermore says he i intend that england shall salute you also when he returns from his victorious campaign sir robert sale will be despatched to england where i doubt not he will receive those marks of honour which become a hero many people did sixty years ago as is fitting a worthy herald shall precede him and share his glory i mean of course yourself your work here is done and nobly done for the time being i shall send you to calcutta with all the speed that your disability allows there to take ship for england i just stared at the man i had never thought of this to get out of this hellish country for if as ive said i can now consider that india was kind to me i was still overjoyed at the thought of leaving it to see england again and home and london and the clubs and messes and civilised people to be feted there as i had been assured i would be to return in triumph when i had set out under a cloud to be safe beyond the reach of black savages and heat and filth and disease and danger to see white women again and live soft and take life easy and sleep secure at nights to devour the softness of elspeth to stroll in the park and be pointed out as the hero of pipers fort to come back to life again why it was like waking from a nightmare the thought of it all set me shaking there are further reports to be made on affairs in afghanistan says ellenborough and i can think of no more fitting messenger well sir says i im at your orders if you insist ill go it took four months to sail home just as it had taken four months to sail out but im bound to say i didnt mind this time then i had been going into exile now i was coming home a hero if id had any doubts of that the voyage dispelled them the captain and his officers and the passengers were as civil as butter and treated me as if i were the duke himself when they found i was a cheery sort who liked his bottle and talk we got along famously for they never seemed to tire of hearing me tell of my engagements with afghans male and female and we got drunk most nights together one or two of the older chaps were a bit leery of me and one even hinted that i talked a deal too much but i didnt care for this and said so they were just sour old packagerats anyway or jealous civilians i wonder now looking back that the defence of jallalabad made such a stir for it was a very ordinary business really but it did and since i was the first out of india who had been there and borne a distinguished part i got the lions share of admiration it was so on the ship and was to prove so in england during the voyage my broken leg recovered almost entirely but there was not much activity on shipboard anyway and no women and boozing with the boys apart i had a good deal of time to myself this and the absence of females naturally turned me to thoughts of elspeth it was strange and delightful to think of going home to a wife and i got that queasy feeling deep in my bowels whenever i found myself dreaming about her it wasnt all lust either not more than about ninetenths after all she wasnt going to be the only woman in england but when i conjured up a picture of that lovely placid face and blonde hair i got a tightness in my throat and a trembling in my hands that was quite apart from what the clergy call carnal appetites it was the feeling i had experienced that first night i rattled her beside the clyde a kind of hunger for her presence and the sound of her voice and the dreamy stupidity of her blue eyes i wondered if i was falling in love with her and decided that i was and that i didnt care anyway which is a sure sign so in this moonstruck state i whiled away the long voyage and by the time we docked among the forest of shipping in london pool i was in a fine sweat romantic and horny all at once i made great haste for my fathers house full of excitement at the thought of surprising her for of course she had no idea that i was coming and banged the knocker so hard that passersby turned to stare at the big brownfaced fellow who was in such a devilish hurry old oswald opened just as healways did and gaped like a sheep as i strode past him shouting the hall was empty and both strange and familiar at once as things are after a long absence elspeth i roared halloo elspeth im home oswald was gabbling at my elbow that my father was out and i clapped him on the back and pulled his whiskers good for him says i i hope they have to carry him home tonight wheres your mistress elspeth hallo he just went on clucking at me between delight and amazement and then i heard a door open behind me and looked round and who should be standing there but judy that took me aback a bit i hadnt thought she would still be here hallo says i not too well pleased although she was looking as handsome as ever hasnt the guvnor got a new whore yet she was about to say something but at that moment there was a step on the staircase and elspeth was standing there staring down at me god what a picture she was corngold hair red lips parted blue eyes wide breast heaving no doubt she was wearing something but i couldnt for the life of me remember what it was she looked like a startled nymph and then the old satyr flashy was bounding up the stairs grabbing her and crying im home im home elspeth im home oh harry says she and then her arms were round my neck and her lips were on mine if the brigade of guards had marched into the hall just then to command me to the tower id not have heard them i picked her up bodily tingling at the feel of her and without a word spoken carried her into the bedroom and tumbled her there and then it was superb for i was halfdrunk with excitement and longing and when it was over i simply lay there listening to her prattle a thousand questions clasping her to me kissing every inch of her and answering god knows what how long we spent there i cant imagine but it was a long golden afternoon and ended only when the maid tapped on the door to say that my father was home again and demanding to see me so we must get dressed and straighten ourselves giggling like naughty children and when elspeth had herself in order the maid came tapping again to say that my father was growing impatient just to show that heroes werent to be hurried i caught my darling up again and in spite of her muffled squeals of protest mounted her once more without the formality of undressing then we went down it should have been a splendid evening with the family welcoming the prodigal achilles but it wasnt my father had aged in two years his face was redder and his belly bigger and his hair was quite white at the temples he was civil enough damned me for a young rascal and said he was proud of me the whole town had been talking over the reports from india and ellenboroughs eulogies for myself and sale and havelock were all over the place but his jollity soon wore off and he drank a good deal too much at dinner and fell into a silence at last i could see then there was something wrong although i didnt pay him much heed judy dined with us and i gathered she was now entirely one of the household which was bad news i didnt care for her any better now than i had two years before after our quarrel and i made it pretty plain it seemed rather steep of my father to keep his dolly at home with my wife there and treat them as equals and i decided to speak to him about it but judy was cool and civil too and i gathered she was ready to keep the peace if i did not that i minded her or my father much i was all over elspeth revelling in the dreamy way she listened to my talk i had forgotten what a ninny she was but it had its compensations she sat wideeyed at my adventures and i dont suppose anyone else got a word in edgeways all through the meal i just bathed myself in that simple dazzling smile of hers and persuaded her of what a wonderful husband she had and later when we went to bed i persuaded her more so it was then though that the first little hint of something odd in her behaviour crossed my mind she had dropped off to sleep and i was lying there exhausted listening to her breathing and feeling somehow dissatisfied which was strange considering then it came to me this little doubt and i dismissed it and then it came back i had had plenty of experience with women as you know and can judge them in bed as well as anyone i reckon and it seemed to me however hard i pushed the thought away that elspeth was not as she had been before i went away ive often said that she only came to life when she was at grips with a man well she had been willing enough in the few hours of my homecoming i couldnt deny but there hadnt been any of the rapturous passion on her part that i remembered these are fine things and difficult to explain oh she was active enough at the time and content enough afterwards but she was easier about it all somehow if it had been fetnab or josette i wouldnt have noticed i dare say it was their work as well as their play but i had a different emotion about elspeth and it told me there was something missing it was just a shadow and when i woke next morning i had forgotten it if i hadnt the mornings events would have driven it from my mind i came down late and cornered my father in his study before he could slip out to his club he was sitting with his feet along the couch preparing for the rigours of the day with a glass of brandy and looking liverish but i plunged right in and told him my thoughts about judy things have changed says i and we cant have her seen about the place nowadays youll gather that two years among the afghans had changed my attitude to parental discipline i wasnt so easy to cow as i had been oh aye says he and how have things changed youll find i told him that im known about the town henceforth what with india and so on well be more in the public eye now and folk will talk it wont do for elspeth for one thing elspeth likes her says he does she though well thats no matter it aint what elspeth likes that counts but what the town likes and they wont like us if we keep this this pet pussy in the house my were grown very nice he sneered and took a good pull at his brandy i could see the flush of temper on his face and wondered why he hadnt lost it yet i didnt know india bred such fine sensibilities he went on quite the reverse id have thought oh look father it wont do and you know it send her up to leicestershire if you want or give her a maison of her own but she cant stay here he looked at me a long while by god maybe ive been wrong about you all along i know youre a wastrel but i never thought you had the stuff to be brave in spite of all the tales from india perhaps you have or perhaps its just insolence anyway youre on the wrong scent boy as i said elspeth likes her and if she dont want her away then she stays in gods name what does it matter what elspeth likes shell do as i tell her i doubt it says he whats that he put down his glass wiped his lips and said you wont like it harry but here it is who pays the piper calls the tune and your elspeth and her damned family have been calling the tune this year past hold on now let me finish youll have plenty to say no doubt but itll wait i could only stare at him not understanding were in queer street harry i hardly know how myself but there it is i suppose ive been running pretty fast all my life and not taking much account of how the money went what are lawyers for eh i took some bad tumbles on the turf never heeded the expenses of this place or leicestershire didnt stint any way at all but it was the damned railway shares that really did the trick oh there are fortunes being made out of em the right ones i picked the wrong ones a year ago i was a ruined man up to my neck with the jews ready to be sold up i didnt write to you about it what was the point this house aint mine nor our place in leicestershire its hers or it will be when old morrison goes god rot and damn him it cant be too soon he jumped up and walked about finally stopping before the fireplace he met the bill for his daughters sake oh you should have seen it more canting headwagging hypocrisy than ive seen in years in parliament even he had the effrontery to stand in my own hall by god and tell me it was a judgement on him for letting his daughter marry beneath herself beneath herself dye hear and i had to listen to him and keep myself from flooring the old swine what could i do i was the poor relation i still am hes still paying the bills through the simpering nitwit you married he lets her have what she wants and there you are but if hes settled an allowance on her hes settled nothing she asks him and he provides damned if i would if i was him but there perhaps he thinks it worth while he seems to dote on her and ill say this for the chit shes not stingy but shes the paymistress harry my son and youd best not forget it youre a kept man dyou see so it dont become you or me to say wholl come and wholl go and since your elspeth is astonishingly liberalminded why miss judy can stay and be damned to you i heard him out flabbergasted at first but perhaps because i was a more practical man than the guvnor or had fewer notions of gentility through having an aristocratic mother i took a different view of the matter while he splashed more brandy into his glass i asked how much does he let her have eh i told you whatever she wants the old bastard seems to be warm enough for ten but you cant get your hands on it i tell you well i dont mind says i as long as the moneys there it dont signify who draws the orders he gaped at me jesus he said in a choked voice have you no pride probably as much as you have says i very cool youre still here aint you he took on the old familiar apoplectic look so i slid out before he threw a bottle at me and went upstairs to think it wasnt good news of course but i didnt doubt i could come to a good understanding with elspeth which was all that mattered the truth was i didnt have his pride it wasnt as if i should have to sponge off old morrison after all no doubt i should have been upset at the thought of not inheriting my fathers fortune or what had been his fortune but when old morrison ceased to trouble the world id have elspeths share of the will which would quite probably make up for all that in the meantime i tackled her on the subject at the first opportunity and found her all brainless agreement which was highly satisfactory what i have is yours my love says she with that melting look you know you have only to ask me for anything anything at all much obliged says i but it might be a little inconvenient sometimes i was thinking if there was a regular payment say it would save all the tiresome business for you my father would not allow that im afraid he has been quite clear you see i saw all right and worked away at her but it was no use a fool she might be but she did what papa told her and the old miser knew better than to leave a loophole for the flashman family to crawl in and lighten him its a wise man that knows his own soninlaw so it was going to have to be cash on demand which was better than no cash at all and she was ready enough with fifty guineas when i made my first application it was all cut and dried with a lawyer in johnsons court who advanced her whatever she asked for in reason however apart from these sordid matters there was quite enough to engage me in those first days at home no one at the horse guards knew quite what to do with me so i was round the clubs a good deal and it was surprising how many people knew me all of a sudden they would hail me in the park or shake hands in the street and there was a steady stream of callers at home friends of my fathers whom he hadnt seen for years popped up to meet me and greet him invitations were showered on us letters of congratulation piled up on the hall table and spilled on to the floor there were paragraphs in the press about the first of the returned heroes from cabool and jellulabad and the new comic paper punch had a cartoon in its series of pencillings which showed a heroic figure some thing like me wielding an enormous scimitar like a panto mime bandit with hordes of blackamoors trying to wrest the union jack from me in vain underneath there was the caption a flash blade which give you some idea of the standard of humour in that journal however elspeth was enchanted with it and bought a dozen copies she was in whirl of delight at being the centre of so much attention for the heros wife gets as many of the garlands as he does especially if shes a beauty there was one night at the theatre when the manager insisted on taking us out of our seats to a box and the whole audience cheered and stamped and clapped elspeth was radiant and stood there squeaking and clasping her hands with not the least trace of embarrassment while i waved very goodnatured to the mob oh harry says she sparkling im so happy i could die why you are famous harry and i she didnt finish but i know she was thinking that she was famous too at that moment i loved her all the more for thinking it the parties in that first week were too many to count and always we were the centre of attraction they had a military flavour for thanks to the news from afghanistan and china where we had also been doing well the army was in fashion more than usual the more senior officers and the mamas claimed me which left elspeth to the young blades this delighted her of course and pleased me i wasnt jealous and indeed took satisfaction in seeing them clustering like flies round a jampot which they could watch but couldnt taste she knew a good many of them and i learned that during my absence in india quite a few of the young sparks had squired her in the park or ridden in the row with her which was natural enough she being an army wife but i just kept an eye open all the same and coldshouldered one or two when they came too close there was one in particular a young life guards captain called watney who was often at the house and was her riding partner twice in the week he was a tall curlylipped exquisite with a lazy eye who made himself very easy at home until i gave him the aboutturn i can attend mrs flashman very well thankee says i none better says he im sure i had only hoped that you might relinquish her for a halfhour or so not for a minute says i oh come now says he patronising me this is very selfish i am sure mrs flashman wouldnt agree im sure she would would you care to test it says he with an infuriating smile i could have boxed his ears but i kept my temper very well go to the devil you mincing pimp i told him and left him standing in the hall i went straight to elspeths room told her what had happened and cautioned her against seeing watney again which one is he she asked admiring her hair in the mirror fellow with a face like a horse and a hawhaw voice there are so many like that says she i cant tell one from the other harry darling would i look well with ringlets do you think this pleased me as you can guess and i forgot the incident at once i remember it now for it was that same day that everything happened all at once there are days like that a chapter in your life ends and another one begins and nothing is the same afterwards i was to call at the horse guards to see my uncle bindley and i told elspeth i would not be home until the afternoon when we were to go out to tea at someoneorothers but when i got to horse guards my uncle bundled me straight into a carriage and bore me off to meet of all people the duke of wellington id never seen him closer than a distance and it made me fairly nervous to stand in his anteroom after bindley had been ushered in to him and hear their voices murmuring behind the closed door then it opened and the duke came out he was whitehaired and pretty wrinkled at this time but that damned hooked nose would have marked him anywhere and his eyes were like gimlets ah this is the young man says he shaking hands for all his years he walked with the spring of a jockey and was very spruce in his grey coat the town is full of you just now says he looking me in the eyes it is as it should be it was a damned good bit of work about the only good thing in the whole business by god whatever ellenborough and palmerston may say hudson thinks i you should see me now short of the heavens opening there was nothing to be added the duke asked me a few sharp questions about akbar khan and the afghans generally and how the troops had behaved on the retreat which i answered as well as i could he listened with his head back and said hmm and nodded and then said briskly it is a thorough shame that it has been so shockingly managed but it is always the way with these damned politicals there is no telling them if i had had someone like mcnaghten with me in spain bindley id still be at lisbon i dare say and what is to happen to mr flashman have you spoken to hardinge bindley said they would have to find a regiment for me and the duke nodded yes he is a regimental man you were in the th hussars as i remember well you wont want to go back there and he gave me a shrewd look his lordship is no better disposed to indian officers now than he ever was the more fool he i have thought of telling him more than once that im an indian officer myself but he would probably just have given me a setdown well mr flashman i am to take you to her majesty this afternoon so you must be here at one oclock and with that he turned back to his room said a word to bindley and shut the door well you can guess how all this dazzled me to have the great duke chatting to me to learn that i was to be presented to the queen all this had me walking on the clouds i went home in a rosy dream hugging myself at the way elspeth would take the news this would make her damned father sit up and take notice all right and it would be odd if i couldnt squeeze something out of him in consequence if i played my cards well i hurried upstairs but she wasnt in her room i called and eventually old oswald appeared and said she had gone out where away says i well sir says he looking mighty sour i dont rightly know with miss judy no sir says he not with miss judy miss judy is downstairs sir there was something damned queer about his manner but there was nothing more to be got from him so i went downstairs and found judy playing with a kitten in the morning room wheres my wife says i out with captain watney says she cool as you please riding here kittykitty in the park i dare say for a minute i didnt understand youre wrong says i i sent him packing two hours ago well they went riding half an hour ago so he must have unpacked she picked up the kitten and began to stroke it what the devil dyou mean i mean theyve gone out together what else dammit says i furious i told her not to she went on stroking and looked at me with her crooked little smile she cant have understood you then says she or she would not have gone would she i stood staring at her feeling a chill suddenly settle on my insides what are you hinting damn you i said nothing at all it is you who are imagining do you know i believe youre jealous jealous by god and what have i to be jealous about you should know best surely i stood looking thunder at her torn between anger and fear of what she seemed to be implying now lookee here i said i want to know what the blazes youre at if you have anything to say about my wife by god youd best be careful my father came stumping into the hall at that minute curse him and calling for judy she got up and walked past me the kitten in her arms she stopped at the door gave me a crooked spiteful smile and says what were you doing in india reading singing hymns or did you occasionally go riding in the park and with that she slammed the door leaving me shot to bits with horrible thoughts growing in my mind suspicion doesnt come gradually it springs up suddenly and grows with every breath it takes if you have a foul mind as i have you think foul thoughts readier than clean ones so that even as i told myself that judy was a lying bitch trying to frighten me with implications and that elspeth was incapable of being false at the same time i had a vision of her rolling naked in a bed with her arms round watneys neck god it wasnt possible elspeth was an innocent a completely honest fool who hadnt even known what fornication meant when i first met her that hadnt stopped her bounding into the bushes with me though at the first invitation oh but it was still unthinkable she was my wife and as amiable and proper as a girl could be she was utterly different from swine like me she had to be i couldnt be as wrong in my judgement as that could i i was standing torturing myself with these happy notions and then common sense came to the rescue good god all she had done was go riding with watney why she hadnt even known who he was when i warned her against him that morning and she was the most scatterbrained thing in petticoats besides she wasnt of the mettle that trollops are made of too meek and gentle and submissive by half she wouldnt have dared the mere thought of what id do would have terrified what would i do disown her divorce her throw her out by god i couldnt i didnt have the means my father was right for a moment i was appalled if elspeth was making a mistress for watney or anyone else there was nothing i could do about it i could cut her to ribbons oh aye and what then take to the streets i couldnt stay in the army or in town even without means oh but to the devil with this it was pure moonshine aye and deliberately put into my mind to make me jealous by that brownheaded slut of my fathers this was her making mischief to get her own back for the hammering id given her three years ago that was it why i didnt have the least reason to think ill of elspeth everything about her denied judys imputations and by god id pay that cow out for her lies and sneers id find a way all right and god help her when i did with my thoughts back in more genial channels i remembered the news id been coming home to tell elspeth well she would have to wait for it until after id been to the palace serve her right for going out with watney damn him in the meantime i spent the next hour looking out my best clothes arranging my hair which was grown pretty long and romantic and cursing oswald as he helped me with my cravat id have been happier in uniform but i didnt have a decent one to my name having spent my time in mufti since i came home i was so excited that i didnt bother to lunch but dandied myself up to the nines and then hurried off to meet his noseship there was a brougham at his door when i arrived and i didnt have to wait two minutes before he came down all dressed and damning the secretary and valet who were stalking along behind him there probably isnt a damned warmingpan in the place he was barking and it is necessary that everything should be in the finest order find out if her majesty takes her own bedlinen when she travels i imagine she does but dont for gods sake go inquiring indiscreetly ask arbuthnot hell know you may be sure that something will be amiss in the end but it cant be helped ah flashman and he ran his eye over me like a drill sergeant come along then there was a little knot of urchins and people to raise a cheer as he came out and some shouted theres the flash cove hurrah by which they meant me there was a little wait after we got in because the coachman had some trouble with his reins and a little crowd gathered while the duke fretted and swore dammit johnson growls he hurry up or we shall have all london here the crowd cheered and we rolled off in the pleasant autumn sunshine with the guttersnipes running behind whooping and people turning on the pavements to lift their hats as the great duke passed by if i knew how news travelled id be a wiser man says he can you imagine it ill lay odds they know in dover by this time that i am taking you to her majesty youve never had any dealings with royalty i take it only in afghanistan my lord says i and he barked a little short laugh they probably have less ceremonial than we do he says it is a most confounded bore let me tell you sir never become a fieldmarshal and commanderinchief it is very fine but it means your sovereign will honour you by coming to stay and not a bed in the place worth a damn i have more anxiety over the furnishing of walmer mr flashman than i did over the works at torres vedras if you are as successful this time as you were then my lord says i buttering him you have no cause for alarm huh says he and gave me a sharp look but he was silent for a minute or two and then asked me if i felt nervous there is no need why you should be says he her majesty is most gracious although it is never as easy of course as it was with her predecessors king william was very easy very kind and made people entirely at home it is altogether more formal now and pretty stiff but if you stay by me and keep your mouth shut youll do i ventured to say that id felt happier at the prospect of charging into a band of ghazis than i did at going to the palace which was rubbish of course but i thought was probably the thing to say damned nonsense says he sharply you wouldnt rather anything of the sort but i know that the feeling is much the same for ive experienced both myself the important thing is never to show it as i am never tired of telling young men now tell me about these ghazis who i understand are the best soldiers the afghans can show he was on my home ground there and i told him about the ghazis and gilzais and pathans and douranis to which he listened very carefully until i realised that we were rolling through the palace gates and there were the guards presenting arms and a flunkey running to hold the door and set the steps and officers clicking to attention and a swarm of people about us come on says the duke and led the way through a small doorway and i have a hazy recollection of stairs and liveried footmen and long carpeted corridors and great chandeliers and softfooted officials escorting us but my chief memory is of the slight greycoated figure in front of me striding along and people getting out of his way we brought up outside two great double doors with a flunkey in a wig at either side and a small fat man in a black tail coat bobbed in front of us and darted forward muttering to twitch at my collar and smooth my lapel apologies he twittered a brush here and he snapped his fingers a brush appeared and he flicked at my coat very deftly and shot a glance in the dukes direction take that damned thing away says the duke and stop fussing we know how to dress without your assistance the little fat man looked reproachful and stood aside motioning to the flunkeys they opened the door and with my heart thumping against my ribs i heard a rich strong voice announce his grace the duke of wellington mr flashman it was a large magnificently furnished drawingroom with a carpet stretching away between mirrored walls and a huge chandelier overhead there were a few people at the other end two men standing near the fireplace a girl sitting on a couch with an older woman standing behind and i think another man and a couple of women near by we walked forward towards them the duke a little in advance and he stopped short of the couch and bowed your majesty says he may i have the honour to present mr flashman and only then did i realise who the girl was we are accustomed to think of her as the old queen but she was just a child then rather plump and pretty enough beneath the neck her eyes were large and popped a little and her teeth stuck out too much but she smiled and murmured in reply by this time i was bowing my backside off naturally when i straightened up she was looking at me and wellington was reciting briskly about kabul and jallalabad distinguished defence mr flashmans notable behaviour are the only phrases that stay in my mind when he stopped she inclined her head at him and then said to me you are the first we have seen of those who served so bravely in afghanistan mr flashman it is realty a great joy to see you returned safe and well we have heard the most glowing reports of your gallantry and it is most gratifying to be able to express our thanks and admiration for such brave and loyal service well she couldnt have said fairer than that i suppose even if she did recite it like a parrot i just made a rumbling sound in my throat and ducked my head again she had a thick oddlyaccented voice and came down heavy on her words every now and then nodding as she did so are you entirely recovered from your wounds she asked very well thankee your majesty says i you are exceedingly brown says one of the men and the heavy german accent startled me id noticed him out of the tail of my eye leaning against the mantel with one leg crossed over the other so this is prince albert i thought what hellishlooking whiskers you must be as brown as an affghan says he and they laughed politely i told him i had passed for one and he opened his eyes and said did i speak the language and would i say something in it so without thinking i said the first words that came into my head hamare ghali ana achha din which is what the harlots chant at passersby and means good day come into our street he seemed very interested but the man beside him stiffened and stared hard at me what does it mean mr flashman says the queen it is a hindu greeting marm says the duke and my guts turned over as i recalled that he had served in india why of course says she we are quite an indian gathering with mr macaulay here the name meant nothing to me then he was looking at me damned hard though with his pretty little mouth set hard i later learned that he had spent several years in government out there so my fatheaded remark had not been lost on him either mr macaulay has been reading us his new poems says the queen they are quite stirring and fine i think his horatius must have been your model mr flashman for you know he defied great odds in defence of rome it is a splendid ballad and very inspiring do you know the story duke he said he did which put him one up on me and added that he didnt believe it at which she cried out and demanded to know why three men cant stop an army marm says he livy was no soldier or he would hardly have suggested they could oh come now says macaulay they were on a narrow bridge and could not be outnumbered you see duke says the queen how could they be overcome bows and arrows marm says he slings shoot em down thats what id have done at this she said that the tuscans were more chivalrous than he was and he agreed that very likely they were which is perhaps why there are no tuscan empires today but an extensive british one says the prince quietly and then he leaned forward and murmured something to the queen and she nodded wisely and stood up she was very small and signed to me to come forward in front of her i went wondering and the duke came to my elbow and the prince watched me with his head on one side the lady who had been behind the couch came forward and handed something to the queen and she looked up at me from not a foot away our brave soldiers in afghanistan are to have four medals from the governorgeneral she said you will wear them in course of time but there is also a medal from their queen and it is fitting that you should wear it first of all she pinned it on my coat and she had to reach up to do it she was so small then she smiled at me and i felt so overcome i didnt know what to say seeing this she went all soulful about the eyes you are a very gallant gentleman says she god bless you oh lor i thought if only you knew you romantic little woman thinking im a modern horatius however i had to say something so i mumbled about her majestys service englands service said she looking intense the same thing maam says i flown with inspiration and she cast her eyes down wistfully the duke gave what sounded like a little groan there was a pause and then she asked if i was married i told her i was but that i and my wife had been parted for the past two years what a cruel separation says she as one might say what delicious strawberry jam but she was sure she said that our reunion must be all the sweeter for that parting i know what it means to be a devoted wife with the dearest of husbands she went on glancing at albert and he looked fond and noble god i thought what a honeymoon that must have been then the duke chimed in making his farewells and i realised that this was my cue we both bowed and backed away and she sat looking dumpy on the couch and then we were in the corridor again and the duke was striding off through the hovering attendants well says he youve got a medal no one else will ever have only a few of em struck you see and then ellenborough announced that he was giving four of his own which did not please her majesty at all so her medal is to be stopped he was right as it turned out no one else ever received the medal with its pink and green ribbon and i wear it on ceremonial days along with my victoria cross my american medal of honour my san serafino order of purity and truth and all the other assorted tinware which serves to disguise a cowardly scoundrel as a heroic veteran we passed through the covey of saluting guardsmen bowing officials and rigid flunkeys to our coach but there was no getting through the gates at first for the crowd which had collected and was cheering its head off good old flashy hurrah for flash harry hip hip hooray they clamoured at the railings waving and throwing up their hats jostling the sentries surging in a great press round the gateway until at last the gates were pushed open and the brougham moved slowly through the struggling mass all the faces grinning and shouting and the handkerchiefs waving take off your hat man snaps the duke so i did and they roared again pressing forward against the sides of the coach reaching in to clasp my hand beating on the panels and making a tremendous racket hes got a medal roars someone god save the queen at that they woke the echoes and i thought the coach must overturn i was laughing and waving to them but what do you suppose i was thinking this was real glory here was i the hero of the afghan war with the queens medal on my coat the worlds greatest soldier at my side and the people of the worlds greatest city cheering me to the echo me while the duke sat pokerfaced snapping johnson cant you get us out of this damned mess what was i thinking about the chance that had sent me to india about elphy bey about the horror of the passes on the retreat or the escape at mogala when iqbal died of the nightmare of pipers fort or that dreadful dwarf in the snakepit about sekundar burnes or bernier or the women josette narreeman fetnab and the rest about elspeth about the queen none of these things strange but as the coach won clear and we rattled off down the mall with the cheers dying behind us i could hear arnolds voice saying there is good in you flashman and i could imagine how he would have supposed himself vindicated at this moment and preach on courage in chapel and pretend to rejoice in the redeemed prodigal but all the time he would know in his hypocrite heart that i was a rotter still but neither he nor anyone else would have dared to say so this myth called bravery which is halfpanic halflunacy pays for all in england you cant be a hero and bad theres practically a law against it wellington was muttering sharply about the growing insolence of the mob but he left off to tell me he would set me down at the horse guards when we arrived and i was getting out and thanking him for his kindness he looks sharply at me and says i wish you every good fortune flashman you should go far i dont imagine youre a second marlborough mind but you appear to be brave and youre certainly damned lucky with the first quality you may easily gain command of an army or two and lead em both to ruin but with your luck youll probably lead em back again you have made a good beginning at all events and received today the highest honour you can hope for which is your monarchs mark of favour goodbye to you we shook hands and he drove off i never spoke to him again years later though i told the american general robert lee of the incident and he said wellington was right i had received the highest honour any soldier could hope for but it wasnt the medal for lees money it was wellingtons hand neither i may point out had any intrinsic value i was the object of general admiration at the horse guards of course and at the club and finally i took myself home in excellent fettle it had been raining cats and dogs but had stopped and the sun was shining as i ran up the steps oswald informed me that elspeth was above stairs oho thinks i wait till she hears where ive been and who ive seen shell be rather more attentive to her lord and master now perhaps and less to sprigs of guardees i was smiling as i went upstairs for the events of the afternoon had made my earlier jealousy seem silly and simply the work of the little bitch judy i walked into the bedroom keeping my left hand over the medal to surprise her she was sitting before her glass as usual with her maid dressing her hair harry she cries out where have you been have you forgot we are to take tea with lady chalmers at fourthirty the devil with lady chalmers and all chalmerses says i let em wait oh how can you say so she laughed at me in the mirror but where have you been looking so splendid oh visiting friends you know young couple bert and vicky you wouldnt know em bert and vicky if elspeth had developed a fault in my long absence it was that she had become a complete snob not uncommon among people of her class whoever are they i stood behind her looking at her reflection and exposed the medal i saw her eyes light on it and widen and then she swung round harry what ive been to the palace with the duke of wellington i had this from the queen after we had chatted a little you know about poetry and the queen she squeals the duke the palace and she leaped up clapping her hands throwing her arms round my neck while her maid clucked and fussed and i laughing swung her round and kissed her there was no shutting her up of course she rained questions on me her eyes shining demanding to know who was there and what they said and what the queen wore and how the queen spoke to me and what i replied and every mortal thing finally i pushed her into a chair sent the maid packing and sat down on the bed reciting the whole thing from start to finish elspeth sat roundeyed and lovely listening breathlessly and squealing with excitement every now and then when i told her the queen had asked about her she gasped and turned to look at herself in the mirror i imagine to see if there was a smut on her nose then she demanded that i go through it all again and i did but not before i had stripped off her gown and pulled her on top of me on the bed so that between gasps and sighs the breathtaking tale was retold i lost track of it several times i admit even then she was still marvelling at it all until i pointed out that it was after four oclock and what would lady chalmers say she giggled and said we had better go and chattered incessantly while she dressed and i lazily put myself in order oh it is the most wonderful thing she kept saying the queen the duke oh harry aye says i and where were you eh sparking in the row all afternoon with one of your admirers oh he is the greatest bore says she laughing nothing to talk of but his horses we spent the entire afternoon riding in the park and he spoke of nothing else for two hours on end did he begad says i why you must have been soaked she was in a cupboard by now among her dresses and didnt hear and idly i reached out not thinking and touched the bottlegreen riding coat that lay across the end of the bed i felt it and my heart suddenly turned to stone the coat was bonedry i twisted round to look at the boots standing by a chair they shone glossy with not a mark or a splash on them i sat feeling sick listening to my heart thumping while she chattered away it had rained steadily from the time i had left wellington at the horse guards until i had left the club more than an hour later and come home she could not have been riding in the park in that downpour well where the devil had she and watney been then and what i felt rage mounting inside me rage and spite but i held myself in telling myself i might be wrong she was patting her face with a rabbits foot before the glass never minding me so i said very easy like whereabouts did you go for your ride oh in the park as i said nowhere at all in particular now thats a lie for certain thinks i and yet i couldnt believe it she looked so damned innocent and open so featherheaded and full of nonsense as she went on and on about my wonderful wonderful hour at the palace why only ten minutes ago she had been coupling with me on the bed letting me aye letting me suddenly the ugly thought of the first night home came rushing back to me how i had fancied she was less ardent than i remembered her perhaps i had been right perhaps she had been less passionate well she might be if in my absence she had found some jockey who was more to her fancy over the jumps than i was by god if that were true i would i sat there shaking my head turned away so that she would not see me in the mirror had that slut judy been hinting at the truth then was watney cuckolding me and heaven knew who else besides him i was fairly boiling with shame and anger at the thought but it couldnt be true no not elspeth and yet there was judys sneer and those boots winking their wickedness at me they hadnt been near the park this afternoon by god while the maid came back and attended to elspeths hair again and i tried to close my ears to the shrill feminine trilling of her talk i tried to take hold of myself maybe i was wrong oh god i hoped so it wasnt just that strange yearning that i had about elspeth it was my well my honour if you like oh i didnt give a damn about what the world calls honour but the thought of another man or men frollicking in the hay with my wife who should have been unable to imagine a more masterful or heroic lover than the great flashman the hero whose name was on everyones lips god help us the thought of that pride is a hellish thing without it there isnt any jealousy or ambition and i was proud of the figure i cut in bed and in barracks and here was i the lion of the hour medal and all the dukes handshake and the queens regard still fresh and i was gnawing my innards out about a goldheaded filly without a brain to her name and i must bite my lip and not say a word for fear of the row there would be if i let slip a breath of my suspicions right or wrong the fat would be in the fire and i couldnt afford that well how do i look says she coming to stand in front of me in her gown and bonnet why harry you have gone quite pale i know it is the excitement of this day my poor dear and she tilted up my head and kissed me no i couldnt believe it looking into those babyblue eyes aye and what about those babyblack boots we shall go out to lady chalmerss said she and she will be quite over the moon when she hears about this i expect there will be quite a company there too i shall be so proud harry so proud now let me straighten your cravat bring a brush susan what an excellent coat it is you must always go to that tailor which is he again there now oh harry how handsome you look see yourself in the glass i looked and seeing myself so damned dashing and her radiant and fair beside me i fought down the wretchedness and rage no it couldnt be true susan you have not put away my coat silly girl take it at once before it creases by god though i knew it was or i thought i knew to the devil with the consequences no little ninny in petticoats was going to do this to me elspeth says i turning hang it carefully now when youve brushed it there yes my love elspeth oh harry you look so strong and fierce on my word i dont think i shall feel easy in my mind when i see all these fancy london ladies making eyes at you and she pouted very pretty and touched her finger on my lips elspeth i oh i had nearly forgot you had better take some money with you susan bring me my purse in case of any need that may arise you know twenty guineas my love much obliged says i what the devil you have to make do as best you can if the tides there swim with it and catch on to whatever offers you only go by once will twenty be sufficient do you think better make it forty notes lord broughams speech in may lashed the queen with unsparing severity and caused great controversy lady flora hastings maid of honour to the duchess of kent was believed to be pregnant until medical examination proved that she was not she won great popular sympathy but the young queen who had been bitterly hostile towards her suffered dramatically in public esteem captain john reynolds a particular butt of cardigans was the centre of the notorious black bottle affair in which his resignation was demanded because he was believed to have ordered a bottle of porter in the mess on guest night back cardigan had in fact served in india when he went out to take command of the th at cawnpore in but had spent only a few weeks with the regiment cardigan was a favourite target of the newspapers and especially of the morning chronicle the quarrel referred to here is probably the one in which cardigan in response to a press attack threatened to assault the editor for details of this and other incidents and of lord cardigans military career sec cecil woodhamsmiths the reason why choice of weapons in fact this did not necessarily rest with the injured party but was normally settled by mutual agreement mr attwood mp presented the chartists first petition for political reform to the commons in july in that year there were outbreaks of chartist violence on november people were killed at newport mr abercrombies use of the word chief is inexplicable since sir colin campbells command of the rd came much later of course abercrombie may have served with him in spain military service with the east india companys regiments was considered socially inferior to service in the army proper and flashman must have been conscious of this which possibly accounts for his casual reference to it the company at this time drew its artillery engineer and infantry officers from the addiscombe training establishment cavalry officers however could be appointed direct by the companys directors cardigan who seems to have had a liking for flashman may well have had influence with the board the company did not believe in maintaining houses for transients and visitors they were expected to find hospitality with british residents or pay their own lodgings avitabile flashmans description of this extraordinary soldier of fortune is accurate the italian was noted as a stern just administrator and intrepid soldier cotton was the ringleader of the great rugby school mutiny of in which the door of the headmaster dr ingles was blown in with gunpowder poor army swords the sabres issued to british cavalry at this time were notorious for their greasy brass hilts which turned in the hand flashmans account of burness murder clears up a point which has troubled historians previous versions suggest that the burnes brothers left the residency in disguise accompanied by a mysterious third party who has been described as a kashmiri musselman it has been alleged that this third man actually denounced them to the ghazis but flashman could hardly have betrayed them without considerable risk to himself so his account is probably the true one the actual names of these two afghans remain a mystery other accounts call them muhammed sadeq and surwar khan but lady sale seems to suggest that one of them was sultan jan lieutenantgeneral colin mackenzie has left one of the most vivid accounts of the first afghan war in storms and sunshine of a soldiers life flashman like many other european writers uses the word ghazi as though it referred to a tribe although he certainly knew better in arabic ghazi is literally a conqueror but may be accurately translated as hero or champion europeans usually render it as fanatic in which connection it is interesting to note the parallel between the moslem ghazis and the christian medieval ideal of knighthood the ghazi sect were dedicated to the militant expansion of islam flashmans account of the retreat tallies substantially with those of such contemporaries as mackenzie lady sale and lieutenant eyre this is also true of his version of affairs in afghanistan generally his description of mcnaghtens murder for example is the fullest and most personal to survive there are omissions and discrepancies here and there he does not mention gentleman jim skinners part in the liaison work with akbar khan for instance but on the whole he can be regarded as highly reliable within his selfcentred limits readers seeking wider and more authoritative accounts are recommended to the standard works which include kayes history of the war in afghanistan vol ii fortuscues history of the british army vol xii and patrick macrorys admirably clear account signal catastrophe the united front of officers took place at jugdulluk on january in fact some prisoners were taken by the afghans at gandamack including captain souter of the th regiment one of two men who wrapped the battalion colours round their bodies the picture to which flashman refers is by w b wollen ra hung at the royal academy in flashman may be excused an overstatement here possibly sergeant hudson was a fine swordsman but this was not usual in the british cavalry fortescue in his passage on the charge of the heavy brigade at balaclava refers to the troopers habit of using their sabres as bludgeons it was not uncommon for a man to use his sabrehilt as a knuckleduster instead of cutting or thrusting major henry havelock later famous as the hero of lucknow the stern cromwellian soldier became one of the great figures of the indian empire sale was indeed hailed as a celebrity but returned to india and was killed at mudki in fighting the sikhs sheltons adventurous career ended when he fell from his horse on parade at dublin and was killed lawrence and mackenzie both achieved general rank flashman saw ellenborough at his worst arrogant theatrical and given to flights of rhetoric the governorgeneral went to extravagant lengths to honour the heroes of afghanistan and was widely ridiculed but in the main he was an able and energetic administrator punch began publication in the pencillings were its first fullpage cartoons the opium war in china had ended with a treaty whereby hong kong was ceded to britain the dukes reference to

queens disposal and she visited it in the following month macaulays lays of ancient rome was first published on october the queens medal that her majesty was piqued at lord ellenboroughs decision to
