 chapter one dr sheppard at the breakfast table mrs ferrars died on the night of the th september a thursday i was sent for at eight oclock on friday morning and a few minutes after nine i reached home again is that you james my sister caroline called come and get your breakfast i walked into the diningroom youve had an early call yes i said kings paddock mrs ferrars i know annie told me annie is our maid well my sister demanded a sad business she must have died in her sleep i know said my sister again i didnt know myself until i got there if annie knows it was the milkman who told me the ferrars cook told him what did she die of she died of an overdose of veronal shes been taking it for sleeplessness she must have taken too much no said caroline she took it on purpose i told you she poisoned her husband and ever since shes been haunted by what she did i told caroline that her whole idea was nonsense nonsense said caroline im sure shes left a letter confessing everything she didnt leave a letter i said sharply oh said caroline so you did inquire about that did you chapter two whos who in kings abbot there are only two houses of any importance in kings abbot one is kings paddock left to mrs ferrars by her husband the other fernly park is owned by roger ackroyd an extremely successful businessman of nearly fifty years of age he gives generously to village activities though he is said to be extremely mean in personal spending when he was just twentyone ackroyd married a beautiful widow mrs paton who had one child ralph sadly mrs ackroyd was an alcoholic and drank herself to death ralph now twentyfive has been a continual source of trouble to ackroyd however we are all very fond of ralph in kings abbot after her husbands death ackroyd and mrs ferrars were always seen together and it was thought that at the end of a period of mourning mrs ferrars would become mrs roger ackroyd the ferrarses only came to live here just over a year ago before that the whole village had confidently expected ackroyd to marry his housekeeper miss russell at the same time his widowed sisterinlaw mrs cecil ackroyd with her daughter came to stay with ackroyd and she certainly disapproved of him marrying his housekeeper i went on my round my thoughts returning to mrs ferrars death i had last seen her only yesterday walking with ralph paton i had been very surprised to see him he and his stepfather had argued very badly six months ago and he hadnt been seen in kings abbot since i was still thinking of it when i came face to face with roger ackroyd himself sheppard he exclaimed this is a terrible business ive got to talk to you can you come back with me now no ive got patients to visit still and surgery then come for dinner tonight at i damn heres old miss gannett coming i dont want to have to talk to her see you tonight sheppard miss gannett was full of gossip wasnt it sad about poor dear mrs ferrars people were saying she had been a drug addict i went home thoughtful to find several patients waiting for me to begin surgery chapter three the man who grew vegetable marrows i told caroline at lunch that i would be dining at fernly excellent she said youll hear all about it by the way why is ralph staying at the three boars pub he arrived yesterday morning and last night he went out to meet a girl i dont know who she is it must have been very hard for caroline to have to admit that she didnt know but i can guess continued my sister his cousin flora ackroyd is of course no relation really to ralph paton they are secretly engaged ackroyd disapproves and they have to meet secretly i began to talk about our new neighbour which stopped caroline saying more about her romantic theory the house next door the larches has recently been rented by a stranger to carolines annoyance she has not been able to find out anything about him except that his name is mr porrott he is a foreigner and he is interested in growing vegetable marrows that is not the sort of information caroline wants she wants to know where he comes from what he does whether he is married and so on my dear caroline i said theres no doubt that the man is a retired hairdresser look at that moustache of his i escaped into the garden i was digging up weeds when a heavy object flew past my ears and fell at my feet it was a marrow over the wall there appeared an eggshaped head partly covered with suspiciously black hair a huge moustache and a pair of green eyes it was the mysterious mr porrott a thousand pardons monsieur for some months now i grow the marrows this morning i become angry with them i seize one i throw him over the wall monsieur i am ashamed do not worry it is not a habit with me but monsieur do you not think that a man may work to reach a peaceful retirement and then find that after all he wants the old busy days back and the occupation that he thought he was so glad to leave yes i said thinking how strangely he spoke english i know that feeling well i have always wanted to travel to see the world a year ago i inherited some money enough to allow me to realize a dream yet i am still here my little neighbour nodded habits are very hard to break and monsieur my work was the most interesting work there is in the world the study of human nature clearly a retired hairdresser who knows the secrets of human nature better than a hairdresser also i had a friend who for many years never left my side occasionally he behaved stupidly enough to make me afraid but his honest opinions the pleasure of delighting and surprising him by my greater intelligence i miss these things more than i can tell you he died not so he lives now in the argentine in the argentine i said jealously mr porrott looked at me sympathetically you will go there yes he asked i shook my head with a sigh i could have gone a year ago but i was foolish and speculated not those new oilfields he asked i thought about them but in the end i chose a gold mine in western australia my neighbour was regarding me with a strange expression it is fate that i should live next to a man who would seriously consider investing in oilfields and gold mines and you are a doctor a man who knows the stupidity of most things well well we are neighbors please you must give your excellent sister my best marrow he bent down picked up a huge marrow and gave it to me indeed said the little man cheerfully this has not been a wasted morning i have met a man who in some ways resembles my old friend by the way you must know everyone in this village who is the young man with the very dark hair and eyes and the handsome face captain ralph paton i said he is the stepson of mr ackroyd of fernly park i should have guessed mr ackroyd spoke of him many times you know mr ackroyd i asked surprised mr ackroyd knew me in london when i worked there i have asked him to say nothing of my profession down here i have not even tried to correct the way the local people pronounce my name so captain ralph paton and he is engaged to the beautiful miss flora who told you so mr ackroyd he put some pressure on the young man that is never wise a young man should marry to please himself not to please a stepfather even though he expects to inherit a great deal of money from him i was confused i could not imagine ackroyd discussing the marriage with a hairdresser at that moment my sister called me from the house i went in caroline had just come back from the village she began talking immediately i met mr ackroyd and i asked him about ralph he was astonished he had no idea the boy was down here then he went on to tell me that ralph and flora are engaged and i told him that ralph was staying at the three boars caroline i said do you never think that you might do harm by repeating everything you hear nonsense people should know things i think mr ackroyd went straight to the three boars but if so he didnt find ralph there because as i was coming through the woods coming through the woods i interrupted it was such a lovely day the autumn colours are so perfect at this time of year caroline does not like woods at any time of year but our local woods are the only place where you can talk with a young woman unseen by the whole village anyway i heard voices one was ralph patons the other was a girls she said something i didnt hear and ralph answered very angrily my dear girl he said the old man will disinherit me which means ill be very very poor if he doesnt i will be a very very rich man when he dies so i dont want him to change his will you leave it to me and dont worry unfortunately just then i stepped on a piece of wood which broke and made a noise and they moved away so i wasnt able to see who the girl was who could it have been i made an excuse about a patient and went out but i went straight to the three boars ralph had not inherited his mothers addiction to alcohol but he was selfindulgent and extravagant nevertheless his friends were all devoted to him at the three boars i was told that captain paton had just come in i went up to his room why its sheppard the one person i am glad to see in this place have a drink wont you thanks i said i will he pressed the bell then sat down with a sigh im in a complete mess i just dont know what to do next its my stepfather what has he done it isnt what hes done but what hes likely to do if i could help i suggested he shook his head its good of you doctor but ive got to do this on my own chapter four dinner at fernly as parker the fernly park butler took my coat ackroyds secretary a pleasant young man called geoffrey raymond passed through the hall on his way to ackroyds study with his hands full of business documents good evening doctor coming to dine or is this a professional call this referred to my black bag which i had put down on the oak table i explained that i expected to be called to deliver a baby at any moment raymond went on his way saying go into the drawing room ill tell mr ackroyd youre here i noticed just as i was turning the handle of the drawingroom door a sound from inside like the shutting down of a sash window as i walked in miss russell ackroyds housekeeper was just coming out what a goodlooking woman she was im afraid im early i said oh i dont think so its gone halfpast seven dr sheppard but i must be going i only came in to see if the flowers were all right she went and i saw of course what i had forgotten that the windows were long french ones opening on the terrace so that could not have been the sound i heard i noticed the silver table which displays silver and other valuable items its glass top lifts and inside as i knew from other visits were one or two pieces of old silver a baby shoe which had belonged to king charles i and a number of african pieces wanting to examine one of the figures more closely i lifted the lid it slipped through my fingers and fell the sound i had heard was this lid being shut down i was still bending over the silver table when flora ackroyd came in nobody can help admiring her she has pale gold hair her eyes are the deepest blue and her skin is the color of cream and roses congratulate me dr sheppard said flora she held out her left hand on the third finger was a beautiful single pearl ring im going to marry ralph uncle is very pleased i took both her hands in mine my dear i said i hope youll be very happy weve been engaged for about a month continued flora but it was only announced yesterday uncle is going to do up crossstones and give it to us to live in and were going to pretend to farm really we shall hunt all the winter and go to london for the season just then the widowed mrs cecil ackroyd came in i am sorry to say i cannot stand mrs ackroyd she is all teeth and bones with small pale blue eyes and however friendly her words may be her eyes always remain coldly calculating had i heard about floras engagement she wondered mrs ackroyd was interrupted as the drawingroom door opened once more you know major blunt dont you doctor yes indeed hector blunt has shot more wild animals in africa and india than any man living and every two years he spends a fortnight at fernly a man of medium height and wellbuilt blunts face is deeply suntanned and strangely expressionless he is not a man who talks a lot he said now how are you sheppard and then stood in front of the fireplace looking over our heads as though he saw something very interesting happening in the far distance major blunt said flora could you tell me about these african things im sure you know what they all are blunt joined flora at the silver table and they bent over it together dinner was not a cheerful affair ackroyd ate almost nothing and immediately after dinner he took me to his study once weve had coffee we wont be disturbed again he explained i told raymond to make sure we wont be interrupted as parker entered with the coffee tray ackroyd sat down in an armchair in front of the fire that pain i was getting after eating its back again he said you must give me some more of those tablets i realized that he wanted to pretend to parker that our discussion was a medical one i cooperated i brought some with me theyre in my bag in the hall so ill go and get them dont go yourself parker bring in the doctors bag will you very good sir parker went out as i was about to speak ackroyd raised his hand dont say anything yet and make certain that windows closed will you i got up and went to it it was an ordinary sash window the heavy blue curtains were closed but the window itself was open at the top parker reentered with my bag while i was still at the window thats done i said as the door closed behind parker whats the matter with you ackroyd im in mental agony he said yesterday mrs ferrars told me she poisoned her husband i want your advice i dont know what to do why did mrs ferrars tell you this three months ago i asked her to marry me she said yes but that i couldnt announce it until her year of mourning was over yesterday i pointed out that a year and three weeks had now passed since her husbands death i had noticed that she had been behaving strangely for some days she she told me everything her hatred of her brutal husband her growing love for me and the the terrible thing she had done poison my goodness it was murder in cold blood i saw the horror in ackroyds face just as mrs ferrars must have seen it but sheppard it seems that someone knew about the murder and has been blackmailing her for huge sums of money the strain of that drove her nearly mad who was the man she wouldnt tell me said ackroyd slowly she didnt actually say that it was a man but of course i agreed it must have been a man and youve no suspicion at all something she said made me think that the blackmailer might be among my household but i must have misunderstood her what did you say to her i asked what could i say by telling me she made me as guilty as herself unless i reported her to the police she made me promise to do nothing for twentyfour hours i swear to you sheppard that it never entered my head what she was going to do suicide and i drove her to it she saw the awful shock on my face the horror of what shed done but what am i to do now the poor lady is dead why bring up past trouble but how am i to get hold of that scoundrel who blackmailed her to her death i see i said the person ought to be punished but the cost must be understood her reputation ruined suspicion that you really might have been her accomplice look here sheppard suppose we leave it like this if no word comes from her after twentyfour hours we wont say anything what do you mean by word coming from her i asked curiously i have the strongest impression that she left a message for me and ive got a feeling that by choosing death she wanted the whole thing to come out if only to get revenge on the man who made her desperate the door opened and the butler parker entered carrying some letters on a silver tray the evening post sir ackroyd took the letters off the tray then parker collected the coffee cups and left quietly ackroyd was staring at a long blue envelope like a man turned to stone her writing she must have posted it last night just before before he tore open the envelope and pulled out a thick letter then he looked up sharply youre sure you shut the window quite sure im full of nerves murmured ackroyd to himself he unfolded the thick sheets of paper and read in a low voice my very dear roger i killed ashley and now i must die to pay for that i saw the horror in your face this afternoon so i am taking the only road open to me i leave to you the punishment of the blackmailer who has made my life unbearable i could not tell you the name this afternoon but i propose to write it to you now if you can my very dear roger forgive me ackroyd paused sheppard im sorry but i must read this alone he said unsteadily he put the letter in the envelope and laid it on the table later when i am alone for some reason i tried to persuade him at least read the name of the blackmailer i said he refused the letter had been brought in at twenty minutes to nine it was ten minutes to nine when i left him the letter still unread i hesitated with my hand on the door handle looking back and wondering if there was anything i had left undone i could think of nothing as i closed the door behind me i was surprised to see parker nearby it occurred to me that he might have been listening at the door mr ackroyd does not want to be disturbed i said coldly he told me to tell you so the village church clock rang nine oclock as i passed by the gatekeepers cottage at the end of the drive and ten minutes later i was at home once more it was a quarter past ten when the telephone rang i picked it up what i said what ill come at once i called to caroline that was parker telephoning from fernly theyve just found roger ackroyd murdered chapter five murder i heard the noise of the door chain at fernly park and then parker stood in the open doorway where is he i demanded have you telephoned the police the police sir parker stared at me whats the matter with you parker if your master has been murdered the master murdered impossible sir didnt you telephone me not five minutes ago and tell me that mr ackroyd had been found murdered me oh no indeed sir ill give you the exact words i heard is that dr sheppard parker speaking will you please come at once sir mr ackroyd has been murdered a wicked joke to play sir parker said in a shocked voice where is mr ackroyd i asked still in the study sir the ladies have gone to bed and major blunt and mr raymond are in the billiard room i think ill just look in and see him i said i passed through the door on the right of the main hall into the small inner hall which led to ackroyds study a small flight of stairs to the left went up to his bedroom i tapped on the study door there was no answer and the door was locked allow me sir said parker who had followed me he dropped on one knee and looked through the keyhole the key is in the lock sir he said rising mr ackroyd must have locked himself in and fallen asleep i shook the handle and called out ackroyd ackroyd its sheppard let me in and still silence i picked up a heavy oak chair and hit the door with it at the third blow the lock broke ackroyd was sitting as i had left him in the armchair in front of the fire his head had fallen sideways and just below the collar of his jacket was a shining piece of metal stabbed from behind parker murmured horrible he stretched out a hand towards the handle of the dagger you mustnt touch that i said sharply go and telephone the police then tell mr raymond and major blunt to come to the study very good sir when our local inspector a man called davis and police constable jones arrived ackroyds secretary geoffrey raymond and blunt were in the study with me good evening gentlemen said inspector davis now then who found the body i explained the circumstances did it sound like parkers voice on the telephone doctor well i didnt really notice i just assumed it was him how long would you say mr ackroyd has been dead doctor half an hour at least the door was locked on the inside what about the window i closed and bolted it earlier in the evening at mr ackroyds request the inspector walked across and opened the curtains well its open now true the lower sash was raised as high as it could go davis produced a torch and shone it along the windowsill outside this is the way he went all right and got in in the light of the torch several footprints could be seen are there any valuables missing geoffrey raymond shook his head not that we can discover i said nothing but the blue envelope containing mrs ferrars letter had disappeared hmm said the inspector he turned to the butler have any suspicious strangers been hanging about no sir when was mr ackroyd last seen alive probably by me i said when i left at about ten minutes to nine he told me that he didnt wish to be disturbed and i repeated the order to parker mr ackroyd was alive at halfpast nine raymond added i heard him talking in here who to i assumed that it was dr sheppard i wanted to ask him about some papers i was working on however when i heard the voices i remembered he wanted to talk to dr sheppard without being disturbed and i went away again who could have been with him at halfpast nine queried the inspector it wasnt you mr er major blunt i said major hector blunt asked the inspector with a respectful tone in his voice blunt nodded i didnt see him after dinner the inspector turned once more to raymond didnt you hear what mr ackroyd was saying sir only a few words mr ackroyd was saying there have been so many demands on my financial resources recently that i cannot agree to your request i did not hear any more a demand for money said the inspector thoughtfully and it seems almost certain that mr ackroyd himself must have let this stranger in one things clear mr ackroyd was alive and well at ninethirty that is the last moment we know he was alive if youll excuse me parker said miss flora saw him at about a quarter to ten i was bringing a tray with whisky and soda when miss flora who was just coming out of this room stopped me and said her uncle didnt want to be disturbed youd already been told that mr ackroyd didnt want to be disturbed hadnt you yes sir but i always bring the drinks tray about that time sir parker was shaking his reaction looked more like guilt than shock hmm said the inspector i must see miss ackroyd at once for the moment well leave this room as it is i will just close and lock the window he then led the way into the small hall and we followed him constable jones stay here dont let anyone go into that room if youll excuse me sir said parker if you lock the door into the main hall nobody can get into this part of the house the inspector then locked the hall door behind him and gave the constable some instructions in a low voice we must get busy on those footprints explained the inspector but first of all miss ackroyd does she know about the murder yet raymond shook his head well she can answer my questions better without being upset by knowing about the murder tell her theres been a burglary and ask her to come down and answer a few questions in less than five minutes flora came down the main staircase and the inspector stepped forward good evening miss ackroyd were afraid theres been an attempt at burglary and we want you to help us come into the billiard room and sit down now miss ackroyd parker here says you came out of your uncles study at about a quarter to ten is that right quite right i had been to say goodnight to him was there anyone with your uncle he was alone did you happen to notice whether the window was open or shut flora shook her head i cant say the curtains were closed do you mind telling us exactly what happened i went in and said goodnight uncle im going to bed now i kissed him and he said tell parker i dont want anything more tonight and that hes not to disturb me i met parker just outside the door and gave him uncles message can you tell me what has been stolen were not quite certain said the inspector the girl stood up youre hiding something from me hector blunt came between her and the inspector she half stretched out her hand and as he took it she turned to him as though he promised safety its bad news flora he said quietly poor rogers dead when she whispered very soon after you left him im afraid said blunt flora gave a little cry and fainted blunt and i carried her upstairs and laid her on her bed then i got him to wake mrs ackroyd and tell her the news chapter six the tunisian dagger i met the inspector coming from the kitchen do you mind coming into the study with me doctor inspector davis unlocked the hall door and locked it again behind him we dont want anyone to hear us whats all this about blackmail is it parkers imagination or is there something in it if parker heard anything about blackmail he must have been listening outside this door i replied thats very likely i didnt like his manner and when i questioned him again he told me some story of blackmail i told him the events of the evening most extraordinary story davis said when i had finished and you say you couldnt see that letter on the study table when you found ackroyd well it gives us a motive for the murder do you think that parker himself might be the man were after it looks likely but keep it quiet until weve got all the evidence he crossed over to ackroyds body in the armchair the weapon ought to give us a clue he pulled the dagger out carefully from ackroyd and put it in an empty flower vase on the mantelpiece quite a work of art it was indeed a beautiful object a narrow blade and a beautifully decorated handle take a look at the handle fingerprints i want to see if mr raymond can tell us anything about this dagger we went back to the billiard room where the inspector held up the dagger still in the vase have you ever seen this before mr raymond why thats the tunisian dagger it was given to mr ackroyd by major blunt where was this kept in the silver table in the drawingroom what i exclaimed when i arrived last night i heard the lid of the table being shut i explained in detail was the dagger there when you were looking at the table the inspector asked i dont remember noticing it wed better ask the housekeeper remarked the inspector a few minutes later miss russell entered the room oh yes the silver table was open she said when the inspector had put his question i shut the lid as i passed can you tell me if this dagger was in its place then i cant say she replied thank you said the inspector miss russell left the room let me see said the inspector this silver table is in front of one of the french windows and the windows were open well somebody could get that dagger any time he liked ill be coming back in the morning with the chief constable colonel melrose until then ill keep the key of that door i want the chief constable to see everything exactly as it is when i got back caroline extracted the whole history of the evening from me though i said nothing of the blackmail the police suspect parker i said parker said my sister that inspector must be a complete fool parker indeed with these mysterious words we went up to bed chapter seven i learn my neighbours profession the following morning flora ackroyd came to our house dr sheppard i want you to come to the larches with me to see that funny little man exclaimed caroline yes he is hercule poirot the famous private detective uncle promised not to tell anyone because monsieur poirot wanted to live quietly flora i said seriously i advise you not to involve this detective in the case i know why you say that she cried youre afraid but ralph wouldnt murder anyone no no i exclaimed i never thought he could kill anyone then why did you go to the three boars last night after uncles body was found how did you know about that i heard from the servants that ralph was staying there so i went this morning the people there told me that he went out at about nine oclock yesterday evening and that later you came to see him and went up to his room to see if he was in this morning they discovered that his bed hadnt been slept in her eyes met mine there must be a simple explanation well he wasnt in his room when i got there so i came home but i know the police dont suspect ralph they do suspect him a man from cranchester arrived this morning inspector raglan he had been to the three boars before me the barman told me all about the questions he asked he must think ralph did it oh dr sheppard let us go at once to monsieur poirot he will find out the truth monsieur le docteur monsieur poirot said mademoiselle he bowed to flora i have heard of the tragedy which has occurred and i offer all my sympathy in what way can i serve you find the murderer said flora i see said the little man but if i go into this i will go through with it to the end you may wish that you had left it to the police i want the truth said flora looking him straight in the eyes then i accept said the little man quietly now tell me all dr sheppard should tell you said flora he knows more than i do poirot listened carefully you went to this inn last night now why was that i chose my words carefully i thought someone ought to inform the young man of his stepfathers death poirot nodded and suggested a visit to the local police he thought it better for flora to return home and for me to accompany him at the police station we found inspector davis the chief constable colonel melrose and inspector raglan i introduced poirot to them and explained the situation the case is clear said raglan no need for amateurs it was poirot who saved the embarrassing situation i have retired he said and i hate publicity i must ask that if i help solve the mystery my name should not be mentioned if inspector raglan permits me to assist him i will be honoured raglan was obviously pleased with this well well said colonel melrose we must tell you the latest developments monsieur poirot i thank you said poirot dr sheppard said something about the butler being suspected nonsense said raglan these highclass servants get into such a panic with things like this that they act suspiciously for no reason at all the fingerprints i hinted nothing like parkers and yours and mr raymonds dont fit either doctor we had given our fingerprints to davis last night what about those of captain paton asked poirot were going to take that young gentlemans fingerprints as soon as we find him what have you got against him i asked he went out just on nine oclock last night he was seen near fernly park about ninethirty and he hasnt been seen since hes believed to be in serious money difficulties ive got a pair of his shoes here he had two pairs almost exactly the same im going up now to compare them with those footprints we all drove up to fernly in the colonels car would you like to go with the inspector monsieur poirot asked the chief constable or would you prefer to examine the study poirot chose the study and melrose took us in the body had been taken away but otherwise the room was exactly as it had been last night the letter in the blue envelope doctor where was it when you left the room poirot asked mr ackroyd had put it down on this little table on his right poirot nodded colonel melrose would you sit down in this chair a minute i thank you now monsieur le docteur will you point out the exact position of the dagger did so whilst the little man stood in the doorway so the handle of the dagger was clearly visible from the door then yes poirot went to the window the electric light was on of course when you discovered the body i agreed and he came to the middle of the room are you a man of good observation dr sheppard i think so there was a fire burning in the fireplace when you broke the door down and found mr ackroyd dead how was the fire was it low i i really cant say the little man shook his head i made a mistake in asking you that question you could tell me the details of the patients appearance nothing there would escape you if i wanted information about the papers on that desk mr raymond would have noticed anything there was to see to find out about the fire i must ask the man whose business it is to observe such things he moved swiftly to the wall and rang the servants bell after a minute or two parker appeared parker said poirot when you found your master dead what was the state of the fire it was almost out ah and is this room exactly as it was then the butler looked round the room the curtains were closed sir and the electric light was on this chair was a little more forward he indicated a highbacked chair to the left of the door between it and the window show me said poirot the butler pulled the chair out two feet from the wall turning it so that the seat faced the door now who pushed it back into its place again did you no sir said parker but it was back in position when i arrived with the police sir im sure of that raymond or blunt must have pushed it back i suggested surely it isnt important it is completely unimportant said poirot that is why it is so interesting excuse me a minute said colonel melrose he left the room with parker i wish youd tell me something of your methods i said to poirot the point about the fire for instance oh that was simple you left mr ackroyd at ten minutes to nine the window was closed and bolted and the door unlocked at a quarter past ten when the body was discovered the door was locked and the window was open who opened it clearly only mr ackroyd himself could have done so either because the room became unbearably hot but since the fire was nearly out that cannot be the reason or because he let someone in that way and if he did it must have been someone well known to him since he had previously been nervous about that same window it sounds very simple i said everything is simple if you arrange the facts methodically ah here is the colonel that telephone call has been traced the colonel said it was put through to dr sheppard at last night from a public call box at kings abbot railway station and at the night mail train leaves for liverpool chapter eight inspector raglan is confident you will be making inquiries at the station i asked naturally but you know what that station is like replied colonel melrose i did kings abbots station is an important one where different railway lines meet it has two public telephone boxes at that time of night three local trains come in to deliver passengers to the express for liverpool which comes in at and leaves at the chances of someone being noticed telephoning or getting on to the express are very small indeed but why telephone at all demanded melrose there seems no reason be sure there was a reason poirot said and when we know that we will know everything we should find out if mr ackroyd had been visited by any strangers during the past week colonel melrose went in search of raymond and i rang the bell for parker when geoffrey raymond came in he seemed delighted to meet poirot it will be a great privilege to watch you at work he said then hello whats this poirot had moved aside and i saw that while my back had been turned he had pulled out the armchair so that it stood in the position parker had indicated monsieur raymond this chair was pulled out like this last night when mr ackroyd was found killed someone moved it back into its place did you move it back no i dont even remember that it was in that position it is of no importance said the detective as parker came in what i really want to ask you is this did any stranger come to see mr ackroyd during this past week no said raymond i cant remember anyone can you parker there was the young man who came on wednesday sir he said from curtis and trout i understood he was oh that is not the kind of stranger this gentleman means raymond turned to poirot mr ackroyd had some idea of buying a dictaphone the firm sent down their salesman but mr ackroyd did not buy the butler spoke to raymond mr hammond has just arrived sir ill come at once said the young man poirot looked inquiringly at the chief constable mr hammond is the family lawyer monsieur poirot poirot nodded could you please show me the table from which the dagger was taken we went to the drawing room but on the way constable jones waylaid colonel melrose who went with him i showed poirot the silver table and after raising the lid once and letting it fall he pushed open the window and stepped out onto the terrace i followed him inspector raglan had just come round the corner of the house well monsieur poirot this isnt going to be much of a case im sorry too because i like ralph paton a nice young fellow gone wrong you have worked so quickly poirot observed how exactly did you reach this conclusion if i may ask to begin with method thats what i always say method first mr ackroyd was last seen alive at a quarter to ten by miss flora at halfpast ten the doctor says that mr ackroyd had been dead at least half an hour that gives us exactly a quarter of an hour in which the crime was committed i made a list of everyone in the house and worked through it setting down opposite their names where they were and what they were doing between and pm he handed a sheet of paper to poirot i read it over his shoulder major blunt in billiard room with mr raymond major blunt confirms this mr raymond billiard room see above mrs ackroyd watching billiard match went up to bed miss ackroyd went straight upstairs from her uncles room confirmed by parker also housemaid elsie dale servants parker went straight to butlers pantry confirmed by housekeeper miss russell miss russell as above spoke to housemaid elsie dale upstairs at ursula bourne parlourmaid in her own room until then in servants hall mrs cooper cook in servants hall gladys jones second housemaid in servants hall elsie dale upstairs in bedroom seen there by miss russell and miss flora ackroyd mary thripp kitchen maid servants hall the cook has been here seven years the parlourmaid eighteen months and parker just over a year the others are new except for parker they all seem quite all right i am quite sure that parker did not commit the murder poirot said that covers the household continued the inspector now mary black who lives in the house by the fernly park gates the lodge was closing the curtains last night when she saw ralph paton go past and take the path to the right which is a quicker way than the drive to get to the terrace it was exactly twentyfive minutes past nine he enters the study through the window at ninethirty mr geoffrey raymond hears someone in the study asking for money and mr ackroyd refusing what happens next let us suppose captain paton leaves the same way through the window he walks along the terrace he comes to the open drawingroom window say its now a quarter to ten miss flora ackroyd is saying goodnight to her uncle major blunt mr raymond and mrs ackroyd are in the billiard room the drawing room is empty he enters quietly takes the dagger from the silver table and returns to the study window he takes off his shoes so that mr ackroyd wont hear him climbs in and well i dont need to go into details then he leaves quietly and heads for the station rings up from there why said poirot softly his eyes shone with a strange green light its difficult to say exactly why he did that raglan said but murderers do funny things come along and ill show you those footprints we followed him to the study window where the constable produced the shoes taken from the local inn the inspector laid them over the footprints they arent the same pair that made these prints he went away in those this is a pair just like them but older see how the studs are worn down surely a great many people wear shoes with rubber studs in them asked poirot thats so i wouldnt give so much importance to the footprints if it wasnt for everything else he left no prints on the terrace or on the graveled path but just at the end of the path from the drive look at this a graveled path joined the terrace a few feet away in one place the ground was wet and there again were the marks of footsteps among them the shoes with rubber studs poirot followed the path on a little way you noticed the womens footprints the inspector laughed naturally but several different women have walked this way men as well its a regular short cut to the house you see but its the footsteps on the windowsill that are really important poirot nodded its no good going further said the inspector as we came in view of the drive its all graveled again here again poirot nodded but he stayed until the inspector had gone back towards the house then he looked at me luck has sent you to replace my friend hastings you are always by my side chapter nine the goldfish pond let us walk a little poirot said the air is pleasant today he led me down a path enclosed by bushes at the end was a paved area with a seat and a pond of goldfish poirot took another path which went up the side of a wooded slope in one place the trees had been cut down and a seat looked down on the pond england is very beautiful said poirot then he smiled and so are english girls hush my friend and look at the pretty picture below us flora was moving along the path we had just left and she was singing quietly to herself despite her black mourning dress there was nothing but joy in her whole attitude she suddenly turned round flung her head back and laughed as she did so a man stepped out from the trees it was hector blunt how you surprised me the girl said i didnt see you blunt stood looking at her for a minute or two in silence what i like about you said flora is your cheerful conversation i was never good at conversation not even when i was young that was a very long time ago i suppose said flora i caught the laughter in her voice but i dont think blunt did yes he said simply it was its time i went back to africa im useless in social gatherings but youre not going now cried flora no not while were in all this trouble oh please if you go she turned away you want me to stay asked blunt we all i meant you personally said blunt with directness flora turned slowly back again and met his eyes i want you to stay she said if if that makes any difference it makes all the difference said blunt they sat down on the stone seat by the goldfish pond its such a lovely morning said flora you know i cant help feeling happy in spite of everything thats awful i suppose its quite natural said blunt you never saw your uncle until two years ago did you you cant be expected to grieve very much you make things seem so simple said flora ill ill tell you why i felt so happy this morning however heartless you think me its because the lawyer has been here mr hammond he told us about the will uncle roger has left me twenty thousand pounds think of it twenty thousand beautiful pounds blunt looked surprised does it mean so much to you why its everything freedom life no more pretending to be thankful for all the old clothes rich relations give you im so happy im free free to do what i like free not to she stopped suddenly not to what asked blunt quickly nothing important miss ackroyd can i do anything about paton i mean i know how anxious you must be thank you said flora in a cold voice ralph will be all right ive got the most wonderful detective in the world and hes going to find out all about it poirot rose to his feet i demand pardon he cried i cannot allow mademoiselle to praise me and not draw attention to my presence he hurried down the path with me close behind him this is monsieur hercule poirot said flora i expect youve heard of him poirot bowed i know major blunt by reputation he said i am glad to meet you monsieur i am in need of some information when did you last see monsieur ackroyd alive at dinner and you neither saw nor heard anything of him after that i didnt see him but i heard his voice how was that i went out on the terrace at about halfpast nine i was walking up and down smoking i heard ackroyd speaking to his secretary i assumed it was raymond because raymond had said just before i came out that he was taking some papers to ackroyd i never thought of it being anybody else seems i was wrong can you remember what the words you heard were im afraid i cant something quite ordinary it is of no importance murmured poirot did you move a chair back against the wall in the study after the body was discovered chair no poirot turned to flora there is one thing i should like to know from you mademoiselle when you were looking at the things in the silver table with monsieur blunt before dinner was the dagger in its place or was it not inspector raglan asked me that im certain the dagger was not there raglan thinks it was and that ralph took it later in the evening he thinks im saying it to protect ralph and arent you i asked flora stamped her foot no dr sheppard poirot tactfully changed the subject of the conversation look there is something shiny in this pond let us see if i can reach it he knelt down by the pond pushed up the sleeve of his jacket and put his arm in the water however the mud at the bottom of the pond moved and his hand came out empty blunt looked at his watch nearly lunchtime he said wed better get back to the house you will have lunch with us monsieur poirot asked flora i would like you to meet my mother the little man bowed i will be delighted mademoiselle and you will stay too wont you dr sheppard we set off towards the house flora and blunt walking ahead poirot began to brush drops of water off his sleeve and all for nothing too i said sympathetically i wonder what it was in the pond my good friend he said gently hercule poirot does not risk spoiling his clothes without being sure of getting what he is looking for before showing my empty hand i dropped what it contained into my other hand he held out his left hand palm open on it lay a womans wedding ring i took it from him look inside commanded poirot i did so inside was fine writing from r march th i looked at poirot but i saw that he did not wish to say anything more three possibilities came to my mind the obvious one being that ralph had secretly married flora despite her uncles disapproval at that time that roger ackroyd had been secretly married to mrs ferrars or the least likely that roger ackroyd had married his housekeeper miss russell chapter ten the parlourmaid we found mrs ackroyd in the hall with her was a small man with sharp grey eyes mr hammond is staying to lunch with us said mrs ackroyd you know major blunt mr hammond and dear dr sheppard a close friend of poor rogers and let me see this is monsieur poirot mother i told you about him he is going to find out who killed uncle poirot went up to the lawyer and spoke to him quietly i joined them then hesitated perhaps im intruding i said not at all cried poirot you and i monsieur le docteur we investigate this business side by side i desire a little information from the good mr hammond i cannot seriously believe that captain paton can be involved in this crime the lawyer said the fact that he was in need of money is nothing it was a permanent condition with ralph he was always asking his stepfather for money mr hammond seeing that i am acting for miss ackroyd you will not object to telling me the terms of mr ackroyds will they are quite simple after paying certain legacies such as interrupted poirot a thousand pounds to his housekeeper miss russell fifty pounds to the cook emma cooper five hundred pounds to his secretary mr geoffrey raymond then to various hospitals poirot held up his hand ah the charitable bequests they do not interest me quite so the income on ten thousand pounds worth of shares is to be paid to mrs cecil ackroyd during her lifetime miss flora ackroyd inherits twenty thousand pounds everything else including this property and the shares in ackroyd and son is left to his adopted son ralph paton captain paton will be a very wealthy young man after lunch the lawyer asked mrs ackroyd now have you all the cash you need for now if not i can arrange to let you have whatever you require that ought to be all right said raymond mr ackroyd cashed a cheque for a hundred pounds yesterday for wages and other expenses due today where is this money hammond asked in his desk no he always kept his cash in his bedroom i think said the lawyer we ought to make sure the money is there before i leave certainly agreed the secretary ill take you up now oh i forgot the door is locked a few minutes later inspector raglan joined us and brought the key with him he unlocked the door and we went up the small staircase at the top of the stairs the door into ackroyds bedroom stood open the inspector opened the curtains letting in the sunlight and geoffrey raymond went to the top drawer of a desk and took out a round leather box opening it he took out a thick wallet here is the money he said taking out some banknotes you will find the hundred there mr ackroyd put it in the box in my presence last night when he was dressing for dinner mr hammond took the notes and counted them he looked up sharply there are only sixty pounds here but i dont understand it cried the secretary it is very simple remarked poirot either mr ackroyd paid out that forty pounds sometime last evening or else it has been stolen the inspector turned to mrs ackroyd which of the servants would usually come in here yesterday evening the housemaid would get the bed ready i think we ought to clear this matter up said the inspector the other servants are all right as far as you know has anything gone missing before no are any of them leaving the parlourmaid gave notice yesterday i believe to you oh no miss russell deals with household matters poirot and i accompanied the inspector to the housekeepers room she said the housemaid elsie dale had been at fernly for five months a nice girl and most respectable with good references what about the parlourmaid asked poirot she is clearly better educated than most servants and very quiet and ladylike an excellent worker then why is she leaving asked the inspector i understand mr ackroyd was very angry at something she had done yesterday afternoon and she gave notice perhaps youd like to see her yourselves ursula bourne came as instructed she was a tall girl with a lot of brown hair rolled tightly away at the back of her neck and very steady grey eyes you are ursula bourne asked the inspector yes sir i understand you are leaving yes sir why is that it was my job to tidy the study and i disturbed some papers on mr ackroyds desk he was very angry about it and i said i had better leave he told me to go as soon as possible were you in mr ackroyds bedroom last night no sir that is elsies work i never went upstairs i must tell you my girl that a large sum of money is missing from mr ackroyds room her face reddened if you think i took it and that is why mr ackroyd dismissed me you are wrong you can search my things if you like it was yesterday afternoon that mr ackroyd dismissed you or you dismissed yourself was it not poirot asked the girl nodded how long did the discussion last between you and mr ackroyd twenty minutes half an hour something like that thank you mademoiselle i looked at him his eyes were shining ursula bourne left and the inspector turned to miss russell have you got her references miss russell moved to a desk and took out a handful of letters she selected one and handed it to the inspector hmm he said it seems to be all right her last job was at marby grange marby with mrs richard folliott well lets have a look at elsie dale elsie dale answered our questions easily and was very upset about the loss of the money i dont think theres anything wrong with her observed the inspector when she had gone well thank you very much miss russell its highly probable mr ackroyd spent that money himself i left the house with poirot i wonder i said what the papers ursula bourne disturbed were they must have been important for ackroyd to be so angry the secretary said there were no papers of particular importance on the desk said poirot quietly so why would he have been so angry with her had no answer chapter eleven poirot pays a call on sunday after seeing my patients i arrived home at about six oclock ive had a very interesting afternoon began caroline have you i said did miss gannett come for tea no monsieur poirot now what do you think of that i thought a good many things of it but i was careful not to say them to caroline what did he talk about i asked he told me a lot about himself and his cases and naturally we talked about the murder i was able to correct monsieur poirot on several points he was very grateful to me he said i could make an excellent detective with a wonderful understanding of human nature he talked a lot about the little grey cells of the brain his own he says are of the first quality he isnt modest is he he thought that it was very important for ralph to be found as soon as possible and explain himself he says that his disappearance will produce a very bad impression at the inquest i agreed with him said caroline caroline i said did you tell monsieur poirot what you overheard in the woods that day i did said caroline you realize youre giving poirot evidence that will prove ralph is guilty not at all said caroline i was surprised you hadnt told him i took very good care not to i said im fond of that boy so am i thats why i say youre talking nonsense i dont believe ralph did it and so the truth cant hurt him therefore we ought to give monsieur poirot all the help we can did poirot ask you any more questions i inquired only about the patients you had that morning your surgery patients how many and who they were were you able to tell him that of course said my sister i can see the path up to the surgery door perfectly from this window and ive got an excellent memory james much better than yours im sure you have there was old mrs bennett and that boy from the farm with the bad foot dolly grice came to have a needle taken out of her finger and that american steward off the ship let me see thats four yes and old george evans with his bad stomach and lastly miss russell chapter twelve round the table a joint inquest for mrs ferrars and ackroyd was held on monday by arrangement with the police very little information was allowed to come out at the inquest i gave evidence about the cause of ackroyds death and the probable time the absence of ralph paton was commented on by the coroner but not stressed afterwards poirot and i had a few words with inspector raglan it looks bad monsieur poirot he said im a local man and ive seen captain paton many times so i dont want him to be the murderer but if hes innocent why doesnt he come forward weve got evidence against him but its just possible that the evidence could be explained away ralphs description had been given to every port and railway station in england his apartment in town was watched and any houses he visited frequently he had no luggage and as far as anyone knew no money it seemed impossible that ralph could avoid detection i cant find anyone who saw him at the station that night continued the inspector theres no news from liverpool either you think he went to liverpool asked poirot well that telephone message from the station was just three minutes before the liverpool express train left ah yes the telephone message my friend said poirot seriously i believe that when we find the explanation of that telephone call we will find the explanation of the murder i must confess i think weve got better clues than that mr poirot said the inspector the fingerprints on the dagger for instance poirot suddenly became very foreign in manner as he often did when excited over something monsieur inspecteur he said those fingerprints they may lead you nowhere mr poirot those prints were made by someone who was in the house that night and ive taken the prints of every member of the household everyone none of them match you have taken the prints of everyone without overlooking anyone both alive and dead the inspector looked puzzled you mean i am suggesting said poirot that the fingerprints on the dagger handle are those of mr ackroyd himself it is an easy matter to prove his body is still available youre surely not suggesting suicide mr poirot ah no my theory is that the murderer wore gloves or wrapped something round his or her hand after the blow was struck the killer picked up the victims hand and closed it round the dagger handle he did this to make a confusing case even more confusing inspector raglan stared at the little man well its an idea ill look into it poirot watched him go off then he turned to me with twinkling eyes and now that we are left on our own what do you think my good friend about a little meeting of the family half an hour later we were sitting round the table in the dining room at fernly the servants were not present so there were six of us in all mrs ackroyd flora major blunt young raymond poirot and myself poirot rose and bowed messieurs mesdames i have called you together for a certain purpose he paused to begin with mademoiselle you are engaged to captain ralph paton i beg you if you know where he is to persuade him to come forward mademoiselle his position grows daily more dangerous if he had come forward immediately he could have explained himself even if the facts look suspicious but this silence this disappearance makes him look guilty mademoiselle persuade him to come forward before it is too late floras face had gone very white too late she repeated very low poirot leant forward see now mademoiselle he said very gently it is papa poirot who asks you this the old papa poirot who has much knowledge and much experience i would not seek to trap you mademoiselle will you not trust me and tell me where ralph paton is hiding the girl stood monsieur poirot she said in a clear voice i swear to you that i have no idea where ralph is and that i have neither seen him nor heard from him either on the day of of the murder or since she sat down again poirot brought his hand down on the table with a sharp sound that is that he said his face hardened now i ask everyone sitting round this table mrs ackroyd major blunt dr sheppard mr raymond you are all friends of the missing man if you know where ralph paton is hiding speak out there was silence messieurs et mesdames said poirot understand this i mean to arrive at the truth the truth however ugly in itself is always strange and beautiful to those who search for it i tell you i intend to know and i will know in spite of you all how do you mean in spite of us all raymond asked just that monsieur every one of you in this room is hiding something from me he raised his hand as a faint murmur of protest arose it may be something unimportant that you do not think affects the case but there it is each one of you has something to hide come now am i right he looked questioningly at each of us and every pair of eyes dropped before his yes mine as well i am answered said poirot with a strange laugh he got up from his seat and went out chapter thirteen the motives that evening at poirots request i went over to his house after dinner he had placed a bottle of whisky on a small table with water and a glass he himself was making hot chocolate he inquired politely about my sister who he said was a most interesting woman you will have got all the local gossip from her i said true and untrue and a great deal of valuable information he added quietly women they are marvelous they observe a thousand little details without knowing that they are doing so their subconscious mind adds these little things together and they call the result intuition i wish youd tell me i said what you really think of it all you have seen what i have seen should our ideas not be the same im afraid youre laughing at me ive no experience of matters of this kind poirot smiled at me so i give you then a little lecture the first thing is to get a clear history of what happened that evening always remembering that the person who speaks may be lying now first dr sheppard leaves the house at ten minutes to nine how do i know that because i told you so you might not be speaking the truth but parker also says that you left the house at ten minutes to nine so we accept that and pass on at nine oclock you leave the park gates how do i know that that is so i told you so i began again but poirot interrupted me with a gesture of impatience ah you are a little stupid tonight my friend you know that it is so but how am i to know you do not use your little grey cells now what did you think of the parlourmaids story does it take half an hour to dismiss a servant was the story of those important papers true tell me now your own ideas i took a piece of paper from my pocket i wrote down a few suggestions i said but excellent you have method let us hear them to begin with one must look at the thing logically just what my poor friend hastings used to say interrupted poirot but alas he never did so point no i mr ackroyd was heard talking to someone at halfpast nine point no at some time during the evening ralph paton must have come in through the window the prints of his shoes tell us that point no mr ackroyd would only have let in someone he knew point no the person with mr ackroyd at ninethirty was asking for money we know ralph paton needed money these four points go to show that the person with mr ackroyd at ninethirty was ralph paton but we know that mr ackroyd was alive at a quarter to ten therefore it was not ralph who killed him ralph left the window open afterwards the murderer came in that way decidedly you have little grey cells of a kind said poirot but what about the telephone call the pushedout chair then there is the missing forty pounds given by ackroyd to ralph he may have reconsidered his first refusal that still leaves one thing unexplained why was blunt so certain that it was raymond with mr ackroyd at ninethirty he explained that i said i will not pursue the point tell me instead what were ralph patons reasons for disappearing ackroyd was murdered a few minutes after ralph left he must have been afraid he would be accused and ran away men have been known to act guiltily when theyre perfectly innocent yes that is true said poirot but we must not forget one thing i know what youre going to say motive ralph paton inherits a great fortune by his stepfathers death that is one motive agreed poirot but do you realize that there are three separate motives staring us in the face somebody stole the blue envelope and its contents that is one motive blackmail and the blackmailer could have been ralph paton then there is the fact that he was in some sort of trouble which he feared ackroyd might discover and finally there is the one you have just mentioned well i said the case does seem strong against him does it said poirot that is where we disagree you and i three motives it is almost too much i am inclined to believe that after all ralph paton is innocent chapter fourteen mrs ackroyd mrs ackroyd asked me to visit her early on tuesday morning she was in bed well mrs ackroyd i said whats the matter with you its the shock of poor rogers death and then yesterday that meeting with that dreadful little frenchman or belgian or whatever he is he was bullying us does he really imagine im hiding something he he positively accused me yesterday it doesnt matter surely mrs ackroyd since you are not hiding anything mrs ackroyd looked away servants do gossip and talk amongst themselves and then rumors get round everyone you were with monsieur poirot all the time werent you doctor it was that girl ursula bourne wasnt it shes leaving she would want to make all the trouble she could you must know exactly what she said that girl may have said all sorts of things about about something she saw me do just to cause trouble poirot had been right of the six people round the table yesterday mrs ackroyd at least had something to hide if i were you mrs ackroyd i said i would tell monsieur poirot whatever it is youre hiding oh mrs ackroyd began crying i had hoped doctor that you might tell monsieur poirot explain it you know even the smallest bill for something id bought roger would question it as if he earned only a few hundred pounds a year instead of being a very wealthy man those dreadful bills some i didnt like to show roger at all and then i got a letter from a scottish gentleman mr bruce macpherson who was prepared to lend me anything from ten pounds to ten thousand pounds i wrote to him but there were difficulties he needed to know that i would be able to repay the loan and although i expected that roger would provide for me on his death i didnt know i thought that if only i could see his will well on friday afternoon everyone was out or so i thought and i went into rogers study i had a real reason for going there and when i saw all the papers on the desk i suddenly had an idea i wonder if roger keeps his will in one of the drawers of the desk i see i said so you searched the desk did you find the will mrs ackroyd gave a little scream how bad it sounds but it wasnt at all like that really in dear rogers place i would have said what i was leaving people in my will but men are so secretive but then as i was searching ursula bourne came in it was very awkward i shut the drawer and stood up and i called her attention to some dust on the top of the desk but i didnt like the way she looked almost disapproving i have never liked that girl very much shes too well educated for a servant you cant tell who are ladies and who arent these days and what happened next roger came in he said whats all this and i said nothing i just came in to fetch the newspaper and i took it and went out with it i heard bourne asking roger if she could speak to him for a minute i went straight up to my room to lie down i was very upset there was a pause you will explain to monsieur poirot wont you you can see for yourself what a very small matter the whole thing was but of course when monsieur poirot was so strict about hiding things i thought of this at once that is all i said you have told me everything yees said mrs ackroyd i noted the hesitation and i knew that there was still something she was keeping back it was nothing less than a flash of genius that made me ask my next question mrs ackroyd i said was it you who left the silver table open how did you know she whispered i you see there were one or two pieces of valuable silver i had been reading about silver and there was a photograph of a small piece that had been sold for a huge amount of money it looked just like one of the pieces in the silver table i thought i would take it up to london with me and and have it valued then if it really was a valuable piece just think what a lovely surprise it would have been for roger why did you leave the lid open i asked i heard footsteps coining along the terrace i hurried out of the room and just got up the stairs before parker opened the front door to you that must have been miss russell i said thoughtfully mrs ackroyd had revealed something extremely interesting miss russell must have entered the drawing room by the french window where had she been when i returned home i discovered that poirot had visited caroline i am helping him with the case monsieur poirot wanted me to find out whether ralph patons boots were black or brown i stared at her i see now that i was unbelievably stupid about these boots they were brown shoes i said i saw them not shoes james boots monsieur poirot wanted to know whether a pair of boots ralph had with him at the hotel were brown or black a lot depends on this and how are you going to find out i asked caroline said she already had monsieur poirot thought they were probably brown he was wrong theyre black caroline evidently felt that she had scored a point over poirot i did not answer i was puzzling over what connection the color of a pair of ralph patons boots had with the case chapter fifteen geoffrey raymond that afternoon when i returned from seeing my patients caroline told me that geoffrey raymond had just left did he want to see me i asked it was monsieur poirot he wanted to see caroline said hed just come from the larches monsieur poirot was out and mr raymond thought that he might be here he said he would come back and went away a great pity because monsieur poirot came in almost the minute after he left came in here no to his own house how do you know the side window caroline explained i can see the front door from there arent you going across to the larches my dear caroline i said what for you might hear what its all about and you might tell monsieur poirot about the boots poirot got up to meet me with a look of pleasure when i arrived at the larches sit down my good friend he said you have something for me yes information of a kind i told him of my interview with mrs ackroyd that explains something to me he said thoughtfully and it confirms the evidence of the housekeeper she said you remember that she found the lid of the silver table open and closed it as she walked past it yes i said but why did she come in through the french windows by the way ive got a message for you from my sister ralph patons boots were black not brown ah said poirot sadly that is a pity he gave no explanation about why then the door opened and geoffrey raymond came in perhaps id better leave i suggested please dont go because of me doctor said raymond i just have a confession to make you accused us all of hiding something monsieur poirot i plead guilty i was in debt badly and ackroyds five hundred pounds will solve all my problems he smiled with that openness that made him such a likeable youngster you are a very wise young man said poirot nodding with approval you see when i know someone is hiding things from me i suspect that the thing hidden may be something very bad indeed you have done well im glad im cleared from suspicion laughed raymond ill leave now so that is that i remarked as the door closed behind the young secretary yes agreed poirot but have you thought my friend that many people in that house will benefit by mr ackroyds death only one in fact does not major blunt the way he said blunts name was so strange that i looked up puzzled you think he has something to conceal also there is a saying is there not that englishmen conceal only one thing their love no i would like to try a little experiment with parker parker yes parker my thoughts always return to parker not as the murderer but perhaps he is the scoundrel who blackmailed mrs ferrars parker might have taken the letter i said it wasnt until later that i noticed it was gone then my friend will you accompany me to fernly we set out at once at fernly poirot asked to see miss ackroyd and she came to us mademoiselle flora said poirot i am not yet satisfied of the innocence of parker with your help i want to have him repeat some of his actions on that night but we must think of something to tell him ah i have it now ring the servants bell for parker if you will be so good doctor i did so and the butler soon appeared you rang sir yes my good parker said poirot i have in mind a little experiment i know that on the night of the murder major blunt was on the terrace outside the study window i want to see if anyone there could have heard the voices of miss ackroyd and yourself in the small hall that night i want you to repeat that scene could you please get the tray you were carrying parker left and we went and stood outside the study door soon parker appeared in the doorway carrying a tray with whisky and water now let us do everything just as it happened cried poirot seeming very excited you came from the outer hall and mademoiselle was where here said flora i had just closed the door yes miss agreed parker your hand was still on the handle as it is now then said poirot begin the play flora stood with her hand on the door handle and parker came through the door from the main hall he stopped just inside the door flora spoke oh parker mr ackroyd doesnt want to be disturbed again tonight is that right she added i think you said this evening not tonight miss flora then raising his voice in a theatrical fashion parker said very good miss shall i lock up as usual yes please parker left through the door flora followed him and started to go up the main staircase is that enough she asked over her shoulder excellent said the little man rubbing his hands i have discovered what i wanted to know chapter sixteen parker the funerals of mrs ferrars and roger ackroyd took place at eleven oclock in the morning afterwards poirot invited me to go back to the larches with him with your help i will question parker he said we will scare him so much that the truth is certain to come out i asked him to be at my house at twelve oclock he will be there now on arrival at the larches poirots housekeeper told us that parker was already there as we entered the drawing room the butler stood up respectfully good afternoon parker said poirot pleasantly please sit down what i have to say may take some time parker sat in the chair poirot had pointed to now said poirot smiling have you often blackmailed people the butler jumped to his feet sir i ive never never been insulted suggested poirot in such a way before then why my excellent parker were you so anxious to overhear the conversation between mr ackroyd and dr sheppard the other evening after you had heard the word blackmail i wasnt i who did you work for before mr ackroyd poirot demanded suddenly a major ellerby sir just so major ellerby was addicted to drugs was he not a man was killed and major ellerby was partly responsible it was kept quiet but you knew about it how much did major ellerby pay you to keep quiet you see i have made inquiries said poirot pleasantly you got a large sum of money then as blackmail and now i want to hear about your latest efforts parkers face was completely white but i never hurt mr ackroyd honestly sir i didnt its true that i tried to listen that night i heard the word blackmail sir and well i thought that if mr ackroyd was being blackmailed why shouldnt i have a share a strange expression passed over poirots face he leaned forward had you any reason to think before that night that mr ackroyd was being blackmailed no sir it was a great surprise to me he was such a gentleman in all his behaviour i hope you believe me sir ive been afraid all the time the police would discover that business with major ellerby and suspect me because of it i believe that you have told me the truth said poirot if you have not it will be very bad for you my friend as soon as he had gone i asked do you believe parkers story it seems clear that he believes it was ackroyd who was the victim of blackmail if so he knows nothing about mrs ferrars being blackmailed because she had poisoned her husband then in that case who precisely who now we will visit the good monsieur hammond in the lawyers office poirot came at once to the point monsieur you acted i understand for mrs ferrars of kings paddock i did i thought so now i would like you to listen to the story dr sheppard will tell you my friend you do not mind repeating the conversation you had with mr ackroyd last friday night do you not at all i said hammond listened with close attention blackmail said the lawyer thoughtfully i suspected that might be the case monsieur said poirot could you please give us an idea of the actual money paid to the blackmailer during the past year mrs ferrars sold shares the money for them was paid into her account and not reinvested i once asked her why not and she said that she had to support several of her husbands poor relations and the amount asked poirot in all i should say twenty thousand pounds twenty thousand pounds i exclaimed in one year mrs ferrars was a very wealthy woman said poirot and the penalty for murder is death by hanging and a murderer she was i thank you monsieur hammond said poirot standing when we were outside poirot said we can remove parker as a suspect if he had twenty thousand pounds would he have continued being a butler no when we arrived at my house i invited poirot to come in we were sitting in front of the fire and smoking when caroline entered have you found ralph paton yet she asked poirot where would i find him mademoiselle i thought perhaps youd found him in cranchester in cranchester but why in cranchester i smiled one of the many private detectives who live here everyone in the village in fact saw you in a car on the cranchester road yesterday i explained poirot laughed ah that a simple visit to the dentist my tooth it aches caroline was very disappointed and we began discussing ralph paton he has a weak nature i insisted but not a savage one ah said poirot but weakness where does it end exactly said caroline look at james here he would be as weak as water if i wasnt here to look after him ive always believed it to be my duty to look after him if hed been brought up badly who knows what mischief he might have got into now as far as i can see of the people connected to fernly only two could have had the opportunity of murdering roger and that is ralph paton and flora ackroyd parker met her outside the door didnt he he didnt hear her uncle saying goodnight to her she could have killed him before she left the room caroline im not saying she did james im saying she could have done as a matter of fact i dont believe shed kill even an insect but there it is mr raymond and major blunt have alibis mrs ackroyds got an alibi even that russell woman has one so who is left only ralph and flora and whatever you say i dont believe ralph paton is a murderer when poirot spoke it was in a gentle almost dreamlike voice let us take a man a very ordinary man there is a weakness in him but it is hidden let us suppose that something happens in his life he is in difficulties or he may discover a secret by accident his first thought will be to speak out to do his duty as an honest citizen and then the weakness shows here is a chance of money a great amount of money he has to do nothing for it just keep quiet then the desire for money grows he must have more and more and in his greed he pushes his source of money too far one can push a man as far as one likes but with a woman one must not push too far for a woman has at heart a great desire to speak the truth how many husbands who have been unfaithful to their wives die and take their secret with them how many wives gushed too far by their husbands behaviour tell their husbands that they have been unfaithful in a moment of anger which they will regret they tell the truth with great momentary satisfaction to themselves so it was i think in this case the strain was too great and so having confessed to mr ackroyd there was no reason for mrs ferrars to pay the blackmailer more money but the blackmailer knew he was about to be revealed and he is not the same man he was a year ago he is desperate he is prepared to do anything for if his crime is discovered he will be ruined and so the dagger strikes it was as though he had put a spell upon the room there was something in the power of poirots description which struck fear into both of us afterwards he went on softly the dagger removed he will be himself again normal kind but if the need arises again then he will kill again chapter seventeen flora ackroyd as i was driving back from visiting my patients the following morning i met inspector raglan good morning dr sheppard said the inspector im on my way to the larches to let monsieur poirot know that he was quite right about those fingerprints they did belong to mr ackroyd however although he was right about that im afraid to say that in other ways i dont think poirots mind is quite what it used to be thats why he had to retire and come down here it seems to be a family thing hes got a nephew whos completely mad poirot has i said very surprised yes quietly behaved i believe but mad poor boy who told you that a huge smile appeared on inspector raglans face your sister miss sheppard really caroline is amazing she never rests until she knows every detail of everybodys family secrets jump in inspector i said opening the door of my car well go up to the larches together and give our belgian friend the latest news poirot received us with his usual smiling politeness he listened to the information we had brought him nodding his head then he raised a hand but you see you approach the matter from the wrong base the inspector stared at him frowning i dont understand what you mean poirot shook his head look here you believe mr ackroyd was alive at a quarter to ten well you have to admit that too dont you monsieur poirot i admit nothing that is not proved poirot answered with a quick smile well weve got miss flora ackroyds evidence that she said goodnight to her uncle but me i do not always believe what a young lady tells me but parker saw her coming out of the door no that is just what he did not see parker saw her outside the door with her hand on the handle he did not see her come out of the room but where else could she have been perhaps on the stairs that is my little idea but those stairs only lead to mr ackroyds bedroom precisely and still the inspector stared you think shed been up to her uncles bedroom are you suggesting that it was miss ackroyd who took that forty pounds i suggest nothing but life was not very easy for that mother and daughter roger ackroyd was a strange man over money matters the girl might be desperate for a little money think what happens then she has taken the money she goes down the little staircase when she is halfway down she hears parker going to the study if the money is found to be missing parker is sure to remember having seen her come down those stairs she has just time to run quietly down to the study door with her hand on the handle to show that she has just come out when parker appears in the doorway she says the first thing that comes into her head she repeats the orders roger ackroyd gave earlier in the evening and then goes to her own room afterwards it was a little difficult for mademoiselle flora she was told simply that the police had arrived and that there had been a burglary naturally she jumped to the conclusion that the theft of the money had been discovered her one idea was to stick to her story when she learned that her uncle was dead she was panicstricken young women do not faint nowadays monsieur without huge provocation and a young and pretty girl does not like to admit that she is a thief especially before those whose good opinion she wants to keep i was always convinced that mademoiselle flora was hiding something from us to satisfy myself i did the little experiment that i have told you about dr sheppard accompanied me a test for parker you said it was i remarked bitterly poirot hadnt been honest with me the inspector stood we must question the young lady right away will you come up to fernly with me monsieur poirot certainly dr sheppard will drive us in his car on asking for miss ackroyd we were shown into the billiard room flora and major hector blunt were sitting on the long window seat good morning miss ackroyd said the inspector can we have a word or two alone with you what is it asked flora nervously dont go major blunt he can stay cant he she asked turning to the inspector if you want him to said the inspector but i have some questions to ask you and id prefer to do it privately i think you would prefer it also i saw her face grow paler then she turned and spoke to blunt i want you to stay please yes i mean it whatever the inspector has to say to me id rather you heard it raglan sighed well if you really want to now monsieur poirot flora looked at poirot mademoiselle what one does not tell papa poirot he finds out you took the money did you not there was a silence which lasted for at least a minute then flora sat up straight and spoke monsieur poirot is right i am a thief yes a thief now you know i am glad the truth has come out its been a nightmare these last few days you dont know what my life has been like since my father died and left us with no money ive bought things i couldnt afford and promised to pay the shops later knowing i couldnt oh i hate myself when i think of it all thats what brought us together ralph and i we were both weak i understood him and i was sorry because im the same were weak miserable things she looked at blunt but im not lying any more im not pretending to be the kind of girl you like young and innocent and simple i dont care if you never want to see me again i hate myself despise myself but youve got to believe one thing if telling the truth would have made things better for ralph i would have spoken out but i knew that it wouldnt be better for ralph it makes the case against him stronger than ever i was not doing him any harm by sticking to my lie ralph said blunt i see always ralph you dont understand said flora hopelessly she turned to the inspector i was desperate for money i never saw my uncle that evening after he left the dining room as for the money you can do whatever you want nothing could be worse than it is now suddenly she hid her face in her hands and rushed from the room well said the inspector so thats that blunt came forward inspector raglan he said quietly that money was given to me by mr ackroyd for a special purpose miss ackroyd never touched it she is lying with the idea of protecting captain paton i am prepared to swear to it he made an awkward bow then turning quickly he left the room poirot followed him into the hall monsieur a moment i beg of you i am not deceived by your lie all the same what you have done here is very good you are a man quick to think and to act the other day i spoke of hidden things all the time i have seen what you are concealing mademoiselle flora you love her with all your heart oh why must everyone in england avoid talking about love as though it was some disgraceful secret you love mademoiselle flora you seek to conceal that fact from everyone but take the advice of hercule poirot do not conceal it from mademoiselle herself what do you mean by that blunt said sharply you think that she loves ralph paton but i hercule poirot tell you that that is not so mademoiselle flora accepted captain patons offer of marriage to please her uncle and because she saw in the marriage a way of escape from her life here she liked him and there was much sympathy and understanding between them but love no it is not captain paton mademoiselle flora loves what do you mean asked blunt i saw the dark red blush under his suntanned skin you have been blind monsieur she is loyal the little one ralph paton is under suspicion she feels that she must support him do you really think blunt began and stopped if you doubt me ask her yourself monsieur but perhaps you no longer care to after the theft of the money blunt gave a sound like an angry laugh do you think id turn away from her because of that roger was always difficult about money so she got in a mess and was too frightened to tell him poor child poor lonely child poirot looked thoughtfully at the side door mademoiselle flora went into the garden i think he murmured ive been a complete fool said blunt youre a good man monsieur poirot thank you he took poirots hand and gave it a grip which made poirot wince in pain then he walked quickly to the side door and went out into the garden not a complete fool murmured poirot massaging his hand only one kind the fool in love chapter eighteen an untruth our drive back to the village was filled with raglans complaints all those alibis are useless weve got to start again and find out what everyone was doing from ninethirty onwards nine thirty thats the time weve got to focus on we arrived back at my house and i hurried in to my surgery patients leaving poirot to walk to the police station with the inspector when i had seen the last patient i went into the little room at the back of the house i call this my workshop and i am rather proud of the wireless set i made there i was just adjusting the inside of an alarm clock when the door opened and my sister caroline came in monsieur poirot wants to see you well i said bring him in here caroline returned in a moment or two with poirot and then left shutting the door aha my friend said poirot coming forward he sat down and looked at me you know i said throwing down the screwdriver i was holding its extraordinary the whole case has changed entirely poirot smiled surely it is obvious he murmured according to you everything is obvious but its not obvious to me its as if you have left me walking about in a fog poirot shook his head no my friend take the matter of mademoiselle flora the inspector was surprised but you were not i never dreamed of her being the thief but ive felt that flora was hiding something so the truth when it came was almost expected it upset inspector raglan very much indeed poor man ah yes but i made good use of his unhappiness and persuaded him to help me in a small matter poirot took a sheet of writing paper from his pocket and read aloud the police have for some days been searching for captain ralph paton the stepson of mr ackroyd of fernly park whose tragic death occurred last friday captain paton has been found in liverpool where he was about to sail for america poirot folded up the piece of paper again that my friend will be in the newspapers tomorrow morning i stared at him but but it isnt true he isnt in liverpool poirot smiled with pleasure you have such quick intelligence i assured inspector raglan that very interesting results would follow the appearance of this report in the newspaper so he agreed i still do not understand i said what you expect to get out of this you should use your little grey cells said poirot seriously he got to his feet and came across to the bench i see you love machinery my friend pleased by his attention i showed poirot my homemade wireless and one or two little inventions of my own small things but useful in the house decidedly said poirot you should be an inventor not a doctor chapter nineteen in the newspaper the news about ralph paton invented by poirot appeared in the newspaper the next morning and that afternoon poirot arrived at my house i have something i would like you to do my friend he said tonight i want to have a little meeting at my house i need mrs ackroyd mademoiselle flora major blunt and mr raymond i would like you to ask them to come at nine oclock you will ask them yes with pleasure but why not ask them yourself because they will want to know my reasons for having the meeting and as you know my friend i dislike having to explain my little ideas until the time comes it was then that caroline opened the door her face was full of excitement ursula bourne she said shes here ive asked her to wait in the dining room shes terribly upset poor thing and says she must see monsieur poirot at once his housekeeper told her he was here ursula bourne was sitting at the table her arms were spread out in front of her and her eyes were red from crying ursula bourne i murmured but poirot went past me with outstretched hands no he said that is not quite right i think it is not ursula bourne is it my child but ursula paton mrs ralph paton chapter twenty ursulas story ursula nodded her head once and burst into tears again caroline put her arm around the girl my dear she said soothingly it will be all right everything will be all right hidden under her love of gossip there is a lot of kindness in caroline and soon ursula sat up and wiped away her tears this is very weak and silly of me she said no no my child said poirot kindly we all understand the strain of this last week and then to discover that you knew continued ursula how did you know was it ralph who told you poirot shook his head you know what brought me to you she went on this she held out a newspaper it says that ralph has been arrested so everything ive done is useless i dont have to pretend any longer newspaper reports are not always true mademoiselle murmured poirot all the same the truth is what we need now now listen i do truly believe that your husband is innocent but if i am to save him i must know all there is to know even if it does seem to make the case against him stronger than before how well you understand said ursula so you will tell me the whole story will you not from the beginning what i want to know caroline said is why this child was pretending to be a parlourmaid why did you do it for a joke to earn money said ursula quietly ursula bourne it seemed was one of a family of seven children and her parents had lost all their money ursulas eldest sister was married to a captain folliott ursula was determined to earn her living and disliked the idea of being a nursery governess one of the few professions open to untrained girls ursula preferred to get a job as a parlourmaid it was her sister who had written a reference for her at fernly despite some comment about her obviously good education she was a success at her job i enjoyed the work she explained and i had plenty of time to myself and then came her meeting with ralph paton and the love affair which ended in a secret marriage ralph had persuaded her into that he had said that his stepfather would never let him marry a girl who had no money ralph had said that he would find a job and then when he was earning enough money to support her they would tell ackroyd he hoped however that this might not be necessary he hoped that his stepfather might still be persuaded to pay his debts but when ackroyd learned how much money ralph owed he became extremely angry and refused to help his stepson in any way some months passed and then ralph was ordered to come to fernly it was now roger ackroyds greatest wish that ralph should marry flora and he told the young man that this was what he wanted as always ralph took the easy way and agreed that he would ask flora to marry him neither flora nor ralph pretended that they loved one another it was on both sides a business arrangement roger ackroyd told them what he wanted and they agreed ralph was not the kind of young man who thought about the future and i believe that he thought the engagement to flora could be ended after a few months both flora and ralph got ackroyd to agree that it should be kept a secret for a month or two ralph of course was anxious to hide it from ursula he felt that her strong and honest nature would not agree to such lies then came the moment when roger ackroyd always determined to be in control decided to announce the engagement he said nothing of his intention to ralph only to flora and flora didnt object ursula was shocked by the news she wrote to ralph demanding that he come down from london to see her they met in the woods where some of their conversation was heard by my sister ralph implored ursula to keep silent for a little while longer but ursula was determined to tell mr ackroyd the truth immediately husband and wife parted in anger ursula asked for a meeting with roger ackroyd that same afternoon and told him of the marriage their meeting was an angry one and it might have been even worse if ackroyd hadnt already been obsessed with his own troubles it was bad enough however unforgivable things were said by both of them that evening ursula met ralph by the goldfish pond going out secretly from the house by the side door in order to do so ralph said that ursula had ruined his life by telling the truth to his stepfather it was quite possible that ackroyd would change his will and disinherit ralph ursula hurt and angry told ralph that she hated the way he had behaved they parted still angry with one another and ursula in despair had thrown her wedding ring into the pond a little over half an hour later came the discovery of roger ackroyds body since that night ursula had neither seen nor heard from ralph what a damaging series of facts this story was i knew ackroyd well enough he would definitely have changed his will if he had lived his death came at just the right time for ralph and ursula paton no wonder the girl had kept silent and played her part so well my thoughts were interrupted by poirot speaking mademoiselle i must ask you one question and on it everything may depend what time was it when you parted from captain ralph paton it was halfpast nine when i went out to meet him major blunt was walking up and down the terrace so i had to go around the bushes to avoid him i must have reached ralph at about twentyseven minutes to ten i was with him ten minutes for it was a quarter to ten when i got back to the house mademoiselle what did you do when you got back to the house i went up to my room is there anyone who can prove that prove that i was in my room oh no but surely oh i see they might think they might think i saw the horror in her eyes poirot finished the sentence for her that it was you who entered by the window and stabbed mr ackroyd as he sat in his chair yes nobody but a fool would think any such thing said caroline angrily she patted ursula on the shoulder horrible the girl was murmuring horrible i see now if ralph heard of his stepfathers murder he might think that i had done it now mademoiselle poirot said quickly do not worry be brave and trust hercule poirot chapter twenty one poirots little reunion and now said caroline getting up from her chair ursula is coming upstairs to lie down dont you worry my dear monsieur poirot will do everything he can for you be sure of that so far so good poirot said when they had gone things are becoming clearer theyre looking blacker and blacker against ralph paton i said yes that is so but it was to be expected was it not i looked at him confused by the remark suddenly he sighed and shook his head there are moments when i really miss my friend hastings always when i had a big case he was by my side and he helped me yes he often helped me for he had an ability to discover the truth without realizing it at times he would say something particularly foolish and yet that foolish remark would reveal the truth to me and it was his habit to keep a written record of the cases that proved interesting i gave a slightly embarrassed cough as a matter of fact ive read some of captain hastings work and i thought why not try doing something of the same myself poirot sprang from his chair i had a moments terror that he was going to embrace me in the french fashion by kissing me on both cheeks but thankfully he didnt but this is magnificent you have written down your thoughts on the case as you went along i nodded let me see them this instant cried poirot i hope you wont mind i said i may have been a little personal now and then oh i understand perfectly you have written that i am ridiculous now and then it matters not at all hastings he also was not always polite hoping that what i had written would be published one day in the future i had divided the work into chapters poirot had therefore twenty chapters to read still doubtful but knowing that i had to go out to a patient some distance away i gave the pages to him and went out it was after eight oclock when i got back caroline brought me a hot dinner on a tray she told me that she had eaten with poirot at seven thirty and that poirot had then gone to my workshop to finish reading my manuscript i hope james said my sister that youve been careful in what you say about me in it i had not been careful at all i thought dismayed not that it matters very much said caroline reading the expression on my face correctly monsieur poirot will know what to think he understands me much better than you do i went into the workshop poirot was sitting by the window i congratulate you you have recorded all the facts faithfully and exactly and has it helped you yes considerably come we must go and set the stage for my little performance caroline was in the hall i think she wanted to be invited to come with us i would have asked you to come if i could mademoiselle poirot said regretfully but it would not be wise you see all these people tonight are suspects among them i will find the person who killed mr ackroyd you really believe that i said amazed i see that you do not yet appreciate hercule poirot for his true worth poirot replied at that minute ursula came down the stairs you are ready my child said poirot that is good we will go to my house together mademoiselle caroline believe me i will do everything possible to do things as you would wish them to be done good evening we left caroline looking as sad as a dog that has been refused a walk stood on the front door step watching us go at the larches poirot moved about quickly rearranging the lighting the lamps were placed to throw a clear light on the side of the room where poirot had grouped the chairs leaving the other end of the room in a dim light soon a bell was heard they are here said poirot good all is ready the door opened and the people from fernly came in poirot went forward and welcomed mrs ackroyd and flora it is most good of you to come he said and major blunt and mr raymond the secretary was smiling easily so whats the great idea he said laughing some scientific machine do we have bands round our wrists which register guilty heartbeats i am oldfashioned i use the old methods admitted poirot i work only with the little grey cells now let us begin but first i have an announcement to make he took ursulas hand this lady is mrs ralph paton she was married to captain paton last march a little scream burst from mrs ackroyd ralph married married to bourne really monsieur i dont believe you ursulas face reddened and she began to speak but flora stopped her going quickly to the other girls side she put her arm through ursulas i must apologize for our surprise she said we had no idea you and ralph have kept your secret very well but i am very happy about it you are very kind miss ackroyd said ursula in a low voice ralph behaved very badly to you you neednt worry about that said flora ralph was in trouble and took the only way out i would probably have done the same in his place he should have told me the secret though i wouldnt have betrayed him poirot made a sound the meetings going to begin said flora but just tell me one thing where is ralph you must know if anyone does but i dont cried ursula isnt he detained in liverpool asked raymond he is not in liverpool said poirot shortly in fact i remarked no one knows where he is except hercule poirot eh said raymond poirot replied seriously me i know everything remember that at a gesture from him everyone took their seats as they did so the door opened once more and two more people came in and sat down near the door parker and miss russell the number is complete said poirot there was satisfaction in his voice and every one of you had the opportunity to kill mr ackroyd with a cry mrs ackroyd sprang up i dont like this she cried i would much prefer to go home you cannot go home madame said poirot until you have heard what i have to say he paused a moment then said ralph paton and ursula bourne had the strongest motive for wishing mr ackroyd dead but it could not have been ralph paton who was with mr ackroyd in the study at ninethirty ralph paton was with his wife so who was it in the room with mr ackroyd at nine thirty and now i ask my cleverest question was anyone with him raymond did not seem impressed i dont know if youre trying to suggest im a liar monsieur poirot but remember major blunt also heard mr ackroyd talking to someone he was on the terrace outside and he heard the voices poirot nodded i have not forgotten but major blunt thought that it was you mr ackroyd was speaking to and there must have been some reason for him to think so from the beginning of the case i have been struck by one thing the words which mr raymond overheard it has been amazing to me that no one has seen anything strange about them he paused a minute and then quoted softly there have been so many demands on my financial resources recently that i cannot agree to your request does nothing strike you as strange about that i dont think so said raymond he has frequently dictated letters to me using almost exactly those same words exactly cried poirot would any man use such a phrase in talking to another now if he had been dictating a letter you mean he was reading a letter aloud asked raymond surely a man wouldnt read letters of that type aloud to himself you have all forgotten one thing said poirot softly the stranger who called at the house the wednesday before the dictaphone company gasped raymond a dictaphone thats what you think poirot nodded i contacted the company their reply is that mr ackroyd did purchase a dictaphone why he hid the matter from you i do not know he must have intended to surprise me with it murmured raymond he loved to surprise people he was probably playing with it like a new toy yes it fits in it explains too said poirot why major blunt thought it was you who was in the study all the same raymond said this discovery of yours brilliant though it is doesnt change anything mr ackroyd was alive at ninethirty since he was speaking into the dictaphone as to ralph paton he hesitated glancing at ursula it isnt that i doubt your story for a moment ive always been sure captain paton was innocent but he is in a most unfortunate position if he would come forward poirot interrupted that is your advice yes that he should come forward certainly if you know where he is not very far away said poirot smiling he is there he pointed dramatically everyones head turned ralph paton was standing in the doorway chapter twenty two ralph patons story it was a very uncomfortable minute for me i hardly took in what happened next but when i was sufficiently in control of myself to realize what was going on ralph paton was standing by his wife smiling across the room at me poirot too was smiling and at the same time shaking a finger at me have i not told you many times that it is useless to conceal things from hercule poirot he demanded that he always finds these things out he turned to the others one day you remember i accused five persons of concealing something from me four of them told me their secret dr sheppard did not i suppose i might as well explain things now i said i had been to see ralph that afternoon he told me about his marriage and the trouble he was in as soon as the murder was discovered i realized that suspicion would fall on ralph or on the girl he loved that night i told him the facts the thought of having to give evidence which might incriminate his wife made him decide at all costs to to i hesitated and ralph spoke up to disappear he said ursula took her hand from his and stepped back you thought that ralph you actually thought that i might have killed your stepfather let us return to the behaviour of dr sheppard said poirot drily dr sheppard was successful in hiding captain paton from the police where asked raymond you should ask yourself the question that i did if the doctor is concealing the young man what place would he choose it must be nearby i think of a hotel no where then ah i have it a nursing home a home for the mentally ill so in order to investigate further i invent a nephew with mental trouble i ask mademoiselle sheppard about suitable homes she gives me the names of two near cranchester to which her brother has sent patients i make inquiries yes at one of them a patient was brought by the doctor early on saturday morning though known by another name i had no difficulty in identifying that patient as captain paton after certain formalities i was allowed to bring him with me to my house in the early hours of yesterday morning dr sheppard has been very loyal said ralph he did what he thought was best i know now that i should have come forward but in the nursing home we never saw a newspaper or heard the radio i knew nothing of what was going on well now we can have your story of what happened that night said raymond impatiently you know it already said ralph i left fernly at about nine fortyfive and walked up and down the lanes trying to decide what to do next i have no alibi but i promise you that i never went to the study that i never saw my stepfather alive or dead whatever the world thinks id like all of you to believe me no alibi makes things very simple though said poirot in a cheerful voice very simple indeed we all stared at him to save captain paton the real criminal must confess he smiled round at us all see now i did not invite inspector raglan to be present i did not want to tell him everything i know tonight he leaned forward and suddenly his voice and his whole personality changed he suddenly became dangerous i know the murderer of mr ackroyd is in this room now it is to the murderer i speak tomorrow the truth goes to inspector raglan you understand there was a tense silence then poirots housekeeper came in with a telegram poirot opened it quickly blunts voice rose the murderer is amongst us you say you know who poirot had read the message i know now he tapped the paper what is that said raymond sharply a wireless message from a ship now on her way to the united states there was complete silence poirot stood up and bowed messieurs et mesdames this meeting of mine is at an end remember the truth goes to inspector raglan in the morning chapter twenty three the whole truth poirot made a gesture for me to stay after everyone had left i was puzzled there had been a real threat in poirots words hut i still believed he had the wrong idea he moved over to the fireplace well my friend he said quietly and what do you think of it all i dont know what to think why not go straight to inspector raglan with the truth instead of giving the guilty person this warning poirot sat down use your little grey cells he said there is always a reason behind my actions i said slowly it seems to me that the first reason was to try and force a confession from the murderer a clever idea but not the truth my second thought is that perhaps by making him believe you knew you might force him out into the open he might try to silence you as he formerly silenced mr ackroyd and use myself to trap him mon ami i am not sufficiently heroic for that then surely you are running the risk of letting the murderer escape by warning him poirot shook his head he cannot escape there is only one way out and that way does not lead to freedom you really believe that one of those people here tonight committed the murder i asked yes my friend i will explain exactly how i reached my conclusion now there were two facts and a little discrepancy in time which attracted my attention the first was the telephone call if ralph paton was indeed the murderer the telephone call became meaningless and silly therefore i said to myself ralph paton is not the murderer i concluded that the telephone call must have been made by an accomplice of the murderer i was not quite pleased with that deduction but i let it stand for the minute i next examined the motive for the call that was difficult i could only get at it by judging its result which was that the murder was discovered that night instead of the following morning but matters were still not clear what was the advantage of having the crime discovered that night rather than the following morning the only idea i had was that the murderer knowing the crime was to be discovered at a certain time could make sure of being present when the door was broken in or immediately afterwards and now we come to the second fact the chair pulled out from the wall inspector raglan dismissed that as of no importance i on the contrary have always regarded it as hugely important the chair being pulled out as it was would stand in a direct line between the door and the window the window i said quickly you too have my first idea i imagined that the chair was pulled out to hide something connected to the window but i abandoned that thought for the chair hid very little of the window but just in front of the window there was a table with books and magazines on it now that table was completely hidden by the pulledout chair now what if there had been something on that table that was not intended to be seen something put there by the murderer i had no idea of what that something might be but i knew it was something that the murderer had not been able to take away with him however it was vital that it should be removed as soon as possible after the crime had been discovered and so the telephone message and the opportunity for the murderer to be there when the body was discovered now four people were on the scene before the police arrived yourself parker major blunt and mr raymond parker i eliminated at once since he was the one person certain to be there when the body was discovered also it was he who told me of the pulledout chair raymond and blunt however remained under suspicion if the crime had been discovered in the early hours of the morning it was possible that they might have arrived too late to prevent the object on the round table being discovered now what was that object you heard what i said in this room not half an hour ago if a dictaphone was being used by mr ackroyd that night why was no dictaphone found i never thought of that i said so if something was taken from the table why would not that something be the dictaphone but a dictaphone cannot be hidden in a pocket there must have been something innocent looking which could hold it you see where i am arriving a picture of the murderer is taking shape a person who was on the scene immediately but who might not have been if the crime had been discovered the following morning a person carrying a receptacle into which the dictaphone might be put i interrupted but why remove the dictaphone what was the point like mr raymond you think that what was heard at ninethirty was mr ackroyds voice speaking into a dictaphone but consider this useful invention you dictate into it do you not and at some later time a secretary or a typist turns it on and the voice speaks again you mean i gasped poirot nodded yes at ninethirty mr ackroyd was already dead it was the dictaphone speaking not the man and the murderer switched it on then he must have been in the room at that minute possibly but what if a timing device had been attached to the dictaphone in that case we must add two more things to our picture of the murderer it must be someone who knew mr ackroyd had bought the dictaphone someone with the necessary mechanical knowledge to attach a timer then we came to the footprints on the windowsill here was my conclusion those prints were made by someone deliberately trying to put suspicion on ralph paton to test this it was necessary to discover certain facts one pair of ralphs shoes had been taken from the three boars by the police neither ralph nor anyone else could have worn them that evening since they were downstairs being cleaned according to the police theory ralph was wearing another pair of the same kind and it was true that he had two pairs now for my theory to be proved correct the murderer had to wear ralphs shoes that evening in which case ralph must have been wearing a third pair of footwear of some kind it was unlikely that he would have brought three identical pairs of shoes and the third pair of footwear was more likely to be boots i got your sister to make inquiries on this point emphasizing the color in order to hide the real reason for my asking you know the result of her investigations ralph paton had had a pair of boots with him the first question i asked him when he came to my house yesterday morning was what he was wearing on his feet on the night of the murder he replied at once that he had worn boots he was still wearing them having nothing else to put on so the murderer is someone who had the opportunity to take these shoes of ralph patons from the three boars that day and the murderer must have been a person who had the opportunity to take that dagger from the silver table so a person who was at the three boars earlier that day a person who knew ackroyd well enough to know that he had bought a dictaphone a person who was good at mechanical things who had the opportunity to take the dagger from the silver table before miss flora arrived who had with him a receptacle suitable for hiding the dictaphone such as a large black bag and who was alone in the study after the crime was discovered while parker was telephoning for the police in fact dr sheppard chapter twenty four and nothing but the truth there was complete silence for a minute and a half then i laughed youre mad i said no said poirot i am not mad it was the little discrepancy in time that first brought my attention to you right at the beginning you left the house at ten minutes to nine both by your own statement and that of parker and yet it was nine oclock when you passed through the lodge gates it was a cold night not an evening a man would want to walk slowly why had you taken ten minutes to do a five minutes walk all along i realized that we had only your statement that the study window was closed ackroyd asked you if you had done so he never looked to see supposing then that the study window was open supposing too that you killed ackroyd before you left then you go out of the front door and run round to the summerhouse you then take ralph patons shoes out of your black bag put them on walk through the mud in them and leave prints on the windowsill when you climb in you lock the study door on the inside and run back to the summerhouse then you change back into your own shoes and run down to the gate i did exactly the same things myself the other day it took ten minutes exactly then you went home which gave you your alibi since you had timed the dictaphone for halfpast nine my dear poirot i said what on earth had i to gain by murdering ackroyd safety it was you who was blackmailing mrs ferrars who knew more about mr ferrars death than his doctor when you spoke to me that first day in the garden you mentioned a legacy that you received about a year ago i have been unable to discover any trace of a legacy you had to invent some way to explain the twenty thousand pounds you blackmailed out of mrs ferrars money that has not done you much good you lost most of it in speculation and then you went back to mrs ferrars for more money and mrs ferrars took an unexpected way out of the torture you were putting her through you knew that if ackroyd learnt the truth he would have no mercy on you you were ruined and the telephone call i asked you have an explanation of that also i suppose that was my greatest problem when i discovered that a call had really been put through to you at first i believed that you had simply invented the story it was a very clever idea that you needed some excuse for arriving at fernly and finding the body and then getting the chance to remove the dictaphone on which your alibi depended i had a very vague idea of how it was done when i came to see your sister that first day and asked her which patients you had seen on friday morning among your patients that morning was the steward of an american liner who was leaving for liverpool by the train that evening and afterwards he would be on the atlantic ocean well out of the way i noted that the ss orion had sailed on saturday and having discovered the name of the steward i sent him a wireless message asking a certain question this is his reply you saw me receive just now he held out the message to me it ran as follows quite correct dr sheppard asked me to take a note to a patients house i was to ring him up from the station with the reply reply was no answer it was a clever idea said poirot the call was genuine but there was only one mans report as to what was actually said your own now remember what i said the truth goes to inspector raglan in the morning but because i admire and like your good sister i am willing to give you the chance of another way out there might be for instance an overdose of a sleeping drug you understand me but captain ralph paton must be proved innocent i suggest that you finish that very interesting manuscript of yours with the truth have you quite finished there is one more thing it would be most unwise of you to attempt to silence me as you silenced monsieur ackroyd that kind of business does not succeed against hercule poirot you understand my dear poirot i said smiling a little whatever else i may be i am not a fool i stood well well i said with a slight vain i must be off home thank you for a most interesting and instructive evening poirot also stood and bowed with his usual politeness as i went out of the room chapter twenty five apologia five am i am very tired but i have finished my hand aches from writing what a strange end to my manuscript i had planned for it to be published someday as the history of one of poirots failures strange how things work out poor old ackroyd he knew danger was close at hand and yet he never suspected me the dagger was a lastminute thought id brought a weapon of my own but when i saw the dagger in the silver table i thought how much better it would be to use a weapon that wasnt mine as soon as i heard of mrs ferrars death i wondered if she had told ackroyd everything before she died when i met him i thought that perhaps he knew the truth but that he was going to give me the chance to deny it so i went home and made my plans he had given me the dictaphone two days before to make a small adjustment to it i did what i needed to and took it up with me in my bag that evening when i looked round ackroyds study from the door i was quite satisfied nothing had been left undone the dictaphone was on the table by the window timed to switch on at ninethirty and the armchair was pulled out to hide it from the door i must admit that it gave me a shock to find parker just outside the door then later when the body was discovered and i sent parker to telephone for the police i put the dictaphone into my bag and pushed back the chair to its usual place i never dreamed that parker would notice that chair i wish i had known earlier that flora would say her uncle was alive at a quarter to ten that really puzzled me but my greatest fear all through has been caroline i have suspected she might guess it was strange the way she spoke that day of my being as weak as water well she will never know the truth i can trust poirot he and inspector raglan will manage it between them i would not like caroline to know she is fond of me and my death will bring her great sadness but sadness passes discovering that i am a murderer would live with her forever when i have finished writing i will put this manuscript in an envelope and address it to poirot and then what will it be veronal that would be a kind of justice not that i take any responsibility for mrs ferrars death it was the direct result of her own murderous actions i feel no pity for her i have no pity for myself either so let it be veronal but i wish hercule poirot had never retired from work and come here to grow vegetable marrows the end
