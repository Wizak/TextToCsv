frank merriwell juniors golden trail frank merriwell juniors golden trail or the fugitive professor by burt l standish chapter i dreams and omens look here you fellows cried ballard if i dont get this out of my system im going to explode it will only take a minute or two and go on and explode cut in clancy unfeelingly cant you see that chip and i are busy but this dream was a corker red and i for the love of mike pink i wish youd cork wait till the work out there is wound up and then you can wow how was that for a tackle chip three separate and distinct times there in the grand stand billy ballard had tried to tell his chums young frank merriwell and owen clancy of a dream he had the night before it seemed to have occurred to suddenly for the forenoon and part of the afternoon had slipped away without any attempt on ballards part to rehearse the fancies that had afflicted him in his sleep but now he was feverishly eager and the rebuffs he took from the annoyed clancy only exasperated him it was hardly an opportune moment however to talk dreams and omens merry was wrapped up in a practice game of football and was alternately scrutinizing players and hastily jotting down notes with a pencil clancy was not making any memoranda but snappy work on the gridiron was claiming his full attention with a sigh of resignation ballard bottled up his remarks and sat back on the hard boards only merry and his two chums were in the grand stand the practice game was between the regular ophir athletic club eleven and a scrub team it had been put on for franks exclusive benefit for two straight years the o a c had gone down to inglorious defeat before their rivals from gold hill thirtysix to nothing on last thanksgiving day and the sting of those defeats had made ophir pessimistic and their eleven a joke another thanksgiving day was less than two months ahead and the ophir fellows were turning to merriwell for help they felt that if any one could pick an eleven from the club members and round them into winning form it was he and he alone this was not the first practice game staged for merriwell the first one had degenerated into a farce for the spirit of fun had taken untimely grip of the players and a promising exhibition had gone to pieces on a reef of horseplay spink and handy for the club had waited upon merry and tendered apologies and a second game had been arranged circumstances over which merry had had little control had kept him away from that second game and now four days later the ophir eleven were gallantly retrieving themselves the two teams had ranged themselves across the field and a scrub foot had booted the oval well down toward the regulars goal a nervous full back waited to receive that opening kick while his teammates rushed at him to form their flying screen of interference the ball evaded the arms that reached for it while another back fell on it and kept it clear of the clutches of a scrub end frank scrawled a note on the paper that lay on his knee thats leversee he remarked but i think hell steady down that scrub end is faster than a streak of greased lightning chip commented the admiring clancy good material what presently came the first scrimmage and a regular half back all beef and brawn went down in a flurry the scrub defense was like a stone wall it was the second down and four yards to gain the regular interferers dashed to get around one end of the line but were flung to right and left and the runner dropped more than a yard short of the required distance the regular full back retreated for a punt fast and far the ball sailed into the scrub field which proved that the backs feet were not nervous no matter if his hands and arms had been a trifle unsteady bully muttered frank and scrawled another notation the scrubs going up against the regulars defense found it impossible to make any decisive gains vigor and rocklike endurance marked the clashes and both regulars and scrubs had to punt and punt again fake plays were riddled by swift and sagacious end rushes for one side or the other hurling attacks against the center were crushed and flung back and more and more as the battle raged it became evident that the regular eleven while good were no whit better than the scrubs the fight in the first half was carried into the last minute of the play the whistle separated the combatants and neither side had scored during the interval that followed ballard sought to tell his dream merriwell and clancy however were in close and earnest conversation regarding the players and had no time for anything not connected with the game with material like that to choose from chip said clancy it ought not to be much of a trick to select an eleven that would put it all over gold hill from all i can hear clan merry answered the gold hill bunch is a fast one i dont know what we can do the ophirites are liable to hit their funny bone in the last half and turn the performance into a farce comedy never again chip once was enough what happens once is always liable to happen again frank answered although im hoping for the best his fears were not realized the last half of the game although faulty in spots was on the whole a creditable performance merriwell was more than pleased when spink and handy dusty and breathless halted on their way to the showers and the dressing rooms to ask his opinion merry gave them the praise that was their due we can make up an eleven here that ought to do things to gold hill fellows said he they say that gold hill is so sure of getting our scalps for the third time said spink that they havent begun their fall work which makes everything look all the brighter for ophir laughed frank too much confidence is worse than not enough you seem to think that i can help you although i its a cinch you can help us broke in handy wasnt your father the star coach at yale a slight frown crossed franks face dont try to pin any of dads medals on me handy said frank i didnt inherit any of his couching ability dad gave me a good clean bringingup ever since ive been old enough to waddle he has made me stand on my own feet if you fellows are bound that i can help you ill give some suggestions and do my best ill get the suggestions in shape and give them to you in a day or so the regulars and scrubs who had grouped themselves at a little distance behind spink and handy gave a delighted cheer frank putting away his pencil and paper smiled as he watched them trot away toward the gym now said ballard with a show of injured dignity i wonder if you fellows can spare a little of your valuable time whats biting you pink inquired frank its a dream said clancy derisively pink has been seeing things at night and he has been boiling over to tell us about it ever since this practice game started why dont you get a dream book you crazy chump he added to ballard and figure the visions out for yourself or a joke book said frank you can do about as much figuring from that as from anything else oh blazes exclaimed ballard dont make light of this dream i just happened to remember since we reached this grand stand that ive had it three nights in succession when a dream comes to you three times like that its supposed to mean something sure agreed clancy wagging his head it means that for three nights you have er eaten not wisely but too well hows that chip pretty good eh he straightened up looked grave and went on to ballard dreams william are the result of tantrums in the tummy you load up a suffering organ with grub thats so rich it affects the imagination consequently when the razmataz in a state of coma projects itself into the medulla oblongata ballard yelling wildly made a jump for clancy merry however had already taken hint in hand that sounds too much like professor phineas borredaile said frank call off the dog clan and he smothered his redheaded chum and pushed him down on the hard boards ill be good chip murmured clancy in a stilted voice take your hands off my face and let me breathe frank released him with a laugh and clancy smoothed himself out i was only expounding explained the redheaded chap and now that the prof isnt around to do it a substitute has to take hold pink isnt the only one who has taken a foolish powder said merry and talking about phineas what do you suppose the old fossil is up to clancy went on just a shade of anxiety sifting into his tones its four days now since he suddenly made up his mind to go over gold hill what did he go for and why is he staying away we havent heard a word from him since he left merriwell looked serious all that has been bothering me clan he acknowledged since we found the prof in that deserted mining camp and helped him file a location on that mining claim were responsible for him in a way he need looking after and we havet been on the job at all after you disappeared mysteriously the other night remarked clancy mr bradlaugh had an idea that you had gone over to gold hill to see the prof mr bradlaugh called up the bristow hotel at the hill and talked with borrodaile he said he hadnt seen you on i know about that merry interrupted that was four days ago and we havent seen borrodaile nor had a word from him since honest fellows im getting worried before we started out here this afternoon i asked mr bradlaugh to try and get the prof on the phone and to ask him when he intended coming back to ophir until i hear from dad in answer to that letter i sent the night i was taken out to the bar z ranch i wont know what were expected to do with the prof meanwhile weve got to keep an eye on him hes the sole owner of a rich mining claim and hes about as capable of looking after his interests as a blanket indian thats right assented clancy borrodaile can tell you all about the jurassic period and can give you the complete history of the neanderthal man from a to izizard but ill guarantee to sell him a gold brick in five minutes as for business well he doesnt know any more about ordinary everyday business than a er troglodyte whatever that is my dream was about the professor struck in ballard merry and clancy turned at that and gave their chum some attention come over with it pink said frank theres nothing in the dream of course but the fact that the professor figured in it proves you were fretting a little on his account yourself well it was like this returned ballard glad that the opportunity had finally come to relieve his mind i seemed to be back in that pile of ruins that used to be happenchance the playedout mining camp from that claim of the professors stretched a row of nuggets clear from the picket post mountains to gold hill they were big nuggets too running all the way from one the size of my hat to a whole lot as big as a washtub whew grinned clancy go on pink dont mind me the nuggets proceeded ballard frowning at clancy were arranged like steppingstones one here another a few feet beyond and another beyond that and so on regular golden trail laughed clancy that was some dream pink the professor resumed ballard was running along the trail hat off his bald head glimmering in the sun and the tails of his long coat flying out behind three or four nuggets behind him running after him as fast as they could go were several hardlooking citizens thats about all for three times now ive seen the prof chased over that golden trail by desperadoes ive never be able to see how the chase came out for always just at the critical moment id wake up what do you think of it before frank could answer some one appeared in the clubhouse door across the athletic field from the grand stand and trumpeted merriwells name through his hands hello answered frank getting up and shouting mr bradlaugh wants you on the phone came the answer without delaying frank leaped the rail in front of him and sprinted for the clubhouse ballard and clancy followed but at a more leisurely pace that dream of yours pink averred clancy on the way across the field was a happenchance like the old playedout town we found in the picket posts ballard merely grunted it was plain that he had his own ideas on the subject of that dream on reaching the clubhouse the two lads found merry just coming away from the telephone his face was clouded and there was an anxious light in his eyes whats wrong chip inquired clancy borrodaile isnt in gold hill was the answer he left the bristow hotel three days ago and hasnt been seen since chapter ii the telegram from bloomfield professor phineas borrodaile had for years been an instructor in an academy in the middle west his health failing he was ordered to arizona the dry invigorating climate had worked wonders in thousands of cases similar to the professors and there was every reason to believe that the professor would be greatly benefited if not entirely cured of his malady at the last moment before starting borrodaile had happened to think of an old letter from a nephew of his who had been engaged in the mining business in a camp called happenchance in southern arizona the professor looked up the letter the writer of it had died years before and the camp of happenchance had had its day and was now deserted and lost among the picket post mountains what made the letter of especial interest to the professor was the fact that it gave the location of a ledge of gold not far from the old happenchance placerings a bee began buzzing in the professors bonnet it was this he would get out of the world in the old lost camp he would recover his health by living the primitive life also being next of kin to his late nephew he would find and possess himself of the ledge of gold some months after professor borrodaile had put his plan into execution young merriwell received a letter from his father in bloomfield rather mysteriously requesting him to pay a visit to the lost town of the picket posts and to report at length upon anything he might find in the only habitable building of the camp aided by a prospector named nick porter frank and his chums visited happenchance and there found the professor they had adventures in helping the professor get his location notice on file and only merrys fleetness of foot and good judgment saved a prospective bonanza mine for borrodaile very strangely the professor had left ophir for gold hill not many hours after he had come with frank and his friends from gold hill to ophir the youngsters were not his guardians however and did not feel authorized to interfere too much in his affairs merry thought it best to go slow in the matter until a reply had been received to the report which he had sent to his father six days or a week would be required in forwarding a letter to bloomfield and receiving a letter in reply meanwhile four days had elapsed and borrodaile had dropped completely out of sight knowing the professor to be inexperienced in business affairs merriwell had begun to worry about him there were unscrupulous men in plenty who would not hesitate to take advantage of him with the idea of securing his very valuable mining claim the telephone message from mr bradlaugh therefore was quite disturbing ah ha exclaimed ballard when merriwell reported the professor missing from gold hill so you think theres nothing in that dream of mine eh this news from gold hill shows that it amounts to something what the mischief do you think is going on chip asked clancy im up in the air and havent an idea replied frank mr bradlaugh asked me to come over to his office in town for a conference well have to hit the golden trail declared ballard and run it out to a finish weve got to be mighty quick about it too or theres no telling what will happen to the old prof show us your nuggets as big as washtubs pink grinned clancy and im willing to begin to sprint the dream was only a warning it didnt suggest what we were to do or how were to go about it but just gives us a hunch that borrodaile needs help thats the trouble with dreams theres too much guesswork about em if you have one and something happens that seems to tally with it why youre apt to take it for granted that you had a hunch ill bet youve had thousands of dreams about things that never happened and yet here youre picking out one that appears to jibe with the profs absence from gold hill and trying to make us think its a warning stuff youre too free with your snap judgments red said ballard solemnly but wait a while and youll change your tune merriwell was already on his way out of the clubhouse clancy and ballard gave up their discussion and hurried after him the clubhouse and athletic field were less than a mile from the town of ophir and the three friends were soon jogging along through the sand on their way to mr bradlaughs office bradlaugh was president of the o a c and western representative of the syndicate that owned the big mine and stamp mill to the south of town it was the mine that had made the straggling settlement of ophir a possibility it will be at least two days more before i can hear from dad merry remarked just as they struck into the main street of the camp and before we interfere too much with the professor i think we ought to learn from headquarters just how far we ought to go oh bother that exclaimed clancy if the old boys in danger chip we cant hang back waiting to hear from bloomfield sure we cant were making a guess though when we figure that he is in any sort of trouble just because he cant be located is no sign hes shooting the trouble chutes yes it is averred ballard stoutly that dream i oh cut out the dreams and forebodings pink broke in frank were dealing with facts now and not with a lot of bunk superstitions that dream had become ballards hobby and he was in a fair way of riding it to death although he was easy going and rather lazy when circumstances gave him the chance to be yet he straightened suddenly at franks sharp fling at his delusion and was on the point of flashing a keen retort before he could speak however frank had turned in at bradlaughs office mr bradlaugh sat at his desk smoking a cigar he welcomed the lads cordially and waved them to chair what do you think about borrodaile frank he asked coming right down to the main subject i think was the prompt answer that he has a head thats stuffed with knowledge but its not the sort of knowledge that will help him hang on to that bonanza mining claim of his my motion to a t y ty he can go back to caesars time and tell you how the old romans used to do business but hes as innocent as a babe in arms about the way business is done in this day and age of the world he needs looking after or some one will get that claim of his for a song and then forget the singing part have you any idea why he went back to gold hill after he had just come from there no sir that was the night and a flicker of a smile crossed merrys face when i went out to the bar z ranch and before i had left i didnt know he had gone hum mr bradlaugh sat back in his chair and peered into the vapor that floated above his head boys said he when he finally lowered his eyes i have a feeling that some one is trying to victimize this professor of yours in other words that evil forces are at work to swindle him out of his claim or perhaps to get it in some way even more desperate i dont want to alarm you unnecessarily but its the part of wisdom to consider this matter in the worst light possible and then to go to work alon g that line if were mistaken in our conclusions well and good better that you know than to think nothing is wrong to let matters drift and then to find that the professor has been swindled or he hesitated or that he has disappeared never to return all three of the boys at that gave a jump of consternation great scott exclaimed clancy you dont have any idea that the harmless old fossil has been put out of the way no was the reply and yet there are people who would put him out of the way if by so doing they could show up with a quitclaim deed to that wonderfully rich gold mine if the professor were gone for good you see no one would appear to question the validity of the legal document such things have been done i mention it in this case merely as a possibility then again we have to consider it as a case of mere swindling the professor i think could easily he victimized my most hopeful view is this that borradaile has simply gone off somewhere without any plotters tagging to his heel and that he will present himself in due course with the claim still in his possession it is best though to put the worst construction on his absence then if my last theory proves correct we shall all be happily disappointed frank drew a deep breath i havent felt like butting into the profs affairs too much said he until i hear from dad i think youre amply warranted in going ahead and looking for him said bradlaugh sure what would you do mr bradlaugh go over to gold hill and try to pick up some clews there that might be advisable just at present however i have another line of investigation in mind i dont suppose you have forgotten nick porter the old prospector who took you out to the deserted camp in the picket posts clancy began to laugh its a cinch said he that well never forget old silent porter and his whisky bottle i suppose he used the fifty dollars chip paid him to grubstake himself and that hes now in the deserts looking for a mine thats what he wanted the fifty for answered bradlaugh but after he got it he seems to have delayed going into the hills next day after you lads got back from happenchance porter went to gold hill the spree he had there on that fifty has been the talk of the town hes a disreputable old chap when in his cups and im wondering if he knows anything about borrodailes disappearance by jove exclaimed merry i wouldnt put it past him any he was with us when we came back from happenchance and i remember now just how he looked when he saw a sample of the wiregold ore he was ready to throw a fit said ballard because he had been all through the picket post range and had never found any gold there ill bet a farm you can nail this thing to nick porter dont be hasty about that warned bradlaugh its only a theory and i believe every man ought to be considered as honest until he proves himself otherwise porter is merely a subject for investigation thats all then said frank promptly well go over to gold hill this very night and begin investigating him you wont have to go to gold hill ive heard from our super at the mine that porter returned here this afternoon looking a good deal the worse for wear after supper you can visit the mine and have a talk with the prospector youll know what angle to give your investigations merriwell but he may pull out for the hills while were delaying here in town hell have to get money for another grubstake before he goes any more prospecting even if he has the money which is hardly possible the super on my orders will delay him if he tries to leave here was a sample of mr bradlaughs thoughtfulness which merry deeply appreciated well be at the mine this evening mr bradlaugh said he and if porter knows anything about the professors absence well do our best to find out what it is my car would be at your disposal but just now its in the repair shop went on mr bradlaugh there are a couple of motor cycles at the mine though if you find it necessary to go anywhere in a hurry pardo the super will be glad to let you take the machines frank thanked mr bradlaugh for the offer and started to leave just a moment said the older man how did the boys shape up in the practice game fine merriwell answered i suppose after you have located the professor and extricated him from any troubles he may have fallen into youll do your best to give us an eleven that will make the gold hillers eat crow instead of turkey for thanksgiving there was a twinkle in mr bradlaughs eyes as he spoke ill do what i can mr bradlaugh merry answered you may depend on that i am depending on it it seems to me that the son of the greatest baseball pitcher and football half back yale ever produced is well qualified to give ophir a winning eleven good luck to you and your friends merriwell wind tip this business of the professors as soon as you can and then get back on the football job if i can help you in any way call on me as frank after murmuring further thanks was about to step through the office door woo sing roustabout chinaman at the ophir house stepped up on the porch with a yellow envelope in his hand whoosh gabbled woo sing his parchmentlike face splitting in a wide grin my lookee fo you missul melliwell is that telegram for me demanded frank allee same answered the chinaman passing it over frank tore open the envelope and read the message then with a long whistle he returned to put it in mr bradlaughs hands mr bradlaugh read as follows frank merriwell junior care ophir house ophir ariz via gold hill good work watch borradaile carefully dont let him out of your sight important letter on the way your father mr bradlaugh also gave a long whistle as he sank back in his chair thoughtfully and with the message in his hand chapter iii porter shows his teeth it was eight oclock in the evening when merry clancy and ballard reached the mine and went hunting for the office of pardo the superintendent the surface activities of a big gold mine in full operation at night are as weird as they are interesting the boys were deeply impressed as they looked down into the valley where the mining milling and cyaniding were going on the stamp mill where the ore was pounded to powder and robbed of its gold was a huge ramshackle structure although it had a framework of heavy timbers yet the strong skeleton was but loosely covered with boards through wide cracks and many gaps in the sides of the building a flood of light poured out and the thunder of a hundred stamps filled the camp glimmering lights dotted the shadowy depths of the valley some shining through the windows of rough dwellings and others moving about in the hands of workers from the open door of a blacksmith shop poured a yellow glow from a forge and against the roar of the stamps arose the musical clink of hammer on anvil this blacksmith shop happened to be the first building the boy passed on entering the camp they stopped and asked the smith where they would find the superintendents office the brawny fellow turned from the anvil stepped to the door and pointed theres the supers office younker he said to frank where ye see them two lights close together mebby hes there an mebby hes over to town anyways the assistant super is on deck a person had to shout in order to make himself heard in the steady tumult of the mill frank bawled his thanks and he and his two comrades pressed on toward the twin lights indicated by the blacksmith these lights it was presently discovered came through two windows of a small office building a man was sitting out in front tilted comfortably back in a chair and smoking a pipe he was a vague figure in the shadows and the visitors could not see very much of him is this mr pardos office frank inquired stepping close to the man and lifting his voice youve struck it was the sociable rejoinder are you mr pardo the superintendent strike two my lad well my names merriwell and i and youve come here for a talk with that old hassayamper nick porter finished pardo mr bradlaugh has put me next the super laughed i suppose you know what a brilliant talker the prospector is unless violently agitated about the only audible sound porter ever made was a grunt we know all about that frank answered well continued the super after the way he went off the handle in gold hill he seems to be less talkative than usual and less audible he added whenever he bobs up in ophir he makes it a rule to hang out in this camp mainly because one of our crusherman on the night shift is an old friend of his but hes a crusty old curmudgeon and i never hanker much to have him around hes up in the head of the mill with joe bosley now come on merriwell and ill show you and your friends where to find this precious prospector the obliging superintendent got out of his comfortable chair and started along a camp trail that led up a steep incline along the top of the rise showed one side of the mill glowing ruddily against the night sky here there was a long elevated platform upon which ore from the mine was unloaded a man could be seen moving spectrally around and shoveling ore into a crusher set in the mill wall pardo paused halfway up the low hill and drew merriwell toward him thats bosley the crusherman said he hell tell you where you can find porter bring the prospector to my office if you like it isnt quite so noisy as the mill and you can talk to better advantage the super turned and went back frank and his friends moved on to the ore platform jumped to the top of it and yelled their query at bosley nick the crusherman bawled leaning for a moment on his shovel and appraising the boys as well as he could oh hes communin with himself in the feed loft right through that hole he finished pointing to an opening in the wall and down the steps frank led the way through the opening and at the foot of the steps he and his chums found themselves in a small inferno the bright shimmering stems of twenty batteries each of five stamps were marking time before their eyes like a row of steel soldiers each stamp weighed eight hundred and fifty pounds and it rose and fell ninetyfive times to the minute the uproar was steady and deafening ore feeders were shoveling crushed ore into the stamp hoppers franks eyes ranged over the sweating seminude powerful figures as they worked he could see nothing of nick porter while franks eyes were searching the loft clancy nudged him with an elbow frank turned and clancy made signs and pointed looking in the direction indicated by clancys finger frank saw the slouching form of porter the prospector he was sitting on a keg in an angle of the wall he was leaning back against the boards behind him a cob pipe between his teeth his eyes peering out of the jungle of beard that covered his face were fixed speculatively on the three boys merry immediately stepped to the prospectors side hello porter he yelled in his ear the prospector probably grunted although frank could hear nothing i want to talk with you for a few minutes merry went on in a manner calculated to disarm any suspicions porter may have had come up to the supers office will you he stepped back the prospector sat still on the keg for a moment then slowly knocked the ashes from his pipe and stood up frank was congratulating himself that porter was to make for pardos office without any further persuasion but in this he was mistaken clancy stood on the prospectors right merry in front of him and ballard on the left between the spot where porter was standing and the opening that led into the feed loft the prospector slipped his pipe into his pocket moving in a slow sluggish way that suggested weariness he was not weary however suddenly without warning of any sort he put out one arm and threw clancy sideways so that he fell over a heap of crushed stone another moment and porter had leaped for a flight of stairs and had vanished downward into the body of the mill it was all so quickly done that frank was taken by surprise the thought flashed through his mind that porter unless he knew something about professor borrodaile and suspected why the boys were there would not be showing his teeth in that fashion an instant after the prospector had disappeared down the stairs frank jumped after him ballard followed close on franks heels and clancy hastily picking himself up stifled an exclamation of anger and rushed after ballard the stairs led down to the floor where the boxes were placed and where the plates whose silver recovered the gold from the ore stretched the length of the mill amalgamators and batterymen were going and coming through all the pounding racket of this part of the establishment but the prospector had somehow managed to lose himself so suddenly and completely had porter disappeared that it seemed little short of magical frank took three or four steps from the foot of the stairs peering along the row of plates covered with dirty water from the battery boxes and looking back into the shadowy recesses under the ore loft he was asking himself if porter would have had time to get away into the darkness back of the batteries when a redshirted amalgamator stepped to his side lookin fer porter he yelled frank nodded he ducked out o the door yonder and the amalgamator with a jerk of his thumb indicated an opening that led out into the night ballard was nearest the door he had heard the amalgamator and whirled like lightning and dashed out of the mill and into the darkness frank was tight at his heels while clancy brought up the rear of the little file of pursuers the noise was not so deafening outside the mill but the boys were blinded temporarily by their quick transition from the bright glow of the mill to the outer gloom they stared around them but could see nothing of the prospector ballard however heard something or other which gave him a clew this way he shouted frank heard his chums feet swiftly crunching the sand and gravel and followed the sound in a moment or two his vision cleared somewhat and he was able to see several rows of huge wooden tanks a plank incline led to the top of one row and ballard could be distinguished racing up the incline beyond ballard traveling at speed over a plank gangway that spanned the tanktops was a burly figure silhouetted against the lighter gloom of the night with a shout to clancy merriwell hustled after ballard those tanks were part of the cyanide plant wherein the refuse of the mill was treated with deadly cyanide of potassium for recovering what little gold was left after the refuse or tailings had come from the stamp mill the cyanide plant presumably was familiar ground to porter whereas the boys had never seen it before in the gloom the prospector could navigate across the big vats with something like accuracy while the boys carried on their pursuit at a tremendous disadvantage recklessly ballard ran on merriwell called a warning to him but ballard either did not hear it or else paid no attention the form of the prospector leaping and plunging onward sprang from one row of vats to another each row was a little lower than the row to the north so that the tiers took on the form of a flight of giant steps porter gained the top tier and stood for a moment on a plank spanning a vat that was three or four times as large as any of the others ballard climbed to the same plank porter dropped down with a savage snarling cry clinging for a moment to the edge of the tank he twisted the plank from under ballards feet ballard dropped with a splash merciful powers yelled a voice in wild alarm get him out quick thats the solution tank and is filled with cyanide merriwells heart almost stopped beating in a gleam of light from the mill he saw the white drawn face of pardo peering toward the spot where ballard was splashing in the deadly cyanide solution an instant later he bounded to the rescue chapter iv a close call just one thing saved ballard from going over his head into the cyanide solution and that was this porter had not twisted the plank off the rim of the tank but had manipulated it in such a way as to cause ballard to lose his footing and drop into the poisonous liquid beneath as ballard dropped he flung out his arms seized the plank and so kept head and shoulders out of the cyanide had he gone under or swallowed even a few drops of the deadly stuff that pursuit of the savage prospector would have had a tragic termination ballard kicking around in the solution was trying to drag himself up on the plank as merry crept toward him steady there pink called frank dont splash the stuff around and keep out of it as much as you can its a deadly poison never mind me cried ballard keep after that confounded prospector hell get away if you dont you first old chap frank answered it has a scurvy trick porter played on you and and it might have resulted fatally now then gripping his chum by the arms frank heaved him upward until he was on his knees on the plank want any help came the agitated voice of clancy from just below the solution tank no answered merriwell were making it all right drop him over the side called pardo here over in this direction theres a tank of clear water next to the solution vat and the quicker your friend rinses that cyanide out of his clothes the better oh hang the cyanide shouted ballard i was only half into the stuff anyhow stop porter if you can the brute is guilty of something or he wouldnt act like that drop into that tank of water pink ordered merry or ill throw you in ballard without further discussion lowered himself down into the reservoir of water that supplied the mill and kicked around in it for a few moments then drawing himself up on the rim of the vat he jumped off to the ground at the superintendents side merry and clany quickly joined him say cried the startled pardo grabbing ballard by the arm did you swallow any of the solution how could i was the answer i only went in to the waist got any cuts or sores on the lower part of your body no by gorry declared pardo youre a lucky kid all right cyanide of potassium is the most virulent poison known if a person scratches his finger on the tin in opening a case and gets some of the solution in the cut in less than fifteen minutes hes a goner you dont know son how much youve got to be thankful for now that it was all over and ballard was beginning to realize how deadly was the bath in which he had been plunged a few cold shivers started up and down his spine my skin is getting up and walking all over me with cold feet said he ive got to warm up and right now theres only one thing i want and that is to get my hands in porters whiskers and twist his neck lets hotfoot it around and see if we can find him this way my lads shouted pardo if the thing has happened that ive got in my mind theres no use in hunting around this camp for the prospector well find out in a brace of shakes with pardo leading the way the boys ran to a corral on the other side of the camp pardo stopped the corral gate was swinging open that looks he commented as though some one had taken out a horse in a hurry ill just go in and see if porters horse is tied in its usual place if it isnt why we can make up our minds that just at that moment a man approached from the corral the boys jumped forward instinct spelled by the thought that it might be porter but it was not that you cummins called the super yep pardo its cummins was the answer seen anything of nick porter jest about say nick porter stormed in here a minute ago got the gear on his bronk in record time an was off and away afore i could git close enough to find out what was up which way did he go demanded frank toward town nary i rushed around the corral jest in time to see him pintin for pete locos which is right the other way from town hes made a getaway boys said pardo and you might as well give him up were not going to give him up frank answered decidedly weve got to keep after him and run him down its its important well now protested the super youd better think twice about that porter has shown that he wont stop at anything he dont want to talk with you does he hes shown his teeth once next time he does that hell probably bite and bite hard well look out for ourselves put in the impatient clancy hes the fellow we want chip why did he turn on us as he did if he hasnt a guilty mind you think spoke up pardo that he knows what has become of your friend the professor mr bradlaugh told me over the phone he explained why you wanted to talk with porter its a cinch strikes me answered merry that porter can tell us something about the missing prof wouldnt you figure it out that way mr pardo well yes acknowledged the superintendent i dont know but i would what im trying to get at is this old nick porter has proved that he isnt a safe proposition for you boys to tackle you dont know us mr pardo laughed clancy that wasnt a fair shake the prospector gave us on top of those cyanide tanks we ought to keep right after him if we come close well land on him by strategy thats the talk red approved ballard through his chattering teeth ill furnish the strategy if chip should fall down on it lets get to moving three horses mr pardo if you can spare em you havent the slightest notion where porter is going said the super plainly disapproving the plan of the boys to follow porter and marshaling every argument he could against it where can he go along that trail toward pete locos returned frank there are only two places the trail leads to one is locos and the other is mcgurvins the trail stops at mcgurvins we havent a horse for you all thats left in the corral is the prospectors pack burro how about the two motor cycles frank asked mr bradlaugh said you had a couple of the machines here and that we would be welcome to them if we found theyd come handy well yes said pardo ive got the motor cycles if you insist on going after the prospector you can take them but theyll only carry two one of you will have to stay behind well draw straws red and i to see who stays chattered ballard no you wont cut in merry firmly pink youve done enough for one night and have thrown a scare into me that i wont get over in a hurry you want to warm up and the best way for you to do that is to sprint for town kick off those cyanidesoaked clothes and get into bed now look here ballard protested im just as able to go on with this chase as either you or red ive got an ax of my own to grind too remember chip im the one that porter dropped into the solution tank the prospector owes me something for that let clancy go back to the hotel youre as wet as a drowned rat pink struck in clancy and if you dont go back to town chip and i will worry our heads off about you oh yes youll worry a lot derided ballard the excitement is just beginning and im entitled to a little of it there are only two motor cycles pink argued merry so only two of us can go ill ride the burro suggested ballard desperately and wed go to the picket posts and back while you were getting to locos laughed clancy you for town pink dont hang back maybe youll dream some more you go to blazes growled ballard seeing that the argument was already decided against him and that his protests were only delaying the pursuit where are the machines mr pardo asked merry this way the super answered and led the boys to an adobe storehouse not far from the corral the motor cycles proved to be twincylinder highpowered machines theyre loaded with gasoline and oil said pardo for we always keep them in trim for an emergency the gas lamps attached to the front of the motor cycles were lighted and two penciled gleams searched out the ground far in advance porter has a good long start of us remarked clancy an exultant note in his voice but on these buzz buggies we ought to be able to travel a dozen yards to his one i dont know whether i ought to let you go said pardo id go on one of the machines myself if the assistant superintendent wasnt away so that i am needed here what will mr bradlaugh say merriwell laughed at the supers foolish fears mr bradlaugh knows us better than you do mr pardo he answered and hell say you did just right to let us have the machines and take up the chase where we dropped it at the cyanide tanks merry astride his wheel was cranking with the pedals the engine began to pop and sputter and was finally crooning its steady song of speed clancy had likewise turned his own engine over i wish you luck anyhow said pardo well find that golden trail of yours pink joked clancy and bring you one of the nuggets as a souvenir just bring back your scalp red answered ballard thats all the souvenir i want frank dropped a foot and give his machine a hunch forward the pneumatic tires touched ground the iron rests folded up automatically and he started through the gloom toward the trail that led to pete locos a moment later clancy darted after him chapter v on to happenchance the boys were not long in discovering that the two motor cycles they were riding were fine machines with the searchlights boring long holes in the dark merry and clancy seemed fairly to fly over the trail it seemed to them as though they had hardly started before the mass of deep shadow which marked the location of locos adobe lay almost in front of them on the right the house was dark frank after getting out of the saddle examined his watch under the lamp ten oclock he announced to clancy the loco family must all be in bed clan rout some one out chip said clan and see if you can pick up any news while youre doing that ill skirmish around and see if there is a recently ridden horse at petes hitching pole or in his corral frank crossed the open space that lay between the road and the adobe and drummed on the front door with his knuckles after two or three attempts he succeeded in arousing some one who demanded to know what was wanted i want a word with pete loco frank called the door was unbolted and drawn open revealing a swarthyvisaged man in shirt and trousers holding a candle what in blazes dye want asked the man with the candle in no very pleasant tone im pete loco any visitors staying with you tonight mr loco frank inquired i reckon not think this heres a hotel im looking for a prospector named porter the last we saw of him he was coming in this direction nick porter hes over to the mine seen him there this afternoon hes not there now he left the mine and came this way well i havent seen him an he aint here with that pete loco shut the door and frank could hear him shoot the bolt turning away frank met clancy just coming around the corner of the house loco says he doesnt know anything about our man clancy reported frank i guess hes telling the truth chip clancy replied i cant find any extra live stock around and its hardly possible anyhow that porter would stop such a short distance from the mine its a safe bet that hes gone on to mcgurvins frank was in a quandary this adobe said he is at the forks of the trail one branch goes to the mine and ophir and the other leads to gold hill its just possible that porter took the gold hill fork and didnt go on to mcgurvins he wouldnt do that chip clancy answered if he had wanted to go to gold hill he would have turned north from the mine and taken the shorter road through ophir unless frank qualified he had reasons for not wanting to pass through ophir porter might have thought that we would use the telephone if he went that way and have some one stop him tell you what we can do clancy suggested taken somewhat with merrys logic and yet not quite satisfied to recede from his own position we can go on to mcgurvins then if we dont overhaul porter on the road or pick up any clews at mcgurvins we can come back and take the gold hill fork from here we can get over the ground like an express train with these machines and can ride circles all around that horse that carried the prospector away from the mine good agreed frank well see how long it will take us to get to mcgurvins its only seven or eight miles hit er up chip cried the redheaded chap you wont find me taking any of your dust once more they got their machines in motion along the trail the going was none too good and merry got his machine going at a pace that might have been reckless had not the brilliant farflung rays of the searchlight laid the way so clearly before his eyes that the best you can do called clancy whirring along at his chums side this will do frank answered were not on a boulevard remember clancy gave a laugh of sheer exhilaration for the thrill of that wild dash through the night and across the desert was in his veins well be running porter down before we can see him chip he called the wind of their flight casting his words behind him in splintering echoes but merriwell had no fear of that if nick porter had ridden hard he would already have had time to cover the distance between the mine and mcgurvins mcgurvins ranch was the last place short of happenchance in the picket post mountains where water could be secured surely if porter had come that way he would stop at the ranch he had left the mine too hurriedly to equip himself with water canteens and rations for a prolonged stay in the desert franks hopes were mounting high as the motor cycles devoured the distance that separated their riders front mcgurvins at last in fifteen or twenty minutes certainly less than half an hour the mad pace was slowed as the destination hove duskily into sight a yellow gleam showed at one of the windows of the ranch house and suggested that the proprietor might be entertaining a caller the machines were halted at a little distance from the dwelling and merry stole forward to reconnoiter ere announcing himself in person to mcgurvin there was no curtain at the window through which shone the lamplight and the lad crept up to it and looked into the room only one man was visible and that was the ranch owner himself he sat by a table reading i guess were off the track roper said frank rejoining clancy i cant see any one but mcgurvin through the window and hes spelling out the news in a paper if porter was there he and mcgurvin would certainly be together not so certainly chip answered chancy lets look in the corral for a tired horse if we find one then surely its porters and porter has got into the house and gone to bed only one horse and a burro were found and the horse showed no evidence of recent hard riding frank was deeply puzzled if the prospector came this way said he there would be nothing else for it but for him to stop here he wouldnt dare go on into the desert without foot and water possibly he stopped got what he wanted and went on clancy hazarded no clan we cant be much more than half an hour from the mine if we suppose that porter had a full hour the start of us it couldnt have been more than that then he had only an hour and a half to ride here and no time to pick up food and water and push his tired horse on into the desert wed better go back to locos and take the fork to gold hill lets not be in a rush chip now that were here wed better find out what mcgurvin has got to say of course frank returned well have a word or two with the rancher before we turn back the rancher was not surprised to have visitors drop in on him at that hour the better part of his income was derived from the sale of water brought up from his well by burro power to prospectors and others who happened along that way such customers were liable to straggle in from any quarter at any hour pears mighty like ive seen you fellers some place before said the rancher staring hard at the boys say and his face cleared wasnt you along this way a few days ago with barzy blunt an some more runnin some fool race or other he referred to the relay marathon which frank and his chums had run against blunt and his cowboy friends to file in gold hill a location notice of borrodailes claim yes smiled frank were the fellows well sufferin mike guffawed mcgurvin sot down an be sociable cant ye were in something of a hurry mcgurvin frank went on and cant stop long do you know a prospector named porter mcgurvins face went blank and he dug his fingers into his tousled hair not andy porter from up phoenix way he asked squints with his off eye and walks with a limp no frank answered this man is a big fellow whiskers ropy hair gray eyes new one on me said mcgurvin then you havent seen anything of him nary a thing whats he done stole a hoss we dont know what he has done mcgurvin all we want is to have a talk with him can you spare us a couple of canteens full of water and a bag of rations enough for two or three meals shore answered the rancher thats what im here fer dollar fer the water in the canteens an two dollars fer the canteens then another two dollars fer the handout makes five dont it mcgurvin had the reputation of being more or less of a robber having a monopoly of the water in that locality he set his own prices and did not fear competition five dollars is all right mcgurvin said frank blunt was out this way this afternoon with a couple his pards remarked mcgurvin unaware of the bomb was exploding they watered up rested a spell an hiked on to the picket posts merry was startled but contrived not to show it clancy jumped but his chum gave him a warning glance hustle around and get those supplies for us please urged frank were in a hurry hosses to water queried the rancher starting for a rear door no horses mcgurvin ottermobile i reckon deplored mccurvin if them things git too thick in the desert theyll be the ruination of me ill have yore stuff ready in ten minutes he went out through the door clancy leaped excitedly toward merriwell whats on your mind now chip he whispered why the grub and water i made up my mind all of a sudden to extend this of ours to happenchance youre crazy gasped clancy how can we find the way it would be hard enough in broad daylight but at night wed get all twisted up and end by losing ourselves in the foothills if were going to happenchance chip wed better camp right here until morning then cross the rough country when we can see what were about i had made up my mind to go on tonight merry answered even before mcgurvin told us that about barzy blunt gee but that was a bombshell what do you suppose blunt is doing out this way its possible he may know something about the professor why did he go on to the picket posts what business has barzy blunt got around the old camp of happenchance where the professors claim is located before mcgurvin told us blunt had gone in that direction i had made up my mind that we ought to take a look at the deserted town now that i know blunt is there i am more anxious than ever to get to the place but what about porter where he has gone is a mystery said merriwell but i think blunt and his cowboy friends offer a more promising clew to the profs whereabouts well forget about porter for the present and give our attention to blunt they talked in whispers for a short time longer and then sat back suddenly in their chairs as mcgurvin came into the room with two filled canteens and a small canvas bag of rations merry exchanged five silver dollars for the supplies and then the rancher followed the boys out and watched them while they started their machines a couple o gasoline godevils by thunder muttered mcgurvin all kinds o ways o beatin a man that sells water out o his rights if ye didnt have them contraptions yed be shackin along on a couple o bronks an my well ud bring me in two bits a head fer each of em the rancher was still sputtering as the boys raced off through the starlight heading into the desert as soon as they were well away mcgurvins wrath died in his throat and he gave vent to a husky chuckle on ter happenchance or im a piute he muttered jubilantly go it you crazy galoots but i opine ye wont find what yere alookin fer still chuckling he turned back into the house and pounded on a stovepipe that ran through the ceiling and into a room overhead have they gone mcgurvin came a muffled voice from above i reckon they have nick laughed the rancher they went pippitypoppin away each of em on a couple o wheels run by gasoline whered they go happenchance i reckon leastways they headed inter the desert pintin thataway a satisfied grunt echoed from above lucky i hitched yore bronk out in the scrub went on mcgurvin complacently ill bet aplenty them kids was nosin around afore they come in here but they didnt find nothin nary they didnt buenas noches mac called down the man upstairs im turnin in the words were followed by a faint echo of hoarse laughter mcgurvin caught up the sound with some heartiness as he locked the door blew out the light and went groping through the dark for his own bed chapter vi a startling discovery the entrance of barzy blunt into that mystifying tangle had been as sudden as it was unexpected and yet knowing blunt as he did merry wondered that he had not thought of the fellow before blunt was a young cowpuncher who boasted of being a homemade athlete and would take a back seat for nobody least of all young merriwell he was not exactly cracked on the subject of his prowess in athletic sports but his views were certainly warped obsessed with the idea that it was his duty to take merriwell down a peg blunt was continually and in the most weird and wonderful ways contriving to force merry into tests of strength and skill merry had shown blunt his heels in a hundredyard dash and at least once had put him on his back in a catchascatchcan wrestling bout it was at blunts suggestion that the relay marathon was run with the professors claim as the prize and it was by a plot of blunts that merry had been lured to the bar z ranch where as blunt had planned merry pitched against the cowboy in a baseball game frank and his chums had won the relay marathon and frank had pitched his cowboy team to victory yet blunt still refused to be satisfied the cowboy wonder as blunt called himself had been reared by a man who had implanted in his growing mind a vast array of false notions by these the wonder regulated his conduct with a result that was ludicrous at times and at other times almost tragic there was something about the queer fellow that young merriwell liked and yet while he sympathized with blunt to a certain extent he was forced to condemn his rashness and daredevil behavior clan said merry as he and his chums moved on into the trackless desert while i sat in mcgurvins adobe it flashed over me all at once that we had forgotten something about professor borrodaile which might possibly explain his absence what was that why you remember how we left happenchance in such a hurry the time we went to the place and found the prof we were chased out by blunt and his puncher friends not exactly we were hurrying out ahead of them in order to reach the automobile and beat blunt to gold hill with the professors location notice well we were in such a rush that professor borrodaile had to leave his luggage behind now wouldnt it be the natural thing to suppose that the prof returned to happenchance after his goods and chattels holy mackerel exclaimed clancy youve nicked it chip thats just what the harmless old fossil has done he wanted his trunk and he slipped out of gold hill and went after it were thick all right its a wonder that some of us didnt think of that earlier in the game i shouldnt be surprised if we found the prof back in his old place in the only house left in happenchance its possible said merry anyhow thats the idea that flashed through my mind as i sat talking with mcgurvin and thats the reason i contracted for the canteens the water and the rations then when mcgurvin said what he did about blunt i was more anxious than ever to keep on to happenchance what do you think blunt has got up his sleeve this time hes so full of wild ideas that theres no telling if the professor is in happenchance then blunt has some reason for following him there and out of it all chip declared clancy theres going to come a contest of some sort between you and blunt the fellows crazy on the subject of getting the better of you in some feat of strength and skill cant he ever be satisfied seems not frank answered sometimes i have a hunch that i ought to hang back and let blunt make a winning if thats what he wants why not humor him not on your life protested clancy promptly youve got to meet blunt at every point and trim him well i think hes yellow anyhow you and i will never agree on that said merry theres good stuff in barzy blunt and some day hes going to see the error of his way and reform when that happens youll find he has the making of an allround star athlete clancy muttered something under his breath whatever it was it certainty was not creditable to the cowboy wonder were getting into the hills observed clancy shifting the subject and now if we dont get lost it will be because your bump of location is a lot better than mine merry had the habit at all times of keen and careful observation he had made but one trip to the old camp of happenchance but circumstances at that time had conspired to fix the route to it firmly in his mind he had gone to the lost town of the picket posts in the bradlaugh car guided by nick porter but he had ridden back to mcgurvins on a horse accompanying the runners in the first lap of the relay race so he had been able to use his faculty of observation to some purpose could he follow the course by night with the mountains a constant guide by day all but blotted out in the starlight he believed he could and now the test of his confidence was at hand his keen eyes watched the ground as it ruffled into low foothills although he laid a zigzag course as his searchlight brought cactus clumps and thorn bushes into view in the main he succeeded in dodging obstacles and yet held to a fairly direct route a mound of rocks stark and almost shapeless in the gloom guided him like a fingerboard or a flattopped hill or a peculiarshaped valley between two uplifts set him on the right track mile by mile the black mountains came closer and then clancy himself began to pick up a landmark or two which he recognized chip he cried youre a wonder unless im badly mistaken we just passed the valley where we left the car when porter led you and ballard and i into the gap that cuts through the mountain wall to happenchance that was the valley clan replied merriwell and theres nothing very wonderful about getting back to it either its just a matter of minding your ps and qs and remembering a thing or two we couldnt take the car through the gap but i believe we can make it with these machines well go around the hills instead of over them then began a sinuous weaving back and forth following the seams in the uplifts and mounting steadily toward the narrow gap the pace was slow and labored but frank unerringly traced the way until the motorcyle lamps flung their round yellow eyes squarely into the fissure of the mountain wall maybe there isnt anything wonderful about this called clancy as frank led the way into the narrow passage but well it gets my goat poor old pink is missing the time of his life now if we can find borrodaile and jog him into a realization of where he is and what he has done well just about make a good nights work of it its a relief to know that the prof hasnt been in danger of being bunkoed out of his gold mine we dont know that yet frank called back over his shoulder dont take too much for granted red this move on happenchance may be putting us clear off the scent ill bet something it isnt said clancy with supreme conviction emerging from the pass the boys descended into a circular valley in whose center shapeless ruins covered all the oldtime glories such as they were of a once bustling mining camp the searchlights pierced the vast heap of debris and revealed the cluttered lane which had once been the towns main street carefully frank steered through the passage and came at last to a halt in front of the only four walls in the place that remained standing here was the building in which they had discovered professor phineas borrodaile living alone in primitive surroundings and trying to imagine him self a troglodyte hello professor shouted clancy his voice echoed back and forth between the cliffs that rimmed the valley but brought no answer not here he exclaimed in a voice of profound disappointment you really expected that yell would bring him frank asked i really did hang the luck say chip i guess the theory wont hold water the prof is still mysteriously absent after all merry had removed the lamp from his machine and was standing in front of the old door it was swinging by one rusty hinge and he pushed it wide open look out for snakes chip warned clancy cautiously the boys pushed through the doorway and into the room that lay beyond they looked around them as merry flashed the beam of light over the ruinous walls instinctively a gasp of surprise escaped them a cot had once stood at the side of the room and there had been an oil stove in the place and a shelf with some books a chair a trunk and a few other odds and ends of primitive housekeeping but now there was nothing every object had been cleaned out of the place and only the bare walls remained professor borrodaile isnt here clan said young merriwell presently but he has been here and made off with his plunder thats plain the question is where is the professor now it was a startling discovery the boys had made not in itself alone but in the question to which it had given rise chapter vii when dreams come true merry sat down on a chunk of adobe which had fallen out of the wall placing the lamp in the niche left by the chunk in its fall he hooked up a knee between his hands and grew thoughtful clancy found a seat for himself and waited for the result of his chums reflections he waited so long that he became impatient whats at the back of your head chip he asked there isnt a thing at the back of mine frank dropped his knee and looked at his watch its one oclock in the morning said he lets have lunch an ounce of grub is worth a pound of theory any old time said the redheaded fellow cheerfully ill lug in the canteens and the chuck bag he went out and returned with them and he and frank got busy with some sardine sandwiches crackers and cheese which mcgurvin had provided for a handout the water in the canteens was refreshing and likewise the fare rough though it was in the first place clan reasoned merry weve got to consider that it isnt exactly a cinch that borrodaile has been here its probable but not absolutely certain some desert arab may have raided the place and carted away his stuff not likely returned clancy swallowing a mouthful of sandwich as he was about to take another bite he had a thought that caused him to look up quickly unless he added blunt and his friends did the looting they came this way during the afternoon theyre not here now where are they frank shook his head you might just as well ask where porter is or the prof said he its hopeless to try to keep track of barzy blunt or to figure out from what hes done what hes going to do next from what mcgurvin said i thought blunt had come here with some of his friends maybe he did possibly he collected the professors goods and chattels and rode off with them it isnt likely though cowpunchers wouldnt be apt to do all that freighting on horseback would they take the trouble to balance a cot across one of their horses and ride away with it or the professors trunk i guess blunt and his friends wouldnt have much use for the professors plunder so its a fair surmise they didnt take it some one else did thats evident the testimony all points to the professor himself he left gold hill to come to happenchance remarked chancy why didnt he tell us about it it couldnt have been such an awful secret he had to keep it to himself its a deuce of a hard thing to figure out said merry i dont think we ever will understand it until borrodaile bobs up and clears away the mystery himself ive a hunch that blunt is the key to this riddle of the professors whereabouts the wonder may be somewhere around that is if mcgurvin wasnt lying you can bank on it chip that a robber like mcgurvin wouldnt tell the truth if it was to his interest to tell something else he said he didnt know nick porter a man who has been roaming these deserts all his life if thats the truth its remarkable now youre getting back to porter again i thought we had agreed to let him go and pin our faith to barzy blunt blunt i think is our best bet i merely rang in porter to give you my estimate of mcgurvins truthfulness porter couldnt have been at the mcgurvin place or wed have found his horse thats so clancy yawned i move we stay here all night and knock around a little in the morning a good deal of the night has gone anyway and i guess we can stick out the rest of it in happenchance what do you say its important to locate the professor said merry dads telegram puts that right up to us now that were here wed better wait until morning and see if anything develops well bring in the machines hunt a couple of soft rocks and see if we cant get a little sleep the motor cycles were trundled into the old house the light put out and the lads lay down on the old clay floor with lumps of broken adobe for pillows in spite of the hard beds the lack of even the most meager comforts both merry and clancy were soon asleep merry awoke with a beam of sun in his eyes he sat up staring incredulously around him and could hardly believe that several hours had passed the sun was shining into the old ruin through the hanging door merry looked over toward the spot where he had last seen his chum and found that clancy was also sitting up top of the morning to you chip grinned clancy how many lumps on your backbone ive counted a dozen on mine this mattress was harder than the one in our room at pophagans and thats going some any new theories this morning havent had time to think up any laughed merry it doesnt seem more than a minute since i put out the light and er turned in whats happened since i closed my eyes is a perfect blank how about that spring it isnt big enough for a cold plunge but we can duck our heads maybe that will clear our brains a little me for the spring cried clancy bounding to his feet leaving the old house they hurried to the spring which they had located on their previous visit to happenchance the water was cool and clear and the pool into which the water dripped was big enough for a partial ducking handkerchiefs served for towels and there was a lot of goodnatured joshing as the chums dabbed away at their dripping faces on the way back to the grub bag clancy finally remarked i move that we make a detour by way of the ledge and the professors mine lets make sure chip that the claim is still there maybe it has vanished like the prof the claim was found where it had been left although some of the ore had vanished the shelf was gouged and disfigured as though some one had put down a blast blown a hole in the vein and then taken away a lot of the ore by jove exclaimed merry heres something else we might lay to blunt i dont think though that hed come here and steal any of the professors ore ive got my own ideas about that said clancy some one has been here anyhow did the professor do this when he came for his household goods he wouldnt know how to drill a hole cap a fuse and touch off a stick of giant powder no clan it wasnt professor borrodaile the deeper we get into this business the more complicated it becomes the outcropping of ore was wonderfully rich it was of the sort known as wire gold and the rock was covered with a fuzzy yellow web of pure metal what ore had been blown out by the blast had been gathered up slick and clean a bagful of that stuff said merry would mean a whole lot in dollars and cents somebody has been high grading and he dropped a little of his swag as he went off with it added clancy stepping off a few yards from the ledge and pointing to a bit of ore that lay on the ground there is some of the fellows loot clancy went on it lies gold side up and shimmers in the sun like a double eagle he looked at the sample for a few moments and then slipped it into his pocket finding is keeping he grinned this ought to pay you back chip for the five you gave mcgurvin in exchange for stuff that was actually worth about ten cents frank ran past clancy for a couple of rods straight out into the valley it was a thundering bad leak clan he called stooping down and gathering in another ore sample that makes two chunks of the stuff the thief lost he was probably in a rush to get away and didnt notice how the ore was dribbling out wait a minute chip said clancy and lets figure this down as fine as we can there are prints of a horses hoofs along the course where this ore was dropped ballard ought to be here to do the sherlock holmes racket for us im not very swift at this detective business but ill take my oath the thief loaded his bag of loot on a horse you dont think do you said frank dryly that hed carry a bag weighing two or three hundred pounds over his shoulder of course he had a pack animal it wasnt a horse though but a burro how did you guess it was a burro small hoofmarks oh scissors of course of course this claim of the professors is too valuable to be left unguarded he ought to begin working it or else sell it to some one wholl see that its taken care of lets take our gold ore and make tracks for the chuck sack i fell hungry somehow as they started across the valley at a distance of perhaps a hundred feet from the spot where frank had picked up the second bit of ore they found another fifty feet from that they found a fourth piece and then as they paused at the lane leading through the heart of the ruined camp their eyes wandering toward the tookin one glittering point after another each point a scrap of wire gold glimmering in the sun the thief left a trail exclaimed merry from ledge directly to the gap and how much farther chip asked clan excitedly say maybe we can follow that trail and find where the fellow went it was a startling proposition and yet one that might be easily demonstrated well try it said frank but not till after breakfast come on clan and well take another fall out of our rations then ho for the golden trail as merry spoke a queer idea popped suddenly into his mind he stopped short and stared at clancy the latter evidently was fired with the same notion ballards dream muttered clancy rubbing a hand over his wet hair hang it all chip this is quite a jolt to a fellow who isnt at all superstitious the golden trail why pink saw it three times hand running in his sleep chapter viii where the golden trail led merriwell was not superstitious and had no patience with any one who was he was forced to admit however that a strange coincidence had developed in the matter of ballards dream and the discovery that had just been made pink dreamed of nuggets as big as washtubs said the marveling clancy and they were arranged like steppingstones and stretched from the professors claim to gold hill by that time merry had got himself in hand he laughed softly yes clan said he i remember these pieces of ore are not nuggets however and if the whole golden trail was raked together i dont believe it would come anywhere near filling even a smallsized washtub and ill bet the trail doesnt lead from here to gold hill in the dream went on clancy pink saw a gang of toughs chasing the prof along the row of nuggets which is about as consistent as dreams usually are if professor borrodaile wanted to get away from the toughs why did he keep on his yellow steppingstones why didnt he duck aside and hide in the bushes all foolishness clan lets go and eat making their way back to professor borrodailes old lodgings the boys ate a hurried breakfast they were thrilled with the novel idea of following the trail of ore and perhaps of overtaking the thief the fellow whoever he is said clancy may be able to tell us something about the professor everybody we run across out here is liable to be mixed up with the profs disappearance answered merry before starting the two motor cycles were gone over carefully only a small amount of attention was needed to put them in trim for the mornings work at last with their canteens freshly filled and hung across their shoulders and the dwindling bag of rations secured to clancys machine they got clear of the old ruins and made their start along the golden trail the scattered ore led upward and through the gap then out on the farther side and into the foothills nor did the trail after getting away from the circular valley point toward gold hill on the contrary it bent in the opposite direction heres where the facts knock another hole in ballards dream said frank gold hill is northwest of us and the ore takes us southeast we havent any gasoline to waste chip remarked clancy and if we go very far in this direction were liable to get hung up in the desert with a couple of dead engines the reservoirs were still when we left the mine clan and i guess if were careful we can make the round trip without having to walk part of the way if the golden trail promises to lead us too far well hide the machines somewhere and go over some of it on foot the man with the burro and the leaky ore bag had naturally hunted for the easiest way through the hills his devious course bothered the boys a little in keeping track of the pieces of dropped ore the pieces lay on the ground at irregular intervals sometimes there would be two samples within three or four yards of each other and then perhaps the boys would have to go three or four hundred feet before they found another at such times the hoofmarks of the burro served as a guide that thief is a mighty careless sort of a man said clancy its a wonder he didnt notice what was going on and stop the leak strikes me answered merry that he walked and led the burro if that was the case he wasnt in a position to see that the loot was getting away from him for at least a mile the golden trail zigzagged through the foothills finally it came out on a level stretch of ground partly covered with a chaparral of greasewood ironwood and paloverde frank had been noticing for several minutes that the single set of burro tracks had grown into a veritable clutter of hoofprints a good many of the prints were large enough to suggest that horses had passed over the golden trail merry and clancy were discussing the additional tracks as they wheeled out upon the flat bit of desert they could make nothing of them and the anxiety they caused was presently lost in another discovery they had reached the end of the line of ore try as hard as they could not another piece of wiregold ore could they find the thief it appeared must have discovered the hole in the bag at that point and have repaired it still searching and hoping against hope the boys presently came close to the edge of the chaparral then with stunning abruptness a voice shouted from among the bushes now then pards make a surround it was a familiar voice merry as not so startled that he failed to realize that the chaparral shook and rustled with the movements of horsemen in a moment four riders plunged into view and drew rein on each side and in front and rear of merriwell and clancy the surprised lads recognized the fellows at once they were some of the cowboy athletes from the bar z ranch blunt the cowboy wonder and his particular cronies ben jordan bandy harrison and aaron lloyd whoop exulted blunt his spirited black horse rearing under his firm grip on the reins look whos here pard its merriwell by glory chip merriwell the son of his dad merriwell the silkstocking athlete were diamonds in the rough pards but hes cut and polished until he dazzles the eyes well well what do you think of this merry was conscious of one thing and that was that the present meeting in the desert was due to chance alone and not to any plotting on blunts part whoop jubilated blunts three companions put to it somewhat to curb their restive mounts hold still frank you crazy fool cried the wonder slapping his horse about the ears with his hat hes scared of those chugchug bikes same as the rest of the bronks whoa i tell you blunt was a master horseman and soon had his plunging steed steadied down clancy looked up into the face of the cowboy wonder and scowled youre the limit he grunted i guess chip will believe youve got a yellow streak after this a smile mirthless and ugly crossed blunts bronzed face leaning forward along his horses neck he fixed his sloeblack eyes on clancys yeller streak eh he echoed what is there in this to make merriwell think ive got a thing like that of course flashed clancy you touched up the professors claim for the trail of ore weve been following front happenchance thats a lie snapped blunt were cowpunchers and homemade athletes but were not sneak thieves we were on our way to a ranch beyond the picket posts after a bunch of bar z strays we watered late yesterday afternoon at the spring by old happenchance and we reached the range we were bound for at ten oclock last night couldnt find the cattle we were looking for and we started back an hour before dawn this morning we struck that trail of ore half a mile from here and turned back to run it out right in this place she petered out while we were thinking about continuing on to mcgurvins we heard you two popping this way and took to the brush in order to give you a little surprise thats the truth of it and you can believe it or not i believe it blunt merry answered with a restraining glance in his chums direction now that we have met you possibly you can give us a little information were looking for the professor he suddenly dropped out of sight and were anxious to locate him and get him back to ophir wow exclaimed ben jordan do we all know anything about this perfesser well i reckon why hes cork shouted blunt sharply you chaps keep still about the professor ill do the talking on that point he turned in his saddle to face merriwell we can tell you a whole lot about this professor of yours he went on but ive an ax to grind merriwell and the information is going to cost you something i thought that was your stripe sneered clancy oh you did say if i wasnt so teetotally wrapped up in merriwell id give a little attention to you my buck what is the information going to cost asked frank its going to cost you a fight with me sabe if you can put me down for the count merriwell well not only tell you what we know about borrodaile but well turn in every man jack of us and help you get hands on him that was barzy blunt to a hair he never allowed a chance for a contest with young frank merriwell to get past him give him his wish chip or let me growled clancy he ought to have a little sense pounded into that head of his and heres an opening if youre hankerin fer a go redhead called ben jordan mebby i could oblige no put in frank this little matter is between blunt and me weve got the center of the stage and were going to keep it the rest of you can look on he turned to the cowboy wonder sparring is all right blunt he continued but if it is all the same to you why not settle the matter catch as catch can i have already taken one fall out of you but you have always claimed you could have turned the tables on me if the bout hadnt been interrupted im agreeable answered blunt cheerily best two out of three he added slipping out of his saddle and handing his reins to randy harrison hitch pards and gather round a diamond in the rough is going up against this polished article from the east watch me juggle with him he threw up his head and roared in a kind of chant im barzy blunt of the bar z ranch known to fame as the cowboy wonder whoop whoop howled blunts three companions leading the horses back toward the chaparral frank had already begun to strip to the gymnasium clothes which he wore beneath his ordinary apparel as under garments his sleeveless shirt he took off as well thus matching the wonder who was also stripping to the buff merry knew that the cowboys would play fair as they understood the word they showed their sportsmanlike spirit by agreeing that clancy should act as referee if youre ready said clancy get busy warily the two wrestlers faced each other again as in the relay marathon merry was contesting with blunt for the benefit of borrodaile and merry although the wonder was a quick and powerful antagonist was determined to win and to do it handily chapter ix a sharp clash barzy blunt was a splendid specimen of physical development his shoulders were broad his chest deep and there was not an ounce of superfluous flesh on his whole body under his clear white skin the muscles tensed and flowed as he crouched and approached and retreated warily looking for an opening his movements were swift and graceful carried out with a precision and certainty that not only claimed but received merriwells silent admiration but if blunt was a fine specimen of a homemade athlete merriwells more scientific training revealed him a shade better on every one of blunts points admirable though they were if blunts appearance suggested excellence young franks spelled perfection even the cowboys blunts partisans could not refrain from exclamations that honored the polished gem from the east nevertheless the bar z fellows kept all their encouragement for their own champion hes got nothin on ye in weight barzy called aaron lloyd flop him jump in an turn him over for the honor of the ole bar z barzy whooped ben jordan its yore bout pard cried bandy harrison suddenly the two wrestlers rushed at each other by a quick movement blunt secured a hold which merry did not fancy and he slipped out of his grasp on the marble whiteness of merriwells bare back four livid streaks showed and a flick of red oozed from one of them first blood fer barzy howled harrison ye left the mark of yer claws on him pard dont let him git away from ye again the two came together and blunt once more succeeded in getting under merriwell and snapped him over for a quick flop merry however broke the hold as he went down twisted to hands and knees and bobbed up two feet away and again facing his antagonist the cowboys were wildly exultant they believed that barzy blunt was showing his superiority in these initial moves but they were mistaken merry was merely trying out his adversary and calmly studying his weak and his strong points at the game blunt through lack of proper training was making the grave mistake of using all his strength on what might be termed nonessentials in wrestling no more strength should be used than the moment calls for a reserve being held for the supreme moment when the wrestlers came together for the third time the timehonored hold of one over and one under was secured and merry was satisfied from this after a minute of squirming and twisting merry slipped to an armandneck hold his left hand about the back of blunts neck right hand locked in his left elbow blunt began to kick stop that clancy ordered sternly never mind clan said merry ive got him now with a swiftness and ease beautiful to see merriwell thrust his left foot between blunts kicking extremities pushed the left arm farther and completely around his neck clung like a leech to his left elbow twisted on his toes bent his knees and heaved upward blunt was lifted clear of the ground on merrys back it was the old reliable hip lock the next instant blunt had fallen merry was on top and blunts shoulders squarely on the ground first fall for chip merriwell sang out clancy hes a chip of the old block in more ways than one blunt got up smiling it was his old mirthless smile and like a barometer announced his rising temper the second round was a little more exciting possibly merriwell wishing to encourage blunt gave him the initial advantage a minute or a minute and a half of fierce silent struggling followed blunt blowing like a grampus and merriwell taking it easily with an arm clasped around merriwells neck blunt labored tremendously to turn him over merry however was like a rock and all the cowboys efforts failed he expended a vast amount of strength which was exactly what merry wanted then with startling suddenness merriwell from a rocklike passive defense became the aggressor he seemed to yield to blunts pushing and hauling but that supposed yielding was a sorry disappointment to the cowboy somehow merry regained his feet then in a flash merrys right arm had blunts head in chancery with blunt at his back with a marshaling of his reserve strength merry turned the wonder a somersault and laid him stunned and flat on his back well ill be blamed exclaimed jordan rubbing a dazed hand across his forehead thats the best i ever seen an no mistake how the jumpin sand hills did he do it murmured the bewildered harrison hes sure some on the wrestle exclaimed aaron lloyd second fall announced clancy crisply two straight for chip merriwell and he wins frank breathing a little hard hurried to kneel at blunts side didnt hurt you did i he asked anxiously blunt sat up and stared at him smiling wrathfully and his jetblack eyes two points of flame no you didnt hurt me he answered im all rawhide and whalebone and it isnt in you to hurt me confound you ill get you at something or other yet want to spar with bare knuckles not today frank answered a bargain is a bargain blunt i won this setto in a couple of straight falls now tell me what you know about professor borrodaile jordan brought blunts shirt and began pulling it over his head harrison rushed to the horses and returned with a canteen blunt took a long pull at the canteen and got up if youre afraid to spar he began but clancy interrupted him youve lost out blunt and merriwell has bought and paid for the information about professor borrodaile give it to him thats right old pard put in lloyd come across or let some o the rest of us ill do the talking blunt answered yesterday afternoon said he we stopped for a while at mcgurvins while we were watering the bronks i looked up and saw a mans face at an upstairs window it was the face of this professor of yours great scott gulped clancy staring at mcgurvins demanded merry no less excited yes at mcgurvins i asked mac what the professor was doing in his house and he answered that what i didnt know wouldnt bother me it was none of my putin and so i let it go at that theres something else to it too tell what you found out in gold hill aaron two days ago merry and clancy turned their eyes on lloyd i was there fer the ranch mail began lloyd an nick porter was crookin his elbow aplenty and talking a heap too in front of the red light he had a feller in flashy clothes with a sandy mustache and the two was goin it some in the gab line i was leanin against the front of the red light at the time areadin a letter an i couldnt help hear a little of what them two said samll put down a hole an blow out a bag o samples says porter an bring em round about to macs turkeyfootll take the perfesser on from macs to the old camp the mornin after sam gits through arter loadin up with the perfessers plunder hell bring him back to macs an macll hold him then you heppner can go out to macs tuesday arternoon an make yer play thats all finished lloyd aaron didnt remember all that until after id seen the professor at the window interpolated blunt then as we were riding on he let it out blazes exclaimed clancy theres a scheme on to rob borrodaile of that claim of his looks thataway said lloyd passively who is this sam that was to get the bag of samples and take it to mcgurvins by a roundabout way queried merriwell no sabe hes the fellow that had the leaky bag and dropped this trail of ore whos turkeyfoot feller that lives out o gold hill a ways does freightin the way i size it up said frank the professor hired this turkeyfoot to came to happenchance with him and get the goods he had left there they halted at mcgurvins place long enough to give sam time to do his blasting and make off with the samples then the professor and turkeyfoot went to the claim got the professors goods and went back to mcgurvins and there fellows the professor is being held until this man in flashy clothes comes out and does something to beat borrodaile out of the claim thats you said blunt todays tuesday and its this afternoon that the business is to be pulled off the thing to do is to hike for mcgurvins and nip the affair in the bud mac is on the side of the opposition and so is sam and turkeyfoot and the flashily dressed juniper that makes four merriwell and there are only you and clancy to see this game through well help that was part of the bargain and we bar z fellows stand up to our agreements we were at mcgurvins last night remarked frank puzzled there wasnt any one there but the rancher himself shucks said blunt youre easy there might have been a houseful and you none the wiser mcgurvins so crooked he cant walk around his house without running into himself everybody knows that merrys dark eyes began to flash this is an outrage he exclaimed mcgurvin and all the rest who are working with him ought to be arrested blunt laughed what do you want to arrest him for he asked beat him at his own game and let it go at that climb aboard your chug bikes and well mount and hurry along with you we can get to the ranch in time to make mcgurvin and his bunch look two ways for comfort merriwell realized the need of hurry the sun was climbing toward the zenith and afternoon and the working out of the plot against borrodaile would soon be at hand without further delay he got into his clothes then he and clancy started their machines and headed for mcgurvins the cowboys galloped along just behind them chapter x foiling the plotters merriwell and clancy had to diminish their speed in order to let the cowboys keep them in sight this was annoying and merry formed another plan and slowed to a halt in order to broach it to blunt clancy and i said he as blunt and his friends galloped up can cover the ground between here and mcgurvins four times as quick as you fellows i think we had better push on whats the use blunt demanded well all get there before afternoon suppose the man with the flashy clothes and the red mustache should take it into his head to come to mcgurvins before afternoon then maybe its too late possibly hes there now well go on and see said merry you fellows can lope along and get there in time to help clancy and me if we find theyre too many for us correct merriwell well come asmoking frank and owen ducked through the rough country like a couple of meteors the daylight was all they needed to help them in their flight over a course so carefully covered the night before again as once before the professors claim was at stake and the motorcycles were pushed to the utmost in an attempt to reach mcgurvins and head off the scoundrelly work of the plotters it seemed almost no time at all until the verdant spot irrigated by mcgurvins well came into view in the distance across the bare sands well make a detour clan said merry and come up on the ranch from the rear there are only two of us you know and we will have to proceed with care if we dont want to spoil everything sure clancy promptly assented wed better leave our machines in the brush somewhere and move up on the adobe on foot if we dont mcgurvin will hear us this plan was carried out the motor cycles were left at a safe distance and the lads crept cautiously forward under the screen of mcgurvins corral corn was growing in the irrigated truck patch and merry and clancy got into it and moved upon the house presently they began to hear voices then catching a glimpse of mcgurvins hitching pole they saw a saddle horse secured there looks like our man was here already merry whispered in his chums ear where is the talking coming from returned clancy it seems pretty close well find out on hands and knees the boys crept on screened by the broad leaves of the corn presently merry reached the edge of the cornfield and paused the shady side of the house was not over twenty feet from him and there comfortably seated was a florid flashily dressed redmustached person opposite him in another chair was not less a personage than professor phineas borrodaile he was looking over his glasses in consternation at the man with the red mustache grouped in the background were mcgurvin and two flannelshirted roughlooking arizonians it had been a happy inspiration of merrys to hasten on ahead of the cowboys it was not afternoon yet already the stage was set and the play for the professors claim was being made clancy gripped his chum tensely by the arm they did not speak even in whispers but crouched at the edge of the corn and watched and listened yes indeed the professor was saying in his cracked voice you aver rightly mr heppner that this is a remarkable country most remarkable over in the picket post mountains if you please i have seen misty islandlike protuberances resembling greatly the postpliocene crannoges of the roscommon loughs now call off the dog professor interrupted heppner im a government agent and im here on business see you didnt know youd jumped a mining claim belonging to mcgurvin but such is the fact this will have to be straightened out or the responsibility will rest heavily upon you now speaking personal id hate a heap to see you sent to jail seeing as how youre in this country for your health jails aint a health resort by any manner of means what do you propose to do about this dear me murmured borrodaile taking off his hat and rubbing the top of his bald head i am not dishonest gentlemen i assure you that i want only to do whats right the claim i located was discovered by my nephew and i am his next of kin i supposed you understand that it was rightfully mine sure answered the bogus government agent heartily i can see right where you made your mistake how could you know that in the years that followed your nephews discovery the claim was located again by mcgurvin there when did you locate it mac he asked turning on the rancher night onto two year ago asserted mcgurvin solemnly there you are exclaimed heppner triumphantly mcgurvin has done the assessment work so it belonged to him and you jumped it states prison offense professor the professor shuddered i didnt intend to do any wrong he answered ignorance of the law expounded heppner excuses no one still speaking personal im here to let you off light youve had a lot of trouble in this matter and mcgurvin is willing to give you a hundred dollars for that you will have to sign a quitclaim deed though so as to clear up the title i call that beamed heppner mighty generous a heap moren i ort ter do said mcgurvin in a burst of frankness moren id do mac said one of the two others ye know sam whimpered the rancher i allers was troubled with enlargement of the heart i reckon someday itll be the ruination o me aint that so turkeyfoot not as nobody can notice replied the other bystander all i wants is to see the perfesser git his rights i was totin his stuff ter town an im in his pay i stick fer the hunderd an you can whine all ye darn please mr turkeyfoot said the professor casting a grateful look at that noble gentleman i shall never forget your loyalty and kindness to me if you insist i will accept the hundred dollars and sign this quit claim all i want is to do what is right otium oum dignitate that is my motto and what i am seeking such matters as this in which i have unwittingly erred distress me greatly heppner had pulled a paper and a fountain pen from his pocket there aint no odium attached to this move professor he said reassuringly you have done wrong but you are doing your best to make amends he got up and handed the pen to the professor and then opened out the paper sign there said he mac he added have your hundred dollars ready mcgurvin went down into his trousers fished up a roll of bills and held it in his hand eying it hungrily the professor hunting for a place on which to write stood up and laid the paper against the wall of the house merry was astounded to think that borrodaile should prove so lacking in ordinary understanding as to take the words of that gang of tricksters in such a matter but he was child so far as business affairs were concerned it was easy to make him believe anything so long as his particular field of knowledge was not intruded upon something had to be done and merry was not long in doing it a bold move was necessary if heppner ever got that signed quitclaim deed in his hands the transaction would be badly complicated starting up merriwell jumped clear of the cornfield dashed across the space separating him from the group of men in the shade of the house and before the astounded plotters could interfere he had reached over the professors shoulder snatched the paper out of his hands and torn it to bits blast ye roared mcgurvin jumping forward savagely what right you got buttin in sam turkeyfoot and heppner likewise confronted merry with flaming eyes and twitching angry faces the professor fell back astounded merriwell he gasped lifting a hand to his forehead clancy losing not a moment jumped to place himself at his chums side youre a pack of curs cried merriwell and youre trying to swindle the professor out of a bonanza mining claim you with a snarl of rage all four of the plotters began closing in on merry and clancy chapter xi the cowboys save the day for a few moments matters took on a serious aspect for the two boys the quitclaim deed however had been destroyed and there was no fear that professor borrodaile would again fall into heppners trap frank had counted upon this and had even figured that he would have to take a few hard knocks in bringing it about heppner fairly boiling was rushing at merry like an unleashed tornado mcgurvin too was plunging toward him from the right sam and turkeyfoot were making clancy the object of their attack merry felt that heppner was entitled to a little something as a memorial of the plot that failed so dodging the bulllike rush of mcgurvin he jumped at heppner and his doubled fist shot out like a batteringram oof heppner grunted flinging up his arms franks knuckles had landed on the point of his heavy brutelike jaw in just the place best calculated to make a man see stars and incidentally to teach him a lesson the government agent reeled back and staggered groggily mcgurvin swearing furiously flung his arms around frank from behind ill wring yer neck fer ye you young terror threatened the rancher and it was at that moment when merry and clancy were hard beset that a bar z yell floated down the breeze it came with an accompaniment of wildly galloping hoofs high above the tumult and the shouting arose the voice of barzy blunt hang to it merriwell were on the way the coming of reenforcements had a dampening effect upon the ardor of mcgurvin sam and turkeyfoot the rancher released frank and started at a hurried pace for the other side of his house sam and turkeyfoot also attempted to decamp but they were not quick enough the cowboys throwing themselves from their horses rushed pellmell to take a hand in the conflict such a ruction appealed to them and they proceeded to wade into sam and turkey foot frank and blunt went on a hurried search for mcgurvin the rancher was finally located barricaded behind a locked door and he was breathing fierce threats of ravage and slaughter keep away from me or ill fill ye fuller o holes than a pepperbox was one of the ranchers many remarks blunt laughing loudly threw himself against the door with franks help it was kicked open and mcgurvin did not shoot it transpired that he had nothing to shoot with he tried to fight but merry and blunt got him in hand and dragged him out of doors tell us about this you blamed coyote said blunt and be quick youve got about as much grit as a chipmunk and if you dont talk well show you a trick or two that will make you wish you had what you atryin to do barzy asked mcgurvin in an injured tone takin the part o this eastern crowd agin me pah exclaimed the cowboy wonder in disgust im no friend of yours you old tinhorn what were you trying to do out with it it wasnt me barzy whimpered mcgurvin it was heppner heppner from tombstone he put it all up him an nick porter put what up why this scheme to beat the perfesser out o that claim o his i was drawed inter it innercent like yes you were mighty innocent put in frank scathingly you pretended that you had located the professors claim a long while ago and that the professor had jumped it heppner professed to be a government agent sent here to straighten the matter out and you were to give borrodaile a hundred dollars for a quitclaim deed to the mine a hundred dollars gasped blunt great snakes why that claims worth thousands the professor stood for that yarn they had him scared stiff said merriwell he was signing the deed when i jumped out of the cornfield and grabbed it away from him it was heppners doins insisted mcgurvin he was ter gi me a hundred for helpin him you were to sign the quitclaim over to him eh asked blunt thats the how o it barzy hes a villain that heppner person but i was took in by his wiles how much was sam to get asked merry he was gittin another hunderd fer the bag o samples an fer helpin in other ways and turkeyfoot another hunderd was comin ter him sames to the rest o us how about nick porter dunno how much he was ter git he told heppner about the perfesser an the claim in the fust place so i reckon he come higher the perfesser is kinder weak in the headpiece hed bleeve anythin nick porter tole me so when he was here last night oh said merry so porter was here was he when clancy and i came looking for him well yes i didnt say nothin ter you about it merriwell becus i didnt dare porter would a killed me if i had youre a skunk gritted barzy blunt wheres porter now demanded frank he hiked out early this mornin say barzy i heerd ye wasnt no friend o merriwells im not was the answer i made a bargain with him and this is part of it where are the professors goods and turkeyfoots wagon merry questioned out in the scrub was the ranchers reply sos sams burro which he took when he went arter the ore tother day sam was gittin the ore ter show heppner he lost part o it on the way here but enough was left ter make heppner open his eyes a whole lot he allowed it was the richest claim he ever seen yes remarked blunt we know all about sams losing the ore but for that golden trail merriwell you and i would never have got together out there in the desert and this scheme against the professor might have worked to a fare you well id never have butted in if you hadnt bested me with two straight falls have you been keeping the professor here against his will demanded frank of mcgurvin nary i wasnt turkeyfoot had him skeered he tells the perfessor theres a govment agent arter him named heppner an that the claim he thought he located he really jumped that was turkeyfoots part a it purtendin ter be the perfessers friend an goadin him on ter fall in with heppners plan oh turkeyfoots a missable skunk all right the professor stayed here because turkeyfoot told him to asked frank far gone with wonder on borrodailes account thats the how of it an im givin it to ye straight clancy had come up during part of the talk with mcgurvin and presently ben jordan arrived with turkeyfoot and harrison and lloyd with sam the professor dazed and bewildered came pottering along presently and stood off at a distance while he tried to adjust his wits to the sudden whirl of events wheres heppner clan merry asked concluded he hadnt better stay chip clancy explained just as the cowboys got here heppner jumped to the back of his horse and began hitting the high places he took your mark along with him though the redheaded chap finished with a laugh merry walked over to borrodaile and laid a soothing hand on his shoulder wake up professor said he its all over and youve still got your claim my boy answered the professor still a little flighty i dont want that claim if its not legally mine it is legally yours heppner was only pretending to be a government agent and mcgurvin never saw the claim well well murmured the professor mildly surprised then they were dishonest i should say but mr turkeyfoot is my friend he thought i had done wrong and he fought loyally to get me off and to make mcgurvin give me a hundred dollars clancy turned away to hide a laugh turkeyfoot deceived you just as the others did frank explained patiently you hired him to go to happenchance after the stuff you had left there yes we came thus far on our way and mr turkeyfoot explained how i had laid myself liable to fine and imprisonment for stealing a claim he said i must remain here at mcgurvins for a time and er keep shady that is the term he used i believe well i kept shady until he came to go to the old town then when we returned from there i had to keep shady again a little while ago mr heppner arrived saying he represented the government and and well and the professor drew a long sigh im glad to know i havent stolen anything from anybody why did you leave ophir for gold hill mr porter told me about mr turkeyfoot and said he was the one to go out and bring in my personal effects you had had enough trouble on my account merriwell and i did not want to bother you further yet it seems he finished regretfully that i have done the very thing i tried not to do im going to take you back to ophir declared merry and do what i can to look out for you i am quite capable of looking out for myself merriwell nevertheless i shall be glad to have you near me to offer advice your father had a very good business head and i presume you are likewise gifted his face brightened perceptibly as he went on while returning from happenchance with my personal effects i clipped a really excellent specimen of amorphous diapase from a reef among the hills the cellular crystallization of the diapase is intensely interesting it will give me pleasure to show it to you merriwell and never mind that just now professor frank answered turkeyfoot is getting ready to take you on to ophir clancy and i have a couple of motor cycles but were going to load them in turkeyfootys wagon and ride with you just why do you inconvenience yourself in that manner to make sure that nobody takes the mining claim away from you between here and the ophir house said frank the professor looked puzzled but was wise enough not to ask merriwell to explain the end frank merriwell juniors competitor or the honor of the game is the title of the story that will be found in the next issue of this weekly in this story barzy blunt is defeated by young merriwell in another feat of strength and skill and he begins to see light frank gets a letter from his father which is full of interesting surprises you will find this narrative of the doings of chip merriwell and his chums to be full of incident and sustained excitement it is no and will be out october th
