 the story of a bad boy by thomas bailey aldrich chapter one in which i introduce myself this is the story of a bad boy well not such a very bad but a pretty bad boy and i ought to know for i am or rather i was that boy myself lest the title should mislead the reader i hasten to assure him here that i have no dark confessions to make i call my story the story of a bad boy partly to distinguish myself from those faultless young gentlemen who generally figure in narratives of this kind and partly because i really was not a cherub i may truthfully say i was an amiable impulsive lad blessed with fine digestive powers and no hypocrite i didnt want to be an angel and with the angels stand i didnt think the missionary tracts presented to me by the rev wibird hawkins were half so nice as robinson crusoe and i didnt send my little pocketmoney to the natives of the feejee islands but spent it royally in peppermintdrops and taffy candy in short i was a real human boy such as you may meet anywhere in new england and no more like the impossible boy in a storybook than a sound orange is like one that has been sucked dry but let us begin at the beginning whenever a new scholar came to our school i used to confront him at recess with the following words my names tom bailey whats your name if the name struck me favorably i shook hands with the new pupil cordially but if it didnt i would turn on my heel for i was particular on this point such names as higgins wiggins and spriggins were deadly affronts to my ear while langdon wallace blake and the like were passwords to my confidence and esteem ah me some of those dear fellows are rather elderly boys by this timelawyers merchants seacaptains soldiers authors what not phil adams a special good name that adams is consul at shanghai where i picture him to myself with his head closely shavedhe never had too much hairand a long pigtail banging down behind he is married i hear and i hope he and she that was miss wang wang are very happy together sitting crosslegged over their diminutive cups of tea in a skyblue tower hung with bells it is so i think of him to me he is henceforth a jewelled mandarin talking nothing but broken china whitcomb is a judge sedate and wise with spectacles balanced on the bridge of that remarkable nose which in former days was so plentifully sprinkled with freckles that the boys christened him pepper whitcomb just to think of little pepper whitcomb being a judge what would be do to me now i wonder if i were to sing out pepper some day in court fred langdon is in california in the nativewine businesshe used to make the best licoricewater i ever tasted binny wallace sleeps in the old south buryingground and jack harris too is deadharris who commanded us boys of old in the famous snowball battles of slatters hill was it yesterday i saw him at the head of his regiment on its way to join the shattered army of the potomac not yesterday but six years ago it was at the battle of the seven pines gallant jack harris that never drew rein until he had dashed into the rebel battery so they found himlying across the enemys guns how we have parted and wandered and married and died i wonder what has become of all the boys who went to the temple grammar school at rivermouth when i was a youngster all all are gone the old familiar faces it is with no ungentle hand i summon them back for a moment from that past which has closed upon them and upon me how pleasantly they live again in my memory happy magical past in whose fairy atmosphere even conway mine ancient foe stands forth transfigured with a sort of dreamy glory encircling his bright red hair with the old school formula i commence these sketches of my boyhood my name is tom bailey what is yours gentle reader i take for granted it is neither wiggins nor spriggins and that we shall get on famously together and be capital friends forever chapter two in which i entertain peculiar views i was born at rivermouth but before i had a chance to become very well acquainted with that pretty new england town my parents removed to new orleans where my father invested his money so securely in the banking business that be was never able to get any of it out again but of this hereafter i was only eighteen months old at the time of the removal and it didnt make much difference to me where i was because i was so small but several years later when my father proposed to take me north to be educated i had my own peculiar views on the subject i instantly kicked over the little negro boy who happened to be standing by me at the moment and stamping my foot violently on the floor of the piazza declared that i would not be taken away to live among a lot of yankees you see i was what is called a northern man with southern principles i had no recollection of new england my earliest memories were connected with the south with aunt chloe my old negro nurse and with the great illkept garden in the centre of which stood our housea whitewashed stone house it was with wide verandasshut out from the street by lines of orange fig and magnolia trees i knew i was born at the north but hoped nobody would find it out i looked upon the misfortune as something so shrouded by time and distance that maybe nobody remembered it i never told my schoolmates i was a yankee because they talked about the yankees in such a scornful way it made me feel that it was quite a disgrace not to be born in louisiana or at least in one of the border states and this impression was strengthened by aunt chloe who said dar wasnt no gentlmen in the norf no way and on one occasion terrified me beyond measure by declaring that if any of dem mean whites tried to git her away from marster she was jesgwine to knock em on de head wid a gourd the way this poor creatures eyes flashed and the tragic air with which she struck at an imaginary mean white are among the most vivid things in my memory of those days to be frank my idea of the north was about as accurate as that entertained by the welleducated englishmen of the present day concerning america i supposed the inhabitants were divided into two classesindians and white people that the indians occasionally dashed down on new york and scalped any woman or child giving the preference to children whom they caught lingering in the outskirts after nightfall that the white men were either hunters or schoolmasters and that it was winter pretty much all the year round the prevailing style of architecture i took to be logcabins with this delightful picture of northern civilization in my eye the reader will easily understand my terror at the bare thought of being transported to rivermouth to school and possibly will forgive me for kicking over little black sam and otherwise misconducting myself when my father announced his determination to me as for kicking little sami always did that more or less gently when anything went wrong with me my father was greatly perplexed and troubled by this unusually violent outbreak and especially by the real consternation which be saw written in every line of my countenance as little black sam picked himself up my father took my hand in his and led me thoughtfully to the library i can see him now as he leaned back in the bamboo chair and questioned me he appeared strangely agitated on learning the nature of my objections to going north and proceeded at once to knock down all my pine log houses and scatter all the indian tribes with which i had populated the greater portion of the eastern and middle states who on earth tom has filled your brain with such silly stories asked my father wiping the tears from his eyes aunt chloe sir she told me and you really thought your grandfather wore a blanket embroidered with beads and ornamented his leggins with the scalps of his enemies well sir i didnt think that exactly didnt think that exactly tom you will be the death of me he hid his face in his handkerchief and when he looked up he seemed to have been suffering acutely i was deeply moved myself though i did not clearly understand what i had said or done to cause him to feel so badly perhaps i had hurt his feelings by thinking it even possible that grandfather nutter was an indian warrior my father devoted that evening and several subsequent evenings to giving me a clear and succinct account of new england its early struggles its progress and its present conditionfaint and confused glimmerings of all which i had obtained at school where history had never been a favorite pursuit of mine i was no longer unwilling to go north on the contrary the proposed journey to a new world full of wonders kept me awake nights i promised myself all sorts of fun and adventures though i was not entirely at rest in my mind touching the savages and secretly resolved to go on board the shipthe journey was to be made by seawith a certain little brass pistol in my trouserspocket in case of any difficulty with the tribes when we landed at boston i couldnt get the indian out of my head only a short time previously the cherokeesor was it the camancheshad been removed from their huntinggrounds in arkansas and in the wilds of the southwest the red men were still a source of terror to the border settlers trouble with the indians was the staple news from florida published in the new orleans papers we were constantly hearing of travellers being attacked and murdered in the interior of that state if these things were done in florida why not in massachusetts yet long before the sailing day arrived i was eager to be off my impatience was increased by the fact that my father had purchased for me a fine little mustang pony and shipped it to rivermouth a fortnight previous to the date set for our own departurefor both my parents were to accompany me the pony which nearly kicked me out of bed one night in a dream and my fathers promise that he and my mother would come to rivermouth every other summer completely resigned me to the situation the ponys name was gitana which is the spanish for gypsy so i always called hershe was a lady ponygypsy at length the time came to leave the vinecovered mansion among the orangetrees to say goodby to little black sam i am convinced he was heartily glad to get rid of me and to part with simple aunt chloe who in the confusion of her grief kissed an eyelash into my eye and then buried her face in the bright bandana turban which she had mounted that morning in honor of our departure i fancy them standing by the open garden gate the tears are rolling down aunt chloes cheeks sams six front teeth are glistening like pearls i wave my hand to him manfully then i call out goodby in a muffled voice to aunt chloe they and the old home fade away i am never to see them again chapter three on board the typhoon i do not remember much about the voyage to boston for after the first few hours at sea i was dreadfully unwell the name of our ship was the a no fastsailing packet typhoon i learned afterwards that she sailed fast only in the newspaper advertisements my father owned one quarter of the typhoon and that is why we happened to go in her i tried to guess which quarter of the ship he owned and finally concluded it must be the hind quarterthe cabin in which we had the cosiest of staterooms with one round window in the roof and two shelves or boxes nailed up against the wall to sleep in there was a good deal of confusion on deck while we were getting under way the captain shouted orders to which nobody seemed to pay any attention through a battered tin trumpet and grew so red in the face that he reminded me of a scoopedout pumpkin with a lighted candle inside he swore right and left at the sailors without the slightest regard for their feelings they didnt mind it a bit however but went on singing heave ho with the rum below and hurrah for the spanish main o i will not be positive about the spanish main but it was hurrah for something o i considered them very jolly fellows and so indeed they were one weatherbeaten tar in particular struck my fancya thickset jovial man about fifty years of age with twinkling blue eyes and a fringe of gray hair circling his head like a crown as he took off his tarpaulin i observed that the top of his head was quite smooth and flat as if somebody had sat down on him when he was very young there was something noticeably hearty in this mans bronzed face a heartiness that seemed to extend to his loosely knotted neckerchief but what completely won my goodwill was a picture of enviable loveliness painted on his left arm it was the head of a woman with the body of a fish her flowing hair was of livid green and she held a pink comb in one hand i never saw anything so beautiful i determined to know that man i think i would have given my brass pistol to have had such a picture painted on my arm while i stood admiring this work of art a fat wheezy steamtug with the word ajax in staring black letters on the paddlebox came puffing up alongside the typhoon it was ridiculously small and conceited compared with our stately ship i speculated as to what it was going to do in a few minutes we were lashed to the little monster which gave a snort and a shriek and commenced backing us out from the levee wharf with the greatest ease i once saw an ant running away with a piece of cheese eight or ten times larger than itself i could not help thinking of it when i found the chubby smokynosed tugboat towing the typhoon out into the mississippi river in the middle of the stream we swung round the current caught us and away we flew like a great winged bird only it didnt seem as if we were moving the shore with the countless steamboats the tangled rigging of the ships and the long lines of warehouses appeared to be gliding away from us it was grand sport to stand on the quarterdeck and watch all this before long there was nothing to be seen on other side but stretches of low swampy land covered with stunted cypress trees from which drooped delicate streamers of spanish mossa fine place for alligators and congo snakes here and there we passed a yellow sandbar and here and there a snag lifted its nose out of the water like a shark this is your last chance to see the city to see the city tom said my father as we swept round a bend of the river i turned and looked new orleans was just a colorless mass of something in the distance and the dome of the st charles hotel upon which the sun shimmered for a moment was no bigger than the top of old aunt chloes thimble what do i remember next the gray sky and the fretful blue waters of the gulf the steamtug had long since let slip her hawsers and gone panting away with a derisive scream as much as to say ive done my duty now look out for yourself old typhoon the ship seemed quite proud of being left to take care of itself and with its huge white sails bulged out strutted off like a vain turkey i had been standing by my father near the wheelhouse all this while observing things with that nicety of perception which belongs only to children but now the dew began falling and we went below to have supper the fresh fruit and milk and the slices of cold chicken looked very nice yet somehow i had no appetite there was a general smell of tar about everything then the ship gave sudden lurches that made it a matter of uncertainty whether one was going to put his fork to his mouth or into his eye the tumblers and wineglasses stuck in a rack over the table kept clinking and clinking and the cabin lamp suspended by four gilt chains from the ceiling swayed to and fro crazily now the floor seemed to rise and now it seemed to sink under ones feet like a featherbed there were not more than a dozen passengers on board including ourselves and all of these excepting a baldheaded old gentlemana retired seacaptaindisappeared into their staterooms at an early hour of the evening after supper was cleared away my father and the elderly gentleman whose name was captain truck played at checkers and i amused myself for a while by watching the trouble they had in keeping the men in the proper places just at the most exciting point of the game the ship would careen and down would go the white checkers pellmell among the black then my father laughed but captain truck would grow very angry and vow that he would have won the game in a move or two more if the confounded old chickencoopthats what he called the shiphadnt lurched ii think i will go to bed now please i said laying my band on my fathers knee and feeling exceedingly queer it was high time for the typhoon was plunging about in the most alarming fashion i was speedily tucked away in the upper berth where i felt a trifle more easy at first my clothes were placed on a narrow shelf at my feet and it was a great comfort to me to know that my pistol was so handy for i made no doubt we should fall in with pirates before many hours this is the last thing i remember with any distinctness at midnight as i was afterwards told we were struck by a gale which never left us until we came in sight of the massachusetts coast for days and days i had no sensible idea of what was going on around me that we were being hurled somewhere upsidedown and that i didnt like it was about all i knew i have indeed a vague impression that my father used to climb up to the berth and call me his ancient mariner bidding me cheer up but the ancient mariner was far from cheering up if i recollect rightly and i dont believe that venerable navigator would have cared much if it had been announced to him through a speakingtrumpet that a low black suspicious craft with raking masts was rapidly bearing down upon us in fact one morning i thought that such was the case for bang went the big cannon i had noticed in the bow of the ship when we came on board and which had suggested to me the idea of pirates bang went the gun again in a few seconds i made a feeble effort to get at my trouserspocket but the typhoon was only saluting cape codthe first land sighted by vessels approaching the coast from a southerly direction the vessel had ceased to roll and my seasickness passed away as rapidly as it came i was all right now only a little shaky in my timbers and a little blue about the gills as captain truck remarked to my mother who like myself had been confined to the stateroom during the passage at cape cod the wind parted company with us without saying as much as excuse me so we were nearly two days in making the run which in favorable weather is usually accomplished in seven hours thats what the pilot said i was able to go about the ship now and i lost no time in cultivating the acquaintance of the sailor with the greenhaired lady on his arm i found him in the forecastlea sort of cellar in the front part of the vessel he was an agreeable sailor as i had expected and we became the best of friends in five minutes he had been all over the world two or three times and knew no end of stories according to his own account he must have been shipwrecked at least twice a year ever since his birth he had served under decatur when that gallant officer peppered the algerines and made them promise not to sell their prisoners of war into slavery he had worked a gun at the bombardment of vera cruz in the mexican war and he had been on alexander selkirks island more than once there were very few things he hadnt done in a seafaring way i suppose sir i remarked that your name isnt typhoon why lord love ye lad my names benjamin watson of nantucket but im a true blue typhooner he added which increased my respect for him i dont know why and i didnt know then whether typhoon was the name of a vegetable or a profession not wishing to be outdone in frankness i disclosed to him that my name was tom bailey upon which he said be was very glad to hear it when we got more intimate i discovered that sailor ben as he wished me to call him was a perfect walking picturebook he had two anchors a star and a frigate in full sail on his right arm a pair of lovely blue hands clasped on his breast and ive no doubt that other parts of his body were illustrated in the same agreeable manner i imagine he was fond of drawings and took this means of gratifying his artistic taste it was certainly very ingenious and convenient a portfolio might be misplaced or dropped overboard but sailor ben bad his pictures wherever he went just as that eminent person in the poem with rings on her fingers and bells on her toes was accompanied by music on all occasions the two bands on his breast he informed me were a tribute to the memory of a dead messmate from whom he had parted years agoand surely a more touching tribute was never engraved on a tombstone this caused me to think of my parting with old aunt chloe and i told him i should take it as a great favor indeed if he would paint a pink hand and a black hand on my chest he said the colors were pricked into the skin with needles and that the operation was somewhat painful i assured him in an offhand manner that i didnt mind pain and begged him to set to work at once the simplehearted fellow who was probably not a little vain of his skill took me into the forecastle and was on the point of complying with my request when my father happened to own the gangwaya circumstance that rather interfered with the decorative art i didnt have another opportunity of conferring alone with sailor ben for the next morning bright and early we came in sight of the cupola of the boston state house chapter four rivermouth it was a beautiful may morning when the typhoon hauled up at long wharf whether the indians were not early risers or whether they were away just then on a warpath i couldnt determine but they did not appear in any great forcein fact did not appear at all in the remarkable geography which i never hurt myself with studying at new orleans was a picture representing the landing of the pilgrim fathers at plymouth the pilgrim fathers in rather odd hats and coats are seen approaching the savages the savages in no coats or hats to speak of are evidently undecided whether to shake hands with the pilgrim fathers or to make one grand rush and scalp the entire party now this scene had so stamped itself on my mind that in spite of all my father had said i was prepared for some such greeting from the aborigines nevertheless i was not sorry to have my expectations unfulfilled by the way speaking of the pilgrim fathers i often used to wonder why there was no mention made of the pilgrim mothers while our trunks were being hoisted from the hold of the ship i mounted on the roof of the cabin and took a critical view of boston as we came up the harbor i had noticed that the houses were huddled together on an immense bill at the top of which was a large building the state house towering proudly above the rest like an amiable motherhen surrounded by her brood of manycolored chickens a closer inspection did not impress me very favorably the city was not nearly so imposing as new orleans which stretches out for miles and miles in the shape of a crescent along the banks of the majestic river i soon grew tired of looking at the masses of houses rising above one another in irregular tiers and was glad my father did not propose to remain long in boston as i leaned over the rail in this mood a measlylooking little boy with no shoes said that if i would come down on the wharf hed lick me for two centsnot an exorbitant price but i didnt go down i climbed into the rigging and stared at him this as i was rejoiced to observe so exasperated him that he stood on his head on a pile of boards in order to pacify himself the first train for rivermouth left at noon after a late breakfast on board the typhoon our trunks were piled upon a baggagewagon and ourselves stowed away in a coach which must have turned at least one hundred corners before it set us down at the railway station in less time than it takes to tell it we were shooting across the country at a fearful ratenow clattering over a bridge now screaming through a tunnel here we cut a flourishing village in two like a knife and here we dived into the shadow of a pine forest sometimes we glided along the edge of the ocean and could see the sails of ships twinkling like bits of silver against the horizon sometimes we dashed across rocky pastureands where stupideyed cattle were loafing it was fun to scare lazylooking cows that lay round in groups under the newly budded trees near the railroad track we did not pause at any of the little brown stations on the route they looked just like overgrown blackwalnut clocks though at every one of them a man popped out as if he were worked by machinery and waved a red flag and appeared as though he would like to have us stop but we were an express train and made no stoppages excepting once or twice to give the engine a drink it is strange how the memory clings to some things it is over twenty years since i took that first ride to rivermouth and yet oddly enough i remember as if it were yesterday that as we passed slowly through the village of hampton we saw two boys fighting behind a red barn there was also a shaggy yellow dog who looked as if he had commenced to unravel barking himself all up into a knot with excitement we had only a hurried glimpse of the battlelong enough however to see that the combatants were equally matched and very much in earnest i am ashamed to say how many times since i have speculated as to which boy got licked maybe both the small rascals are dead now not in consequence of the setto let us hope or maybe they are married and have pugnacious urchins of their own yet to this day i sometimes find myself wondering how that fight turned out we had been riding perhaps two hours and a half when we shot by a tall factory with a chimney resembling a church steeple then the locomotive gave a scream the engineer rang his bell and we plunged into the twilight of a long wooden building open at both ends here we stopped and the conductor thrusting his head in at the car door cried out passengers for rivermouth at last we had reached our journeys end on the platform my father shook hands with a straight brisk old gentleman whose face was very serene and rosy he had on a white hat and a long swallowtailed coat the collar of which came clear up above his cars he didnt look unlike a pilgrim father this of course was grandfather nutter at whose house i was born my mother kissed him a great many times and i was glad to see him myself though i naturally did not feel very intimate with a person whom i had not seen since i was eighteen months old while we were getting into the doubleseated wagon which grandfather nutter had provided i took the opportunity of asking after the health of the pony the pony had arrived all right ten days before and was in the stable at home quite anxious to see me as we drove through the quiet old town i thought rivermouth the prettiest place in the world and i think so still the streets are long and wide shaded by gigantic american elms whose drooping branches interlacing here and there span the avenues with arches graceful enough to be the handiwork of fairies many of the houses have small flowergardens in front gay in the season with chinaasters and are substantially built with massive chimneystacks and protruding eaves a beautiful river goes rippling by the town and after turning and twisting among a lot of tiny islands empties itself into the sea the harbor is so fine that the largest ships can sail directly up to the wharves and drop anchor only they dont years ago it was a famous seaport princely fortunes were made in the west india trade and in when we were at war with great britain any number of privateers were fitted out at rivermouth to prey upon the merchant vessels of the enemy certain people grew suddenly and mysteriously rich a great many of the first families of today do not care to trace their pedigree back to the time when their grandsires owned shares in the matilda jane twentyfour guns well well few ships come to rivermouth now commerce drifted into other ports the phantom fleet sailed off one day and never came back again the crazy old warehouses are empty and barnacles and eelgrass cling to the piles of the crumbling wharves where the sunshine lies lovingly bringing out the faint spicy odor that haunts the placethe ghost of the old dead west india trade during our ride from the station i was struck of course only by the general neatness of the houses and the beauty of the elmtrees lining the streets i describe rivermouth now as i came to know it afterwards rivermouth is a very ancient town in my day there existed a tradition among the boys that it was here christopher columbus made his first landing on this continent i remember having the exact spot pointed out to me by pepper whitcomb one thing is certain captain john smith who afterwards according to the legend married pocahontaswhereby he got powhatan for a fatherinlawexplored the river in and was much charmed by the beauty of rivermouth which at that time was covered with wild strawberryvines rivermouth figures prominently in all the colonial histories every other house in the place has its tradition more or less grim and entertaining if ghosts could flourish anywhere there are certain streets in rivermouth that would be full of them i dont know of a town with so many old houses let us linger for a moment in front of the one which the oldest inhabitant is always sure to point out to the curious stranger it is a square wooden edifice with gambrel roof and deepset windowframes over the windows and doors there used to be heavy carvingsoakleaves and acorns and angels heads with wings spreading from the ears oddly jumbled together but these ornaments and other outward signs of grandeur have long since disappeared a peculiar interest attaches itself to this house not because of its age for it has not been standing quite a century nor on account of its architecture which is not strikingbut because of the illustrious men who at various periods have occupied its spacious chambers in it was an aristocratic hotel at the left side of the entrance stood a high post from which swung the sign of the earl of halifax the landlord was a stanch loyalistthat is to say be believed in the king and when the overtaxed colonies determined to throw off the british yoke the adherents to the crown held private meetings in one of the back rooms of the tavern this irritated the rebels as they were called and one night they made an attack on the earl of halifax tore down the signboard broke in the windowsashes and gave the landlord hardly time to make himself invisible over a fence in the rear for several months the shattered tavern remained deserted at last the exiled innkeeper on promising to do better was allowed to return a new sign bearing the name of william pitt the friend of america swung proudly from the doorpost and the patriots were appeased here it was that the mailcoach from boston twice a week for many a year set down its load of travelers and gossip for some of the details in this sketch i am indebted to a recently published chronicle of those times it is the french fleet is lying in the harbor of rivermouth and eight of the principal officers in white uniforms trimmed with gold lace have taken up their quarters at the sign of the william pitt who is this young and handsome officer now entering the door of the tavern it is no less a personage than the marquis lafayette who has come all the way from providence to visit the french gentlemen boarding there what a gallantlooking cavalier he is with his quick eyes and coal black hair forty years later he visited the spot again his locks were gray and his step was feeble but his heart held its young love for liberty who is this finely dressed traveler alighting from his coach andfour attended by servants in livery do you know that sounding name written in big valorous letters on the declaration of independencewritten as if by the hand of a giant can you not see it now john hancock this is he three young men with their valet are standing on the doorstep of the william pitt bowing politely and inquiring in the most courteous terms in the world if they can be accommodated it is the time of the french revolution and these are three sons of the duke of orleanslouis philippe and his two brothers louis philippe never forgot his visit to rivermouth years afterwards when he was seated on the throne of france he asked an american lady who chanced to be at his court if the pleasant old mansion were still standing but a greater and a better man than the king of the french has honored this roof here in came george washington the president of the united states to pay his final complimentary visit to the state dignitaries the wainscoted chamber where he slept and the dininghall where he entertained his guests have a certain dignity and sanctity which even the present irish tenants cannot wholly destroy during the period of my reign at rivermouth an ancient lady dame jocelyn by name lived in one of the upper rooms of this notable building she was a dashing young belle at the time of washingtons first visit to the town and must have been exceedingly coquettish and pretty judging from a certain portrait on ivory still in the possession of the family according to dame jocelyn george washington flirted with her just a little bitin what a stately and highly finished manner can be imagined there was a mirror with a deep filigreed frame hanging over the mantelpiece in this room the glass was cracked and the quicksilver rubbed off or discolored in many places when it reflected your face you had the singular pleasure of not recognizing yourself it gave your features the appearance of having been run through a mincemeat machine but what rendered the lookingglass a thing of enchantment to me was a faded green feather tipped with scarlet which drooped from the top of the tarnished gilt mouldings this feather washington took from the plume of his threecornered hat and presented with his own hand to the worshipful mistress jocelyn the day he left rivermouth forever i wish i could describe the mincing genteel air and the illconcealed selfcomplacency with which the dear old lady related the incident many a saturday afternoon have i climbed up the rickety staircase to that dingy room which always had a flavor of snuff about it to sit on a stiffbacked chair and listen for hours together to dame jocelyns stories of the olden time how she would prattle she was bedriddenpoor creatureand had not been out of the chamber for fourteen years meanwhile the world had shot ahead of dame jocelyn the changes that had taken place under her very nose were unknown to this faded crooning old gentlewoman whom the eighteenth century had neglected to take away with the rest of its odd traps she had no patience with newfangled notions the old ways and the old times were good enough for her she had never seen a steam engine though she had heard the dratted thing screech in the distance in her day when gentlefolk traveled they went in their own coaches she didnt see how respectable people could bring themselves down to riding in a car with ragtag and bobtail and lordknowswho poor old aristocrat the landlord charged her no rent for the room and the neighbors took turns in supplying her with meals towards the close of her lifeshe lived to be ninetynineshe grew very fretful and capricious about her food if she didnt chance to fancy what was sent her she had no hesitation in sending it back to the giver with miss jocelyns respectful compliments but i have been gossiping too longand yet not too long if i have impressed upon the reader an idea of what a rusty delightful old town it was to which i had come to spend the next three or four years of my boyhood a drive of twenty minutes from the station brought us to the doorstep of grandfather nutters house what kind of house it was and what sort of people lived in it shall be told in another chapter chapter five the nutter house and the nutter family the nutter houseall the more prominent dwellings in rivermouth are named after somebody for instance there is the walford house the venner house the trefethen house etc though it by no means follows that they are inhabited by the people whose names they bearthe nutter house to resume has been in our family nearly a hundred years and is an honor to the builder an ancestor of ours i believe supposing durability to be a merit if our ancestor was a carpenter he knew his trade i wish i knew mine as well such timber and such workmanship dont often come together in houses built nowadays imagine a lowstudded structure with a wide hall running through the middle at your right band as you enter stands a tall black mahogany clock looking like an egyptian mummy set up on end on each side of the hall are doors whose knobs it must be confessed do not turn very easily opening into large rooms wainscoted and rich in woodcarvings about the mantelpieces and cornices the walls are covered with pictured paper representing landscapes and seaviews in the parlor for example this enlivening figure is repeated all over the room a group of english peasants wearing italian hats are dancing on a lawn that abruptly resolves itself into a seabeach upon which stands a flabby fisherman nationality unknown quietly hauling in what appears to be a small whale and totally regardless of the dreadful naval combat going on just beyond the end of his fishingrod on the other side of the ships is the mainland again with the same peasants dancing our ancestors were very worthy people but their wallpapers were abominable there are neither grates nor stoves in these quaint chambers but splendid open chimneyplaces with room enough for the corpulent backlog to turn over comfortably on the polished andirons a wide staircase leads from the hall to the second story which is arranged much like the first over this is the garret i neednt tell a new england boy whata museum of curiosities is the garret of a wellregulated new england house of fifty or sixty years standing here meet together as if by some preconcerted arrangement all the brokendown chairs of the household all the spavined tables all the seedy hats all the intoxicatedlooking boots all the split walkingsticks that have retired from business weary with the march of life the pots the pans the trunks the bottleswho may hope to make an inventory of the numberless odds and ends collected in this bewildering lumberroom but what a place it is to sit of an afternoon with the rain pattering on the roof what a place in which to read gullivers travels or the famous adventures of rinaldo rinaldini my grandfathers house stood a little back from the main street in the shadow of two handsome elms whose overgrown boughs would dash themselves against the gables whenever the wind blew hard in the rear was a pleasant garden covering perhaps a quarter of an acre full of plumtrees and gooseberry bushes these trees were old settlers and are all dead now excepting one which bears a purple plum as big as an egg this tree as i remark is still standing and a more beautiful tree to tumble out of never grew anywhere in the northwestern comer of the garden were the stables and carriagehouse opening upon a narrow lane you may imagine that i made an early visit to that locality to inspect gypsy indeed i paid her a visit every halfhour during the first day of my arrival at the twentyfourth visit she trod on my foot rather heavily as a reminder probably that i was wearing out my welcome she was a knowing little pony that gypsy and i shall have much to say of her in the course of these pages gypsys quarters were all that could be wished but nothing among my new surroundings gave me more satisfaction than the cosey sleeping apartment that had been prepared for myself it was the hall room over the front door i had never had a chamber all to myself before and this one about twice the size of our stateroom on board the typhoon was a marvel of neatness and comfort pretty chintz curtains hung at the window and a patch quilt of more colors than were in josephs coat covered the little trucklebed the pattern of the wallpaper left nothing to be desired in that line on a gray background were small bunches of leaves unlike any that ever grew in this world and on every other bunch perched a yellowbird pitted with crimson spots as if it had just recovered from a severe attack of the smallpox that no such bird ever existed did not detract from my admiration of each one there were two hundred and sixtyeight of these birds in all not counting those split in two where the paper was badly joined i counted them once when i was laid up with a fine black eye and falling asleep immediately dreamed that the whole flock suddenly took wing and flew out of the window from that time i was never able to regard them as merely inanimate objects a washstand in the corner a chest of carved mahogany drawers a lookingglass in a filigreed frame and a highbacked chair studded with brass nails like a coffin constituted the furniture over the head of the bed were two oak shelves holding perhaps a dozen booksamong which were theodore or the peruvians robinson crusoe an odd volume of tristram shandy baxters saints rest and a fine english edition of the arabian nights with six hundred woodcuts by harvey shall i ever forget the hour when i first overhauled these books i do not allude especially to baxters saints rest which is far from being a lively work for the young but to the arabian nights and particularly robinson crusoe the thrill that ran into my fingers ends then has not run out yet many a time did i steal up to this nest of a room and taking the dogseared volume from its shelf glide off into an enchanted realm where there were no lessons to get and no boys to smash my kite in a lidless trunk in the garret i subsequently unearthed another motley collection of novels and romances embracing the adventures of baron trenck jack sheppard don quixote gil blas and charlotte templeall of which i fed upon like a bookworm i never come across a copy of any of those works without feeling a certain tenderness for the yellowhaired little rascal who used to lean above the magic pages hour after hour religiously believing every word he read and no more doubting the reality of sindbad the sailor or the knight of the sorrowful countenance than he did the existence of his own grandfather against the wall at the foot of the bed hung a singlebarrel shotgunplaced there by grandfather nutter who knew what a boy loved if ever a grandfather did as the trigger of the gun had been accidentally twisted off it was not perhaps the most dangerous weapon that could be placed in the hands of youth in this maimed condition its bump of destructiveness was much less than that of my small brass pocketpistol which i at once proceeded to suspend from one of the nails supporting the fowlingpiece for my vagaries concerning the red man had been entirely dispelled having introduced the reader to the nutter house a presentation to the nutter family naturally follows the family consisted of my grandfather his sister miss abigail nutter and kitty collins the maidofallwork grandfather nutter was a hale cheery old gentleman as straight and as bald as an arrow he had been a sailor in early life that is to say at the age of ten years he fled from the multiplicationtable and ran away to sea a single voyage satisfied him there never was but one of our family who didnt run away to sea and this one died at his birth my grandfather had also been a soldiera captain of militia in if i owe the british nation anything i owe thanks to that particular british soldier who put a musketball into the fleshy part of captain nutters leg causing that noble warrior a slight permanent limp but offsetting the injury by furnishing him with the material for a story which the old gentleman was never weary of telling and i never weary of listening to the story in brief was as follows at the breaking out of the war an english frigate lay for several days off the coast near rivermouth a strong fort defended the harbor and a regiment of minutemen scattered at various points alongshore stood ready to repel the boats should the enemy try to effect a landing captain nutter had charge of a slight earthwork just outside the mouth of the river late one thick night the sound of oars was heard the sentinel tried to fire off his gun at halfcock and couldnt when captain nutter sprung upon the parapet in the pitch darkness and shouted boat ahoyl a musketshot immediately embedded itself in the calf of his leg the captain tumbled into the fort and the boat which had probably come in search of water pulled back to the frigate this was my grandfathers only exploit during the war that his prompt and bold conduct was instrumental in teaching the enemy the hopelessness of attempting to conquer such a people was among the firm beliefs of my boyhood at the time i came to rivermouth my grandfather had retired from active pursuits and was living at ease on his money invested principally in shipping he bad been a widower many years a maiden sister the aforesaid miss abigail managing his household miss abigail also managed her brother and her brothers servant and the visitor at her brothers gatenot in a tyrannical spirit but from a philanthropic desire to be useful to everybody in person she was tall and angular she had a gray complexion gray eyes gray eyebrows and generally wore a gray dress her strongest weak point was a belief in the efficacy of hotdrops as a cure for all known diseases if there were ever two people who seemed to dislike each other miss abigail and kitty collins were those people if ever two people really loved each other miss abigail and kitty collins were those people also they were always either skirmishing or having a cup of tea lovingly together miss abigail was very fond of me and so was kitty and in the course of their disagreements each let me into the private history of the other according to kitty it was not originally my grandfathers intention to have miss abigail at the head of his domestic establishment she had swooped down on him kittys own words with a bandbox in one hand and a faded blue cotton umbrella still in existence in the other clad in this singular garbi do not remember that kitty alluded toany additional peculiarity of dressmiss abigail bad made her appearance at the door of the nutter house on the morning of my grandmothers funeral the small amount of baggage which the lady brought with her would have led the superficial observer to infer that miss abigails visit was limited to a few days i run ahead of my story in saying she remained seventeen years how much longer she would have remained can never be definitely known now as she died at the expiration of that period whether or not my grandfather was quite pleased by this unlookedfor addition to his family is a problem he was very kind always to miss abigail and seldom opposed her though i think she must have tried his patience sometimes especially when she interfered with kitty kitty collins or mrs catherine as she preferred to be called was descended in a direct line from an extensive family of kings who formerly ruled over ireland in consequence of various calamities among which the failure of the potatocrop may be mentioned miss kitty collins in company with several hundred of her countrymen and countrywomenalso descended from kingscame over to america in an emigrant ship in the year eighteen hundred and something i dont know what freak of fortune caused the royal exile to turn up at rivermouth but turn up she did a few months after arriving in this country and was hired by my grandmother to do general housework for the sum of four shillings and sixpence a week kitty had been living about seven years in my grandfathers family when she unburdened her heart of a secret which had been weighing upon it all that time it may be said of people as it is said of nations happy are they that have no history kitty had a history and a pathetic one i think on board the emigrant ship that brought her to america she became acquainted with a sailor who being touched by kittys forlorn condition was very good to her long before the end of the voyage which had been tedious and perilous she was heartbroken at the thought of separating from her kindly protector but they were not to part just yet for the sailor returned kittys affection and the two were married on their arrival at port kittys husbandshe would never mention his name but kept it locked in her bosom like some precious relichad a considerable sum of money when the crew were paid off and the young couplefor kitty was young thenlived very happily in a lodginghouse on south street near the docks this was in new york the days flew by like hours and the stocking in which the little bride kept the funds shrunk and shrunk until at last there were only three or four dollars left in the toe of it then kitty was troubled for she knew her sailor would have to go to sea again unless he could get employment on shore this he endeavored to do but not with much success one morning as usual he kissed her good day and set out in search of work kissed me goodby and called me his little irish lass sobbed kitty telling the story kissed me goodby and heaven help me i niver set oi on him nor on the likes of him again he never came back day after day dragged on night after night and then the weary weeks what had become of him had be been murdered had be fallen into the docks had hedeserted her no she could not believe that he was too brave and tender and true she couldnt believe that he was dead dead or hed come back to her meanwhile the landlord of the lodginghouse turned kitty into the streets now that her man was gone and the payment of the rent doubtful she got a place as a servant the family she lived with shortly moved to boston and she accompanied them then they went abroad but kitty would not leave america somehow she drifted to rivermouth and for seven long years never gave speech to her sorrow until the kindness of strangers who had become friends to her unsealed the heroic lips kittys story you may be sure made my grandparents treat her more kindly than ever in time she grew to be regarded less as a servant than as a friend in the home circle sharing its joys and sorrowsa faithful nurse a willing slave a happy spirit in spite of all i fancy i hear her singing over her work in the kitchen pausing from time to time to make some witty reply to miss abigailfor kitty like all her race had a vein of unconscious humor her bright honest face comes to me out from the past the light and life of the nutter house when i was a boy at rivermouth chapter six lights and shadows the first shadow that fell upon me in my new home was caused by the return of my parents to new orleans their visit was cut short by business which required my fathers presence in natchez where he was establishing a branch of the bankinghouse when they had gone a sense of loneliness such as i had never dreamed of filled my young breast i crept away to the stable and throwing my arms about gypsys neck sobbed aloud she too had come from the sunny south and was now a stranger in a strange land the little mare seemed to realize our situation and gave me all the sympathy i could ask repeatedly rubbing her soft nose over my face and lapping up my salt tears with evident relish when night came i felt still more lonesome my grandfather sat in his armchair the greater part of the evening reading the rivermouth bamacle the local newspaper there was no gas in those days and the captain read by the aid of a small blocktin lamp which he held in one hand i observed that he had a habit of dropping off into a doze every three or four minutes and i forgot my homesickness at intervals in watching him two or three times to my vast amusement he scorched the edges of the newspaper with the wick of the lamp and at about half past eight oclock i had the satisfactions am sorry to confess it was a satisfactionof seeing the rivermouth barnacle in flames my grandfather leisurely extinguished the fire with his hands and miss abigail who sat near a low table knitting by the light of an astral lamp did not even look up she was quite used to this catastrophe there was little or no conversation during the evening in fact i do not remember that anyone spoke at all excepting once when the captain remarked in a meditative manner that my parents must have reached new york by this time at which supposition i nearly strangled myself in attempting to intercept a sob the monotonous click click of miss abigails needles made me nervous after a while and finally drove me out of the sittingroom into the kitchen where kitty caused me to laugh by saying miss abigail thought that what i needed was a good dose of hotdrops a remedy she was forever ready to administer in all emergencies if a boy broke his leg or lost his mother i believe miss abigail would have given him hotdrops kitty laid herself out to be entertaining she told me several funny irish stories and described some of the odd people living in the town but in the midst of her comicalities the tears would involuntarily ooze out of my eyes though i was not a lad much addicted to weeping then kitty would put her arms around me and tell me not to mind itthat it wasnt as if i had been left alone in a foreign land with no one to care for me like a poor girl whom she had once known i brightened up before long and told kitty all about the typhoon and the old seaman whose name i tried in vain to recall and was obliged to fall back on plain sailor ben i was glad when ten oclock came the bedtime for young folks and old folks too at the nutter house alone in the hallchamber i had my cry out once for all moistening the pillow to such an extent that i was obliged to turn it over to find a dry spot to go to sleep on my grandfather wisely concluded to put me to school at once if i had been permitted to go mooning about the house and stables i should have kept my discontent alive for months the next morning accordingly he took me by the hand and we set forth for the academy which was located at the farther end of the town the temple school was a twostory brick building standing in the centre of a great square piece of land surrounded by a high picket fence there were three or four sickly trees but no grass in this enclosure which had been worn smooth and hard by the tread of multitudinous feet i noticed here and there small holes scooped in the ground indicating that it was the season for marbles a better playground for baseball couldnt have been devised on reaching the schoolhouse door the captain inquired for mr grimshaw the boy who answered our knock ushered us into a sideroom and in a few minutesduring which my eye took in fortytwo caps hung on fortytwo wooden pegsmr grimshaw made his appearance he was a slender man with white fragile hands and eyes that glanced half a dozen different ways at oncea habit probably acquired from watching the boys after a brief consultation my grandfather patted me on the head and left me in charge of this gentleman who seated himself in front of me and proceeded to sound the depth or more properly speaking the shallowness of my attainments i suspect my historical information rather startled him i recollect i gave him to understand that richard iii was the last king of england this ordeal over mr grimshaw rose and bade me follow him a door opened and i stood in the blaze of fortytwo pairs of upturned eyes i was a cool hand for my age but i lacked the boldness to face this battery without wincing in a sort of dazed way i stumbled after mr grimshaw down a narrow aisle between two rows of desks and shyly took the seat pointed out to me the faint buzz that had floated over the schoolroom at our entrance died away and the interrupted lessons were resumed by degrees i recovered my coolness and ventured to look around me the owners of the fortytwo caps were seated at small green desks like the one assigned to me the desks were arranged in six rows with spaces between just wide enough to prevent the boys whispering a blackboard set into the wall extended clear across the end of the room on a raised platform near the door stood the masters table and directly in front of this was a recitationbench capable of seating fifteen or twenty pupils a pair of globes tattooed with dragons and winged horses occupied a shelf between two windows which were so high from the floor that nothing but a giraffe could have looked out of them having possessed myself of these details i scrutinized my new acquaintances with unconcealed curiosity instinctively selecting my friends and picking out my enemiesand in only two cases did i mistake my man a sallow boy with bright red hair sitting in the fourth row shook his fist at me furtively several times during the morning i had a presentiment i should have trouble with that boy some daya presentiment subsequently realized on my left was a chubby little fellow with a great many freckles this was pepper whitcomb who made some mysterious motions to me i didnt understand them but as they were clearly of a pacific nature i winked my eye at him this appeared to be satisfactory for he then went on with his studies at recess he gave me the core of his apple though there were several applicants for it presently a boy in a loose olivegreen jacket with two rows of brass buttons held up a folded paper behind his slate intimating that it was intended for me the paper was passed skillfully from desk to desk until it reached my hands on opening the scrap i found that it contained a small piece of molasses candy in an extremely humid state this was certainly kind i nodded my acknowledgments and hastily slipped the delicacy into my mouth in a second i felt my tongue grow redhot with cayenne pepper my face must have assumed a comical expression for the boy in the olivegreen jacket gave an hysterical laugh for which he was instantly punished by mr grimshaw i swallowed the fiery candy though it brought the water to my eyes and managed to look so unconcerned that i was the only pupil in the form who escaped questioning as to the cause of mardens misdemeanor c marden was his name nothing else occurred that morning to interrupt the exercises excepting that a boy in the reading class threw us all into convulsions by calling absalom abolsom abolsom o my son abolsom i laughed as loud as anyone but i am not so sure that i shouldnt have pronounced it abolsom myself at recess several of the scholars came to my desk and shook hands with me mr grimshaw having previously introduced me to phil adams charging him to see that i got into no trouble my new acquaintances suggested that we should go to the playground we were no sooner outofdoors than the boy with the red hair thrust his way through the crowd and placed himself at my side i say youngster if youre comin to this school youve got to toe the mark i didnt see any mark to toe and didnt understand what be meant but i replied politely that if it was the custom of the school i should be happy to toe the mark if he would point it out to me i dont want any of your sarse said the boy scowling look here conwayl cried a clear voice from the other side of the playground you let young bailey alone hes a stranger here and might be afraid of you and thrash you why do you always throw yourself in the way of getting thrashed i turned to the speaker who by this time had reached the spot where we stood conway slunk off favoring me with a parting scowl of defiance i gave my hand to the boy who had befriended mehis name was jack harrisand thanked him for his goodwill i tell you what it is bailey he said returning my pressure goodnaturedly youll have to fight conway before the quarter ends or youll have no rest that fellow is always hankering after a licking and of course youll give him one by and by but whats the use of hurrying up an unpleasant job lets have some baseball by the way bailey you were a good kid not to let on to grimshaw about the candy charley marden would have caught it twice as heavy hes sorry he played the joke on you and told me to tell you so hallo blake where are the bats this was addressed to a handsome franklooking lad of about my own age who was engaged just then in cutting his initials on the bark of a tree near the schoolhouse blake shut up his penknife and went off to get the bats during the game which ensued i made the acquaintance of charley marden binny wallace pepper whitcomb harry blake and fred langdon these boys none of them more than a year or two older than i binny wallace was younger were ever after my chosen comrades phil adams and jack harris were considerably our seniors and though they always treated us kids very kindly they generally went with another set of course before long i knew all the temple boys more or less intimately but the five i have named were my constant companions my first day at the temple grammar school was on the whole satisfactory i had made several warm friends and only two permanent enemiesconway and his echo seth rodgers for these two always went together like a deranged stomach and a headache before the end of the week i had my studies well in hand i was a little ashamed at finding myself at the foot of the various classes and secretly determined to deserve promotion the school was an admirable one i might make this part of my story more entertaining by picturing mr grimshaw as a tyrant with a red nose and a large stick but unfortunately for the purposes of sensational narrative mr grimshaw was a quiet kindhearted gentleman though a rigid disciplinarian he had a keen sense of justice was a good reader of character and the boys respected him there were two other teachersa french tutor and a writingmaster who visited the school twice a week on wednesdays and saturdays we were dismissed at noon and these halfholidays were the brightest epochs of my existence daily contact with boys who had not been brought up as gently as i worked an immediate and in some respects a beneficial change in my character i had the nonsense taken out of me as the saying issome of the nonsense at least i became more manly and selfreliant i discovered that the world was not created exclusively on my account in new orleans i labored under the delusion that it was having neither brother nor sister to give up to at home and being moreover the largest pupil at school there my will had seldom been opposed at rivermouth matters were different and i was not long in adapting myself to the altered circumstances of course i got many severe rubs often unconsciously given but i bad the sense to see that i was all the better for them my social relations with my new schoolfellows were the pleasantest possible there was always some exciting excursion on foota ramble through the pine woods a visit to the devils pulpit a high cliff in the neighborhoodor a surreptitious low on the river involving an exploration of a group of diminutive islands upon one of which we pitched a tent and played we were the spanish sailors who got wrecked there years ago but the endless pine forest that skirted the town was our favorite haunt there was a great green pond hidden somewhere in its depths inhabited by a monstrous colony of turtles harry blake who had an eccentric passion for carving his name on everything never let a captured turtle slip through his fingers without leaving his mark engraved on its shell he must have lettered about two thousand from first to last we used to call them harry blakes sheep these turtles were of a discontented and migratory turn of mind and we frequently encountered two or three of them on the crossroads several miles from their ancestral mud unspeakable was our delight whenever we discovered one soberly walking off with harry blakes initials ive no doubt there are at this moment fat ancient turtles wandering about that gummy woodland with hb neatly cut on their venerable backs it soon became a custom among my playmates to make our barn their rendezvous gypsy proved a strong attraction captain nutter bought me a little twowheeled cart which she drew quite nicely after kicking out the dasher and breaking the shafts once or twice with our lunchbaskets and fishingtackle stowed away under the seat we used to start off early in the afternoon for the seashore where there were countless marvels in the shape of shells mosses and kelp gypsy enjoyed the sport as keenly as any of us even going so far one day as to trot down the beach into the sea where we were bathing as she took the cart with her our provisions were not much improved i shall never forget how squashpie tastes after being soused in the atlantic ocean sodacrackers dipped in salt water are palatable but not squashpie there was a good deal of wet weather during those first six weeks at rivermouth and we set ourselves at work to find some indoor amusement for our halfholidays it was all very well for amadis de gaul and don quixote not to mind the rain they had iron overcoats and were not from all we can learn subject to croup and the guidance of their grandfathers our case was different now boys what shall we do i asked addressing a thoughtful conclave of seven assembled in our barn one dismal rainy afternoon lets have a theatre suggested binny wallace the very thing but where the loft of the stable was ready to burst with hay provided for gypsy but the long room over the carriagehouse was unoccupied the place of all places my managerial eye saw at a glance its capabilities for a theatre i had been to the play a great many times in new orleans and was wise in matters pertaining to the drama so here in due time was set up some extraordinary scenery of my own painting the curtain i recollect though it worked smoothly enough on other occasions invariably hitched during the performances and it often required the united energies of the prince of denmark the king and the gravedigger with an occasional band from the fair ophelia pepper whitcomb in a lownecked dress to hoist that bit of green cambric the theatre however was a success as far as it went i retired from the business with no fewer than fifteen hundred pins after deducting the headless the pointless and the crooked pins with which our doorkeeper frequently got stuck from first to last we took in a great deal of this counterfeit money the price of admission to the rivermouth theatre was twenty pins i played all the principal parts myselfnot that i was a finer actor than the other boys but because i owned the establishment at the tenth representation my dramatic career was brought to a close by an unfortunate circumstance we were playing the drama of william tell the hero of switzerland of course i was william tell in spite of fred langdon who wanted to act that character himself i wouldnt let him so he withdrew from the company taking the only bow and arrow we had i made a crossbow out of a piece of whalebone and did very well without him we had reached that exciting scene where gessler the austrian tyrant commands tell to shoot the apple from his sons head pepper whitcomb who played all the juvenile and women parts was my son to guard against mischance a piece of pasteboard was fastened by a handkerchief over the upper portion of whitcombs face while the arrow to be used was sewed up in a strip of flannel i was a capital marksman and the big apple only two yards distant turned its russet cheek fairly towards me i can see poor little pepper now as he stood without flinching waiting for me to perform my great feat i raised the crossbow amid the breathless silence of the crowded audience consisting of seven boys and three girls exclusive of kitty collins who insisted on paying her way in with a clothespin i raised the crossbow i repeat twang went the whipcord but alas instead of hitting the apple the arrow flew right into pepper whitcombs mouth which happened to be open at the time and destroyed my aim i shall never be able to banish that awful moment from my memory peppers roar expressive of astonishment indignation and pain is still ringing in my cars i looked upon him as a corpse and glancing not far into the dreary future pictured myself led forth to execution in the presence of the very same spectators then assembled luckily poor pepper was not seriously hurt but grandfather nutter appearing in the midst of the confusion attracted by the howls of young tell issued an injunction against all theatricals thereafter and the place was closed not however without a farewell speech from me in which i said that this would have been the proudest moment of my life if i hadnt hit pepper whitcomb in the mouth whereupon the audience assisted i am glad to state by pepper cried hear hear i then attributed the accident to pepper himself whose mouth being open at the instant i fired acted upon the arrow much after the fashion of a whirlpool and drew in the fatal shaft i was about to explain bow a comparatively small maelstrom could suck in the largest ship when the curtain fell of its own accord amid the shouts of the audience this was my last appearance on any stage it was some time though before i heard the end of the william tell business malicious little boys who had not been allowed to buy tickets to my theatre used to cry out after me in the street who killed cock robin i said the sparrer with my bow and arrer i killed cock robini the sarcasm of this verse was more than i could stand and it made pepper whitcomb pretty mad to be called cock robin i can tell you so the days glided on with fewer clouds and more sunshine than fall to the lot of most boys conway was certainly a cloud within schoolbounds he seldom ventured to be aggressive but whenever we met about town he never failed to brush against me or pull my cap over my eyes or drive me distracted by inquiring after my family in new orleans always alluding to them as highly respectable colored people jack harris was right when he said conway would give me no rest until i fought him i felt it was ordained ages before our birth that we should meet on this planet and fight with the view of not running counter to destiny i quietly prepared myself for the impending conflict the scene of my dramatic triumphs was turned into a gymnasium for this purpose though i did not openly avow the fact to the boys by persistently standing on my head raising heavy weights and going hand over hand up a ladder i developed my muscle until my little body was as tough as a hickory knot and as supple as tripe i also took occasional lessons in the noble art of selfdefence under the tuition of phil adams i brooded over the matter until the idea of fighting conway became a part of me i fought him in imagination during schoolhours i dreamed of fighting with him at night when he would suddenly expand into a giant twelve feet high and then as suddenly shrink into a pygmy so small that i couldnt hit him in this latter shape he would get into my hair or pop into my waistcoatpocket treating me with as little ceremony as the liliputians showed captain lemuel gulliverall of which was not pleasant to be sure on the whole conway was a cloud and then i had a cloud at home it was not grandfather nutter nor miss abigail nor kitty collins though they all helped to compose it it was a vague funereal impalpable something which no amount of gymnastic training would enable me to knock over it was sunday if ever i have a boy to bring up in the way he should go i intend to make sunday a cheerful day to him sunday was not a cheerful day at the nutter house you shall judge for yourself it is sunday morning i should premise by saying that the deep gloom which has settled over everything set in like a heavy fog early on saturday evening at seven oclock my grandfather comes smilelessly downstairs he is dressed in black and looks as if be had lost all his friends during the night miss abigail also in black looks as if she were prepared to bury them and not indisposed to enjoy the ceremony even kitty collins has caught the contagious gloom as i perceive when she brings in the coffeeuma solemn and sculpturesque urn at any time but monumental nowand sets it down in front of miss abigail miss abigail gazes at the urn as if it held the ashes of her ancestors instead of a generous quantity of fine old java coffee the meal progresses in silence our parlor is by no means thrown open every day it is open this june morning and is pervaded by a strong smell of centretable the furniture of the room and the little china ornaments on the mantelpiece have a constrained unfamiliar look my grandfather sits in a mahogany chair reading a large bible covered with green baize miss abigail occupies one end of the sofa and has her hands crossed stiffly in her lap i sit in the comer crushed robinson crusoe and gil blas are in close confinement baron trenck who managed to escape from the fortress of clatz cant for the life of him get out of our sittingroom closet even the rivermouth barnacle is suppressed until monday genial converse harmless books smiles lightsome hearts all are banished if i want to read anything i can read baxters saints rest i would die first so i sit there kicking my heels thinking about new orleans and watching a morbid bluebottle fly that attempts to commit suicide by butting his head against the windowpane listenno yesit isit is the robins singing in the gardenthe grateful joyous robins singing away like mad just as if it wasnt sunday their audacity tickles me my grandfather looks up and inquires in a sepulchral voice if i am ready for sabbath school it is time to go i like the sabbath school there are bright young faces there at all events when i get out into the sunshine alone i draw a long breath i would turn a somersault up against neighbor penhallows newly painted fence if i hadnt my best trousers on so glad am i to escape from the oppressive atmosphere of the nutter house sabbath school over i go to meeting joining my grandfather who doesnt appear to be any relation to me this day and miss abigail in the porch our minister holds out very little hope to any of us of being saved convinced that i am a lost creature in common with the human family i return home behind my guardians at a snails pace we have a dead cold dinner i saw it laid out yesterday there is a long interval between this repast and the second service and a still longer interval between the beginning and the end of that service for the rev wibird hawkinss sermons are none of the shortest whatever else they may be after meeting my grandfather and i take a walk we visit appropriately enougha neighboring graveyard i am by this time in a condition of mind to become a willing inmate of the place the usual evening prayermeeting is postponed for some reason at half past eight i go to bed this is the way sunday was observed in the nutter house and pretty generally throughout the town twenty years ago people who were prosperous and natural and happy on saturday became the most rueful of human beings in the brief space of twelve hours i dont think there was any hypocrisy in this it was merely the old puritan austerity cropping out once a week many of these people were pure christians every day in the sevenexcepting the seventh then they were decorous and solemn to the verge of moroseness i should not like to be misunderstood on this point sunday is a blessed day and therefore it should not be made a gloomy one it is the lords day and i do believe that cheerful hearts and faces are not unpleasant in his sight o day of rest how beautiful how fair how welcome to the weary and the old day of the lord and truce to earthly cares day of the lord as all our days should be ah why will man by his austerities shut out the blessed sunshine and the light and make of thee a dungeon of despair about chapter seven one memorable night two months had elapsed since my arrival at rivermouth when the approach of an important celebration produced the greatest excitement among the juvenile population of the town there was very little hard study done in the temple grammar school the week preceding the fourth of july for my part my heart and brain were so full of firecrackers roman candles rockets pinwheels squibs and gunpowder in various seductive forms that i wonder i didnt explode under mr grimshaws very nose i couldnt do a sum to save me i couldnt tell for love or money whether tallahassee was the capital of tennessee or of florida the present and the pluperfect tenses were inextricably mixed in my memory and i didnt know a verb from an adjective when i met one this was not alone my condition but that of every boy in the school mr grimshaw considerately made allowances for our temporary distraction and sought to fix our interest on the lessons by connecting them directly or indirectly with the coming event the class in arithmetic for instance was requested to state how many boxes of firecrackers each box measuring sixteen inches square could be stored in a room of such and such dimensions he gave us the declaration of independence for a parsing exercise and in geography confined his questions almost exclusively to localities rendered famous in the revolutionary war what did the people of boston do with the tea on board the english vessels asked our wily instructor threw it into the river shrieked the smaller boys with an impetuosity that made mr grimshaw smile in spite of himself one luckless urchin said chucked it for which happy expression he was kept in at recess notwithstanding these clever stratagems there was not much solid work done by anybody the trail of the serpent an inexpensive but dangerous firetoy was over us all we went round deformed by quantities of chinese crackers artlessly concealed in our trouserspockets and if a boy whipped out his handkerchief without proper precaution he was sure to let off two or three torpedoes even mr grimshaw was made a sort of accessory to the universal demoralization in calling the school to order he always rapped on the table with a heavy ruler under the green baize tablecloth on the exact spot where he usually struck certain boy whose name i withhold placed a fat torpedo the result was a loud explosion which caused mr grimshaw to look queer charley marden was at the waterpail at the time and directed general attention to himself by strangling for several seconds and then squirting a slender thread of water over the blackboard mr grimshaw fixed his eyes reproachfully on charley but said nothing the real culprit it wasnt charley marden but the boy whose name i withhold instantly regretted his badness and after school confessed the whole thing to mr grimshaw who heaped coals of fire upon the nameless boys head giving him five cents for the fourth of july if mr grimshaw had caned this unknown youth the punishment would not have been half so severe on the last day of june the captain received a letter from my father enclosing five dollars for my son tom which enabled that young gentleman to make regal preparations for the celebration of our national independence a portion of this money two dollars i hastened to invest in fireworks the balance i put by for contingencies in placing the fund in my possession the captain imposed one condition that dampened my ardor considerablyi was to buy no gunpowder i might have all the snappingcrackers and torpedoes i wanted but gunpowder was out of the question i thought this rather hard for all my young friends were provided with pistols of various sizes pepper whitcomb had a horsepistol nearly as large as himself and jack harris though he to be sure was a big boy was going to have a real oldfashioned flintlock musket however i didnt mean to let this drawback destroy my happiness i had one charge of powder stowed away in the little brass pistol which i brought from new orleans and was bound to make a noise in the world once if i never did again it was a custom observed from time immemorial for the townsboys to have a bonfire on the square on the midnight before the fourth i didnt ask the captains leave to attend this ceremony for i had a general idea that he wouldnt give it if the captain i reasoned doesnt forbid me i break no orders by going now this was a specious line of argument and the mishaps that befell me in consequence of adopting it were richly deserved on the evening of the d i retired to bed very early in order to disarm suspicion i didnt sleep a wink waiting for eleven oclock to come round and i thought it never would come round as i lay counting from time to time the slow strokes of the ponderous bell in the steeple of the old north church at length the laggard hour arrived while the clock was striking i jumped out of bed and began dressing my grandfather and miss abigail were heavy sleepers and i might have stolen downstairs and out at the front door undetected but such a commonplace proceeding did not suit my adventurous disposition i fastened one end of a rope it was a few yards cut from kitty collinss clothesline to the bedpost nearest the window and cautiously climbed out on the wide pediment over the hall door i had neglected to knot the rope the result was that the moment i swung clear of the pediment i descended like a flash of lightning and warmed both my hands smartly the rope moreover was four or five feet too short so i got a fall that would have proved serious had i not tumbled into the middle of one of the big rosebushes growing on either side of the steps i scrambled out of that without delay and was congratulating myself on my good luck when i saw by the light of the setting moon the form of a man leaning over the garden gate it was one of the town watch who had probably been observing my operations with curiosity seeing no chance of escape i put a bold face on the matter and walked directly up to him what on airth air you a doin asked the man grasping the collar of my jacket i live here sir if you please i replied and am going to the bonfire i didnt want to wake up the old folks thats all the man cocked his eye at me in the most amiable manner and released his hold boys is boys he muttered he didnt attempt to stop me as i slipped through the gate once beyond his clutches i took to my heels and soon reached the square where i found forty or fifty fellows assembled engaged in building a pyramid of tarbarrels the palms of my hands still tingled so that i couldnt join in the sport i stood in the doorway of the nautilus bank watching the workers among whom i recognized lots of my schoolmates they looked like a legion of imps coming and going in the twilight busy in raising some infernal edifice what a babel of voices it was everybody directing everybody else and everybody doing everything wrong when all was prepared someone applied a match to the sombre pile a fiery tongue thrust itself out here and there then suddenly the whole fabric burst into flames blazing and crackling beautifully this was a signal for the boys to join hands and dance around the burning barrels which they did shouting like mad creatures when the fire had burnt down a little fresh staves were brought and heaped on the pyre in the excitement of the moment i forgot my tingling palms and found myself in the thick of the carousal before we were half ready our combustible material was expended and a disheartening kind of darkness settled down upon us the boys collected together here and there in knots consulting as to what should be done it yet lacked four or five hours of daybreak and none of us were in the humor to return to bed i approached one of the groups standing near the town pump and discovered in the uncertain light of the dying brands the figures of jack harris phil adams harry blake and pepper whitcomb their faces streaked with perspiration and tar and their whole appearance suggestive of new zealand chiefs hullo heres tom bailey shouted pepper whitcomb hell join in of course he would the sting had gone out of my hands and i was ripe for anythingnone the less ripe for not knowing what was on the tapis after whispering together for a moment the boys motioned me to follow them we glided out from the crowd and silently wended our way through a neighboring alley at the head of which stood a tumbledown old barn owned by one ezra wingate in former days this was the stable of the mailcoach that ran between rivermouth and boston when the railroad superseded that primitive mode of travel the lumbering vehicle was rolled in the barn and there it stayed the stagedriver after prophesying the immediate downfall of the nation died of grief and apoplexy and the old coach followed in his wake as fast as could by quietly dropping to pieces the barn had the reputation of being haunted and i think we all kept very close together when we found ourselves standing in the black shadow cast by the tall gable here in a low voice jack harris laid bare his plan which was to burn the ancient stagecoach the old trundlecart isnt worth twentyfive cents said jack harris and ezra wingate ought to thank us for getting the rubbish out of the way but if any fellow here doesnt want to have a hand in it let him cut and run and keep a quiet tongue in his head ever after with this he pulled out the staples that held the lock and the big barn door swung slowly open the interior of the stable was pitchdark of course as we made a movement to enter a sudden scrambling and the sound of heavy bodies leaping in all directions caused us to start back in terror rats cried phil adams bats exclaimed harry blake cats suggested jack harris whos afraid well the truth is we were all afraid and if the pole of the stage had not been lying close to the threshold i dont believe anything on earth would have induced us to cross it we seized hold of the polestraps and succeeded with great trouble in dragging the coach out the two fore wheels had rusted to the axletree and refused to revolve it was the merest skeleton of a coach the cushions had long since been removed and the leather hangings where they had not crumbled away dangled in shreds from the wormeaten frame a load of ghosts and a span of phantom horses to drag them would have made the ghastly thing complete luckily for our undertaking the stable stood at the top of a very steep hill with three boys to push behind and two in front to steer we started the old coach on its last trip with little or no difficulty our speed increased every moment and the fore wheels becoming unlocked as we arrived at the foot of the declivity we charged upon the crowd like a regiment of cavalry scattering the people right and left before reaching the bonfire to which someone had added several bushels of shavings jack harris and phil adams who were steering dropped on the ground and allowed the vehicle to pass over them which it did without injuring them but the boys who were clinging for dear life to the trunkrack behind fell over the prostrate steersman and there we all lay in a heap two or three of us quite picturesque with the nosebleed the coach with an intuitive perception of what was expected of it plunged into the centre of the kindling shavings and stopped the flames sprung up and clung to the rotten woodwork which burned like tinder at this moment a figure was seen leaping wildly from the inside of the blazing coach the figure made three bounds towards us and tripped over harry blake it was pepper whitcomb with his hair somewhat singed and his eyebrows completely scorched off pepper had slyly ensconced himself on the back seat before we started intending to have a neat little ride down hill and a laugh at us afterwards but the laugh as it happened was on our side or would have been if half a dozen watchmen had not suddenly pounced down upon us as we lay scrambling on the ground weak with mirth over peppers misfortune we were collared and marched off before we well knew what had happened the abrupt transition from the noise and light of the square to the silent gloomy brick room in the rear of the meat market seemed like the work of enchantment we stared at each other aghast well remarked jack harris with a sickly smile this is a go no go i should say whimpered harry blake glancing at the bare brick walls and the heavy ironplated door never say die muttered phil adams dolefully the bridewell was a small lowstudded chamber built up against the rear end of the meat market and approached from the square by a narrow passageway a portion of the rooms partitioned off into eight cells numbered each capable of holding two persons the cells were full at the time as we presently discovered by seeing several hideous faces leering out at us through the gratings of the doors a smoky oillamp in a lantern suspended from the ceiling threw a flickering light over the apartment which contained no furniture excepting a couple of stout wooden benches it was a dismal place by night and only little less dismal by day tall houses surrounding the lockup prevented the faintest ray of sunshine from penetrating the ventilator over the doorlong narrow window opening inward and propped up by a piece of lath as we seated ourselves in a row on one of the benches i imagine that our aspect was anything but cheerful adams and harris looked very anxious and harry blake whose nose had just stopped bleeding was mournfully carving his name by sheer force of habit on the prison bench i dont think i ever saw a more wrecked expression on any human countenance than pepper whitcombs presented his look of natural astonishment at finding himself incarcerated in a jail was considerably heightened by his lack of eyebrows as for me it was only by thinking how the late baron trenck would have conducted himself under similar circumstances that i was able to restrain my tears none of us were inclined to conversation a deep silence broken now and then by a startling snore from the cells reigned throughout the chamber by and by pepper whitcomb glanced nervously towards phil adams and said phil do you think they willhang us hang your grandmother returned adams impatiently what im afraid of is that theyll keep us locked up until the fourth is over you aint smart ef they do cried a voice from one of the cells it was a deep bass voice that sent a chill through me who are you said jack harris addressing the cells in general for the echoing qualities of the room made it difficult to locate the voice that dont matter replied the speaker putting his face close up to the gratings of no but ef i was a youngster like you free an easy outside there this spot wouldnt hold me long thats so i chimed several of the prisonbirds wagging their heads behind the iron lattices hush whispered jack harris rising from his seat and walking on tiptoe to the door of cell no what would you do do why id pile them ere benches up agin that ere door an crawl out of that erc winder in no time thats my adwice and werry good adwice it is jim said the occupant of no approvingly jack harris seemed to be of the same opinion for he hastily placed the benches one on the top of another under the ventilator and climbing up on the highest bench peeped out into the passageway if any gent happens to have a ninepence about him said the man in cell no theres a sufferin family here as could make use of it smallest favors gratefully received an no questions axed this appeal touched a new silver quarter of a dollar in my trouserspocket i fished out the coin from a mass of fireworks and gave it to the prisoner he appeared to be so goodnatured a fellow that i ventured to ask what he had done to get into jail intirely innocent i was clapped in here by a rascally nevew as wishes to enjoy my wealth afore im dead your name sir i inquired with a view of reporting the outrage to my grandfather and having the injured person re instated in society git out you insolent young reptyle shouted the man in a passion i retreated precipitately amid a roar of laughter from the other cells cant you keep still exclaimed harris withdrawing his head from the window a portly watchman usually sat on a stool outside the door day and night but on this particular occasion his services being required elsewhere the bridewell had been left to guard itself all clear whispered jack harris as he vanished through the aperture and dropped softly on the ground outside we all followed him expeditiouslypepper whitcomb and myself getting stuck in the window for a moment in our frantic efforts not to be last now boys everybody for himself chapter eight the adventures of a fourth the sun cast a broad column of quivering gold across the river at the foot of our street just as i reached the doorstep of the nutter house kitty collins with her dress tucked about her so that she looked as if she had on a pair of calico trousers was washing off the sidewalk arrah you bad boy cried kitty leaning on the mop handle the capen has jist been askin for you hes gone up town now its a nate thing you done with my clothesline and its me you may thank for gettin it out of the way before the capen come down the kind creature had hauled in the rope and my escapade had not been discovered by the family but i knew very well that the burning of the stagecoach and the arrest of the boys concerned in the mischief were sure to reach my grandfathers ears sooner or later well thomas said the old gentleman an hour or so afterwards beaming upon me benevolently across the breakfast table you didnt wait to be called this morning no sir i replied growing very warm i took a little run up town to see what was going on i didnt say anything about the little run i took home again they had quite a time on the square last night remarked captain nutter looking up from the rivermouth bamacle which was always placed beside his coffeecup at breakfast i felt that my hair was preparing to stand on end quite a time continued my grandfather some boys broke into ezra wingates barn and carried off the old stagecoach the young rascals i do believe theyd burn up the whole town if they had their way with this he resumed the paper after a long silence he exclaimed hullo upon which i nearly fell off the chair miscreants unknown read my grandfather following the paragraph with his forefinger escaped from the bridewell leaving no clew to their identity except the letter h cut on one of the benches five dollars reward offered for the apprehension of the perpetrators sho i hope wingate will catch them i dont see how i continued to live for on hearing this the breath went entirely out of my body i beat a retreat from the room as soon as i could and flew to the stable with a misty intention of mounting gypsy and escaping from the place i was pondering what steps to take when jack harris and charley marden entered the yard i say said harris as blithe as a lark has old wingate been here been here i cried i should hope not the whole things out you know said harris pulling gypsys forelock over her eyes and blowing playfully into her nostrils you dont mean it i gasped yes i do and we are to pay wingate three dollars apiece hell make rather a good spec out of it but how did he discover that we were thethe miscreants i asked quoting mechanically from the rivermouth bamacle why he saw us take the old ark confound him hes been trying to sell it any time these ten years now he has sold it to us when he found that we had slipped out of the meat market he went right off and wrote the advertisement offering five dollars reward though he knew well enough who had taken the coach for he came round to my fathers house before the paper was printed to talk the matter over wasnt the governor mad though but its all settled i tell you were to pay wingate fifteen dollars for the old gocart which he wanted to sell the other day for seventyfive cents and couldnt its a downright swindle but the funny part of it is to come o theres a funny part to it is there i remarked bitterly yes the moment bill conway saw the advertisement he knew it was harry blake who cut that letter h on the bench so off he rushes up to wingatekind of him wasnt itand claims the reward too late young man says old wingate the culprits has been discovered you see slyboots hadnt any intention of paying that five dollars jack harriss statement lifted a weight from my bosom the article in the rivermouth barnacle bad placed the affair before me in a new light i had thoughtlessly committed a grave offence though the property in question was valueless we were clearly wrong in destroying it at the same time mr wingate had tacitly sanctioned the act by not preventing it when he might easily have done so he had allowed his property to be destroyed in order that be might realize a large profit without waiting to hear more i went straight to captain nutter and laying my remaining three dollars on his knee confessed my share in the previous nights transaction the captain heard me through in profound silence pocketed the banknotes and walked off without speaking a word he had punished me in his own whimsical fashion at the breakfast table for at the very moment be was harrowing up my soul by reading the extracts from the rivermouth barnacle he not only knew all about the bonfire but had paid ezra wingate his three dollars such was the duplicity of that aged impostor i think captain nutter was justified in retaining my pocketmoney as additional punishment though the possession of it later in the day would have got me out of a difficult position as the reader will see further on i returned with a light heart and a large piece of punk to my friends in the stableyard where we celebrated the termination of our trouble by setting off two packs of firecrackers in an empty winecask they made a prodigious racket but failed somehow to fully express my feelings the little brass pistol in my bedroom suddenly occurred to me it had been loaded i dont know how many months long before i left new orleans and now was the time if ever to fire it off muskets blunderbusses and pistols were banging away lively all over town and the smell of gunpowder floating on the air set me wild to add something respectable to the universal din when the pistol was produced jack harris examined the rusty cap and prophesied that it would not explode never mind said i lets try it i had fired the pistol once secretly in new orleans and remembering the noise it gave birth to on that occasion i shut both eyes tight as i pulled the trigger the hammer clicked on the cap with a dull dead sound then harris tried it then charley marden then i took it again and after three or four trials was on the point of giving it up as a bad job when the obstinate thing went off with a tremendous explosion nearly jerking my arm from the socket the smoke cleared away and there i stood with the stock of the pistol clutched convulsively in my handthe barrel lock trigger and ramrod having vanished into thin air are you hurt cried the boys in one breath nno i replied dubiously for the concussion had bewildered me a little when i realized the nature of the calamity my grief was excessive i cant imagine what led me to do so ridiculous a thing but i gravely buried the remains of my beloved pistol in our back garden and erected over the mound a slate tablet to the effect that mr barker formerly of new orleans was killed accidentally on the fourth of july in the nd year of his age binny wallace arriving on the spot just after the disaster and charley marden who enjoyed the obsequies immensely acted with me as chief mourners i for my part was a very sincere one as i turned away in a disconsolate mood from the garden charley marden remarked that he shouldnt be surprised if the pistolbutt took root and grew into a mahoganytree or something he said he once planted an old musketstock and shortly afterwards a lot of shoots sprung up jack harris laughed but neither i nor binny wallace saw charleys wicked joke we were now joined by pepper whitcomb fred langdon and several other desperate characters on their way to the square which was always a busy place when public festivities were going on feeling that i was still in disgrace with the captain i thought it politic to ask his consent before accompanying the boys he gave it with some hesitation advising me to be careful not to get in front of the firearms once he put his fingers mechanically into his vestpocket and half drew forth some dollar bills then slowly thrust them back again as his sense of justice overcame his genial disposition i guess it cut the old gentleman to the heart to be obliged to keep me out of my pocketmoney i know it did me however as i was passing through the hall miss abigail with a very severe cast of countenance slipped a brandnew quarter into my hand we had silver currency in those days thank heaven great were the bustle and confusion on the square by the way i dont know why they called this large open space a square unless because it was an ovalan oval formed by the confluence of half a dozen streets now thronged by crowds of smartly dressed townspeople and country folks for rivermouth on the fourth was the centre of attraction to the inhabitants of the neighboring villages on one side of the square were twenty or thirty booths arranged in a semicircle gay with little flags and seductive with lemonade gingerbeer and seedcakes here and there were tables at which could be purchased the smaller sort of fireworks such as pinwheels serpents doubleheaders and punk warranted not to go out many of the adjacent houses made a pretty display of bunting and across each of the streets opening on the square was an arch of spruce and evergreen blossoming all over with patriotic mottoes and paper roses it was a noisy merry bewildering scene as we came upon the ground the incessant rattle of small arms the booming of the twelvepounder firing on the mill dam and the silvery clangor of the churchbells ringing simultaneouslynot to mention an ambitious brassband that was blowing itself to pieces on a balconywere enough to drive one distracted we amused ourselves for an hour or two darting in and out among the crowd and setting off our crackers at one oclock the hon hezekiah elkins mounted a platform in the middle of the square and delivered an oration to which his fellercitizens didnt pay much attention having all they could do to dodge the squibs that were set loose upon them by mischievous boys stationed on the surrounding housetops our little party which had picked up recruits here and there not being swayed by eloquence withdrew to a booth on the outskirts of the crowd where we regaled ourselves with root beer at two cents a glass i recollect being much struck by the placard surmounting this tent root beer sold here it seemed to me the perfection of pith and poetry what could be more terse not a word to spare and yet everything fully expressed rhyme and rhythm faultless it was a delightful poet who made those verses as for the beer itselfthat i think must have been made from the root of all evil a single glass of it insured an uninterrupted pain for twentyfour hours the influence of my liberality working on charley mardenfor it was i who paid for the beerhe presently invited us all to take an icecream with him at pettingils saloon pettingil was the delmonico of rivermouth he furnished ices and confectionery for aristocratic balls and parties and didnt disdain to officiate as leader of the orchestra at the same for pettingil played on the violin as pepper whitcomb described it like old scratch pettingils confectionery store was on the corner of willow and high streets the saloon separated from the shop by a flight of three steps leading to a door hung with faded red drapery had about it an air of mystery and seclusion quite delightful four windows also draped faced the sidestreet affording an unobstructed view of marm hatchs back yard where a number of inexplicable garments on a clothesline were always to be seen careering in the wind there was a lull just then in the icecream business it being dinnertime and we found the saloon unoccupied when we had seated ourselves around the largest marbletopped table charley marden in a manly voice ordered twelve sixpenny icecreams strawberry and verneller mixed it was a magnificent sight those twelve chilly glasses entering the room on a waiter the red and white custard rising from each glass like a churchsteeple and the spoonhandle shooting up from the apex like a spire i doubt if a person of the nicest palate could have distinguished with his eyes shut which was the vanilla and which the strawberry but if i could at this moment obtain a cream tasting as that did i would give five dollars for a very small quantity we fell to with a will and so evenly balanced were our capabilities that we finished our creams together the spoons clinking in the glasses like one spoon lets have some more cried charley marden with the air of aladdin ordering up a fresh hogshead of pearls and rubies tom bailey tell pettingil to send in another round could i credit my ears i looked at him to see if he were in earnest he meant it in a moment more i was leaning over the counter giving directions for a second supply thinking it would make no difference to such a gorgeous young sybarite as marden i took the liberty of ordering ninepenny creams this time on returning to the saloon what was my horror at finding it empty there were the twelve cloudy glasses standing in a circle on the sticky marble slab and not a boy to be seen a pair of hands letting go their hold on the windowsill outside explained matters i had been made a victim i couldnt stay and face pettingil whose peppery temper was well known among the boys i hadnt a cent in the world to appease him what should i do i heard the clink of approaching glassesthe ninepenny creams i rushed to the nearest window it was only five feet to the ground i threw myself out as if i had been an old hat landing on my feet i fled breathlessly down high street through willow and was turning into brierwood place when the sound of several voices calling to me in distress stopped my progress look out you fool the mine the mine yelled the warning voices several men and boys were standing at the head of the street making insane gestures to me to avoid something but i saw no mine only in the middle of the road in front of me was a common flourbarrel which as i gazed at it suddenly rose into the air with a terrific explosion i felt myself thrown violently off my feet i remember nothing else excepting that as i went up i caught a momentary glimpse of ezra wingate leering through is shop window like an avenging spirit the mine that had wrought me woe was not properly a mine at all but merely a few ounces of powder placed under an empty keg or barrel and fired with a slowmatch boys who didnt happen to have pistols or cannon generally burnt their powder in this fashion for an account of what followed i am indebted to hearsay for i was insensible when the people picked me up and carried me home on a shutter borrowed from the proprietor of pettingils saloon i was supposed to be killed but happily happily for me at least i was merely stunned i lay in a semiunconscious state until eight oclock that night when i attempted to speak miss abigail who watched by the bedside put her ear down to my lips and was saluted with these remarkable words strawberry and verneller mixed mercy on us what is the boy saying cried miss abigail rootbeersoldhere this inscription is copied from a triangularshaped piece of slate still preserved in the garret of the nutter house together with the pistol butt itself which was subsequently dug up for a postmortem examination chapter nine i become an r m c in the course of ten days i recovered sufficiently from my injuries to attend school where for a little while i was looked upon as a hero on account of having been blown up what dont we make a hero of the distraction which prevailed in the classes the week preceding the fourth bad subsided and nothing remained to indicate the recent festivities excepting a noticeable want of eyebrows on the part of pepper whitcomb and myself in august we had two weeks vacation it was about this time that i became a member of the rivermouth centipedes a secret society composed of twelve of the temple grammar school boys this was an honor to which i had long aspired but being a new boy i was not admitted to the fraternity until my character had fully developed itself it was a very select society the object of which i never fathomed though i was an active member of the body during the remainder of my residence at rivermouth and at one time held the onerous position of f c first centipede each of the elect wore a copper cent some occult association being established between a cent apiece and a centipedes suspended by a string round his neck the medals were worn next the skin and it was while bathing one day at grave point with jack harris and fred langdon that i had my curiosity roused to the highest pitch by a sight of these singular emblems as soon as i ascertained the existence of a boys club of course i was ready to die to join it and eventually i was allowed to join the initiation ceremony took place in fred langdons barn where i was submitted to a series of trials not calculated to soothe the nerves of a timorous boy before being led to the grotto of enchantmentsuch was the modest title given to the loft over my friends woodhousemy hands were securely pinioned and my eyes covered with a thick silk handkerchief at the head of the stairs i was told in an unrecognizable husky voice that it was not yet too late to retreat if i felt myself physically too weak to undergo the necessary tortures i replied that i was not too weak in a tone which i intended to be resolute but which in spite of me seemed to come from the pit of my stomach it is well said the husky voice i did not feel so sure about that but having made up my mind to be a centipede a centipede i was bound to be other boys had passed through the ordeal and lived why should not i a prolonged silence followed this preliminary examination and i was wondering what would come next when a pistol fired off close by my car deafened me for a moment the unknown voice then directed me to take ten steps forward and stop at the word halt i took ten steps and halted stricken mortal said a second husky voice more husky if possible than the first if you had advanced another inch you would have disappeared down an abyss three thousand feet deep i naturally shrunk back at this friendly piece of information a prick from some twopronged instrument evidently a pitchfork gently checked my retreat i was then conducted to the brink of several other precipices and ordered to step over many dangerous chasms where the result would have been instant death if i had committed the least mistake i have neglected to say that my movements were accompanied by dismal groans from different parts of the grotto finally i was led up a steep plank to what appeared to me an incalculable height here i stood breathless while the bylaws were read aloud a more extraordinary code of laws never came from the brain of man the penalties attached to the abject being who should reveal any of the secrets of the society were enough to make the blood run cold a second pistolshot was heard the something i stood on sunk with a crash beneath my feet and i fell two miles as nearly as i could compute it at the same instant the handkerchief was whisked from my eyes and i found myself standing in an empty hogshead surrounded by twelve masked figures fantastically dressed one of the conspirators was really appalling with a tin saucepan on his head and a tigerskin sleighrobe thrown over his shoulders i scarcely need say that there were no vestiges to be seen of the fearful gulfs over which i had passed so cautiously my ascent had been to the top of the hogshead and my descent to the bottom thereof holding one another by the hand and chanting a low dirge the mystic twelve revolved about me this concluded the ceremony with a merry shout the boys threw off their masks and i was declared a regularly installed member of the r m c i afterwards had a good deal of sport out of the club for these initiations as you may imagine were sometimes very comical spectacles especially when the aspirant for centipedal honors happened to be of a timid disposition if he showed the slightest terror he was certain to be tricked unmercifully one of our subsequent devicesa humble invention of my ownwas to request the blindfolded candidate to put out his tongue whereupon the first centipede would say in a low tone as if not intended for the ear of the victim diabolus fetch me the redhot iron the expedition with which that tongue would disappear was simply ridiculous our meetings were held in various barns at no stated periods but as circumstances suggested any member had a right to call a meeting each boy who failed to report himself was fined one cent whenever a member had reasons for thinking that another member would be unable to attend he called a meeting for instance immediately on learning the death of harry blakes greatgrandfather i issued a call by these simple and ingenious measures we kept our treasury in a flourishing condition sometimes having on hand as much as a dollar and a quarter i have said that the society had no special object it is true there was a tacit understanding among us that the centipedes were to stand by one another on all occasions though i dont remember that they did but further than this we had no purpose unless it was to accomplish as a body the same amount of mischief which we were sure to do as individuals to mystify the staid and slowgoing rivermouthians was our frequent pleasure several of our pranks won us such a reputation among the townsfolk that we were credited with having a large finger in whatever went amiss in the place one morning about a week after my admission into the secret order the quiet citizens awoke to find that the signboards of all the principal streets had changed places during the night people who went trustfully to sleep in currant square opened their eyes in honeysuckle terrace joness avenue at the north end had suddenly become walnut street and peanut street was nowhere to be found confusion reigned the town authorities took the matter in hand without delay and six of the temple grammar school boys were summoned to appear before justice clapbam having tearfully disclaimed to my grandfather all knowledge of the transaction i disappeared from the family circle and was not apprehended until late in the afternoon when the captain dragged me ignominiously from the haymow and conducted me more dead than alive to the office of justice clapham here i encountered five other pallid culprits who had been fished out of divers coalbins garrets and chickencoops to answer the demands of the outraged laws charley marden had hidden himself in a pile of gravel behind his fathers house and looked like a recently exhumed mummy there was not the least evidence against us and indeed we were wholly innocent of the offence the trick as was afterwards proved had been played by a party of soldiers stationed at the fort in the harbor we were indebted for our arrest to master conway who had slyly dropped a hint within the hearing of selectman mudge to the effect that young bailey and his five cronies could tell something about them signs when he was called upon to make good his assertion he was considerably more terrified than the centipedes though they were ready to sink into their shoes at our next meeting it was unanimously resolved that conways animosity should not be quietly submitted to he had sought to inform against us in the stagecoach business he had volunteered to carry pettingils little bill for twentyfour icecreams to charley mardens father and now he had caused us to be arraigned before justice clapham on a charge equally groundless and painful after much noisy discussion a plan of retaliation was agreed upon there was a certain slim mild apothecary in the town by the name of meeks it was generally given out that mr meeks had a vague desire to get married but being a shy and timorous youth lacked the moral courage to do so it was also well known that the widow conway had not buried her heart with the late lamented as to her shyness that was not so clear indeed her attentions to mr meeks whose mother she might have been were of a nature not to be misunderstood and were not misunderstood by anyone but mr meeks himself the widow carried on a dressmaking establishment at her residence on the comer opposite meekss drugstore and kept a wary eye on all the young ladies from miss dorothy gibbss female institute who patronized the shop for sodawater aciddrops and slatepencils in the afternoon the widow was usually seen seated smartly dressed at her window upstairs casting destructive glances across the streetthe artificial roses in her cap and her whole languishing manner saying as plainly as a label on a prescription to be taken immediately but mr meeks didnt take the ladys fondness and the gentlemans blindness were topics ably handled at every sewingcircle in the town it was through these two luckless individuals that we proposed to strike a blow at the common enemy to kill less than three birds with one stone did not suit our sanguinary purpose we disliked the widow not so much for her sentimentality as for being the mother of bill conway we disliked mr meeks not because he was insipid like his own syrups but because the widow loved him bill conway we hated for himself late one dark saturday night in september we carried our plan into effect on the following morning as the orderly citizens wended their way to church past the widows abode their sober faces relaxed at beholding over her front door the well known gilt mortar and pestle which usually stood on the top of a pole on the opposite corner while the passers on that side of the street were equally amused and scandalized at seeing a placard bearing the following announcement tacked to the druggists windowshutters wanted a sempstress the naughty cleverness of the joke which i should be sorry to defend was recognized at once it spread like wildfire over the town and though the mortar and the placard were speedily removed our triumph was complete the whole community was on the broad grin and our participation in the affair seemingly unsuspected it was those wicked soldiers at the fort chapter ten i fight conway there was one person however who cherished a strong suspicion that the centipedes had had a hand in the business and that person was conway his red hair seemed to change to a livelier red and his sallow cheeks to a deeper sallow as we glanced at him stealthily over the tops of our slates the next day in school he knew we were watching him and made sundry mouths and scowled in the most threatening way over his sums conway had an accomplishment peculiarly his ownthat of throwing his thumbs out of joint at will sometimes while absorbed in study or on becoming nervous at recitation he performed the feat unconsciously throughout this entire morning his thumbs were observed to be in a chronic state of dislocation indicating great mental agitation on the part of the owner we fully expected an outbreak from him at recess but the intermission passed off tranquilly somewhat to our disappointment at the close of the afternoon session it happened that binny wallace and myself having got swamped in our latin exercise were detained in school for the purpose of refreshing our memories with a page of mr andrewss perplexing irregular verbs binny wallace finishing his task first was dismissed i followed shortly after and on stepping into the playground saw my little friend plastered as it were up against the fence and conway standing in front of him ready to deliver a blow on the upturned unprotected face whose gentleness would have stayed any arm but a cowards seth rodgers with both hands in his pockets was leaning against the pump lazily enjoying the sport but on seeing me sweep across the yard whirling my strap of books in the air like a sling he called out lustily lay low conwayl heres young baileyl conway turned just in time to catch on his shoulder the blow intended for his head he reached forward one of his long armshe had arms like a windmill that boyand grasping me by the hair tore out quite a respectable handful the tears flew to my eyes but they were not the tears of defeat they were merely the involuntary tribute which nature paid to the departed tresses in a second my little jacket lay on the ground and i stood on guard resting lightly on my right leg and keeping my eye fixed steadily on conwaysin all of which i was faithfully following the instructions of phil adams whose father subscribed to a sporting journal conway also threw himself into a defensive attitude and there we were glaring at each other motionless neither of us disposed to risk an attack but both on the alert to resist one there is no telling how long we might have remained in that absurd position had we not been interrupted it was a custom with the larger pupils to return to the playground after school and play baseball until sundown the town authorities had prohibited ballplaying on the square and there being no other available place the boys fell back perforce on the schoolyard just at this crisis a dozen or so of the templars entered the gate and seeing at a glance the belligerent status of conway and myself dropped bat and ball and rushed to the spot where we stood is it a fight asked phil adams who saw by our freshness that we had not yet got to work yes its a fight i answered unless conway will ask wallaces pardon promise never to hector me in futureand put back my hair this last condition was rather a staggerer i shant do nothing of the sort said conway sulkily then the thing must go on said adams with dignity rodgers as i understand it is your second conway bailey come here whats the row about he was thrashing binny wallace no i wasnt interrupted conway but i was going to because he knows who put meekss mortar over our door and i know well enough who did it it was that sneaking little mulatter pointing at me o by george i cried reddening at the insult cool is the word said adams as he bound a handkerchief round my head and carefully tucked away the long straggling locks that offered a tempting advantage to the enemy who ever heard of a fellow with such a head of hair going into action muttered phil twitching the handkerchief to ascertain if it were securely tied he then loosened my gallowses braces and buckled them tightly above my hips now then bantam never say die conway regarded these businesslike preparations with evident misgiving for he called rodgers to his side and had himself arrayed in a similar manner though his hair was cropped so close that you couldnt have taken hold of it with a pair of tweezers is your man ready asked phil adams addressing rodgers ready keep your back to the gate tom whispered phil in my car and youll have the sun in his eyes behold us once more face to face like david and the philistine look at us as long as you may for this is all you shall see of the combat according to my thinking the hospital teaches a better lesson than the battlefield i will tell you about my black eye and my swollen lip if you will but not a word of the fight youll get no description of it from me simply because i think it would prove very poor reading and not because i consider my revolt against conways tyranny unjustifiable i had borne conways persecutions for many months with lamblike patience i might have shielded myself by appealing to mr grimshaw but no boy in the temple grammar school could do that without losing caste whether this was just or not doesnt matter a pin since it was soa traditionary law of the place the personal inconvenience i suffered from my tormentor was nothing to the pain he inflicted on me indirectly by his persistent cruelty to little binny wallace i should have lacked the spirit of a hen if i had not resented it finally i am glad that i faced conway and asked no favors and got rid of him forever i am glad that phil adams taught me to box and i say to all youngsters learn to box to ride to pull an oar and to swim the occasion may come round when a decent proficiency in one or the rest of these accomplishments will be of service to you in one of the best books ever written for boys are these words learn to box then as you learn to play cricket and football not one of you will be the worse but very much the better for learning to box well should you never have to use it in earnest theres no exercise in the world so good for the temper and for the muscles of the back and legs as for fighting keep out of it if you can by all means when the time comes if ever it should that you have to say yes or no to a challenge to fight say no if you canonly take care you make it plain to yourself why you say no its a proof of the highest courage if done from true christian motives its quite right and justifiable if done from a simple aversion to physical pain and danger but dont say no because you fear a licking and say or think its because you fear god for thats neither christian nor honest and if you do fight fight it out and dont give in while you can stand and see and dont give in when you cant say for i could stand very little and see not at all having pommelled the school pump for the last twenty seconds when conway retired from the field as phil adams stepped up to shake hands with me he received a telling blow in the stomach for all the fight was not out of me yet and i mistook him for a new adversary convinced of my error i accepted his congratulations with those of the other boys blandly and blindly i remember that binny wallace wanted to give me his silver pencilcase the gentle soul had stood throughout the contest with his face turned to the fence suffering untold agony a good wash at the pump and a cold key applied to my eye refreshed me amazingly escorted by two or three of the schoolfellows i walked home through the pleasant autumn twilight battered but triumphant as i went along my cap cocked on one side to keep the chilly air from my eye i felt that i was not only following my nose but following it so closely that i was in some danger of treading on it i seemed to have nose enough for the whole party my left cheek also was puffed out like a dumpling i couldnt help saying to myself if this is victory how about that other fellow tom said harry blake hesitating well did you see mr grimshaw looking out of the recitationroom window just as we left the yard no was he though i am sure of it then he must have seen all the row shouldnt wonder no he didnt broke in adams or he would have stopped it short metre but i guess be saw you pitching into the pump which you did uncommonly strongand of course be smelt mischief directly well it cant be helped now i reflected as the monkey said when he fell out of the cocoanut tree added charley marden trying to make me laugh it was early candlelight when we reached the house miss abigail opening the front door started back at my hilarious appearance i tried to smile upon her sweetly but the smile rippling over my swollen cheek and dying away like a spent wave on my nose produced an expression of which miss abigail declared she had never seen the like excepting on the face of a chinese idol she hustled me unceremoniously into the presence of my grandfather in the sittingroom captain nutter as the recognized professional warrior of our family could not consistently take me to task for fighting conway nor was he disposed to do so for the captain was well aware of the longcontinued provocation i had endured ah you rascal cried the old gentleman after hearing my story just like me when i was youngalways in one kind of trouble or another i believe it runs in the family i think said miss abigail without the faintest expression on her countenance that a tablespoonful of hotdro the captain interrupted miss abigail peremptorily directing her to make a shade out of cardboard and black silk to tie over my eye miss abigail must have been possessed with the idea that i had taken up pugilism as a profession for she turned out no fewer than six of these blinders theyll be handy to have in the house says miss abigail grimly of course so great a breach of discipline was not to be passed over by mr grimshaw he had as we suspected witnessed the closing scene of the fight from the schoolroom window and the next morning after prayers i was not wholly unprepared when master conway and myself were called up to the desk for examination conway with a piece of courtplaster in the shape of a maltese cross on his right cheek and i with the silk patch over my left eye caused a general titter through the room silence said mr grimshaw sharply as the reader is already familiar with the leading points in the case of bailey versus conway i shall not report the trial further than to say that adams marden and several other pupils testified to the fact that conway had imposed on me ever since my first day at the temple school their evidence also went to show that conway was a quarrelsome character generally bad for conway seth rodgers on the part of his friend proved that i had struck the first blow that was bad for me if you please sir said binny wallace holding up his hand for permission to speak bailey didnt fight on his own account he fought on my account and if you please sir i am the boy to be blamed for i was the cause of the trouble this drew out the story of conways harsh treatment of the smaller boys as binny related the wrongs of his playfellows saying very little of his own grievances i noticed that mr grimshaws hand unknown to himself perhaps rested lightly from time to time on wallaces sunny hair the examination finished mr grimshaw leaned on the desk thoughtfully for a moment and then said every boy in this school knows that it is against the rules to fight if one boy maltreats another within schoolbounds or within schoolhours that is a matter for me to settle the case should be laid before me i disapprove of talebearing i never encourage it in the slightest degree but when one pupil systematically persecutes a schoolmate it is the duty of some headboy to inform me no pupil has a right to take the law into his own hands if there is any fighting to be done i am the person to be consulted i disapprove of boys fighting it is unnecessary and unchristian in the present instance i consider every large boy in this school at fault but as the offence is one of omission rather than commission my punishment must rest only on the two boys convicted of misdemeanor conway loses his recess for a month and bailey has a page added to his latin lessons for the next four recitations i now request bailey and conway to shake hands in the presence of the school and acknowledge their regret at what has occurred conway and i approached each other slowly and cautiously as if we were bent upon another hostile collision we clasped hands in the tamest manner imaginable and conway mumbled im sorry i fought with you i think you are i replied drily and im sorry i had to thrash you you can go to your seats said mr grimshaw turning his face aside to hide a smile i am sure my apology was a very good one i never had any more trouble with conway he and his shadow seth rodgers gave me a wide berth for many months nor was binny wallace subjected to further molestation miss abigails sanitary stores including a bottle of opodeldoc were never called into requisition the six black silk patches with their elastic strings are still dangling from a beam in the garret of the nutter house waiting for me to get into fresh difficulties tom browns school days at rugby chapter eleven all about gypsy this record of my life at rivermouth would be strangely incomplete did i not devote an entire chapter to gypsy i had other pets of course for what healthy boy could long exist without numerous friends in the animal kingdom i had two white mice that were forever gnawing their way out of a pasteboard chateau and crawling over my face when i lay asleep i used to keep the pinkeyed little beggars in my bedroom greatly to the annoyance of miss abigail who was constantly fancying that one of the mice had secreted itself somewhere about her person i also owned a dog a terrier who managed in some inscrutable way to pick a quarrel with the moon and on bright nights kept up such a kiyiing in our back garden that we were finally forced to dispose of him at private sale he was purchased by mr oxford the butcher i protested against the arrangement and ever afterwards when we had sausages from mr oxfords shop i made believe i detected in them certain evidences that cato had been foully dealt with of birds i had no endrobins purplemartins wrens bulfinches bobolinks ringdoves and pigeons at one time i took solid comfort in the iniquitous society of a dissipated old parrot who talked so terribly that the rev wibird hawkins happening to get a sample of polls vituperative powers pronounced him a benighted heathen and advised the captain to get rid of him a brace of turtles supplanted the parrot in my affections the turtles gave way to rabbits and the rabbits in turn yielded to the superior charms of a small monkey which the captain bought of a sailor lately from the coast of africa but gypsy was the prime favorite in spite of many rivals i never grew weary of her she was the most knowing little thing in the world her proper sphere in lifeand the one to which she ultimately attainedwas the sawdust arena of a travelling circus there was nothing short of the three rs reading riting and rithmetic that gypsy couldnt be taught the gift of speech was not hers but the faculty of thought was my little friend to be sure was not exempt from certain graceful weaknesses inseparable perhaps from the female character she was very pretty and she knew it she was also passionately fond of dressby which i mean her best harness when she had this on her curvetings and prancings were laughable though in ordinary tackle she went along demurely enough there was something in the enamelled leather and the silverwashed mountings that chimed with her artistic sense to have her mane braided and a rose or a pansy stuck into her forelock was to make her too conceited for anything she had another trait not rare among her sex she liked the attentions of young gentlemen while the society of girls bored her she would drag them sulkily in the cart but as for permitting one of them in the saddle the idea was preposterous once when pepper whitcombs sister in spite of our remonstrances ventured to mount her gypsy gave a little indignant neigh and tossed the gentle emma heels over head in no time but with any of the boys the mare was as docile as a lamb her treatment of the several members of the family was comical for the captain she entertained a wholesome respect and was always on her good behavior when he was around as to miss abigail gypsy simply laughed at herliterally laughed contracting her upper lip and displaying all her snowwhite teeth as if something about miss abigail struck her gypsy as being extremely ridiculous kitty collins for some reason or another was afraid of the pony or pretended to be the sagacious little animal knew it of course and frequently when kitty was banging out clothes near the stable the mare being loose in the yard would make short plunges at her once gypsy seized the basket of clothespins with her teeth and rising on her hind legs pawing the air with her fore feet followed kitty clear up to the scullery steps that part of the yard was shut off from the rest by a gate but no gate was proof against gypsys ingenuity she could let down bars lift up latches draw bolts and turn all sorts of buttons this accomplishment rendered it hazardous for miss abigail or kitty to leave any eatables on the kitchen table near the window on one occasion gypsy put in her head and lapped up six custard pies that had been placed by the casement to cool an account of my young ladys various pranks would fill a thick volume a favorite trick of hers on being requested to walk like miss abigail was to assume a little skittish gait so true to nature that miss abigail herself was obliged to admit the cleverness of the imitation the idea of putting gypsy through a systematic course of instruction was suggested to me by a visit to the circus which gave an annual performance in rivermouth this show embraced among its attractions a number of trained shetland ponies and i determined that gypsy should likewise have the benefit of a liberal education i succeeded in teaching her to waltz to fire a pistol by tugging at a string tied to the trigger to lie down dead to wink one eye and to execute many other feats of a difficult nature she took to her studies admirably and enjoyed the whole thing as much as anyone the monkey was a perpetual marvel to gypsy they became bosomfriends in an incredibly brief period and were never easy out of each others sight prince zanythats what pepper whitcomb and i christened him one day much to the disgust of the monkey who bit a piece out of peppers noseresided in the stable and went to roost every night on the ponys back where i usually found him in the morning whenever i rode out i was obliged to secure his highness the prince with a stout cord to the fence he chattering all the time like a madman one afternoon as i was cantering through the crowded part of the town i noticed that the people in the street stopped stared at me and fell to laughing i turned round in the saddle and there was zany with a great burdock leaf in his paw perched up behind me on the crupper as solemn as a judge after a few months poor zany sickened mysteriously and died the dark thought occurred to me then and comes back to me now with redoubled force that miss abigail must have given him some hotdrops zany left a large circle of sorrowing friends if not relatives gypsy i think never entirely recovered from the shock occasioned by his early demise she became fonder of me though and one of her cunningest demonstrations was to escape from the stableyard and trot up to the door of the temple grammar school where i would discover her at recess patiently waiting for me with her fore feet on the second step and wisps of straw standing out all over her like quills upon the fretful porcupine i should fail if i tried to tell you how dear the pony was to me even hard unloving men become attached to the horses they take care of so i who was neither unloving nor hard grew to love every glossy hair of the pretty little creature that depended on me for her soft straw bed and her daily modicum of oats in my prayer at night i never forgot to mention gypsy with the rest of the familygenerally setting forth her claims first whatever relates to gypsy belongs properly to this narrative therefore i offer no apology for rescuing from oblivion and boldly printing here a short composition which i wrote in the early part of my first quarter at the temple grammar school it is my maiden effort in a difficult art and is perhaps lacking in those graces of thought and style which are reached only after the severest practice every wednesday morning on entering school each pupil was expected to lay his exercise on mr grimshaws desk the subject was usually selected by mr grimshaw himself the monday previous with a humor characteristic of him our teacher had instituted two prizes one for the best and the other for the worst composition of the month the first prize consisted of a penknife or a pencilcase or some such article dear to the heart of youth the second prize entitled the winner to wear for an hour or two a sort of conical paper cap on the front of which was written in tall letters this modest admission i am a dunce the competitor who took prize no wasnt generally an object of envy my pulse beat high with pride and expectation that wednesday morning as i laid my essay neatly folded on the masters table i firmly decline to say which prize i won but heres the composition to speak for itself it is no smallauthor vanity that induces me to publish this stray leaf of natural history i lay it before our young folks not for their admiration but for their criticism let each reader take his leadpencil and remorselessly correct the orthography the capitalization and the punctuation of the essay i shall not feel hurt at seeing my treatise cut all to pieces though i think highly of the production not on account of its literary excellence which i candidly admit is not overpowering but because it was written years and years ago about gypsy by a little fellow who when i strive to recall him appears to me like a reduced ghost of my present self i am confident that any reader who has ever had pets birds or animals will forgive me for this brief digression chapter twelve winter at rivermouth i guess were going to have a regular oldfashioned snowstorm said captain nutter one bleak december morning casting a peculiarly nautical glance skyward the captain was always hazarding prophecies about the weather which somehow never turned out according to his prediction the vanes on the churchsteeples seemed to take fiendish pleasure in humiliating the dear old gentleman if he said it was going to be a clear day a dense seafog was pretty certain to set in before noon once he caused a protracted drought by assuring us every morning for six consecutive weeks that it would rain in a few hours but sure enough that afternoon it began snowing now i had not seen a snowstorm since i was eighteen months old and of course remembered nothing about it a boy familiar from his infancy with the rigors of our new england winters can form no idea of the impression made on me by this natural phenomenon my delight and surprise were as boundless as if the heavy gray sky had let down a shower of pond lilies and white roses instead of snowflakes it happened to be a halfholiday so i had nothing to do but watch the feathery crystals whirling hither and thither through the air i stood by the sittingroom window gazing at the wonder until twilight shut out the novel scene we had had several slight flurries of hail and snow before but this was a regular noreaster several inches of snow had already fallen the rosebushes at the door drooped with the weight of their magical blossoms and the two posts that held the garden gate were transformed into stately turks with white turbans guarding the entrance to the nutter house the storm increased at sundown and continued with unabated violence through the night the next morning when i jumped out of bed the sun was shining brightly the cloudless heavens wore the tender azure of june and the whole earth lay muffled up to the eyes as it were in a thick mantle of milkwhite down it was a very deep snow the oldest inhabitant what would become of a new england town or village without its oldest inhabitant overhauled his almanacs and pronounced it the deepest snow we had bad for twenty years it couldnt have been much deeper without smothering us all our street was a sight to be seen or rather it was a sight not to be seen for very little street was visible one huge drift completely banked up our front door and half covered my bedroom window there was no school that day for all the thoroughfares were impassable by twelve oclock however the great snowploughs each drawn by four yokes of oxen broke a wagonpath through the principal streets but the footpassengers had a hard time of it floundering in the arctic drifts the captain and i cut a tunnel three feet wide and six feet high from our front door to the sidewalk opposite it was a beautiful cavern with its walls and roof inlaid with motherofpearl and diamonds i am sure the ice palace of the russian empress in cowpers poem was not a more superb piece of architecture the thermometer began falling shortly before sunset and we had the bitterest cold night i ever experienced this brought out the oldest inhabitant again the next dayand what a gay old boy he was for deciding everything our tunnel was turned into solid ice a crust thick enough to bear men and horses had formed over the snow everywhere and the air was alive with merry sleighbells icy stalactites a yard long bung from the eaves of the house and the turkish sentinels at the gate looked as if they had given up all hopes of ever being relieved from duty so the winter set in cold and glittering everything outofdoors was sheathed in silver mail to quote from charley marden it was cold enough to freeze the tail off a brass monkeyan observation which seemed to me extremely happy though i knew little or nothing concerning the endurance of brass monkeys having never seen one i had looked forward to the advent of the season with grave apprehensions nerving myself to meet dreary nights and monotonous days but summer itself was not more jolly than winter at rivermouth snowballing at school skating on the mill pond coasting by moonlight long rides behind gypsy in a brandnew little sleigh built expressly for her were sports no less exhilarating than those which belonged to the sunny months and then thanksgiving the nose of memorywhy shouldnt memory have a nosedilates with pleasure over the rich perfume of miss abigails forty mincepies each one more delightful than the other like the sultans forty wives christmas was another redletter day though it was not so generally observed in new england as it is now the great woodfire in the tiled chimneyplace made our sittingroom very cheerful of winter nights when the northwind howled about the eaves and the sharp fingers of the sleet tapped against the windowpanes it was nice to be so warmly sheltered from the storm a dish of apples and a pitcher of chilly cider were always served during the evening the captain had a funny way of leaning back in the chair and eating his apple with his eyes closed sometimes i played dominos with him and sometimes miss abigail read aloud to us pronouncing to toe and sounding all the eds in a former chapter i alluded to miss abigails managing propensities she had affected many changes in the nutter house before i came there to live but there was one thing against which she bad long contended without being able to overcome this was the captains pipe on first taking command of the household she prohibited smoking in the sittingroom where it had been the old gentlemans custom to take a whiff or two of the fragrant weed after meals the edict went forthand so did the pipe an excellent move no doubt but then the house was his and if he saw fit to keep a tub of tobacco burning in the middle of the parlor floor he had a perfect right to do so however be humored her in this as in other matters and smoked by stealth like a guilty creature in the barn or about the gardens that was practicable in summer but in winter the captain was hard put to it when he couldnt stand it longer he retreated to his bedroom and barricaded the door such was the position of affairs at the time of which i write one morning a few days after the great snow as miss abigail was dusting the chronometer in the ball she beheld captain nutter slowly descending the staircase with a long clay pipe in his mouth miss abigail could hardly credit her own eyes danel she gasped retiring heavily on the hatrack the tone of reproach with which this word was uttered failed to produce the slightest effect on the captain who merely removed the pipe from his lips for an instant and blew a cloud into the chilly air the thermometer stood at two degrees below zero in our hall danel cried miss abigail hystericallydanel dont come near me whereupon she fainted away for the smell of tobaccosmoke always made her deadly sick kitty collins rushed from the kitchen with a basin of water and set to work bathing miss abigails temples and chafing her hands i thought my grandfather rather cruel as be stood there with a halfsmile on his countenance complacently watching miss abigails sufferings when she was brought to the captain sat down beside her and with a lovely twinkle in his eye said softly abigail my dear there wasnt any tobacco in that pipe it was a new pipe i fetched it down for tom to blow soapbubbles with at these words kitty collins hurried away her featuresworking strangely several minutes later i came upon her in the scullery with the greater portion of a crash towel stuffed into her mouth miss abygil smelt the terbacca with her oi cried kitty partially removing the cloth and then immediately stopping herself up again the captains joke furnished usthat is kitty and mewith mirth for many a day as to miss abigail i think she never wholly pardoned him after this captain nutter gradually gave up smoking which is an untidy injurious disgraceful and highly pleasant habit a boys life in a secluded new england town in winter does not afford many points for illustration of course he gets his ears or toes frostbitten of course he smashes his sled against another boys of course be bangs his bead on the ice and hes a lad of no enterprise whatever if be doesnt manage to skate into an eelhole and be brought home half drowned all these things happened to me but as they lack novelty i pass them over to tell you about the famous snowfort which we built on slatters hill chapter thirteen the snow fort on slatters hill the memory of man even that of the oldest inhabitant runneth not back to the time when there did not exist a feud between the north end and the south end boys of rivermouth the origin of the feud is involved in mystery it is impossible to say which party was the first aggressor in the faroff anterevolutionary ages but the fact remains that the youngsters of those antipodal sections entertained a mortal hatred for each other and that this hatred had been handed down from generation to generation like miles standishs punchbowl i know not what laws natural or unnatural regulated the warmth of the quarrel but at some seasons it raged more violently than at others this winter both parties were unusually lively and antagonistic great was the wrath of the southenders when they discovered that the northenders bad thrown up a fort on the crown of slatters hill slatters hill or nomansland as it was generally called was a rise of ground covering perhaps an acre and a quarter situated on an imaginary line marking the boundary between the two districts an immense stratum of granite which here and there thrust out a wrinkled boulder prevented the site from being used for building purposes the street ran on either side of the hill from one part of which a quantity of rock had been removed to form the underpinning of the new jail this excavation made the approach from that point all but impossible especially when the ragged ledges were aglitter with ice you see what a spot it was for a snowfort one evening twenty or thirty of the northenders quietly took possession of slatters hill and threw up a strong line of breastworks something after this shape ft slatter graphic the rear of the entrenchment being protected by the quarry was left open the walls were four feet high and twentytwo inches thick strengthened at the angles by stakes driven firmly into the ground fancy the rage of the southenders the next day when they spied our snowy citadel with jack harriss red silk pocket handkerchief floating defiantly from the flagstaff in less than an hour it was known all over town in military circles at least that the puddledockers and the riverrats these were the derisive subtitles bestowed on our southend foes intended to attack the fort that saturday afternoon at two oclock all the fighting boys of the temple grammar school and as many recruits as we could muster lay behind the walls of fort slatter with three hundred compact snowballs piled up in pyramids awaiting the approach of the enemy the enemy was not slow in making his approachfifty strong headed by one mat ames our forces were under the command of general j harris before the action commenced a meeting was arranged between the rival commanders who drew up and signed certain rules and regulations respecting the conduct of the battle as it was impossible for the northenders to occupy the fort permanently it was stipulated that the southenders should assault it only on wednesday and saturday afternoons between the hours of two and six for them to take possession of the place at any other time was not to constitute a capture but on the contrary was to be considered a dishonorable and cowardly act the northenders on the other hand agreed to give up the fort whenever ten of the storming party succeeded in obtaining at one time a footing on the parapet and were able to hold the same for the space of two minutes both sides were to abstain from putting pebbles into their snowballs nor was it permissible to use frozen ammunition a snowball soaked in water and left out to cool was a projectile which in previous years had been resorted to with disastrous results these preliminaries settled the commanders retired to their respective corps the interview had taken place on the hillside between the opposing lines general harris divided his men into two bodies the first comprised the most skilful marksmen or gunners the second the reserve force was composed of the strongest boys whose duty it was to repel the scaling parties and to make occasional sallies for the purpose of capturing prisoners who were bound by the articles of treaty to faithfully serve under our flag until they were exchanged at the close of the day the repellers were called light infantry but when they carried on operations beyond the fort they became cavalry it was also their duty w hen not otherwise engaged to manufacture snowballs the generals staff consisted of five templars i among the number with the rank of major who carried the generals orders and looked after the wounded general mat ames a veteran commander was no less wideawake in the disposition of his army five companies each numbering but six men in order not to present too big a target to our sharpshooters were to charge the fort from different points their advance being covered by a heavy fire from the gunners posted in the rear each scaler was provided with only two rounds of ammunition which were not to be used until he had mounted the breastwork and could deliver his shots on our heads the drawing below represents the interior of the fort just previous to the assault nothing on earth could represent the state of things after the first volley fort slatter detail graphic the thrilling moment had now arrived if i had been going into a real engagement i could not have been more deeply impressed by the importance of the occasion the fort opened fire firsta single ball from the dexterous band of general harris taking general ames in the very pit of his stomach a cheer went up from fort slatter in an instant the air was thick with flying missiles in the midst of which we dimly descried the storming parties sweeping up the hill shoulder to shoulder the shouts of the leaders and the snowballs bursting like shells about our ears made it very lively not more than a dozen of the enemy succeeded in reaching the crest of the hill five of these clambered upon the icy walls where they were instantly grabbed by the legs and jerked into the fort the rest retired confused and blinded by our welldirected fire when general harris with his right eye bunged up said soldiers i am proud of you my heart swelled in my bosom the victory however had not been without its price six northenders having rushed out to harass the discomfited enemy were gallantly cut off by general ames and captured among these were lieutenant p whitcomb who had no business to join in the charge being weak in the knees and captain fred langdon of general harriss staff whitcomb was one of the most notable shots on our side though he was not much to boast of in a roughandtumble fight owing to the weakness before mentioned general ames put him among the gunners and we were quickly made aware of the loss we had sustained by receiving a frequent artful ball which seemed to light with unerring instinct on any nose that was the least bit exposed i have known one of peppers snowballs fired pointblank to turn a comer and hit a boy who considered himself absolutely safe but we had no time for vain regrets the battle raged already there were two bad cases of black eye and one of nosebleed in the hospital it was glorious excitement those pellmell onslaughts and handtohand struggles twice we were within an ace of being driven from our stronghold when general harris and his staff leaped recklessly upon the ramparts and hurled the besiegers heels over head down hill at sunset the garrison of fort slatter was still unconquered and the southenders in a solid phalanx marched off whistling yankee doodle while we cheered and jeered them until they were out of hearing general ames remained behind to effect an exchange of prisoners we held thirteen of his men and he eleven of ours general ames proposed to call it an even thing since many of his eleven prisoners were officers while nearly all our thirteen captives were privates a dispute arising on this point the two noble generals came to fisticuffs and in thefracas our brave commander got his remaining well eye badly damaged this didnt prevent him from writing a general order the next day on a slate in which he complimented the troops on their heroic behavior on the following wednesday the siege was renewed i forget whether it was on that afternoon or the next that we lost fort slatter but lose it we did with much valuable ammunition and several men after a series of desperate assaults we forced general ames to capitulate and he in turn made the place too hot to hold us so from day to day the tide of battle surged to and fro sometimes favoring our arms and sometimes those of the enemy general ames handled his men with great skill his deadliest foe could not deny that once he outgeneralled our commander in the following manner he massed his gunners on our left and opened a brisk fire under cover of which a single company six men advanced on that angle of the fort our reserves on the right rushed over to defend the threatened point meanwhile four companies of the enemys scalers made a detour round the foot of the hill and dashed into fort slatter without opposition at the same moment general amess gunners closed in on our left and there we were between two fires of course we had to vacate the fort a cloud rested on general harriss military reputation until his superior tactics enabled him to dispossess the enemy as the winter wore on the warspirit waxed fiercer and fiercer at length the provision against using heavy substances in the snowballs was disregarded a ball stuck full of sandbird shot came tearing into fort slatter in retaliation general harris ordered a broadside of shells i e snowballs containing marbles after this both sides never failed to freeze their ammunition it was no longer childs play to march up to the walls of fort slatter nor was the position of the besieged less perilous at every assault three or four boys on each side were disabled it was not an infrequent occurrence for the combatants to hold up a flag of truce while they removed some insensible comrade matters grew worse and worse seven northenders had been seriously wounded and a dozen southenders were reported on the sick list the selectmen of the town awoke to the fact of what was going on and detailed a posse of police to prevent further disturbance the boys at the foot of the hill southenders as it happened finding themselves assailed in the rear and on the flank turned round and attempted to beat off the watchmen in this they were sustained by numerous volunteers from the fort who looked upon the interference as tyrannical the watch were determined fellows and charged the boys valiantly driving them all into the fort where we made common cause fighting side by side like the best of friends in vain the four guardians of the peace rushed up the hill flourishing their clubs and calling upon us to surrender they could not get within ten yards of the fort our fire was so destructive in one of the onsets a man named mugridge more valorous than his peers threw himself upon the parapet when he was seized by twenty pairs of hands and dragged inside the breastwork where fifteen boys sat down on him to keep him quiet perceiving that it was impossible with their small number to dislodge us the watch sent for reinforcements their call was responded to not only by the whole constabulary force eight men but by a numerous body of citizens who had become alarmed at the prospect of a riot this formidable array brought us to our senses we began to think that maybe discretion was the better part of valor general harris and general ames with their respective staffs held a council of war in the hospital and a backward movement was decided on so after one grand farewell volley we fled sliding jumping rolling tumbling down the quarry at the rear of the fort and escaped without losing a man but we lost fort slatter forever those battlescarred ramparts were razed to the ground and humiliating ashes sprinkled over the historic spot near which a solitary lynxeyed policeman was seen prowling from time to time during the rest of the winter the event passed into a legend and afterwards when later instances of pluck and endurance were spoken of the boys would say by golly you ought to have been at the fights on slatters hill chapter fourteen the cruise of the dolphin it was spring again the snow had faded away like a dream and we were awakened so to speak by the sudden chirping of robins in our back garden marvellous transformation of snowdrifts into lilacs wondrous miracle of the unfolding leaf we read in the holy book how our saviour at the marriagefeast changed the water into wine we pause and wonder but every hour a greater miracle is wrought at our very feet if we have but eyes to see it i had now been a year at rivermouth if you do not know what sort of boy i was it is not because i havent been frank with you of my progress at school i say little for this is a story pure and simple and not a treatise on education behold me however well up in most of the classes i have worn my latin grammar into tatters and am in the first book of virgil i interlard my conversation at home with easy quotations from that poet and impress captain nutter with a lofty notion of my learning i am likewise translating les aventures de telemaque from the french and shall tackle blairs lectures the next term i am ashamed of my crude composition about the horse and can do better now sometimes my head almost aches with the variety of my knowledge i consider mr grimshaw the greatest scholar that ever lived and i dont know which i would rather bea learned man like him or a circus rider my thoughts revert to this particular spring more frequently than to any other period of my boyhood for it was marked by an event that left an indelible impression on my memory as i pen these pages i feel that i am writing of something which happened yesterday so vividly it all comes back to me every rivermouth boy looks upon the sea as being in some way mixed up with his destiny while he is yet a baby lying in his cradle he hears the dull faroff boom of the breakers when be is older he wanders by the sandy shore watching the waves that come plunging up the beach like whitemaned seahorses as thoreau calls them his eye follows the lessening sail as it fades into the blue horizon and he burns for the time when he shall stand on the quarterdeck of his own ship and go sailing proudly across that mysterious waste of waters then the town itself is full of hints and flavors of the sea the gables and roofs of the houses facing eastward are covered with red rust like the flukes of old anchors a salty smell pervades the air and dense gray fogs the very breath of ocean periodically creep up into the quiet streets and envelop everything the terrific storms that lash the coast the kelp and spars and sometimes the bodies of drowned men tossed on shore by the scornful waves the shipyards the wharves and the tawny fleet of fishingsmacks yearly fitted out at rivermouththese things and a hundred other feed the imagination and fill the brain of every healthy boy with dreams of adventure he learns to swim almost as soon as he can walk he draws in with his mothers milk the art of handling an oar he is born a sailor whatever he may turn out to be afterwards to own the whole or a portion of a rowboat is his earliest ambition no wonder that i born to this life and coming back to it with freshest sympathies should have caught the prevailing infection no wonder i longed to buy a part of the trim little sailboat dolphin which chanced just then to be in the market this was in the latter part of may three shares at five or six dollars each i forget which had already been taken by phil adams fred langdon and binny wallace the fourth and remaining share hung fire unless a purchaser could be found for this the bargain was to fall through i am afraid i required but slight urging to join in the investment i had four dollars and fifty cents on hand and the treasurer of the centipedes advanced me the balance receiving my silver pencilcase as ample security it was a proud moment when i stood on the wharf with my partners inspecting the dolphin moored at the foot of a very slippery flight of steps she was painted white with a green stripe outside and on the stern a yellow dolphin with its scarlet mouth wide open stared with a surprised expression at its own reflection in the water the boat was a great bargain i whirled my cap in the air and ran to the stairs leading down from the wharf when a hand was laid gently on my shoulder i turned and faced captain nutter i never saw such an old sharpeye as he was in those days i knew he wouldnt be angry with me for buying a rowboat but i also knew that the little bowsprit suggesting a jib and the tapering mast ready for its few square feet of canvas were trifles not likely to meet his approval as far as rowing on the river among the wharves was concerned the captain had long since withdrawn his decided objections having convinced himself by going out with me several times that i could manage a pair of sculls as well as anybody i was right in my surmises he commanded me in the most emphatic terms never to go out in the dolphin without leaving the mast in the boathouse this curtailed my anticipated sport but the pleasure of having a pull whenever i wanted it remained i never disobeyed the captains orders touching the sail though i sometimes extended my row beyond the points he had indicated the river was dangerous for sailboats squalls without the slightest warning were of frequent occurrence scarcely a year passed that six or seven persons were not drowned under the very windows of the town and these oddly enough were generally seacaptains who either did not understand the river or lacked the skill to handle a small craft a knowledge of such disasters one of which i witnessed consoled me somewhat when i saw phil adams skimming over the water in a spanking breeze with every stitch of canvas set there were few better yachtsmen than phil adams he usually went sailing alone for both fred langdon and binny wallace were under the same restrictions i was not long after the purchase of the boat we planned an excursion to sandpeep island the last of the islands in the harbor we proposed to start early in the morning and return with the tide in the moonlight our only difficulty was to obtain a whole days exemption from school the customary halfholiday not being long enough for our picnic somehow we couldnt work it but fortune arranged it for us i may say here that whatever else i did i never played truant hookey we called it in my life one afternoon the four owners of the dolphin exchanged significant glances when mr grimshaw announced from the desk that there would be no school the following day he having just received intelligence of the death of his uncle in boston i was sincerely attached to mr grimshaw but i am afraid that the death of his uncle did not affect me as it ought to have done we were up before sunrise the next morning in order to take advantage of the flood tide which waits for no man our preparations for the cruise were made the previous evening in the way of eatables and drinkables we had stored in the stem of the dolphin a generous bag of hardtack for the chowder a piece of pork to fry the cunners in three gigantic applepies bought at pettingils half a dozen lemons and a keg of springwaterthe lastnamed article we slung over the side to keep it cool as soon as we got under way the crockery and the bricks for our campstove we placed in the bows with the groceries which included sugar pepper salt and a bottle of pickles phil adams contributed to the outfit a small tent of unbleached cotton cloth under which we intended to take our nooning we unshipped the mast threw in an extra oar and were ready to embark i do not believe that christopher columbus when he started on his rather successful voyage of discovery felt half the responsibility and importance that weighed upon me as i sat on the middle seat of the dolphin with my oar resting in the rowlock i wonder if christopher columbus quietly slipped out of the house without letting his estimable family know what he was up to charley marden whose father had promised to cane him if he ever stepped foot on sail or rowboat came down to the wharf in a sourgrape humor to see us off nothing would tempt him to go out on the river in such a crazy clamshell of a boat he pretended that he did not expect to behold us alive again and tried to throw a wet blanket over the expedition guess youll have a squally time of it said charley casting off the painter ill drop in at old newburys newbury was the parish undertaker and leave word as i go along bosh muttered phil adams sticking the boathook into the stringpiece of the wharf and sending the dolphin half a dozen yards towards the current how calm and lovely the river was not a ripple stirred on the glassy surface broken only by the sharp cutwater of our tiny craft the sun as round and red as an august moon was by this time peering above the waterline the town had drifted behind us and we were entering among the group of islands sometimes we could almost touch with our boathook the shelving banks on either side as we neared the mouth of the harbor a little breeze now and then wrinkled the blue water shook the spangles from the foliage and gently lifted the spiral mistwreaths that still clung along shore the measured dip of our oars and the drowsy twitterings of the birds seemed to mingle with rather than break the enchanted silence that reigned about us the scent of the new clover comes back to me now as i recall that delicious morning when we floated away in a fairy boat down a river like a dream the sun was well up when the nose of the dolphin nestled against the snowwhite bosom of sandpeep island this island as i have said before was the last of the cluster one side of it being washed by the sea we landed on the riverside the sloping sands and quiet water affording us a good place to moor the boat it took us an hour or two to transport our stores to the spot selected for the encampment having pitched our tent using the five oars to support the canvas we got out our lines and went down the rocks seaward to fish it was early for cunners but we were lucky enough to catch as nice a mess as ever you saw a cod for the chowder was not so easily secured at last binny wallace hauled in a plump little fellow crusted all over with flaky silver to skin the fish build our fireplace and cook the chowder kept us busy the next two hours the fresh air and the exercise had given us the appetites of wolves and we were about famished by the time the savory mixture was ready for our clamshell saucers i shall not insult the rising generation on the seaboard by telling them how delectable is a chowder compounded and eaten in this robinson crusoe fashion as for the boys who live inland and know naught of such marine feasts my heart is full of pity for them what wasted lives not to know the delights of a clambake not to love chowder to be ignorant of lobscouse how happy we were we four sitting crosslegged in the crisp salt grass with the invigorating seabreeze blowing gratefully through our hair what a joyous thing was life and how far off seemed deathdeath that lurks in all pleasant places and was so near the banquet finished phil adams drew from his pocket a handful of sweetfern cigars but as none of the party could indulge without imminent risk of becoming sick we all on one pretext or another declined and phil smoked by himself the wind had freshened by this and we found it comfortable to put on the jackets which had been thrown aside in the heat of the day we strolled along the beach and gathered large quantities of the fairywoven iceland moss which at certain seasons is washed to these shores then we played at ducks and drakes and then the sun being sufficiently low we went in bathing before our bath was ended a slight change had come over the sky and sea fleecywhite clouds scudded here and there and a muffled moan from the breakers caught our ears from time to time while we were dressing a few hurried drops of rain came lisping down and we adjourned to the tent to await the passing of the squall were all right anyhow said phil adams it wont be much of a blow and well be as snug as a bug in a rug here in the tent particularly if we have that lemonade which some of you fellows were going to make by an oversight the lemons had been left in the boat binny wallace volunteered to go for them put an extra stone on the painter binny said adams calling after him it would be awkward to have the dolphin give us the slip and return to port minus her passengers that it would answered binny scrambling down the rocks sandpeep island is diamondshapedone point running out into the sea and the other looking towards the town our tent was on the riverside though the dolphin was also on the same side it lay out of sight by the beach at the farther extremity of the island binny wallace had been absent five or six minutes when we heard him calling our several names in tones that indicated distress or surprise we could not tell which our first thought was the boat has broken adrift i we sprung to our feet and hastened down to the beach on turning the bluff which hid the mooringplace from our view we found the conjecture correct not only was the dolphin afloat but poor little binny wallace was standing in the bows with his arms stretched helplessly towards usdrifting out to sea head the boat in shore shouted phil adams wallace ran to the tiller but the slight cockleshell merely swung round and drifted broadside on o if we bad but left a single scull in the dolphin can you swim it cried adams desperately using his hand as a speakingtrumpet for the distance between the boat and the island widened momentarily binny wallace looked down at the sea which was covered with white caps and made a despairing gesture he knew and we knew that the stoutest swimmer could not live forty seconds in those angry waters a wild insane light came into phil adamss eyes as he stood kneedeep in the boiling surf and for an instant i think he meditated plunging into the ocean after the receding boat the sky darkened and an ugly look stole rapidly over the broken surface of the sea binny wallace half rose from his seat in the stem and waved his hand to us in token of farewell in spite of the distance increasing every instant we could see his face plainly the anxious expression it wore at first bad passed it was pale and meek now and i love to think there was a kind of halo about it like that which painters place around the forehead of a saint so he drifted away the sky grew darker and darker it was only by straining our eyes through the unnatural twilight that we could keep the dolphin in sight the figure of binny wallace was no longer visible for the boat itself had dwindled to a mere white dot on the black water now we lost it and our hearts stopped throbbing and now the speck appeared again for an instant on the crest of a high wave finally it went out like a spark and we saw it no more then we gazed at each other and dared not speak absorbed in following the course of the boat we had scarcely noticed the huddled inky clouds that sagged down all around us from these threatening masses seamed at intervals with pale lightning there now burst a heavy peal of thunder that shook the ground under our feet a sudden squall struck the sea ploughing deep white furrows into it and at the same instant a single piercing shriek rose above the tempestthe frightened cry of a gull swooping over the island how it startled us it was impossible any longer to keep our footing on the beach the wind and the breakers would have swept us into the ocean if we had not clung to each other with the desperation of drowning men taking advantage of a momentary lull we crawled up the sands on our hands and knees and pausing in the lee of the granite ledge to gain breath returned to the camp where we found that the gale had snapped all the fastenings of the tent but one held by this the puffedout canvas swayed in the wind like a balloon it was a task of some difficulty to secure it which we did by beating down the canvas with the oars after several trials we succeeded in setting up the tent on the leeward side of the ledge blinded by the vivid flashes of lightning and drenched by the rain which fell in torrents we crept half dead with fear and anguish under our flimsy shelter neither the anguish nor the fear was on our own account for we were comparatively safe but for poor little binny wallace driven out to sea in the merciless gale we shuddered to think of him in that frail shell drifting on and on to his grave the sky rent with lightning over his head and the green abysses yawning beneath him we fell to crying the three of us and cried i know not how long meanwhile the storm raged with augmented fury we were obliged to hold on to the ropes of the tent to prevent it blowing away the spray from the river leaped several yards up the rocks and clutched at us malignantly the very island trembled with the concussions of the sea beating upon it and at times i fancied that it had broken loose from its foundation and was floating off with us the breakers streaked with angry phosphorus were fearful to look at the wind rose higher and higher cutting long slits in the tent through which the rain poured incessantly to complete the sum of our miseries the night was at hand it came down suddenly at last like a curtain shutting in sandpeep island from all the world it was a dirty night as the sailors say the darkness was something that could be felt as well as seenit pressed down upon one with a cold clammy touch gazing into the hollow blackness all sorts of imaginable shapes seemed to start forth from vacancybrilliant colors stars prisms and dancing lights what boy lying awake at night has not amused or terrified himself by peopling the spaces around his bed with these phenomena of his own eyes i say whispered fred langdon at length clutching my hand dont you see thingsout therein the dark yes yesbinny wallaces face i added to my own nervousness by making this avowal though for the last ten minutes i had seen little besides that starpale face with its angelic hair and brows first a slim yellow circle like the nimbus round the moon took shape and grew sharp against the darkness then this faded gradually and there was the face wearing the same sad sweet look it wore when he waved his hand to us across the awful water this optical illusion kept repeating itself and i too said adams i see it every now and then outside there what wouldnt i give if it really was poor little wallace looking in at us o boys how shall we dare to go back to the town without him ive wished a hundred times since weve been sitting here that i was in his place alive or dead we dreaded the approach of morning as much as we longed for it the morning would tell us all was it possible for the dolphin to outride such a storm there was a lighthouse on mackerel reef which lay directly in the course the boat bad taken when it disappeared if the dolphin had caught on this reef perhaps binny wallace was safe perhaps his cries had been heard by the keeper of the light the man owned a lifeboat and had rescued several people who could tell such were the questions we asked ourselves again and again as we lay in each others arms waiting for daybreak what an endless night it was i have known months that did not seem so long our position was irksome rather than perilous for the day was certain to bring us relief from the town where our prolonged absence together with the storm had no doubt excited the liveliest alarm for our safety but the cold the darkness and the suspense were hard to bear our soaked jackets bad chilled us to the bone to keep warm we lay huddled together so closely that we could bear our hearts beat above the tumult of sea and sky after a while we grew very hungry not having broken our fast since early in the day the rain had turned the hardtack into a sort of dough but it was better than nothing we used to laugh at fred langdon for always carrying in his pocket a small vial of essence of peppermint or sassafras a few drops of which sprinkled on a lump of loafsugar he seemed to consider a great luxury i dont know what would have become of us at this crisis if it hadnt been for that omnipresent bottle of hot stuff we poured the stinging liquid over our sugar which bad kept dry in a sardinebox and warmed ourselves with frequent doses after four or five hours the rain ceased the wind died away to a moan and the seano longer raging like a maniacsobbed and sobbed with a piteous human voice all along the coast and well it might after that nights work twelve sail of the gloucester fishing fleet had gone down with every soul on board just outside of whalesback light think of the wide grief that follows in the wake of one wreck then think of the despairing women who wrung their hands and wept the next morning in the streets of gloucester marblehead and newcastle though our strength was nearly spent we were too cold to sleep once i sunk into a troubled doze when i seemed to bear charley mardens parting words only it was the sea that said them after that i threw off the drowsiness whenever it threatened to overcome me fred langdon was the earliest to discover a filmy luminous streak in the sky the first glimmering of sunrise look it is nearly daybreak while we were following the direction of his finger a sound of distant oars fell on our ears we listened breathlessly and as the dip of the blades became more audible we discerned two foggy lights like willothewisps floating on the river running down to the waters edge we hailed the boats with all our might the call was heard for the oars rested a moment in the rowlocks and then pulled in towards the island it was two boats from the town in the foremost of which we could now make out the figures of captain nutter and binny wallaces father we shrunk back on seeing him thank god cried mr wallace fervently as he leaped from the wherry without waiting for the bow to touch the beach but when he saw only three boys standing on the sands his eye wandered restlessly about in quest of the fourth then a deadly pallor overspread his features our story was soon told a solemn silence fell upon the crowd of rough boatmen gathered round interrupted only by a stifled sob from one poor old man who stood apart from the rest the sea was still running too high for any small boat to venture out so it was arranged that the wherry should take us back to town leaving the yawl with a picked crew to hug the island until daybreak and then set forth in search of the dolphin though it was barely sunrise when we reached town there were a great many people assembled at the landing eager for intelligence from missing boats two picnic parties had started down river the day before just previous to the gale and nothing had been beard of them it turned out that the pleasureseekers saw their danger in time and ran ashore on one of the least exposed islands where they passed the night shortly after our own arrival they appeared off rivermouth much to the joy of their friends in two shattered dismasted boats the excitement over i was in a forlorn state physically and mentally captain nutter put me to bed between hot blankets and sent kitty collins for the doctor i was wandering in my mind and fancied myself still on sandpeep island now we were building our brickstove to cook the chowder and in my delirium i laughed aloud and shouted to my comrades now the sky darkened and the squall struck the island now i gave orders to wallace how to manage the boat and now i cried because the rain was pouring in on me through the holes in the tent towards evening a high fever set in and it was many days before my grandfather deemed it prudent to tell me that the dolphin had been found floating keel upwards four miles southeast of mackerel reef poor little binny wallace how strange it seemed when i went to school again to see that empty seat in the fifth row how gloomy the playground was lacking the sunshine of his gentle sensitive face one day a folded sheet slipped from my algebra it was the last note he ever wrote me i couldnt read it for the tears what a pang shot across my heart the afternoon it was whispered through the town that a body had been washed ashore at grave pointthe place where we bathed we bathed there no more how well i remember the funeral and what a piteous sight it was afterwards to see his familiar name on a small headstone in the old south burying ground poor little binny wallace always the same to me the rest of us have grown up into hard worldly men fighting the fight of life but you are forever young and gentle and pure a part of my own childhood that time cannot wither always a little boy always poor little binny wallace chapter fifteen an old acquaintance turns up a year had stolen by since the death of binny wallacea year of which i have nothing important to record the loss of our little playmate threw a shadow over our young lives for many and many a month the dolphin rose and fell with the tide at the foot of the slippery steps unused the rest of the summer at the close of november we hauled her sadly into the boathouse for the winter but when spring came round we launched the dolphin again and often went down to the wharf and looked at her lying in the tangled eelgrass without much inclination to take a row the associations connected with the boat were too painful as yet but time which wears the sharp edge from everything softened this feeling and one afternoon we brought out the cobwebbed oars the ice once broken brief trips along the wharveswe seldom cared to go out into the river nowbecame one of our chief amusements meanwhile gypsy was not forgotten every clear morning i was in the saddle before breakfast and there are few roads or lanes within ten miles of rivermouth that have not borne the print of her vagrant hoof i studied like a good fellow this quarter carrying off a couple of first prizes the captain expressed his gratification by presenting me with a new silver dollar if a dollar in his eyes was smaller than a cartwheel it wasnt so very much smaller i redeemed my pencilcase from the treasurer of the centipedes and felt that i was getting on in the world it was at this time i was greatly cast down by a letter from my father saying that he should be unable to visit rivermouth until the following year with that letter came another to captain nutter which he did not read aloud to the family as usual it was on business he said folding it up in his wallet he received several of these business letters from time to time and i noticed that they always made him silent and moody the fact is my fathers bankinghouse was not thriving the unlookedfor failure of a firm largely indebted to him had crippled the house when the captain imparted this information to me i didnt trouble myself over the matter i supposedif i supposed anythingthat all grownup people had more or less money when they wanted it whether they inherited it or whether government supplied them was not clear to me a loose idea that my father had a private goldmine somewhere or other relieved me of all uneasiness i was not far from right every man has within himself a goldmine whose riches are limited only by his own industry it is true it sometimes happens that industry does not avail if a man lacks that something which for want of a better name we call luck my father was a person of untiring energy and ability but he had no luck to use a rivermouth saying he was always catching sculpins when everyone else with the same bait was catching mackerel it was more than two years since i had seen my parents i felt that i could not bear a longer separation every letter from new orleanswe got two or three a monthgave me a fit of homesickness and when it was definitely settled that my father and mother were to remain in the south another twelvemonth i resolved to go to them since binny wallaces death pepper whitcomb had been my fidus achates we occupied desks near each other at school and were always together in play hours we rigged a twine telegraph from his garret window to the scuttle of the nutter house and sent messages to each other in a matchbox we shared our pocketmoney and our secretsthose amazing secrets which boys have we met in lonely places by stealth and parted like conspirators we couldnt buy a jackknife or build a kite without throwing an air of mystery and guilt over the transaction i naturally hastened to lay my new orleans project before pepper whitcomb having dragged him for that purpose to a secluded spot in the dark pine woods outside the town pepper listened to me with a gravity which he will not be able to surpass when he becomes chief justice and strongly advised me to go the summer vacation said pepper lasts six weeks that will give you a fortnight to spend in new orleans allowing two weeks each way for the journey i wrung his hand and begged him to accompany me offering to defray all the expenses i wasnt anything if i wasnt princely in those days after considerable urging he consented to go on terms so liberal the whole thing was arranged there was nothing to do now but to advise captain nutter of my plan which i did the next day the possibility that he might oppose the tour never entered my head i was therefore totally unprepared for the vigorous negative which met my proposal i was deeply mortified moreover for there was pepper whitcomb on the wharf at the foot of the street waiting for me to come and let him know what day we were to start go to new orleans go to jericho i exclaimed captain nutter youd look pretty you two philandering off like the babes in the wood twentyfive hundred miles with all the world beforeyou where to choose and the captains features which had worn an indignant air as he began the sentence relaxed into a broad smile whether it was at the felicity of his own quotation or at the mental picture he drew of pepper and myself on our travels i couldnt tell and i didnt care i was heartbroken how could i face my chum after all the dazzling inducements i had held out to him my grandfather seeing that i took the matter seriously pointed out the difficulties of such a journey and the great expense involved he entered into the details of my fathers money troubles and succeeded in making it plain to me that my wishes under the circumstances were somewhat unreasonable it was in no cheerful mood that i joined pepper at the end of the wharf i found that young gentleman leaning against the bulkhead gazing intently towards the islands in the harbor he had formed a telescope of his hands and was so occupied with his observations as to be oblivious of my approach hullo cried pepper dropping his hands look there isnt that a bark coming up the narrows where just at the left of fishcrate island dont you see the foremast peeping above the old derrick sure enough it was a vessel of considerable size slowly beating up to town in a few moments more the other two masts were visible above the green hillocks foretopmasts blown away said pepper putting in for repairs i guess as the bark lazily crept from behind the last of the islands she let go her anchors and swung round with the tide then the gleeful chant of the sailors at the capstan came to us pleasantly across the water the vessel lay within three quarters of a mile of us and we could plainly see the men at the davits lowering the starboard longboat it no sooner touched the stream than a dozen of the crew scrambled like mice over the side of the merchantman in a neglected seaport like rivermouth the arrival of a large ship is an event of moment the prospect of having twenty or thirty jolly tars let loose on the peaceful town excites divers emotions among the inhabitants the small shopkeepers along the wharves anticipate a thriving trade the proprietors of the two rival boardinghousesthe wee drop and the mariners homehasten down to the landing to secure lodgers and the female population of anchor lane turn out to a woman for a ship fresh from sea is always full of possible husbands and longlost prodigal sons but aside from this there is scant welcome given to a ships crew in rivermouth the toilworn mariner is a sad fellow ashore judging him by a severe moral standard once i remember a united states frigate came into port for repairs after a storm she lay in the river a fortnight or more and every day sent us a gang of sixty or seventy of our countrys gallant defenders who spread themselves over the town doing all sorts of mad things they were goodnatured enough but full of old sancho the wee drop proved a drop too much for many of them they went singing through the streets at midnight wringing off doorknockers shinning up waterspouts and frightening the oldest inhabitant nearly to death by popping their heads into his secondstory window and shouting fire one morning a bluejacket was discovered in a perilous plight halfway up the steeple of the south church clinging to the lightningrod how he got there nobody could tell not even bluejacket himself all he knew was that the leg of his trousers had caught on a nail and there he stuck unable to move either way it cost the town twenty dollars to get him down again he directed the workmen how to splice the ladders brought to his assistance and called his rescuers butterfingered landlubbers with delicious coolness but those were manofwars men the sedatelooking craft now lying off fishcrate island wasnt likely to carry any such cargo nevertheless we watched the coming in of the longboat with considerable interest as it drew near the figure of the man pulling the bowoar seemed oddly familiar to me where could i have seen him before when and where his back was towards me but there was something about that closely cropped head that i recognized instantly way enough cried the steersman and all the oars stood upright in the air the man in the bow seized the boathook and turning round quickly showed me the honest face of sailor ben of the typhoon its sailor ben i cried nearly pushing pepper whitcomb overboard in my excitement sailor ben with the wonderful pink lady on his arm and the ships and stars and anchors tattooed all over him was a wellknown hero among my playmates and there he was like something in a dream come true i didnt wait for my old acquaintance to get firmly on the wharf before i grasped his hand in both of mine sailor ben dont you remember me he evidently did not he shifted his quid from one cheek to the other and looked at me meditatively lord love ye lad i dont know you i was never here afore in my life what i cried enjoying his perplexity have you forgotten the voyage from new orleans in the typhoon two years ago you lovely old picturebook ah then he knew me and in token of the recollection gave my hand such a squeeze that i am sure an unpleasant change came over my countenance bless my eyes but you have growed so i shouldnt have knowed you if i had met you in singapore without stopping to inquire as i was tempted to do why he was more likely to recognize me in singapore than anywhere else i invited him to come at once up to the nutter house where i insured him a warm welcome from the captain hold steady master tom said sailor ben slipping the painter through the ringbolt and tying the loveliest knot you ever saw hold steady till i see if the mate can let me off if you please sir he continued addressing the steersman a very redfaced bowlegged person this here is a little shipmate o mine as wants to talk over back times along of me if so its convenient all right ben returned the mate shant want you for an hour leaving one man in charge of the boat the mate and the rest of the crew went off together in the meanwhile pepper whitcomb had got out his cunnerline and was quietly fishing at the end of the wharf as if to give me the idea that he wasnt so very much impressed by my intimacy with so renowned a character as sailor ben perhaps pepper was a little jealous at any rate he refused to go with us to the house captain nutter was at home reading the rivennouth barnacle he was a reader to do an editors heart good he never skipped over an advertisement even if he had read it fifty times before then the paper went the rounds of the neighborhood among the poor people like the single portable eye which the three blind crones passed to each other in the legend of king acrisius the captain i repeat was wandering in the labyrinths of the rivermouth barnacle when i led sailor ben into the sittingroom my grandfather whose inborn courtesy knew no distinctions received my nautical friend as if he had been an admiral instead of a common forecastlehand sailor ben pulled an imaginary tuft of hair on his forehead and bowed clumsily sailors have a way of using their forelock as a sort of handle to bow with the old tar had probably never been in so handsome an apartment in all his days and nothing could induce him to take the inviting mahogany chair which the captain wheeled out from the corner the abashed mariner stood up against the wall twirling his tarpaulin in his two hands and looking extremely silly he made a poor show in a gentlemans drawingroom but what a fellow he had been in his day when the gale blew great guns and the topsails wanted reefing i thought of him with the mexican squadron off vera cruz where the rushing battlebolt sung from the threedecker out of the foam and he didnt seem awkward or ignoble to me for all his shyness as sailor ben declined to sit down the captain did not resume his seat so we three stood in a constrained manner until my grandfather went to the door and called to kitty to bring in a decanter of madeira and two glasses my grandson here has talked so much about you said the captain pleasantly that you seem quite like an old acquaintance to me thankee sir thankee returned sailor ben looking as guilty as if he had been detected in picking a pocket and im very glad to see you mrmr sailor ben suggested that worthy mr sailor ben added the captain smiling tom open the door theres kitty with the glasses i opened the door and kitty entered the room bringing the things on a waiter which she was about to set on the table when suddenly she uttered a loud shriek the decanter and glasses fell with a crash to the floor and kitty as white as a sheet was seen flying through the hall its his wraith its his wraith we heard kitty shrieking in the kitchen my grandfather and i turned with amazement to sailor ben his eyes were standing out of his head like a lobsters its my own little irish lass shouted the sailor and he darted into the hall after her even then we scarcely caught the meaning of his words but when we saw sailor ben and kitty sobbing on each others shoulder in the kitchen we understood it all i begs your honors parden sir said sailor ben lifting his tearstained face above kittys tumbled hair i begs your honors parden for kicking up a rumpus in the house but its my own little irish lass as i lost so long ago heaven preserve us cried the captain blowing his nose violentlya transparent ruse to hide his emotion miss abigail was in an upper chamber sweeping but on hearing the unusual racket below she scented an accident and came ambling downstairs with a bottle of the infallible hotdrops in her hand nothing but the firmness of my grandfather prevented her from giving sailor ben a tablespoonful on the spot but when she learned what had come aboutthat this was kittys husband that kitty collins wasnt kitty collins now but mrs benjamin watson of nantucketthe good soul sat down on the mealchest and sobbed as ifto quote from captain nutteras if a husband of her own had turned up a happier set of people than we were never met together in a dingy kitchen or anywhere else the captain ordered a fresh decanter of madeira and made all hands excepting myself drink a cup to the return of the prodigal season as he persisted in calling sailor ben after the first flush of joy and surprise was over kitty grew silent and constrained now and then she fixed her eyes thoughtfully on her husband why had he deserted her all these years what right had he to look for a welcome from one he had treated so cruelly she had been true to him but had he been true to her sailor ben must have guessed what was passing in her mind for presently he took her hand and saidwell lass its a long yarn but you shall have it all in good time it was my hard luck as made us part company an no will of mine for i loved you dear kitty brightened up immediately needing no other assurance of sailor bens faithfulness when his hour had expired we walked with him down to the wharf where the captain held a consultation with the mate which resulted in an extension of mr watsons leave of absence and afterwards in his discharge from his ship we then went to the mariners home to engage a room for him as he wouldnt hear of accepting the hospitalities of the nutter house you see im only an uneddicated man he remarked to my grandfather by way of explanation chapter sixteen in which sailor ben spins a yarn of course we were all very curious to learn what had befallen sailor ben that morning long ago when he bade his little bride goodby and disappeared so mysteriously after tea that same evening we assembled around the table in the kitchenthe only place where sailor ben felt at hometo hear what he had to say for himself the candles were snuffed and a pitcher of foaming nutbrown ale was set at the elbow of the speaker who was evidently embarrassed by the respectability of his audience consisting of captain nutter miss abigail myself and kitty whose face shone with happiness like one of the polished tin platters on the dresser well my hearties commenced sailor benthen he stopped short and turned very red as it struck him that maybe this was not quite the proper way to address a dignitary like the captain and a severe elderly lady like miss abigail nutter who sat bolt upright staring at him as she would have stared at the tycoon of japan himself i aint much of a hand at spinnin a yarn remarked sailor ben apologetically specially when the yarn is all about a man as has made a fool of hisself an specially when that mans name is benjamin watson bravo cried captain nutter rapping on the table encouragingly thankee sir thankee i go back to the time when kitty an me was livin in lodgins by the dock in new york we was as happy sir as two porpusses which they toil not neither do they spin but when i seed the money gittin low in the lockerkittys starboard stockin savin your presence marmi got downhearted like seem as i should be obleeged to ship agin for it didnt seem as i could do much ashore an then the sea was my natral spear of action i wasnt exactly born on it look you but i fell into it the fust time i was let out arter my birth my mother slipped her cable for a heavenly port afore i was old enough to hail her so i larnt to look on the ocean for a sort of stepmotheran a precious hard one she has been to me the idee of leavin kitty so soon arter our marriage went agin my grain considerable i cruised along the docks for somethin to do in the way of stevedore an though i picked up a stray job here and there i didnt am enough to buy shipbisket for a rat let alone feedin two human mouths there wasnt nothin honest i wouldnt have turned a hand to but the longshoremen gobbled up all the work an a outsider like me didnt stand a show things got from bad to worse the months rent took all our cash except a dollar or so an the sky looked kind o squally fore an aft well i set out one morninthat identical unlucky mornindetermined to come back an toss some pay into kittys lap if i had to sell my jacket for it i spied a brig unloadin coal at pier no how well i remembers it i hailed the mate an offered myself for a coalheaver but i wasnt wanted as he told me civilly enough which was better treatment than usual as i turned off rather glum i was signalled by one of them sleek smoothspoken rascals with a white hat an a weed on it as is always goin about the piers aseekin who they may devower we sailors know em for rascals from stem to starn but somehow every fresh one fleeces us jest as his mate did afore him we dont lam nothin by experence were jest no better than a lot of babys with no brains good mornin my man sez the chap as iley as you please mornin sir sez i lookin for a job sez he through the big end of a telescope sez meanin that the chances for a job looked very small from my pint of view youre the man for my money sez the sharper smilin as innocent as a cherubim jest step in here till we talk it over so i goes with him like a natralborn idiot into a little groceryshop near by where we sets down at a table with a bottle atween us then it comes out as there is a new bedford whaler about to start for the fishin grounds an jest one ablebodied sailor like me is wanted to make up the crew would i go yes i wouldnt on no terms ill bet you fifty dollars sez he that youll come back fust mate ill bet you a hundred sez i that i dont for ive signed papers as keeps me ashore an the parson has witnessed the deed so we sat there he urgin me to ship an i chaffin him cheerful over the bottle arter a while i begun to feel a little queer things got foggy in my upper works an i remembers faintlike of signin a paper then i remembers bein in a small boat an then i remembers nothin until i heard the mates whistle pipin all hands on deck i tumbled up with the rest an there i wason board of a whaler outward bound for a three years cruise an my dear little lass ashore awaitin for me miserable wretch said miss abigail in a voice that vibrated among the tin platters on the dresser this was miss abigails way of testifying her sympathy thankee marm returned sailor ben doubtfully no talking to the man at the wheel cried the captain upon which we all laughed spin added my grandfather sailor ben resumed i leave you to guess the wretchedness as fell upon me for ive not got the gift to tell you there i was down on the ships books for a three years viage an no help for it i feel nigh to six hundred years old when i think how long that viage was there isnt no hourglass as runs slow enough to keep a tally of the slowness of them fust hours but i done my duty like a man seem there wasnt no way of gettin out of it i told my shipmates of the trick as had been played on me an they tried to cheer me up a bit but i was sore sorrowful for a long spell many a night on watch i put my face in my hands and sobbed for thinkin of the little woman left among the landsharks an no man to have an eye on her god bless her here kitty softly drew her chair nearer to sailor ben and rested one hand on his arm our adventures among the whales i take it doesnt consarn the present company here assembled so i give that the go by theres an end to everythin even to a whalin viage my heart all but choked me the day we put into new bedford with our cargo of ile i got my three years pay in a lump an made for new york like a flash of lightuin the people hove to and looked at me as i rushed through the streets like a madman until i came to the spot where the lodginhouse stood on west street but lord love ye there wasnt no sech lodginhouse there but a great new brick shop i made bold to go in an ask arter the old place but nobody knowed nothin about it save as it had been torn down two years or more i was adrift now for i had reckoned all them days and nights on gittin word of kitty from dan shackford the man as kept the lodgin as i stood there with all the wind knocked out of my sails the idee of runnin alongside the perlicestation popped into my head the perlice was likely to know the latitude of a man like dan shackford who wasnt over an above respecktible they did knowhe had died in the tombs jail that day twelvemonth a coincydunce wasnt it i was ready to drop when they told me this howsomever i bore up an give the chief a notion of the fix i was in he writ a notice which i put into the newspapers every day for three months but nothin come of it i cruised over the city week in and week out i went to every sort of place where they hired women hands i didnt leave a think undone that a uneddicated man could do but nothin come of it i dont believe there was a wretcheder soul in that big city of wretchedness than me sometimes i wanted to lay down in the sheets and die drif tin disconsolate one day among the shippin who should i overhaul but the identical smoothspoken chap with a white hat an a weed on it i didnt know if there was any spent left in me till i clapped eye on his very onpleasant countenance you villain sez i wheres my little irish lass as you dragged me away from an i lighted on him hat and all like that here sailor ben brought his fist down on the deal table with the force of a sledgehammer miss abigail gave a start and the ale leaped up in the pitcher like a miniature fountain i begs your parden ladies and gentlemen all but the thought of that feller with his ring an his watchchain an his walrus face is alus too many for me i was for pitchin him into the north river when a perliceman prevented me from benefitin the human family i had to pay five dollars for hittin the chap they said it was salt and buttery an thats what i call a neat genteel luxury it was worth double the money jest to see that white hat with a weed on it layin on the wharf like a busted accordiun arter months of useless sarch i went to sea agin i never got into a foren port but i kept a watch out for kitty once i thought i seed her in liverpool but it was only a gal as looked like her the numbers of women in different parts of the world as looked like her was amazin so a good many years crawled by an i wandered from place to place never givin up the sarch i might have been chief mate scores of times maybe master but i hadnt no ambition i seed many strange things in them yearsoutlandish people an cities storms shipwracks an battles i seed many a true mate go down an sometimes i envied them what went to their rest but these things is neither here nor there about a year ago i shipped on board the belphcebe yonder an of all the strange winds as ever blowed the strangest an the best was the wind as blowed me to this here blessed spot i cant be too thankful that im as thankful as it is possible for an uneddicated man to be he knows as reads the heart of all here ended sailor bens yarn which i have written down in his own homely words as nearly as i can recall them after he had finished the captain shook hands with him and served out the ale as kitty was about to drink she paused rested the cup on her knee and asked what day of the month it was the twentyseventh said the captain wondering what she was driving at then cried kitty its ten years this night sence since what asked my grandfather sence the little lass and i got spliced roared sailor ben theres another coincydunce for you on hearing this we all clapped hands and the captain with a degree of ceremony that was almost painful drank a bumper to the health and happiness of the bride and bridegroom it was a pleasant sight to see the two old lovers sitting side by side in spite of all drinking from the same little cupa battered zinc dipper which sailor ben had unslung from a strap round his waist i think i never saw him without this dipper and a sheathknife suspended just back of his hip ready for any convivial occasion we had a merry time of it the captain was in great force this evening and not only related his famous exploit in the war of but regaled the company with a dashing seasong from mr shakespeares play of the tempest he had a mellow tenor voice not shakespeare but the captain and rolled out the verse with a will the master the swabber the boatswain and i the gunner and his mate lovd mall meg and marian and margery but none of us card for kate a very good song and very well sung says sailor ben but some of us does care for kate is this mr shawkspear a seafarm man sir not at present replied the captain with a monstrous twinkle in his eye the clock was striking ten when the party broke up the captain walked to the mariners home with his guest in order to question him regarding his future movements well sir said he i aint as young as i was an i dont calulate to go to sea no more i proposes to drop anchor here an hug the land until the old hulk goes to pieces ive got two or three thousand dollars in the locker an expects to get on uncommon comfortable without askin no odds from the assylum for decayed mariners my grandfather indorsed the plan warmly and sailor ben did drop anchor in rivermouth where he speedily became one of the institutions of the town his first step was to buy a small onestory cottage located at the head of the wharf within gunshot of the nutter house to the great amusement of my grandfather sailor ben painted the cottage a light skyblue and ran a broad black stripe around it just under the eaves in this stripe he painted white portholes at regular distances making his residence look as much like a manofwar as possible with a short flagstaff projecting over the door like a bowsprit the effect was quite magical my description of the exterior of this palatial residence is complete when i add that the proprietor nailed a horseshoe against the front door to keep off the witchesa very necessary precaution in these latitudes the inside of sailor bens abode was not less striking than the outside the cottage contained two rooms the one opening on the wharf he called his cabin here he ate and slept his few tumblers and a frugal collection of crockery were set in a rack suspended over the table which had a cleat of wood nailed round the edge to prevent the dishes from sliding off in case of a heavy sea hanging against the walls were three or four highly colored prints of celebrated frigates and a lithograph picture of a rosy young woman insufficiently clad in the american flag this was labelled kitty though im sure it looked no more like her than i did a walrustooth with an esquimaux engraved on it a sharks jaw and the blade of a swordfish were among the enviable decorations of this apartment in one corner stood his bunk or bed and in the other his wellworn seachest a perfect pandoras box of mysteries you would have thought yourself in the cabin of a real ship the little room aft separated from the cabin by a sliding door was the caboose it held a cookingstove pots pans and groceries also a lot of fishinglines and coils of tarred twine which made the place smell like a forecastle and a delightful smell it isto those who fancy it kitty didnt leave our service but played housekeeper for both establishments returning at night to sailor bens he shortly added a wherry to his worldly goods and in the fishing season made a very handsome income during the winter he employed himself manufacturing crabnets for which he found no lack of customers his popularity among the boys was immense a jackknife in his expert hand was a whole chest of tools he could whittle out anything from a wooden chain to a chinese pagoda or a fullrigged seventyfour a foot long to own a ship of sailor bens building was to be exalted above your fellowcreatures he didnt carve many and those he refused to sell choosing to present them to his young friends of whom tom bailey you may be sure was one how delightful it was of winter nights to sit in his cosey cabin close to the ships stove he wouldnt hear of having a fireplace and listen to sailor bens yarns in the early summer twilights when he sat on the doorstep splicing a rope or mending a net he always had a bevy of blooming young faces alongside the dear old fellow how tenderly the years touched him after thisall the more tenderly it seemed for having roughed him so cruelly in other days chapter seventeen how we astonished the rivermouthians sailor bens arrival partly drove the new orleans project from my brain besides there was just then a certain movement on foot by the centipede club which helped to engross my attention pepper whitcomb took the captains veto philosophically observing that he thought from the first the governor wouldnt let me go i dont think pepper was quite honest in that but to the subject in hand among the few changes that have taken place in rivermouth during the past twenty years there is one which i regret i lament the removal of all those varnished iron cannon which used to do duty as posts at the corners of streets leading from the river they were quaintly ornamental each set upon end with a solid shot soldered into its mouth and gave to that part of the town a picturesqueness very poorly atoned for by the conventional wooden stakes that have deposed them these guns old sogers the boys called them had their story like everything else in rivermouth when that everlasting last warthe war of i meancame to an end all the brigs schooners and barks fitted out at this port as privateers were as eager to get rid of their useless twelvepounders and swivels as they had previously been to obtain them many of the pieces had cost large sums and now they were little better than so much crude ironnot so good in fact for they were clumsy things to break up and melt over the government didnt want them private citizens didnt want them they were a drug in the market but there was one man ridiculous beyond his generation who got it into his head that a fortune was to be made out of these same guns to buy them all to hold on to them until war was declared again as he had no doubt it would be in a few months and then sell out at fabulous pricesthis was the daring idea that addled the pate of silas trefethen dealer in e w i goods and groceries as the faded sign over his shopdoor informed the public silas went shrewdly to work buying up every old cannon he could lay hands on his backyard was soon crowded with brokendown guncarriages and his barn with guns like an arsenal when silass purpose got wind it was astonishing how valuable that thing became which just now was worth nothing at all ha ha thought silas somebody else is tryin hi git control of the market but i guess ive got the start of him so he went on buying and buying oftentimes paying double the original price of the article people in the neighboring towns collected all the worthless ordnance they could find and sent it by the cartload to rivermouth when his barn was full silas began piling the rubbish in his cellar then in his parlor he mortgaged the stock of his grocery store mortgaged his house his barn his horse and would have mortgaged himself if anyone would have taken him as security in order to carry on the grand speculation he was a ruined man and as happy as a lark surely poor silas was cracked like the majority of his own cannon more or less crazy he must have been always years before this he purchased an elegant rosewood coffin and kept it in one of the spare rooms in his residence he even had his name engraved on the silverplate leaving a blank after the word died the blank was filled up in due time and well it was for silas that he secured so stylish a coffin in his opulent days for when he died his worldly wealth would not have bought him a pine box to say nothing of rosewood he never gave up expecting a war with great britain hopeful and radiant to the last his dying words were englandwarfew daysgreat profits it was that sweet old lady dame jocelyn who told me the story of silas trefethen for these things happened long before my day silas died in at trefethens death his unique collection came under the auctioneers hammer some of the larger guns were sold to the town and planted at the corners of divers streets others went off to the ironfoundry the balance numbering twelve were dumped down on a deserted wharf at the foot of anchor lane where summer after summer they rested at their ease in the grass and fungi pelted in autumn by the rain and annually buried by the winter snow it is with these twelve guns that our story has to deal the wharf where they reposed was shut off from the street by a high fencea silent dreamy old wharf covered with strange weeds and mosses on account of its seclusion and the good fishing it afforded it was much frequented by us boys there we met many an afternoon to throw out our lines or play leapfrog among the rusty cannon they were famous fellows in our eyes what a racket they had made in the heyday of their unchastened youth what stories they might tell now if their puffy metallic lips could only speak once they were lively talkers enough but there the grim seadogs lay silent and forlorn in spite of all their former growlings they always seemed to me like a lot of venerable disabled tars stretched out on a lawn in front of a hospital gazing seaward and mutely lamenting their lost youth but once more they were destined to lift up their dolorous voicesonce more ere they keeled over and lay speechless for all time and this is how it befell jack harris charley marden harry blake and myself were fishing off the wharf one afternoon when a thought flashed upon me like an inspiration i say boys i cried hauling in my line hand over hand ive got something what does it pull like youngster asked harris looking down at the taut line and expecting to see a big perch at least o nothing in the fish way i returned laughing its about the old guns what about them i was thinking what jolly fun it would be to set one of the old sogers on his legs and serve him out a ration of gunpowder up came the three lines in a jiffy an enterprise better suited to the disposition of my companions could not have been proposed in a short time we had one of the smaller cannon over on its back and were busy scraping the green rust from the touchhole the mould had spiked the gun so effectually that for a while we fancied we should have to give up our attempt to resuscitate the old soger a long gimlet would clear it out said charley marden if we only had one i looked to see if sailor bens flag was flying at the cabin door for he always took in the colors when he went off fishing when you want to know if the admirals aboard jest cast an eye to the buntin my hearties says sailor ben sometimes in a jocose mood he called himself the admiral and i am sure he deserved to be one the admirals flag was flying and i soon procured a gimlet from his carefully kept toolchest before long we had the gun in working order a newspaper lashed to the end of a lath served as a swab to dust out the bore jack harris blew through the touchhole and pronounced all clear seeing our task accomplished so easily we turned our attention to the other guns which lay in all sorts of postures in the rank grass borrowing a rope from sailor ben we managed with immense labor to drag the heavy pieces into position and place a brick under each muzzle to give it the proper elevation when we beheld them all in a row like a regular battery we simultaneously conceived an idea the magnitude of which struck us dumb for a moment our first intention was to load and fire a single gun how feeble and insignificant was such a plan compared to that which now sent the light dancing into our eyes what could we have been thinking of cried jack harris well give em a broadside to be sure if we die for it we turned to with a will and before nightfall had nearly half the battery overhauled and ready for service to keep the artillery dry we stuffed wads of loose hemp into the muzzles and fitted wooden pegs to the touchholes at recess the next noon the centipedes met in a corner of the schoolyard to talk over the proposed lark the original projectors though they would have liked to keep the thing secret were obliged to make a club matter of it inasmuch as funds were required for ammunition there had been no recent drain on the treasury and the society could well afford to spend a few dollars in so notable an undertaking it was unanimously agreed that the plan should be carried out in the handsomest manner and a subscription to that end was taken on the spot several of the centipedes hadnt a cent excepting the one strung around their necks others however were richer i chanced to have a dollar and it went into the cap quicker than lightning when the club in view of my munificence voted to name the guns baileys battery i was prouder than i have ever been since over anything the money thus raised added to that already in the treasury amounted to nine dollarsa fortune in those days but not more than we had use for this sum was divided into twelve parts for it would not do for one boy to buy all the powder nor even for us all to make our purchases at the same place that would excite suspicion at any time particularly at a period so remote from the fourth of july there were only three stores in town licensed to sell powder that gave each store four customers not to run the slightest risk of remark one boy bought his powder on monday the next boy on tuesday and so on until the requisite quantity was in our possession this we put into a keg and carefully hid in a dry spot on the wharf our next step was to finish cleaning the guns which occupied two afternoons for several of the old sogers were in a very congested state indeed having completed the task we came upon a difficulty to set off the battery by daylight was out of the question it must be done at night it must be done with fuses for no doubt the neighbors would turn out after the first two or three shots and it would not pay to be caught in the vicinity who knew anything about fuses who could arrange it so the guns would go off one after the other with an interval of a minute or so between theoretically we knew that a minute fuse lasted a minute double the quantity two minutes but practically we were at a standstill there was but one person who could help us in this extremitysailor ben to me was assigned the duty of obtaining what information i could from the exgunner it being left to my discretion whether or not to intrust him with our secret so one evening i dropped into the cabin and artfully turned the conversation to fuses in general and then to particular fuses but without getting much out of the old boy who was busy making a twine hammock finally i was forced to divulge the whole plot the admiral had a sailors love for a joke and entered at once and heartily into our scheme he volunteered to prepare the fuses himself and i left the labor in his hands having bound him by several extraordinary oathssuch as hopeimaydie and shivermytimbersnot to betray us come what would this was monday evening on wednesday the fuses were ready that night we were to unmuzzle baileys battery mr grimshaw saw that something was wrong somewhere for we were restless and absentminded in the classes and the best of us came to grief before the morning session was over when mr grimshaw announced guy fawkes as the subject for our next composition you might have knocked down the mystic twelve with a feather the coincidence was certainly curious but when a man has committed or is about to commit an offence a hundred trifles which would pass unnoticed at another time seem to point at him with convicting fingers no doubt guy fawkes himself received many a start after he had got his wicked kegs of gunpowder neatly piled up under the house of lords wednesday as i have mentioned was a halfholiday and the centipedes assembled in my barn to decide on the final arrangements these were as simple as could be as the fuses were connected it needed but one person to fire the train hereupon arose a discussion as to who was the proper person some argued that i ought to apply the match the battery being christened after me and the main idea moreover being mine others advocated the claim of phil adams as the oldest boy at last we drew lots for the post of honor twelve slips of folded paper upon one of which was written thou art the man were placed in a quart measure and thoroughly shaken then each member stepped up and lifted out his destiny at a given signal we opened our billets thou art the man said the slip of paper trembling in my fingers the sweets and anxieties of a leader were mine the rest of the afternoon directly after twilight set in phil adams stole down to the wharf and fixed the fuses to the guns laying a train of powder from the principal fuse to the fence through a chink of which i was to drop the match at midnight at ten oclock rivermouth goes to bed at eleven oclock rivermouth is as quiet as a country churchyard at twelve oclock there is nothing left with which to compare the stillness that broods over the little seaport in the midst of this stillness i arose and glided out of the house like a phantom bent on an evil errand like a phantom i flitted through the silent street hardly drawing breath until i knelt down beside the fence at the appointed place pausing a moment for my heart to stop thumping i lighted the match and shielded it with both hands until it was well under way and then dropped the blazing splinter on the slender thread of gunpowder a noiseless flash instantly followed and all was dark again i peeped through the crevice in the fence and saw the main fuse spitting out sparks like a conjurer assured that the train had not failed i took to my heels fearful lest the fuse might burn more rapidly than we calculated and cause an explosion before i could get home this luckily did not happen theres a special providence that watches over idiots drunken men and boys i dodged the ceremony of undressing by plunging into bed jacket boots and all i am not sure i took off my cap but i know that i had hardly pulled the coverlid over me when boom sounded the first gun of baileys battery i lay as still as a mouse in less than two minutes there was another burst of thunder and then another the third gun was a tremendous fellow and fairly shook the house the town was waking up windows were thrown open here and there and people called to each other across the streets asking what that firing was for boom went gun number four i sprung out of bed and tore off my jacket for i heard the captain feeling his way along the wall to my chamber i was half undressed by the time he found the knob of the door i say sir i cried do you hear those guns not being deaf i do said the captain a little tartlyany reflection on his hearing always nettled him but what on earth they are for i cant conceive you had better get up and dress yourself im nearly dressed sir boom boomtwo of the guns had gone off together the door of miss abigails bedroom opened hastily and that pink of maidenly propriety stepped out into the hail in her nightgownthe only indecorous thing i ever knew her to do she held a lighted candle in her hand and looked like a very aged lady macbeth o danel this is dreadful what do you suppose it means i really cant suppose said the captain rubbing his ear but i guess its over now boom said baileys battery rivermouth was wide awake now and half the male population were in the streets running different ways for the firing seemed to proceed from opposite points of the town everybody waylaid everybody else with questions but as no one knew what was the occasion of the tumult people who were not usually nervous began to be oppressed by the mystery some thought the town was being bombarded some thought the world was coming to an end as the pious and ingenious mr miller had predicted it would but those who couldnt form any theory whatever were the most perplexed in the meanwhile baileys battery bellowed away at regular intervals the greatest confusion reigned everywhere by this time people with lanterns rushed hither and thither the town watch had turned out to a man and marched off in admirable order in the wrong direction discovering their mistake they retraced their steps and got down to the wharf just as the last cannon belched forth its lightning a dense cloud of sulphurous smoke floated over anchor lane obscuring the starlight two or three hundred people in various stages of excitement crowded about the upper end of the wharf not liking to advance farther until they were satisfied that the explosions were over a board was here and there blown from the fence and through the openings thus afforded a few of the more daring spirits at length ventured to crawl the cause of the racket soon transpired a suspicion that they had been sold gradually dawned on the rivermouthians many were exceedingly indignant and declared that no penalty was severe enough for those concerned in such a prank othersand these were the very people who had been terrified nearly out of their witshad the assurance to laugh saying that they knew all along it was only a trick the town watch boldly took possession of the ground and the crowd began to disperse knots of gossips lingered here and there near the place indulging in vain surmises as to who the invisible gunners could be there was no more noise that night but many a timid person lay awake expecting a renewal of the mysterious cannonading the oldest inhabitant refused to go to bed on any terms but persisted in sitting up in a rockingchair with his hat and mittens on until daybreak i thought i should never get to sleep the moment i drifted off in a doze i fell to laughing and woke myself up but towards morning slumber overtook me and i had a series of disagreeable dreams in one of which i was waited upon by the ghost of silas trefethen with an exorbitant bill for the use of his guns in another i was dragged before a courtmartial and sentenced by sailor ben in a frizzled wig and threecornered cocked hat to be shot to death by baileys batterya sentence which sailor ben was about to execute with his own hand when i suddenly opened my eyes and found the sunshine lying pleasantly across my face i tell you i was glad that unaccountable fascination which leads the guilty to hover about the spot where his crime was committed drew me down to the wharf as soon as i was dressed phil adams jack harris and others of the conspirators were already there examining with a mingled feeling of curiosity and apprehension the havoc accomplished by the battery the fence was badly shattered and the ground ploughed up for several yards round the place where the guns formerly layformerly lay for now they were scattered every which way there was scarcely a gun that hadnt burst here was one ripped open from muzzle to breech and there was another with its mouth blown into the shape of a trumpet three of the guns had disappeared bodily but on looking over the edge of the wharf we saw them standing on end in the tidemud they had popped overboard in their excitement i tell you what fellows whispered phil adams it is lucky we didnt try to touch em off with punk theyd have blown us all to finders the destruction of baileys battery was not unfortunately the only catastrophe a fragment of one of the cannon had earned away the chimney of sailor bens cabin he was very mad at first but having prepared the fuse himself he didnt dare complain openly id have taken a reef in the blessed stovepipe said the admiral gazing ruefully at the smashed chimney if i had known as how the flagship was agoin to be under fire the next day he rigged out an iron funnel which being in sections could be detached and taken in at a moments notice on the whole i think he was resigned to the demolition of his brick chimney the stovepipe was a great deal more shipshape the town was not so easily appeased the selectmen determined to make an example of the guilty parties and offered a reward for their arrest holding out a promise of pardon to anyone of the offenders who would furnish information against the rest but there were no faint hearts among the centipedes suspicion rested for a while on several personson the soldiers at the fort on a crazy fellow known about town as bottlenose and at last on sailor ben shiver my timbers cries that deeply injured individual do you suppose sir as i have lived to sixty year an aint got no more sense than to go for to blaze away at my own upper riggin it doesnt stand to reason it certainly did not seem probable that mr watson would maliciously knock over his own chimney and lawyer hackett who had the case in hand bowed himself out of the admirals cabin convinced that the right man had not been discovered people living by the sea are always more or less superstitious stories of spectre ships and mysterious beacons that lure vessels out of their course and wreck them on unknown reefs were among the stock legends of rivermouth and not a few people in the town were ready to attribute the firing of those guns to some supernatural agency the oldest inhabitant remembered that when he was a boy a dimlooking sort of schooner hove to in the offing one foggy afternoon fired off a single gun that didnt make any report and then crumbled to nothing spar mast and hulk like a piece of burnt paper the authorities however were of the opinion that human hands had something to do with the explosions and they resorted to deeplaid stratagems to get hold of the said hands one of their traps came very near catching us they artfully caused an old brass fieldpiece to be left on a wharf near the scene of our late operations nothing in the world but the lack of money to buy powder saved us from falling into the clutches of the two watchmen who lay secreted for a week in a neighboring sailloft it was many a day before the midnight bombardment ceased to be the towntalk the trick was so audacious and on so grand a scale that nobody thought for an instant of connecting us lads with it suspicion at length grew weary of lighting on the wrong person and as conjecturelike the physicians in the epitaphwas in vain the rivermouthians gave up the idea of finding out who had astonished them they never did find out and never will unless they read this veracious history if the selectmen are still disposed to punish the malefactors i can supply lawyer hackett with evidence enough to convict pepper whitcomb phil adams charley marden and the other honorable members of the centipede club but really i dont think it would pay now chapter a frog he would awooing go if the reader supposes that i lived all this while in rivermouth without falling a victim to one or more of the young ladies attending miss dorothy gibbss female institute why then all i have to say is the reader exhibits his ignorance of human nature miss gibbss seminary was located within a few minutes walk of the temple grammar school and numbered about thirtyfive pupils the majority of whom boarded at the hallprimrose hall as miss dorothy prettily called it the primroses as we called them ranged from seven years of age to sweet seventeen and a prettier group of sirens never got together even in rivermouth for rivermouth you should know is famous for its pretty girls there were tall girls and short girls rosy girls and pale girls and girls as brown as berries girls like amazons slender girls weird and winning like undine girls with black tresses girls with auburn ringlets girls with every tinge of golden hair to behold miss dorothys young ladies of a sunday morning walking to church two by two the smallest toddling at the end of the procession like the bobs at the tail of a kite was a spectacle to fill with tender emotion the least susceptible heart to see miss dorothy marching grimly at the head of her light infantry was to feel the hopelessness of making an attack on any part of the column she was a perfect dragon of watchfulness the most unguarded lifting of an eyelash in the fluttering battalion was sufficient to put her on the lookout she had had experiences with the male sex this miss dorothy so prim and grim it was whispered that her heart was a tattered album scrawled over with lovelines but that she had shut up the volume long ago there was a tradition that she had been crossed in love but it was the faintest of traditions a gay young lieutenant of marines had flirted with her at a country ball ad and then marched carelessly away at the head of his company to the shrill music of the fife without so much as a sigh for the girl he left behind him the years rolled on the gallant gay lothariowhich wasnt his namemarried became a father and then a grandfather and at the period of which i am speaking his grandchild was actually one of miss dorothys young ladies so at least ran the story the lieutenant himself was dead these many years but miss dorothy never got over his duplicity she was convinced that the sole aim of mankind was to win the unguarded affection of maidens and then march off treacherously with flying colors to the heartless music of the drum and fife to shield the inmates of primrose hall from the bitter influences that had blighted her own early affections was miss dorothys mission in life no wolves prowling about my lambs if you please said miss dorothy i will not allow it she was as good as her word i dont think the boy lives who ever set foot within the limits of primrose hall while the seminary was under her charge perhaps if miss dorothy had given her young ladies a little more liberty they would not have thought it such fun to make eyes over the white lattice fence at the young gentlemen of the temple grammar school i say perhaps for it is one thing to manage thirtyfive young ladies and quite another thing to talk about it but all miss dorothys vigilance could not prevent the young folks from meeting in the town now and then nor could her utmost ingenuity interrupt postal arrangements there was no end of notes passing between the students and the primroses notes tied to the heads of arrows were shot into dormitory windows notes were tucked under fences and hidden in the trunks of decayed trees every thick place in the boxwood hedge that surrounded the seminary was a possible postoffice it was a terrible shock to miss dorothy the day she unearthed a nest of letters in one of the huge wooden urns surmounting the gateway that led to her dovecot it was a bitter moment to miss phoebe and miss candace and miss hesba when they had their locks of hair grimly handed back to them by miss gibbs in the presence of the whole school girls whose locks of hair had run the blockade in safety were particularly severe on the offenders but it didnt stop other notes and other tresses and i would like to know what can stop them while the earth holds together now when i first came to rivermouth i looked upon girls as rather tame company i hadnt a spark of sentiment concerning them but seeing my comrades sending and receiving mysterious epistles wearing bits of ribbon in their buttonholes and leaving packages of confectionery generally lemondrops in the hollow trunks of treeswhy i felt that this was the proper thing to do i resolved as a matter of duty to fall in love with somebody and i didnt care in the least who it was in much the same mood that don quixote selected the dulcinea del toboso for his ladylove i singled out one of miss dorothys incomparable young ladies for mine i debated a long while whether i should not select two but at last settled down on onea pale little girl with blue eyes named alice i shall not make a long story of this for alice made short work of me she was secretly in love with pepper whitcomb this occasioned a temporary coolness between pepper and myself not disheartened however i placed laura ricei believe it was laura ricein the vacant niche the new idol was more cruel than the old the former frankly sent me to the right about but the latter was a deceitful lot she wore my nosegay in her dress at the evening service the primroses were marched to church three times every sunday she penned me the daintiest of notes she sent me the glossiest of ringlets cut as i afterwards found out from the stupid head of miss gibbss chambermaid and at the same time was holding me and my pony up to ridicule in a series of letters written to jack harris it was harris himself who kindly opened my eyes i tell you what bailey said that young gentleman laura is an old veteran and carries too many guns for a youngster she cant resist a flirtation i believe shed flirt with an infant in arms theres hardly a fellow in the school that hasnt worn her colors and some of her hair she doesnt give out any more of her own hair now its been pretty well used up the demand was greater than the supply you see its all very well to correspond with laura but as to looking for anything serious from her the knowing ones dont hope i havent hurt your feelings old boy that was a soothing stroke of flattery to call me old boy but it was my duty as a friend and a centipede to let you know who you were dealing with such was the advice given me by that timestricken careworn and embittered man of the world who was sixteen years old if he was a day i dropped laura in the course of the next twelve months i had perhaps three or four similar experiences and the conclusion was forced upon me that i was not a boy likely to distinguish myself in this branch of business i fought shy of primrose hall from that moment smiles were smiled over the boxwood hedge and little hands were occasionally kissed to me but i only winked my eye patronizingly and passed on i never renewed tender relations with miss gibbss young ladies all this occurred during my first year and a half at rivermouth between my studies at school my outdoor recreations and the hurts my vanity received i managed to escape for the time being any very serious attack of that love fever which like the measles is almost certain to seize upon a boy sooner or later i was not to be an exception i was merely biding my time the incidents i have now to relate took place shortly after the events described in the last chapter in a life so tranquil and circumscribed as ours in the nutter house a visitor was a novelty of no little importance the whole household awoke from its quietude one morning when the captain announced that a young niece of his from new york was to spend a few weeks with us the bluechintz room into which a ray of sun was never allowed to penetrate was thrown open and dusted and its mouldy air made sweet with a bouquet of potroses placed on the oldfashioned bureau kitty was busy all the forenoon washing off the sidewalk and sandpapering the great brass knocker on our frontdoor and miss abigail was up to her elbows in a pigeonpie i felt sure it was for no ordinary person that all these preparations were in progress and i was right miss nelly glentworth was no ordinary person i shall never believe she was there may have been lovelier women though i have never seen them there may have been more brilliant women though it has not been my fortune to meet them but that there was ever a more charming one than nelly glentworth is a proposition against which i contend i dont love her now i dont think of her once in five years and yet it would give me a turn if in the course of my daily walk i should suddenly come upon her eldest boy i may say that her eldest boy was not playing a prominent part in this life when i first made her acquaintance it was a drizzling cheerless afternoon towards the end of summer that a hack drew up at the door of the nutter house the captain and miss abigail hastened into the hall on hearing the carriage stop in a moment more miss nelly glentworth was seated in our sittingroom undergoing a critical examination at the hands of a small boy who lounged uncomfortably on a settee between the windows the small boy considered himself a judge of girls and he rapidly came to the following conclusions that miss nelly was about nineteen that she had not given away much of her back hair which hung in two massive chestnut braids over her shoulders that she was a shade too pale and a trifle too tall that her hands were nicely shaped and her feet much too diminutive for daily use he furthermore observed that her voice was musical and that her face lighted up with an indescribable brightness when she smiled on the whole the small boy liked her well enough and satisfied that she was not a person to be afraid of but on the contrary one who might be made quite agreeable he departed to keep an appointment with his friend sir pepper whitcomb but the next morning when miss glentworth came down to breakfast in a purple dress her face as fresh as one of the mossroses on the bureau upstairs and her laugh as contagious as the merriment of a robin the small boy experienced a strange sensation and mentally compared her with the loveliest of miss gibbss young ladies and found those young ladies wanting in the balance a nights rest had wrought a wonderful change in miss nelly the pallor and weariness of the journey had passed away i looked at her through the toastrack and thought i had never seen anything more winning than her smile after breakfast she went out with me to the stable to see gypsy and the three of us became friends then and there nelly was the only girl that gypsy ever took the slightest notice of it chanced to be a halfholiday and a baseball match of unusual interest was to come off on the school ground that afternoon but somehow i didnt go i hung about the house abstractedly the captain went up town and miss abigail was busy in the kitchen making immortal gingerbread i drifted into the sittingroom and had our guest all to myself for i dont know how many hours it was twilight i recollect when the captain returned with letters for miss nelly many a time after that i sat with her through the dreamy september afternoons if i had played baseball it would have been much better for me those first days of miss nellys visit are very misty in my remembrance i try in vain to remember just when i began to fall in love with her whether the spell worked upon me gradually or fell upon me all at once i dont know i only know that it seemed to me as if i had always loved her things that took place before she came were dim to me like events that had occurred in the middle ages nelly was at least five years my senior but what of that adam is the only man i ever heard of who didnt in early youth fall in love with a woman older than himself and i am convinced that he would have done so if he had had the opportunity i wonder if girls from fifteen to twenty are aware of the glamour they cast over the straggling awkward boys whom they regard and treat as mere children i wonder now young women are so keen in such matters i wonder if miss nelly glentworth never suspected until the very last night of her visit at rivermouth that i was over ears in love with her pretty self and was suffering pangs as poignant as if i had been ten feet high and as old as methuselah for indeed i was miserable throughout all those five weeks i went down in the latin class at the rate of three boys a day her fresh young eyes came between me and my book and there was an end of virgil o love love love love is like a dizziness it winna let a body gang aboot his business i was wretched away from her and only less wretched in her presence the special cause of my woe was this i was simply a little boy to miss glentworth i knew it i bewailed it i ground my teeth and wept in secret over the fact if i had been aught else in her eyes would she have smoothed my hair so carelessly sending an electric shock through my whole system would she have walked with me hand in hand for hours in the old garden and once when i lay on the sofa my head aching with love and mortification would she have stooped down and kissed me if i hadnt been a little boy how i despised little boys how i hated one particular little boytoo little to be loved i smile over this very grimly even now my sorrow was genuine and bitter it is a great mistake on the part of elderly people male and female to tell a child that he is seeing his happiest days dont you believe a word of it my little friend the burdens of childhood are as hard to bear as the crosses that weigh us down later in life while the happinesses of childhood are tame compared with those of our maturer years and even if this were not so it is rank cruelty to throw shadows over the young heart by croaking be merry for tomorrow you die as the last days of nellys visit drew near i fell into a very unhealthy state of mind to have her so frank and unconsciously coquettish with me was a daily torment to be looked upon and treated as a child was bitter almonds but the thought of losing her altogether was distraction the summer was at an end the days were perceptibly shorter and now and then came an evening when it was chilly enough to have a woodfire in our sittingroom the leaves were beginning to take hectic tints and the wind was practising the minor pathetic notes of its autumnal dirge nature and myself appeared to be approaching our dissolution simultaneously one evening the evening previous to the day set for nellys departurehow well i remember iti found her sitting alone by the wide chimneypiece looking musingly at the crackling back log there were no candles in the room on her face and hands and on the small golden cross at her throat fell the flickering firelightthat ruddy mellow firelight in which ones grandmother would look poetical i drew a low stool from the corner and placed it by the side of her chair she reached out her hand to me as was her pretty fashion and so we sat for several moments silently in the changing glow of the burning logs at length i moved back the stool so that i could see her face in profile without being seen by her i lost her hand by this movement but i couldnt have spoken with the listless touch of her fingers on mine after two or three attempts i said nelly a good deal louder than i intended perhaps the effort it cost me was evident in my voice she raised herself quickly in the chair and half turned towards me well tom ii am very sorry you are going away so am i i have enjoyed every hour of my visit do you think you will ever come back here perhaps said nelly and her eyes wandered off into the fitful firelight i suppose you will forget us all very quickly indeed i shall not i shall always have the pleasantest memories of rivermouth here the conversation died a natural death nelly sank into a sort of dream and i meditated fearing every moment to be interrupted by some member of the family i nerved myself to make a bold dash nelly well do you i hesitated do i what love anyone very much why of course i do said nelly scattering her revery with a merry laugh i love uncle nutter and aunt nutter and youand towser towser our new dog i couldnt stand that i pushed back the stool impatiently and stood in front of her thats not what i mean i said angrily well what do you mean do you love anyone to marry him the idea of it cried nelly laughing but you must tell me must tom indeed you must nelly she had risen from the chair with an amused perplexed look in her eyes i held her an instant by the dress please tell me o you silly boy cried nelly then she rumpled my hair all over my forehead and ran laughing out of the room suppose cinderella had rumpled the princes hair all over his forehead how would he have liked it suppose the sleeping beauty when the kings son with a kiss set her and all the old clocks agoing in the spellbound castlesuppose the young minx had looked up and coolly laughed in his eye i guess the kings son wouldnt have been greatly pleased i hesitated a second or two and then rushed after nelly just in time to run against miss abigail who entered the room with a couple of lighted candles goodness gracious tom exclaimed miss abigail are you possessed i left her scraping the warm spermaceti from one of her thumbs nelly was in the kitchen talking quite unconcernedly with kitty collins there she remained until suppertime supper over we all adjourned to the sittingroom i planned and plotted but could manage in no way to get nelly alone she and the captain played cribbage all the evening the next morning my lady did not make her appearance until we were seated at the breakfasttable i had got up at daylight myself immediately after breakfast the carriage arrived to take her to the railway station a gentleman stepped from this carriage and greatly to my surprise was warmly welcomed by the captain and miss abigail and by miss nelly herself who seemed unnecessarily glad to see him from the hasty conversation that followed i learned that the gentleman had come somewhat unexpectedly to conduct miss nelly to boston but how did he know that she was to leave that morning nelly bade farewell to the captain and miss abigail made a little rush and kissed me on the nose and was gone as the wheels of the hack rolled up the street and over my finer feelings i turned to the captain who was that gentleman sir that was mr waldron a relation of yours sir i asked craftily no relation of minea relation of nellys said the captain smiling a cousin i suggested feeling a strange hatred spring up in my bosom for the unknown well i suppose you might call him a cousin for the present hes going to marry little nelly next summer in one of peter parleys valuable historical works is a description of an earthquake at lisbon at the first shock the inhabitants rushed into the streets the earth yawned at their feet and the houses tottered and fell on every side i staggered past the captain into the street a giddiness came over me the earth yawned at my feet and the houses threatened to fall in on every side of me how distinctly i remember that momentary sense of confusion when everything in the world seemed toppling over into ruins as i have remarked my love for nelly is a thing of the past i had not thought of her for years until i sat down to write this chapter and yet now that all is said and done i shouldnt care particularly to come across mrs waldrons eldest boy in my afternoons walk he must be fourteen or fifteen years old by this timethe young villain chapter nineteen i become a blighted being when a young boy gets to be an old boy when the hair is growing rather thin on the top of the old boys head and he has been tamed sufficiently to take a sort of chastened pleasure in allowing the baby to play with his watchsealswhen i say an old boy has reached this stage in the journey of life he is sometimes apt to indulge in sportive remarks concerning his first love now though i bless my stars that it wasnt in my power to marry miss nelly i am not going to deny my boyish regard for her nor laugh at it as long as it lasted it was a very sincere and unselfish love and rendered me proportionately wretched i say as long as it lasted for ones first love doesnt last forever i am ready however to laugh at the amusing figure i cut after i had really ceased to have any deep feeling in the matter it was then i took it into my head to be a blighted being this was about two weeks after the spectral appearance of mr waldron for a boy of a naturally vivacious disposition the part of a blighted being presented difficulties i had an excellent appetite i liked society i liked outofdoor sports i was fond of handsome clothes now all these things were incompatible with the doleful character i was to assume and i proceeded to cast them from me i neglected my hair i avoided my playmates i frowned abstractedly i didnt eat as much as was good for me i took lonely walks brooded in solitude i not only committed to memory the more turgid poems of the late lord byronfare thee well and if forever cbut i became a despondent poet on my own account and composed a string of stanzas to one who will understand them think i was a trifle too hopeful on that point for i came across the verses several years afterwards and was quite unable to understand them myself it was a great comfort to be so perfectly miserable and yet not suffer any i used to look in the glass and gloat over the amount and variety of mournful expression i could throw into my features if i caught myself smiling at anything i cut the smile short with a sigh the oddest thing about all this is i never once suspected that i was not unhappy no one not even pepper whitcomb was more deceived than i among the minor pleasures of being blighted were the interest and perplexity i excited in the simple souls that were thrown in daily contact with me pepper especially i nearly drove him into a corresponding state of mind i had from time to time given pepper slight but impressive hints of my admiration for some one this was in the early part of miss glentworths visit i had also led him to infer that my admiration was not altogether in vain he was therefore unable to explain the cause of my strange behavior for i had carefully refrained from mentioning to pepper the fact that some one had turned out to be anothers i treated pepper shabbily i couldnt resist playing on his tenderer feelings he was a boy bubbling over with sympathy for anyone in any kind of trouble our intimacy since binny wallaces death had been uninterrupted but now i moved in a sphere apart not to be profaned by the step of an outsider i no longer joined the boys on the playground at recess i stayed at my desk reading some lugubrious volumeusually the mysteries of udolpho by the amiable mrs radcliffe a translation of the sorrows of werter fell into my hands at this period and if i could have committed suicide without killing myself i should certainly have done so on halfholidays instead of fraternizing with pepper and the rest of our clique i would wander off alone to grave point grave pointthe place where binny wallaces body came ashorewas a narrow strip of land running out into the river a line of lombardy poplars stiff and severe like a row of grenadiers mounted guard on the waterside on the extreme end of the peninsula was an old disused graveyard tenanted principally by the early settlers who had been scalped by the indians in a remote corner of the cemetery set apart from the other mounds was the grave of a woman who had been hanged in the old colonial times for the murder of her infant goodwife polly haines had denied the crime to the last and after her death there had arisen strong doubts as to her actual guilt it was a belief current among the lads of the town that if you went to this grave at nightfall on the th of novemberthe anniversary of her executionand asked for what did the magistrates hang you a voice would reply nothing many a rivermouth boy has tremblingly put this question in the dark and sure enough polly haines invariably answered nothing a low redbrick wall broken down in many places and frosted over with silvery moss surrounded this burialground of our pilgrim fathers and their immediate descendants the latest date on any of the headstones was a crop of very funny epitaphs sprung up here and there among the overgrown thistles and burdocks and almost every tablet had a deathshead with crossbones engraved upon it or else a puffy round face with a pair of wings stretching out from the ears like this cherub graphic these mortuary emblems furnished me with congenial food for reflection i used to lie in the long grass and speculate on the advantages and disadvantages of being a cherub i forget what i thought the advantages were but i remember distinctly of getting into an inextricable tangle on two points how could a cherub being all head and wings manage to sit down when he was tired to have to sit down on the back of his head struck me as an awkward alternative again where did a cherub carry those indispensable articles such as jackknives marbles and pieces of twine which boys in an earthly state of existence usually stow away in their trouserspockets these were knotty questions and i was never able to dispose of them satisfactorily meanwhile pepper whitcomb would scour the whole town in search of me he finally discovered my retreat and dropped in on me abruptly one afternoon while i was deep in the cherub problem look here tom bailey said pepper shying a piece of clamshell indignantly at the file jacet on a neighboring gravestone you are just going to the dogs cant you tell a fellow what in thunder ails you instead of prowling round among the tombs like a jolly old vampire pepper i replied solemnly dont ask me all is not well heretouching my breast mysteriously if i had touched my head instead i should have been nearer the mark pepper stared at me earthly happiness i continued is a delusion and a snare you will never be happy pepper until you are a cherub pepper by the by would have made an excellent cherub he was so chubby having delivered myself of these gloomy remarks i arose languidly from the grass and moved away leaving pepper staring after me in mute astonishment i was hamlet and werter and the late lord byron all in one you will ask what my purpose was in cultivating this factitious despondency none whatever blighted beings never have any purpose in life excepting to be as blighted as possible of course my present line of business could not long escape the eye of captain nutter i dont know if the captain suspected my attachment for miss glentworth he never alluded to it but he watched me miss abigail watched me kitty collins watched me and sailor ben watched me i cant make out his signals i overheard the admiral remark to my grandfather one day i hope he aint got no kind of sickness aboard there was something singularly agreeable in being an object of so great interest sometimes i had all i could do to preserve my dejected aspect it was so pleasant to be miserable i incline to the opinion that people who are melancholy without any particular reason such as poets artists and young musicians with long hair have rather an enviable time of it in a quiet way i never enjoyed myself better in my life than when i was a blighted being chapter twenty in which i prove myself to be the grandson of my grandfather it was not possible for a boy of my temperament to be a blighted being longer than three consecutive weeks i was gradually emerging from my selfimposed cloud when events took place that greatly assisted in restoring me to a more natural frame of mind i awoke from an imaginary trouble to face a real one i suppose you dont know what a financial crisis is i will give you an illustration you are deeply in debtsay to the amount of a quarter of a dollarto the little knicknack shop round the corner where they sell picturepapers sprucegum needles and malaga raisins a boy owes you a quarter of a dollar which he promises to pay at a certain time you are depending on this quarter to settle accounts with the small shopkeeper the time arrivesand the quarter doesnt thats a financial crisis in one sensetwentyfive senses if i may say so when this same thing happens on a grander scale in the mercantile world it produces what is called a panic one mans inability to pay his debts ruins another man who in turn ruins someone else and so on until failure after failure makes even the richest capitalists tremble public confidence is suspended and the smaller fry of merchants are knocked over like tenpins these commercial panics occur periodically after the fashion of comets and earthquakes and other disagreeable things such a panic took place in new orleans in the year and my fathers bankinghouse went to pieces in the crash of a comparatively large fortune nothing remained after paying his debts excepting a few thousand dollars with which he proposed to return north and embark in some less hazardous enterprise in the meantime it was necessary for him to stay in new orleans to wind up the business my grandfather was in some way involved in this failure and lost i fancy a considerable sum of money but he never talked much on the subject he was an unflinching believer in the spiltmilk proverb it cant be gathered up he would say and its no use crying over it pitch into the cow and get some more milk is my motto the suspension of the bankinghouse was bad enough but there was an attending circumstance that gave us at rivermouth a great deal more anxiety the cholera which someone predicted would visit the country that year and which indeed had made its appearance in a mild form at several points along the mississippi river had broken out with much violence at new orleans the report that first reached us through the newspapers was meagre and contradictory many people discredited it but a letter from my mother left us no room for doubt the sickness was in the city the hospitals were filling up and hundreds of the citizens were flying from the stricken place by every steamboat the unsettled state of my fathers affairs made it imperative for him to remain at his post his desertion at that moment would have been at the sacrifice of all he had saved from the general wreck as he would be detained in new orleans at least three months my mother declined to come north without him after this we awaited with feverish impatience the weekly news that came to us from the south the next letter advised us that my parents were well and that the sickness so far had not penetrated to the faubourg or district where they lived the following week brought less cheering tidings my fathers business in consequence of the flight of the other partners would keep him in the city beyond the period he had mentioned the family had moved to pass christian a favorite wateringplace on lake pontchartrain near new orleans where he was able to spend part of each week so the return north was postponed indefinitely it was now that the old longing to see my parents came back to me with irresistible force i knew my grandfather would not listen to the idea of my going to new orleans at such a dangerous time since he had opposed the journey so strongly when the same objection did not exist but i determined to go nevertheless i think i have mentioned the fact that all the male members of our family on my fathers sideas far back as the middle ageshave exhibited in early youth a decided talent for running away it was an hereditary talent it ran in the blood to run away i do not pretend to explain the peculiarity i simply admit it it was not my fate to change the prescribed order of things i too was to run away thereby proving if any proof were needed that i was the grandson of my grandfather i do not hold myself responsible for the step any more than i do for the shape of my nose which is said to be a facsimile of captain nutters i have frequently noticed how circumstances conspire to help a man or a boy when he has thoroughly resolved on doing a thing that very week the rivermouth barnacle printed an advertisement that seemed to have been written on purpose for me it read as follows wanted a few ablebodied seamen and a cabinboy for the ship rawlings now loading for new orleans at johnsons wharf boston apply in person within four days at the office of messrs co or on board the ship how i was to get to new orleans with only was a question that had been bothering me this advertisement made it as clear as day i would go as cabinboy i had taken pepper into my confidence again i had told him the story of my love for miss glentworth with all its harrowing details and now conceived it judicious to confide in him the change about to take place in my life so that if the rawlings went down in a gale my friends might have the limited satisfaction of knowing what had become of me pepper shook his head discouragingly and sought in every way to dissuade me from the step he drew a disenchanting picture of the existence of a cabinboy whose constant duty according to pepper was to have dishes broken over his head whenever the captain or the mate chanced to be out of humor which was mostly all the time but nothing pepper said could turn me a hairsbreadth from my purpose i had little time to spare for the advertisement stated explicitly that applications were to be made in person within four days i trembled to think of the bare possibility of some other boy snapping up that desirable situation it was on monday that i stumbled upon the advertisement on tuesday my preparations were completed my baggageconsisting of four shirts half a dozen collars a piece of shoemakers wax heaven knows what for and seven stockings wrapped in a silk handkerchieflay hidden under a loose plank of the stable floor this was my point of departure my plan was to take the last train for boston in order to prevent the possibility of immediate pursuit if any should be attempted the train left at pm i ate no breakfast and little dinner that day i avoided the captains eye and wouldnt have looked miss abigail or kitty in the face for the wealth of the indies when it was time to start for the station i retired quietly to the stable and uncovered my bundle i lingered a moment to kiss the white star on gypsys forehead and was nearly unmanned when the little animal returned the caress by lapping my cheek twice i went back and patted her on reaching the station i purchased my ticket with a bravado air that ought to have aroused the suspicion of the ticketmaster and hurried to the car where i sat fidgeting until the train shot out into the broad daylight then i drew a long breath and looked about me the first object that saluted my sight was sailor ben four or five seats behind me reading the rivermouth barnacle reading was not an easy art to sailor ben he grappled with the sense of a paragraph as if it were a polarbear and generally got the worst of it on the present occasion he was having a hard struggle judging by the way he worked his mouth and rolled his eyes he had evidently not seen me but what was he doing on the boston train without lingering to solve the question i stole gently from my seat and passed into the forward car this was very awkward having the admiral on board i couldnt understand it at all could it be possible that the old boy had got tired of land and was running away to sea himself that was too absurd i glanced nervously towards the car door now and then half expecting to see him come after me we had passed one or two waystations and i had quieted down a good deal when i began to feel as if somebody was looking steadily at the back of my head i turned round involuntarily and there was sailor ben again at the farther end of the car wrestling with the rivermouth barnacle as before i began to grow very uncomfortable indeed was it by design or chance that he thus dogged my steps if he was aware of my presence why didnt he speak to me at once why did he steal round making no sign like a particularly unpleasant phantom maybe it wasnt sailor ben i peeped at him slyly there was no mistaking that tanned genial phiz of his very odd he didnt see me literature even in the mild form of a country newspaper always had the effect of poppies on the admiral when i stole another glance in his direction his hat was tilted over his right eye in the most dissolute style and the rivermouth barnacle lay in a confused heap beside him he had succumbed he was fast asleep if he would only keep asleep until we reached our destination by and by i discovered that the rear car had been detached from the train at the last stoppingplace this accounted satisfactorily for sailor bens singular movements and considerably calmed my fears nevertheless i did not like the aspect of things the admiral continued to snooze like a good fellow and was snoring melodiously as we glided at a slackened pace over a bridge and into boston i grasped my pilgrims bundle and hurrying out of the car dashed up the first street that presented itself it was a narrow noisy zigzag street crowded with trucks and obstructed with bales and boxes of merchandise i didnt pause to breathe until i had placed a respectable distance between me and the railway station by this time it was nearly twilight i had got into the region of dwellinghouses and was about to seat myself on a doorstep to rest when lo there was the admiral trundling along on the opposite sidewalk under a full spread of canvas as he would have expressed it i was off again in an instant at a rapid pace but in spite of all i could do he held his own without any perceptible exertion he had a very ugly gait to get away from the admiral i didnt dare to run for fear of being mistaken for a thief a suspicion which my bundle would naturally lend color to i pushed ahead however at a brisk trot and must have got over one or two milesmy pursuer neither gaining nor losing groundwhen i concluded to surrender at discretion i saw that sailor ben was determined to have me and knowing my man i knew that escape was highly improbable so i turned round and waited for him to catch up with me which he did in a few seconds looking rather sheepish at first sailor ben said i severely do i understand that you are dogging my steps well little messmate replied the admiral rubbing his nose which he always did when he was disconcerted i am kind o followin in your wake under orders under orders under the captains orders surely in other words my grandfather has sent you to fetch me back to rivermouth thats about it said the admiral with a burst of frankness and i must go with you whether i want to or not the capens very identical words there was nothing to be done i bit my lips with suppressed anger and signified that i was at his disposal since i couldnt help it the impression was very strong in my mind that the admiral wouldnt hesitate to put me in irons if i showed signs of mutiny it was too late to return to rivermouth that nighta fact which i communicated to the old boy sullenly inquiring at the same time what he proposed to do about it he said we would cruise about for some rations and then make a night of it i didnt condescend to reply though i hailed the suggestion of something to eat with inward enthusiasm for i had not taken enough food that day to keep life in a canary we wandered back to the railway station in the waiting room of which was a kind of restaurant presided over by a severelooking young lady here we had a cup of coffee apiece several tough doughnuts and some blocks of venerable spongecake the young lady who attended on us whatever her age was then must have been a mere child when that spongecake was made the admirals acquaintance with boston hotels was slight but he knew of a quiet lodginghouse near by much patronized by seacaptains arid kept by a former friend of his in this house which had seen its best days we were accommodated with a mouldy chamber containing two cotbeds two chairs and a cracked pitcher on a washstand the mantelshelf was ornamented with three big pink conchshells resembling pieces of petrified liver and over these hung a cheap lurid print in which a united states sloopofwar was giving a british frigate particular fits it is very strange how our own ships never seem to suffer any in these terrible engagements it shows what a nation we are an oillamp on a dealtable cast a dismal glare over the apartment which was cheerless in the extreme i thought of our sittingroom at home with its flowery wallpaper and gay curtains and soft lounges i saw major elkanah nutter my grandfathers father in powdered wig and federal uniform looking down benevolently from his gilt frame between the bookcases i pictured the captain and miss abigail sitting at the cosey round table in the moonlike glow of the astral lamp and then i fell to wondering how they would receive me when came back i wondered if the prodigal son had any idea that his father was going to kill the fatted calf for him and how he felt about it on the whole though i was very low in spirits i put on a bold front to sailor ben you will understand to be caught and caged in this manner was a frightful shock to my vanity he tried to draw me into conversation but i answered in icy monosyllables he again suggested we should make a night of it and hinted broadly that he was game for any amount of riotous dissipation even to the extent of going to see a play if i wanted to i declined haughtily i was dying to go he then threw out a feeler on the subject of dominos and checkers and observed in a general way that seven up was a capital game but i repulsed him at every point i saw that the admiral was beginning to feel hurt by my systematic coldness we had always been such hearty friends until now it was too bad of me to fret that tender honest old heart even for an hour i really did love the ancient boy and when in a disconsolate way he ordered up a pitcher of beer i unbent so far as to partake of some in a teacup he recovered his spirits instantly and took out his cuddy clay pipe for a smoke between the beer and the soothing fragrance of the navyplug i fell into a pleasanter mood myself and it being too late now to go to the theatre i condescended to sayaddressing the northwest corner of the ceilingthat seven up was a capital game upon this hint the admiral disappeared and returned shortly with a very dirty pack of cards as we played with varying fortunes by the flickering flame of the lamp he sipped his beer and became communicative he seemed immensely tickled by the fact that i had come to boston it leaked out presently that he and the captain had had a wager on the subject the discovery of my plans and who had discovered them were points on which the admiral refused to throw any light they had been discovered however and the captain had laughed at the idea of my running away sailor ben on the contrary had stoutly contended that i meant to slip cable and be off whereupon the captain offered to bet him a dollar that i wouldnt go and it was partly on account of this wager that sailor ben refrained from capturing me when he might have done so at the start now as the fare to and from boston with the lodging expenses would cost him at least five dollars i didnt see what he gained by winning the wager the admiral rubbed his nose violently when this view of the case presented itself i asked him why he didnt take me from the train at the first stoppingplace and return to rivermouth by the down train at he explained having purchased a ticket for boston he considered himself bound to the owners the stockholders of the road to fulfil his part of the contract to use his own words he had shipped for the viage this struck me as being so deliciously funny that after i was in bed and the light was out i couldnt help laughing aloud once or twice i suppose the admiral must have thought i was meditating another escape for he made periodical visits to my bed throughout the night satisfying himself by kneading me all over that i hadnt evaporated i was all there the next morning when sailor ben half awakened me by shouting merrily all hands on deck the words rang in my ears like a part of my own dream for i was at that instant climbing up the side of the rawlings to offer myself as cabinboy the admiral was obliged to shake me roughly two or three times before he could detach me from the dream i opened my eyes with effort and stared stupidly round the room bit by bit my real situation dawned on me what a sickening sensation that is when one is in trouble to wake up feeling free for a moment and then to find yesterdays sorrow all ready to go on again well little messmate how fares it i was too much depressed to reply the thought of returning to rivermouth chilled me how could i face captain nutter to say nothing of miss abigail and kitty how the temple grammar school boys would look at me how conway and seth rodgers would exult over my mortification and what if the rev wibird hawkins should allude to me in his next sundays sermon sailor ben was wise in keeping an eye on me for after these thoughts took possession of my mind i wanted only the opportunity to give him the slip the keeper of the lodgings did not supply meals to his guests so we breakfasted at a small chophouse in a crooked street on our way to the cars the city was not astir yet and looked glum and careworn in the damp morning atmosphere here and there as we passed along was a sharpfaced shopboy taking down shutters and now and then we met a seedy man who had evidently spent the night in a doorway such early birds and a few laborers with their tin kettles were the only signs of life to be seen until we came to the station where i insisted on paying for my own ticket i didnt relish being conveyed from place to place like a felon changing prisons at somebody elses expense on entering the car i sunk into a seat next the window and sailor ben deposited himself beside me cutting off all chance of escape the car filled up soon after this and i wondered if there was anything in my mien that would lead the other passengers to suspect i was a boy who had run away and was being brought back a man in front of ushe was nearsighted as i discovered later by his reading a guidebook with his nosebrought the blood to my cheeks by turning round and peering at me steadily i rubbed a clear spot on the cloudy windowglass at my elbow and looked out to avoid him there in the travellers room was the severelooking young lady piling up her blocks of spongecake in alluring pyramids and industriously intrenching herself behind a breastwork of squashpie i saw with cynical pleasure numerous victims walk up to the counter and recklessly sow the seeds of death in their constitutions by eating her doughnuts i had got quite interested in her when the whistle sounded and the train began to move the admiral and i did not talk much on the journey i stared out of the window most of the time speculating as to the probable nature of the reception in store for me at the terminus of the road what would the captain say and mr grimshaw what would he do about it then i thought of pepper whitcomb dire was the vengeance i meant to wreak on pepper for who but he had betrayed me pepper alone had been the repository of my secretperfidious pepper as we left station after station behind us i felt less and less like encountering the members of our family sailor ben fathomed what was passing in my mind for he leaned over and said i dont think as the capen will bear down very hard on you but it wasnt that it wasnt the fear of any physical punishment that might be inflicted it was a sense of my own folly that was creeping over me for during the long silent ride i had examined my conduct from every standpoint and there was no view i could take of myself in which i did not look like a very foolish person indeed as we came within sight of the spires of rivermouth i wouldnt have cared if the up train which met us outside the town had run into us and ended me contrary to my expectation and dread the captain was not visible when we stepped from the cars sailor ben glanced among the crowd of faces apparently looking for him too conway was therehe was always hanging about the stationand if he had intimated in any way that he knew of my disgrace and enjoyed it i should have walked into him i am certain but this defiant feeling entirely deserted me by the time we reached the nutter house the captain himself opened the door come on board sir said sailor ben scraping his left foot and touching his hat seafashion my grandfather nodded to sailor ben somewhat coldly i thought and much to my astonishment kindly took me by the hand i was unprepared for this and the tears which no amount of severity would have wrung from me welled up to my eyes the expression of my grandfathers face as i glanced at it hastily was grave and gentle there was nothing in it of anger or reproof i followed him into the sittingroom and obeying a motion of his hand seated myself on the sofa he remained standing by the round table for a moment lost in thought then leaned over and picked up a letter it was a letter with a great black seal chapter twenty one in which i leave rivermouth a letter with a great black seal i knew then what had happened as well as i know it now but which was it father or mother i do not like to look back to the agony and suspense of that moment my father had died at new orleans during one of his weekly visits to the city the letter bearing these tidings had reached rivermouth the evening of my flighthad passed me on the road by the down train i must turn back for a moment to that eventful evening when i failed to make my appearance at supper the captain began to suspect that i had really started on my wild tour southwarda conjecture which sailor bens absence helped to confirm i had evidently got off by the train and sailor ben had followed me there was no telegraphic communication between boston and rivermouth in those days so my grandfather could do nothing but await the result even if there had been another mail to boston he could not have availed himself of it not knowing how to address a message to the fugitives the postoffice was naturally the last place either i or the admiral would think of visiting my grandfather however was too full of trouble to allow this to add to his distress he knew that the faithful old sailor would not let me come to any harm and even if i had managed for the time being to elude him was sure to bring me back sooner or later our return therefore by the first train on the following day did not surprise him i was greatly puzzled as i have said by the gentle manner of his reception but when we were alone together in the sittingroom and he began slowly to unfold the letter i understood it all i caught a sight of my mothers handwriting in the superscription and there was nothing left to tell me my grandfather held the letter a few seconds irresolutely and then commenced reading it aloud but he could get no further than the date i cant read it tom said the old gentleman breaking down i thought i could he handed it to me i took the letter mechanically and hurried away with it to my little room where i had passed so many happy hours the week that followed the receipt of this letter is nearly a blank in my memory i remember that the days appeared endless that at times i could not realize the misfortune that had befallen us and my heart upbraided me for not feeling a deeper grief that a full sense of my loss would now and then sweep over me like an inspiration and i would steal away to my chamber or wander forlornly about the gardens i remember this but little more as the days went by my first grief subsided and in its place grew up a want which i have experienced at every step in life from boyhood to manhood often even now after all these years when i see a lad of twelve or fourteen walking by his fathers side and glancing merrily up at his face i turn and look after them and am conscious that i have missed companionship most sweet and sacred i shall not dwell on this portion of my story there were many tranquil pleasant hours in store for me at that period and i prefer to turn to them one evening the captain came smiling into the sittingroom with an open letter in his hand my mother had arrived at new york and would be with us the next day for the first time in weeksyears it seemed to mesomething of the old cheerfulness mingled with our conversation round the evening lamp i was to go to boston with the captain to meet her and bring her home i need not describe that meeting with my mothers hand in mine once more all the long years we had been parted appeared like a dream very dear to me was the sight of that slender pale woman passing from room to room and lending a patient grace and beauty to the saddened life of the old house everything was changed with us now there were consultations with lawyers and signing of papers and correspondence for my fathers affairs had been left in great confusion and when these were settled the evenings were not long enough for us to hear all my mother had to tell of the scenes she had passed through in the illfated city then there were old times to talk over full of reminiscences of aunt chloe and little black sam little black sam by the by had been taken by his master from my fathers service ten months previously and put on a sugarplantation near baton rouge not relishing the change sam had run away and by some mysterious agency got into canada from which place he had sent back several indecorous messages to his late owner aunt chloe was still in new orleans employed as nurse in one of the cholera hospital wards and the desmoulins near neighbors of ours had purchased the pretty stone house among the orangetrees how all these simple details interested me will be readily understood by any boy who has been long absent from home i was sorry when it became necessary to discuss questions more nearly affecting myself i had been removed from school temporarily but it was decided after much consideration that i should not return the decision being left in a manner in my own hands the captain wished to carry out his sons intention and send me to college for which i was nearly fitted but our means did not admit of this the captain too could ill afford to bear the expense for his losses by the failure of the new orleans business had been heavy yet he insisted on the plan not seeing clearly what other disposal to make of me in the midst of our discussions a letter came from my uncle snow a merchant in new york generously offering me a place in his countinghouse the case resolved itself into this if i went to college i should have to be dependent on captain nutter for several years and at the end of the collegiate course would have no settled profession if i accepted my uncles offer i might hope to work my way to independence without loss of time it was hard to give up the longcherished dream of being a harvard boy but i gave it up the decision once made it was uncle snows wish that i should enter his countinghouse immediately the cause of my good uncles haste was thishe was afraid that i would turn out to be a poet before he could make a merchant of me his fears were based upon the fact that i had published in the rivermouth barnacle some verses addressed in a familiar manner to the moon now the idea of a boy with his living to get placing himself in communication with the moon struck the mercantile mind as monstrous it was not only a bad investment it was lunacy we adopted uncle snows views so far as to accede to his proposition forthwith my mother i neglected to say was also to reside in new york i shall not draw a picture of pepper whitcombs disgust when the news was imparted to him nor attempt to paint sailor bens distress at the prospect of losing his little messmate in the excitement of preparing for the journey i didnt feel any very deep regret myself but when the moment came for leaving and i saw my small trunk lashed up behind the carriage then the pleasantness of the old life and a vague dread of the new came over me and a mist filled my eyes shutting out the group of schoolfellows including all the members of the centipede club who had come down to the house to see me off as the carriage swept round the corner i leaned out of the window to take a last look at sailor bens cottage and there was the admirals flag flying at halfmast so i left rivermouth little dreaming that i was not to see the old place again for many and many a year chapter twenty two exeunt omnes with the close of my schooldays at rivermouth this modest chronicle ends the new life upon which i entered the new friends and foes i encountered on the road and what i did and what i did not are matters that do not come within the scope of these pages but before i write finis to the record as it stands before i leave itfeeling as if i were once more going away from my boyhoodi have a word or two to say concerning a few of the personages who have figured in the story if you will allow me to call gypsy a personage i am sure that the reader who has followed me thus far will be willing to hear what became of her and sailor ben and miss abigail and the captain first about gypsy a month after my departure from rivemouth the captain informed me by letter that he had parted with the little mare according to agreement she had been sold to the ringmaster of a travelling circus i had stipulated on this disposal of her and was about to set out on her travels she did not disappoint my glowing anticipations but became quite a celebrity in her wayby dancing the polka to slow music on a pineboard ballroom constructed for the purpose i chanced once a long while afterwards to be in a country town where her troupe was giving exhibitions i even read the gaudily illumined showbill setting forth the accomplishments of zuleika the famed arabian trick ponybut i failed to recognize my dear little mustang girl behind those highsounding titles and so alas did not attend the performance i hope all the praises she received and all the spangled trappings she wore did not spoil her but i am afraid they did for she was always over much given to the vanities of this world miss abigail regulated the domestic destinies of my grandfathers household until the day of her death which dr theophilus tredick solemnly averred was hastened by the inveterate habit she had contracted of swallowing unknown quantities of hotdrops whenever she fancied herself out of sorts eightyseven empty phials were found in a bonnetbox on a shelf in her bedroom closet the old house became very lonely when the family got reduced to captain nutter and kitty and when kitty passed away my grandfather divided his time between rivermouth and new york sailor ben did not long survive his little irish lass as he always fondly called her at his demise which took place about six years since he left his property in trust to the managers of a home for aged mariners in his will which was a very whimsical documentwritten by himself and worded with much shrewdness toohe warned the trustees that when he got aloft he intended to keep his weather eye on them and should send a speritual shot across their bows and bring them to if they didnt treat the aged mariners handsomely he also expressed a wish to have his body stitched up in a shotted hammock and dropped into the harbor but as he did not strenuously insist on this and as it was not in accordance with my grandfathers preconceived notions of christian burial the admiral was laid to rest beside kitty in the old south burying ground with an anchor that would have delighted him neatly carved on his headstone i am sorry the fire has gone out in the old ships stove in that skyblue cottage at the head of the wharf i am sorry they have taken down the flagstaff and painted over the funny portholes for i loved the old cabin as it was they might have let it alone for several months after leaving rivermouth i carried on a voluminous correspondence with pepper whitcomb but it gradually dwindled down to a single letter a month and then to none at all but while he remained at the temple grammar school he kept me advised of the current gossip of the town and the doings of the centipedes as one by one the boys left the academyadams harris marden blake and langdonto seek their fortunes elsewhere there was less to interest me in the old seaport and when pepper himself went to philadelphia to read law i had no one to give me an inkling of what was going on there wasnt much to go on to be sure great events no longer considered it worth their while to honor so quiet a place one fourth of july the temple grammar school burnt downset on fire it was supposed by an eccentric squib that was seen to bolt into an upper windowand mr grimshaw retired from public life married and lived happily ever after as the storybooks say the widow conway i am able to state did not succeed in enslaving mr meeks the apothecary who united himself clandestinely to one of miss dorothy gibbss young ladies and lost the patronage of primrose hall in consequence young conway went into the grocery business with his ancient chum rodgersrodgers conway i read the sign only last summer when i was down in rivermouth and had half a mind to pop into the shop and shake hands with him and ask him if he wanted to fight i contented myself however with flattening my nose against his dingy shopwindow and beheld conway in red whiskers and blue overalls weighing out sugar for a customergiving him short weight ill bet anything i have reserved my pleasantest word for the last it is touching the captain the captain is still hale and rosy and if he doesnt relate his exploit in the war of as spiritedly as he used to he makes up by relating it more frequently and telling it differently every time he passes his winters in new york and his summers in the nutter house which threatens to prove a hard nut for the destructive gentleman with the scythe and the hourglass for the seaward gable has not yielded a clapboard to the eastwind these twenty years the captain has now become the oldest inhabitant in rivermouth and so i dont laugh at the oldest inhabitant any more but pray in my heart that he may occupy the post of honor for half a century to come so ends the story of a bad boybut not such a very bad boy as i told you to begin with
