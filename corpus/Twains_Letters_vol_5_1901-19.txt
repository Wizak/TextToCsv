twains letters vol ed ab paine mark twains letters arranged with comment by albert bigelow paine volume v xl letters of chiefly to twichell mark twain as a reformer summer at saranac assassination of president mckinley an editorial in the louisville courierjournal early in said a remarkable transformation or rather a development has taken place in mark twain the genial humorist of the earlier day is now a reformer of the vigorous kind a sort of knight errant who does not hesitate to break a lance with either church or state if he thinks them interposing on that broad highway over which he believes not a part but the whole of mankind has the privilege of passing in the onward march of the ages mark twain had begun breaking the lance very soon after his return from europe he did not believe that he could reform the world but at least he need not withhold his protest against those things which stirred his wrath he began by causing the arrest of a cabman who had not only overcharged but insulted him he continued by writing openly against the american policy in the philippines the missionary propaganda which had resulted in the chinese uprising and massacre and against tammany politics not all of his efforts were in the line of reform he had become a sort of general spokesman which the public flocked to hear whatever the subject on the occasion of a lincoln birthday service at carnegie hall he was chosen to preside and he was obliged to attend more dinners than were good for his health his letters of this period were mainly written to his old friend twichell in hartford howells who lived in new york he saw with considerable frequency in the letter which follows the medicine which twichell was to take was plasmon an english proprietary remedy in which mark twain had invested a panacea for all human ills which osteopathy could not reach to rev joseph twichell in hartford w th st jan dear joe certainly i used to take it in my coffee but it settled to the bottom in the form of mud and i had to eat it with a spoon so i dropped the custom and took my teaspoonfuls in cold milk after breakfast if we were out of milk i shoveled the dry powder into my mouth and washed it down with water the only essential is to get it down the method is not important no blame it i cant go to the alumni dinner joe it takes two days and i cant spare the time moreover i preside at the lincoln birthday celebration in carnegie hall feb and i must not make two speeches so close together think of it two old rebels functioning there i as president and watterson as orator of the day things have changed somewhat in these years thank god look here when you come down you must be our guest weve got a roomy room for you and livy will make trouble if you go elsewhere come straight to west th jan livy says amen to that also can you give us a day or twos notice so the room will be sure to be vacant im going to stick close to my desk for a month now hoping to write a small book ys ever mark the letter which follows is a fair sample of mark twains private violence on a subject which in public print he could only treat effectively by preserving his good humor when he found it necessary to boil over as he did now and then for relief he always found a willing audience in twichell the mention of his private philosophy refers to what is man privately published in reissued by his publishers in to rev j h twichell in hartford w th jan dear joe im not expecting anything but kicks for scoffing and am expecting a diminution of my bread and butter by it but if livy will let me i will have my say this nation is like all the others that have been spewed upon the earth ready to shout for any cause that will tickle its vanity or fill its pocket what a hell of a heaven it will be when they get all these hypocrites assembled there i cant understand it you are a public guide and teacher joe and are under a heavy responsibility to men young and old if you teach your people as you teach me to hide their opinions when they believe the flag is being abused and dishonored lest the utterance do them and a publisher a damage how do you answer for it to your conscience you are sorry for me in the fair way of give and take i am willing to be a little sorry for you however i seem to be going counter to my own private philosophy which livy wont allow me to publish because it would destroy me but i hope to see it in print before i die i planned it years ago and wrote it in ive often tried to read it to livy but she wont have it it makes her melancholy the truth always has that effect on people would have anyway if they ever got hold of a rag of it which they dont you are supposing that i am supposing that i am moved by a large patriotism and that i am distressed because our president has blundered up to his neck in the philippine mess and that i am grieved because this great big ignorant nation which doesnt know even the a b c facts of the philippine episode is in disgrace before the sarcastic world drop that idea i care nothing for the rest i am only distressed and troubled because i am befouled by these things that is all when i search myself away down deep i find this out whatever a man feels or thinks or does there is never any but one reason for it and that is a selfish one at great inconvenience and expense of precious time i went to the chief synagogue the other night and talked in the interest of a charity school of poor jew girls i know to the finest shades the selfish ends that moved me but no one else suspects i could give you the details if i had time you would perceive how true they are ive written another article you better hurry down and help livy squelch it shes out pottering around somewhere poor housekeeping slave and clara is in the hands of the osteopath getting the bronchitis pulled and hauled out of her it was a bad attack and a little disquieting it came day before yesterday and she hasnt sat up till this afternoon she is getting along satisfactorily now lots of love to you all mark mark twains religion had to do chiefly with humanity in its present incarnation and concerned itself very little with any possible measure of reward or punishment in some supposed court of the hereafter nevertheless psychic investigation always interested him and he was goodnaturedly willing to explore even hoping perhaps to be convinced that individuality continues beyond death the letter which follows indicates his customary attitude in relation to spiritualistic research the experiments here mentioned however were not satisfactory to mrs charles mcquiston dobbs ferry n y march dear mrs mcquiston i have never had an experience which moved me to believe the living can communicate with the dead but my wife and i have experimented in the matter when opportunity offered and shall continue to do so i enclose a letter which came this morning the second from the same source mrs kis a missourian and lately she discovered by accident that she was a remarkable hypnotiser her best subject is a missouri girl miss white who is to come here soon and sustain strictly scientific tests before professors at columbia university mrs clemens and i intend to be present and we shall ask the pair to come to our house to do whatever things they can do meantime if you thought well of it you might write her and arrange a meeting telling her it is by my suggestion and that i gave you her address someone has told me that mrs piper is discredited i cannot be sure but i think it was mr myers president of the london psychical research society we heard of his death yesterday he was a spiritualist i am afraid he was a very easily convinced man we visited two mediums whom he and andrew lang considered quite wonderful but they were quite transparent frauds mrs clemens corrects me one of those women was a fraud the other not a fraud but only an innocent wellmeaning driveling vacancy sincerely yours s l clemens in mark twains bermuda chapters entitled idle notes of an idle excursion he tells of an old sea captain one hurricane jones who explained biblical miracles in a practical even if somewhat startling fashion in his story of the prophets of baal for instance the old captain declared that the burning water was nothing more nor less than petroleum upon reading the notes professor phelps of yale wrote that the same method of explaining miracles had been offered by sir thomas browne perhaps it may be added that captain hurricane jones also appears in roughing it as captain ned blakely to professor william lyon phelps yale university new york april my dear sir i was not aware that old sir thomas had anticipated that story and i am much obliged to you for furnishing me the paragraph t is curious that the same idea should leave entered two heads so unlike as the head of that wise old philosopher and that of captain ned wakeman a splendidly uncultured old sailor but in his own opinion a thinker by divine right he was an old friend of mine of many years standing i made two or three voyages with him and found him a darling in many ways the petroleum story was not told to me he told it to joe twichell who ran across him by accident on a sea voyage where i think the two were the only passengers a delicious pair and admirably mated they took to each other at once and became as thick as thieves joe was passing under a fictitious name and old wakeman didnt suspect that he was a parson so he gave his profanity full swing and he was a master of that great art you probably know twichell and will know that that is a kind of refreshment which he is very capable of enjoying sincerely yours s l clemens for the summer clemens and his family found a comfortable lodge in the adirondacks a log cabin called the lair on saranac lake soon after his arrival there he received an invitation to attend the celebration of missouris eightieth anniversary he sent the following letter to edward l dimmitt in st louis among the adirondack lakes july dear mr dimmitt by an error in the plans things go wrong end first in this world and much precious time is lost and matters of urgent importance are fatally retarded invitations which a brisk young fellow should get and which would transport him with joy are delayed and impeded and obstructed until they are fifty years overdue when they reach him it has happened again in this case when i was a boy in missouri i was always on the lookout for invitations but they always miscarried and went wandering through the aisles of time and now they are arriving when i am old and rheumatic and cant travel and must lose my chance i have lost a world of delight through this matter of delaying invitations fifty years ago i would have gone eagerly across the world to help celebrate anything that might turn up it would have made no difference to me what it was so that i was there and allowed a chance to make a noise the whole scheme of things is turned wrong end to life should begin with age and its privileges and accumulations and end with youth and its capacity to splendidly enjoy such advantages as things are now when in youth a dollar would bring a hundred pleasures you cant have it when you are old you get it and there is nothing worth buying with it then its an epitome of life the first half of it consists of the capacity to enjoy without the chance the last half consists of the chance without the capacity i am admonished in many ways that time is pushing me inexorably along i am approaching the threshold of age in i shall be this is no time to be flitting about the earth i must cease from the activities proper to youth and begin to take on the dignities and gravities and inertia proper to that season of honorable senility which is on its way and imminent as indicated above yours is a great and memorable occasion and as a son of missouri i should hold it a high privilege to be there and share your just pride in the states achievements but i must deny myself the indulgence while thanking you earnestly for the prized honor you have done me in asking me to be present very truly yours s l clemens in the foregoing mark twain touches upon one of his favorite fancies that life should begin with old age and approach strong manhood golden youth to end at last with pampered and beloved babyhood possibly he contemplated writing a story with this idea as the theme but he seems never to have done so the reader who has followed these letters may remember yung wing who had charge of the chinese educational mission in hartford and how mark twain with twichell called on general grant in behalf of the mission yung wing now returned to china had conceived the idea of making an appeal to the government of the united states for relief of his starving countrymen to j h twichell in hartford ampersand n y july dear joe as you say it is impracticable in my case certainly for me to assist in an appeal to that congress of landthieves and liars would be to bring derision upon it and for me to assist in an appeal for cash to pass through the hands of those missionaries out there of any denomination catholic or protestant wouldnt do at all they wouldnt handle money which i had soiled and i wouldnt trust them with it anyway they would devote it to the relief of suffering i know that but the sufferers selected would be converts the missionaryutterances exhibit no humane feeling toward the others but in place of it a spirit of hate and hostility and it is natural the bible forbids their presence there their trade is unlawful why shouldnt their characters be of necessity in harmony with but never mind let it go it irritates me later i have been reading yung wings letter again it may be that he is overwrought by his sympathies but it may not be so there may be other reasons why the missionaries are silent about the shensiyear famine and cannibalism it may be that there are so few protestant converts there that the missionaries are able to take care of them that they are not likely to largely concern themselves about catholic converts and the others is quite natural i think that crude way of appealing to this government for help in a cause which has no money in it and no politics rises before me again in all its admirable innocence doesnt yung wing know us yet however he has been absent since or we have gone to hell since then kossuth couldnt raise cents in congress now if he were back with his moving magyartale i am on the front porch lower one main deck of our little bijou of a dwellinghouse the lakeedge lower saranac is so nearly under me that i cant see the shore but only the water smallpored with rainsplashes for there is a heavy downpour it is charmingly like sitting snuggled up on a ships deck with the stretching sea all around but very much more satisfactory for at sea a rainstorm is depressing while here of course the effect engendered is just a deep sense of comfort and contentment the heavy forest shuts us solidly in on three sides there are no neighbors there are beautiful little tancolored impudent squirrels about they take tea p m not invited at the table in the woods where jean does my typewriting and one of them has been brave enough to sit upon jeans knee with his tail curved over his back and munch his food they come to dinner p m on the front porch not invited they all have the one name blennerhasset from burrs friend and none of them answers to it except when hungry we have been here since june st for a little while we had some warm days according to the familys estimate i was hardly discommoded myself otherwise the weather has been of the sort you are familiar with in these regions cool days and cool nights we have heard of the hot wave every wednesday per the weekly paper we allow no dailies to intrude last week through visitors also the only ones we have had dr root and john howells we have the daily lakeswim and all the tribe servants included but not i do a good deal of boating sometimes with the guide sometimes without him jean and clara are competent with the oars if we live another year i hope we shall spend its summer in this house we have taken the appleton country seat overlooking the hudson at riverdale minutes from the grand central station for a year beginning oct with option for another year we are obliged to be close to new york for a year or two aug rd i go yachting a fortnight up north in a knot boat feet long with the owner mr rogers tom reid dr rice col a g paine and one or two others judge howland would go but cant get away from engagements professor sloane would go but is in the grip of an illness come will you go if you can manage it drop a postcard to me co hh rogers broadway i shall be in new york a couple of days before we sail july or aug perhaps the latter and i think i shall stop at the hotel grosvenor cor lth st and th ave we all send you and the harmonies lots and gobs of love mark to rev j h twichell in hartford ampersand n y aug dear joe just a word to scoff at you with your extravagant suggestion that i read the biography of phillips brooks the very dullest book that has been printed for a century joe ten pages of mrs cheneys masterly biography of her fathers no five pages of it contain more meat more sense more literature more brilliancy than that whole basketful of drowsy rubbish put together why in that dead atmosphere even brooks himself is dull he wearied me oh how he wearied me we had a noble good time in the yacht and caught a chinese missionary and drowned him love from us all to you all mark the assassination of president mckinley occurred september such an event would naturally stir mark twain to comment on human nature in general his letter to twichell is as individual as it is sound in philosophy at what period of his own life or under what circumstances he made the long journey with tragic intent there is no means of knowing now there is no other mention of it elsewhere in the records that survive him to rev j h twichell in hartford ampersand tuesday sept dear joe it is another off day but tomorrow i shall resume work to a certainty and bid a long farewell to letterscribbling the news of the president looks decidedly hopeful and we are all glad and the household faces are much improved as to cheerfulness oh the talk in the newspapers evidently the human race is the same old human race and how unjust and unreflectingly discriminating the talkers are under the unsettling effects of powerful emotion the talkers are saying wild things crazy things they are out of themselves and do not know it they are temporarily insane yet with one voice they declare the assassin sane a man who has been entertaining fiery and reason debauching maggots in his head for weeks and months why no one is sane straight along year in and year out and we all know it our insanities are of varying sorts and express themselves in varying forms fortunately harmless forms as a rule but in whatever form they occur an immense upheaval of feeling can at any time topple us distinctly over the sanityline for a little while and then if our form happens to be of the murderous kind we must look out and so must the spectator this ass with the unpronounceable name was probably more insane than usual this week or two back and may get back upon his bearings by and by but he was over the sanityborder when he shot the president it is possible that it has taken him the whole interval since the murder of the king of italy to get insane enough to attempt the presidents life without a doubt some thousands of men have been meditating the same act in the same interval but new and strong interests have intervened and diverted their overexcited minds long enough to give them a chance to settle and tranquilize and get back upon a healthy level again every extraordinary occurrence unsettles the heads of hundreds of thousands of men for a few moments or hours or days if there had been ten kings around when humbert fell they would have been in great peril for a day or more and from men in whose presence they would have been quite safe after the excess of their excitement had had an interval in which to cool down i bought a revolver once and travelled twelve hundred miles to kill a man he was away he was gone a day with nothing else to do i had to stop and think and did within an hour within half of it i was ashamed of myself and felt unspeakably ridiculous i do not know what to call it if i was not insane during a whole week my head was in a turmoil night and day fierce enough and exhausting enough to upset a stronger reason than mine all over the world every day there are some millions of men in that condition temporarily and in that time there is always a moment perhaps only a single one when they would do murder if their man was at hand if the opportunity comes a shade too late the chances are that it has come permanently too late opportunity seldom comes exactly at the supreme moment this saves a million lives a day in the world for sure no ruler is ever slain but the tremendous details of it are ravenously devoured by a hundred thousand men whose minds dwell unaware near the temporaryinsanity frontier and over they go now there is a day two days three during which no ruler would be safe from perhaps the half of them and there is a single moment wherein he would not be safe from any of them no doubt it may take this present shootingcase six months to breed another rulertragedy but it will breed it there is at least one mind somewhere which will brood and wear and decay itself to the killingpoint and produce that tragedy every negro burned at the stake unsettles the excitable brain of another one i mean the inflaming details of his crime and the lurid theatricality of his exit do it and the duplicate crime follows and that begets a repetition and that one another one and so on every lynchingaccount unsettles the brains of another set of excitable white men and lights another pyre lynchings last year inside of months this year in ten years this will be habit on these terms yes the wild talk you see in the papers and from men who are sane when not upset by overwhelming excitement a u s senatorcullom wants this buffalo criminal lynched it would breed other lynchings of men who are not dreaming of committing murders now and will commit none if cullom will keep quiet and not provide the exciting cause and a district attorney wants a law which shall punish with death attempts upon a presidents life this mind you as a deterrent it would have no effect or the opposite one the lunatics mindspace is all occupied as mine was with the matter in hand there is no room in it for reflections upon what may happen to him that comes after the crime it is the noise the attempt would make in the world that would breed the subsequent attempts by unsettling the rickety minds of men who envy the criminal his vast notoriety his obscure name tongued by stupendous kings and emperors his picture printed everywhere the trivialest details of his movements what he eats what he drinks how he sleeps what he says cabled abroad over the whole globe at cost of fifty thousand dollars a day and he only a lowly shoemaker yesterday like the assassin of the president of france in debt three francs to his landlady and insulted by her and today she is proud to be able to say she knew him as familiarly as you know your own brother and glad to stand till she drops and pour out columns and pages of her grandeur and her happiness upon the eager interviewer nothing will check the lynchings and rulermurder but absolute silence the absence of powpow about them how are you going to manage that by gagging every witness and jamming him into a dungeon for life by abolishing all newspapers by exterminating all newspaper men and by extinguishing gods most elegant invention the human race it is quite simple quite easy and i hope you will take a day off and attend to it joe i blow a kiss to you and am lovingly yours mark when the adirondack summer ended clemens settled for the winter in the beautiful appleton home at riverdaleonthehudson it was a place of widespreading grass and shadea house of ample room they were established in it in time for mark twain to take an active interest in the new york elections and assist a ticket for good government to defeat tammany hall xli letters of riverdale york harbor illness of mrs clemens the year was an eventful one for mark twain in april he received a degree of lld from the university of missouri and returned to his native state to accept it this was his last journey to the mississippi river during the summer mrs clemenss health broke down and illnesses of one sort or another visited other members of the family amid so much stress and anxiety clemens had little time or inclination for work he wrote not many letters and mainly somber ones once by way of diversion he worked out the idea of a curious club which he formed its members to be young girls girls for the most part whom he had never seen they were elected without their consent from among those who wrote to him without his consent and it is not likely that any one so chosen declined membership one selection from his letters to the french member miss helene picard of stdie france will explain the club and present a side of mask twain somewhat different from that found in most of his correspondence to miss picard in stdie france riverdaleonthehudson february dear miss helene if you will let me call you so considering that my head is white and that i have grownup daughters your beautiful letter has given me such deep pleasure i will make bold to claim you for a friend and lock you up with the rest of my riches for i am a miser who counts his spoil every day and hoards it secretly and adds to it when he can and is grateful to see it grow some of that gold comes like yourself in a sealed package and i cant see it and may never have the happiness but i know its value without that and by what sum it increases my wealth i have a club a private club which is all my own i appoint the members myself and they cant help themselves because i dont allow them to vote on their own appointment and i dont allow them to resign they are all friends whom i have never seen save one but who have written friendly letters to me by the laws of my club there can be only one member in each country and there can be no male member but myself some day i may admit males but i dont know they are capricious and inharmonious and their ways provoke me a good deal it is a matter which the club shall decide i have made four appointments in the past three or four months you as member for france a young highland girl as member for scotland a mohammedan girl as member for bengal and a dear and bright young niece of mine as member for the united states for i do not represent a country myself but am merely member at large for the human race you must not try to resign for the laws of the club do not allow that you must console yourself by remembering that you are in the best of company that nobody knows of your membership except myself that no member knows anothers name but only her country that no taxes are levied and no meetings held but how dearly i should like to attend one one of my members is a princess of a royal house another is the daughter of a village bookseller on the continent of europe for the only qualification for membership is intellect and the spirit of good will other distinctions hereditary or acquired do not count may i send you the constitution and laws of the club i shall be so pleased if i may it is a document which one of my daughters typewrites for me when i need one for a new member and she would give her eyebrows to know what it is all about but i strangle her curiosity by saying there are much cheaper typewriters than you are my dear and if you try to pry into the sacred mysteries of this club one of your prosperities will perish sure my favorite it is joan of arc my next is huckleberry finn but the familys next is the prince and the pauper yes you are right i am a moralist in disguise it gets me into heaps of trouble when i go thrashing around in political questions i wish you every good fortune and happiness and i thank you so much for your letter sincerely yours s l clemens early in the year clemens paid a visit to twichell in hartford and after one of their regular arguments on theology and the moral accountability of the human race arguments that had been going on between them for more than thirty years twichell lent his visitor freedom of the will by jonathan edwards to read on the way home the next letter was the result to rev j h twichell in hartford riverdaleonthehudson feb dear joe after compliments meaning what a good time you gave me what a happiness it was to be under your roof again etc etc see opening sentence of all translations of letters passing between lord roberts and indian princes and rulers from bridgeport to new york thence to home and continuously until near midnight i wallowed and reeked with jonathan in his insane debauch rose immediately refreshed and fine at this morning but with a strange and haunting sense of having been on a three days tear with a drunken lunatic it is years since i have known these sensations all through the book is the glaze of a resplendent intellect gone mad a marvelous spectacle no not all through the book the drunk does not come on till the last third where what i take to be calvinism and its god begins to show up and shine red and hideous in the glow from the fires of hell their only right and proper adornment by god i was ashamed to be in such company jonathan seems to hold as against the arminian position that the man or his soul or his will never creates an impulse itself but is moved to action by an impulse back of it thats sound also that of two or more things offered it it infallibly chooses the one which for the moment is most pleasing to itself perfectly correct an immense admission for a man not otherwise sane up to that point he could have written chapters iii and iv of my suppressed gospel but there we seem to separate he seems to concede the indisputable and unshakable dominion of motive and necessity call them what he may these are exterior forces and not under the mans authority guidance or even suggestion then he suddenly flies the logic track and to all seeming makes the man and not these exterior forces responsible to god for the mans thoughts words and acts it is frank insanity i think that when he concedes the autocratic dominion of motive and necessity he grants a third position of mine that a mans mind is a mere machine an automatic machine which is handled entirely from the outside the man himself furnishing it absolutely nothing not an ounce of its fuel and not so much as a bare suggestion to that exterior engineer as to what the machine shall do nor how it shall do it nor when after that concession it was time for him to get alarmed and shirk for he was pointing straight for the only rational and possible nextstation on that piece of road the irresponsibility of man to god and so he shirked shirked and arrived at this handsome result man is commanded to do soandso it has been ordained from the beginning of time that some men shant and others cant these are to be blamed let them be damned i enjoy the colonel very much and shall enjoy the rest of him with an obscene delight joe the whole tribe shout love to you and yours mark we have not heard of joe goodman since the trying days of and when he was seeking to promote the fortunes of the typesetting machine goodman meantime who had in turn been miner printer publisher and farmer had been devoting his energies and genius to something entirely new he had been translating the prehistoric mayan inscriptions of yucatan and with such success that his work was elaborately published by an association of british scientists in due time a copy of this publication came to clemens who was full of admiration of the great achievement to j t goodman in california riverdaleonthehudson june dear joe i am lost in reverence and admiration it is now twentyfour hours that i have been trying to cool down and contemplate with quiet blood this extraordinary spectacle of energy industry perseverance pluck analytical genius penetration this irruption of thunders and fiery splendors from a fair and flowery mountain that nobody had supposed was a sleeping volcano but i seem to be as excited as ever yesterday i read as much as half of the book not understanding a word but enchanted nevertheless partly by the wonder of it all the study the erudition the incredible labor the modesty the dignity the majestic exclusiveness of the field and its lofty remoteness from things and contacts sordid and mean and earthy and partly by the grace and beauty and limpidity of the books unsurpassable english science always great and worshipful goes often in hodden grey but you have clothed her in garments meet for her high degree you think you get poor pay for your twenty years no oh no you have lived in a paradise of the intellect whose lightest joys were beyond the reach of the longest purse in christendom you have had daily and nightly emancipation from the worlds slaveries and gross interests you have received a bigger wage than any man in the land you have dreamed a splendid dream and had it come true and today you could not afford to trade fortunes with anybody not even with another scientist for he must divide his spoil with his guild whereas essentially the world you have discovered is your own and must remain so it is all just magnificent joe and no one is prouder or gladder than yours always mark at york harbor maine where they had taken a cottage for the summer a pretty place with howells not far distant at kittery point mrs clemenss health gave way this was at a period when telegraphic communication was far from reliable the oldtime western union had fallen from grace its system no longer justified the best significance of that word the new day of reorganization was coming and it was time for it mark twains letter concerning the service at york harbor would hardly be warranted today but those who remember conditions of that earlier time will agree that it was justified then and will appreciate its satire to the president of the western union in new york the pines york harbor maine dear sir i desire to make a complaint and i bring it to you the head of the company because by experience i know better than to carry it to a subordinate i have been here a month and a half and by testimony of friends reinforced by personal experience i now feel qualified to claim as an established fact that the telegraphic service here is the worst in the world except that boston these services are actually slower than was the new york and hartford service in the days when i last complained to you which was fifteen or eighteen years ago when telegraphic time and train time between the mentioned points was exactly the same towit three hours and a half six days ago it was that raw day which provoked so much comment my daughter was on her way up from new york and at noon she telegraphed me from new haven asking that i meet her with a cloak at portsmouth her telegram reached me four hours and a quarter later just minutes too late for me to catch my train and meet her i judge that the telegram traveled about miles it is the best telegraphic work i have seen since i have been here and i am mentioning it in this place not as a complaint but as a compliment i think a compliment ought always to precede a complaint where one is possible because it softens resentment and insures for the complaint a courteous and gentle reception still there is a detail or two connected with this matter which ought perhaps to be mentioned and now having smoothed the way with the compliment i will venture them the head corpse in the york harbor office sent me that telegram altho he knew it would reach me too late to be of any value also that he was going to send it to me by his boy that the boy would not take the trolley and come the miles in minutes but would walk that he would be two hours and a quarter on the road and that he would collect cents for transportation for a telegram which the he knew to be worthless before he started it from these data i infer that the western union owes me cents that is to say the amount paid for combined wire and land transportation a recoup provided for in the printed paragraph which heads the telegraphblank by these humane and christian stages we now arrive at the complaint proper we have had a grave case of illness in the family and a relative was coming some six hundred miles to help in the sickroom during the convalescing period it was an anxious time of course and i wrote and asked to be notified as to the hour of the expected arrival of this relative in boston or in york harbor being afraid of the telegraph which i think ought not to be used in times of hurry and emergency i asked that the desired message be brought to me by some swift method of transportation by the milkman if he was coming this way but there are always people who think they know more than you do especially young people so of course the young fellow in charge of this lady used the telegraph and at boston of all places except york harbor the result was as usual let me employ a statelier and exacter term and say historical the dispatch was handed to the h c of the boston office at this morning it said shall bring a s to you eleven fortyfive this morning the distance traveled by the dispatch is forty or fifty miles i suppose as the traintime is five minutes short of two hours and the trains are so slow that they cant give a w u telegram two hours and twenty minutes start and overtake it as i have said the dispatch was handed in at boston at the expected visitors left boston at and reached my house at noon beating the telegram solid hours and minutes over the boy brought the telegram it was baldheaded with age but still legible the boy was prostrate with travel and exposure but still alive and i went out to condole with him and get his last wishes and send for the ambulance he was waiting to collect transportation before turning his passing spirit to less serious affairs i found him strangely intelligent considering his condition and where he is getting his training i asked him at what hour the telegram was handed to the h c in boston he answered brightly that he didnt know i examined the blank and sure enough the wary boston h c had thoughtfully concealed that statistic i asked him at what hour it had started from boston he answered up as brightly as ever and said he didnt know i examined the blank and sure enough the boston h c had left that statistic out in the cold too in fact it turned out to be an official concealment no blank was provided for its exposure and none required by the law i suppose it is a good onesided idea i remarked they can take your money and ship your telegram next year if they want to youve no redress the law ought to extend the privilege to all of us the boy looked upon me coldly i asked him when the telegram reached york harbor he pointed to some figures following the signature at the bottom of the blank i said it was now and asked do you mean that it reached your morgue an hour and a half ago he nodded assent it was at that time half an hour too late to be of any use to me if i wanted to go and meet my people which was the case for by the wording of the message you can see that they were to arrive at the station at why did your h c send me this useless message cant he read is he dead its the rules no that does not account for it would he have sent it if it had been three years old i in the meantime deceased and he aware of it the boy didnt know because you know a rule which required him to forward to the cemetery today a dispatch due three years ago would be as good a rule as one which should require him to forward a telegram to me today which he knew had lost all its value an hour or two before he started it the construction of such a rule would discredit an idiot in fact an idiot i mean a common ordinary christian idiot you understand would be ashamed of it and for the sake of his reputation wouldnt make it what do you think he replied with much natural brilliancy that he wasnt paid for thinking this gave me a better opinion of the commercial intelligence pervading his morgue than i had had before it also softened my feelings toward him and also my tone which had hitherto been tinged with bitterness let bygones be bygones i said gently we are all erring creatures and mainly idiots but god made us so and it is dangerous to criticise sincerely s l clemens one day there arrived from europe a caller with a letter of introduction from elizabeth queen of rumania better known as carmen sylva the visitor was madam hartwig formerly an american girl returning now because of reduced fortunes to find profitable employment in her own land her husband a man of high principle had declined to take part in an affair of honor as recognized by the continental code hence his ruin elizabeth of rumania was one of the most loved and respected of european queens and an author of distinction mark twain had known her in vienna her letter to him and his own letter to the public perhaps a second one for its date is two years later follow herewith from carmen sylva to mark twain bucarest may honored master if i venture to address you on behalf of a poor lady who is stranded in bucarest i hope not to be too disagreeable mrs hartwig left america at the age of fourteen in order to learn to sing which she has done thoroughly her husband had quite a brilliant situation here till he refused to partake dans une afaire onereuse so it seems they havent a penny and each of them must try to find a living she is very nice and pleasant and her school is so good that she most certainly can give excellent singing lessons i beg your pardon for being a bore to one i so deeply love and admire to whom i owe days and days of forgetfulness of self and troubles and the intensest of all joys heroworship people dont always realize what a happiness that is god bless you for every beautiful thought you poured into my tired heart and for every smile on a weary way carmen sylva from mark twain to the public nov to whom it may concern i desire to recommend madame hartwig to my friends and the public as a teacher of singing and as a concertvocalist she has lived for fifteen years at the court of roumania and she brought with her to america an autograph letter in which her majesty the queen of roumania cordially certified her to me as being an accomplished and gifted singer and teacher of singing and expressed a warm hope that her professional venture among us would meet with success through absence in europe i have had no opportunity to test the validity of the queens judgment in the matter but that judgment is the utterance of an entirely competent authority the best that occupies a throne and as good as any that sits elsewhere as the musical world well knows and therefore back it without hesitation and endorse it with confidence i will explain that the reason her majesty tried to do her friend a friendly office through me instead of through someone else was not that i was particularly the right or best person for the office but because i was not a stranger it is true that i am a stranger to some of the monarchs mainly through their neglect of their opportunities but such is not the case in the present instance the latter fact is a high compliment to me and perhaps i ought to conceal it some people would mark twain mrs clemenss improvement was scarcely perceptible it was not until october that they were able to remove her to riverdale and then only in a specially arranged invalidcar at the end of the long journey she was carried to her room and did not leave it again for many months to rev j h twichell in hartford riverdale n y oct dear joe it is ten days since susy twichell wrote that you were laid up with a sprained shoulder since which time we have had no news about it i hope that no news is good news according to the proverb still authoritative confirmation of it will be gladly received in this family if some of you will furnish it moreover i should like to know how and where it happened in the pulpit as like as not otherwise you would not be taking so much pains to conceal it this is not a malicious suggestion and not a personallyinvented one you told me yourself once that you threw artificial power and impressiveness into places in your sermons where needed by banging the bible your own words you have reached a time of life when it is not wise to take these risks you would better jump around we all have to change our methods as the infirmities of age creep upon us jumping around will be impressive now whereas before you were gray it would have excited remark poor livy drags along drearily it must be hard times for that turbulent spirit it will be a long time before she is on her feet again it is a most pathetic case i wish i could transfer it to myself between ripping and raging and smoking and reading i could get a good deal of a holiday out of it clara runs the house smoothly and capably she is discharging a trialcook today and hiring another a power of love to you all mark such was the state of mrs clemenss health that visitors were excluded from the sick room and even clemens himself was allowed to see her no more than a few moments at a time these brief precious visits were the chief interests of his long days occasionally he was allowed to send her a few lines reporting his occupations and these she was sometimes permitted to answer only one of his notes has been preserved written after a day now rare of literary effort its signature the letter y stands for youth always her name for him to mrs clemens dear heart ive done another full days work and finished before i have been reading and dozing since and would have had a real sleep a few minutes ago but for an incursion to bring me a couple of unimportant letters ive stuck to the bed all day and am getting back my lost ground next time i will be strictly careful and make my visit very short just a kiss and a rush thank you for your dear dear note you who are my own and only sweetheart sleep well y xlii letters of to various persons hard days at riverdale last summer at elmira the return to italy the reader may perhaps recall that h h rogers some five or six years earlier had taken charge of the fortunes of helen keller making it possible for her to complete her education helen had now written her first book a wonderful book the story of my life and it had been successfully published for a later generation it may be proper to explain that the miss sullivan later mrs macy mentioned in the letter which follows was the noble woman who had devoted her life to the enlightenment of this blind dumb girl had made it possible for her to speak and understand and indeed to see with the eyes of luminous imagination the case of plagiarism mentioned in this letter is not now remembered and does not matter but it furnished a text for mark twain whose remarks on the subject in general are eminently worth while to helen keller in wrentham mass riverdaleonthehudson st patricks day dear helen i must steal half a moment from my work to say how glad i am to have your book and how highly i value it both for its own sake and as a remembrances of an affectionate friendship which has subsisted between us for nine years without a break and without a single act of violence that i can call to mind i suppose there is nothing like it in heaven and not likely to be until we get there and show off i often think of it with longing and how theyll say there they come sit down in front i am practicing with a tin halo you do the same i was at henry rogerss last night and of course we talked of you he is not at all well you will not like to hear that but like you and me he is just as lovely as ever i am charmed with your bookenchanted you are a wonderful creature the most wonderful in the world you and your other half together miss sullivan i mean for it took the pair of you to make a complete and perfect whole how she stands out in her letters her brilliancy penetration originality wisdom character and the fine literary competencies of her pen they are all there oh dear me how unspeakably funny and owlishly idiotic and grotesque was that plagiarism farce as if there was much of anything in any human utterance oral or written except plagiarism the kernal the soul let us go further and say the substance the bulk the actual and valuable material of all human utterances is plagiarism for substantially all ideas are secondhand consciously and unconsciously drawn from a million outside sources and daily used by the garnerer with a pride and satisfaction born of the superstition that he originated them whereas there is not a rag of originality about them anywhere except the little discoloration they get from his mental and moral calibre and his temperament and which is revealed in characteristics of phrasing when a great orator makes a great speech you are listening to ten centuries and ten thousand men but we call it his speech and really some exceedingly small portion of it is his but not enough to signify it is merely a waterloo it is wellingtons battle in some degree and we call it his but there are others that contributed it takes a thousand men to invent a telegraph or a steam engine or a phonograph or a photograph or a telephone or any other important thing and the last man gets the credit and we forget the others he added his little mite that is all he did these object lessons should teach us that ninetynine parts of all things that proceed from the intellect are plagiarisms pure and simple and the lesson ought to make us modest but nothing can do that then why dont we unwittingly reproduce the phrasing of a story as well as the story itself it can hardly happen to the extent of fifty words except in the case of a child its memorytablet is not lumbered with impressions and the actual language can have gravingroom there and preserve the language a year or two but a grown persons memorytablet is a palimpsest with hardly a bare space upon which to engrave a phrase it must be a very rare thing that a whole page gets so sharply printed upon a mans mind by a single reading that it will stay long enough to turn up some time or other and be mistaken by him for his own no doubt we are constantly littering our literature with disconnected sentences borrowed from books at some unremembered time and now imagined to be our own but that is about the most we can do in i read dr holmess poems in the sandwich islands a year and a half later i stole his dictation without knowing it and used it to dedicate my innocents abroad with then years afterwards i was talking with dr holmes about it he was not an ignorant ass no not he he was not a collection of decayed human turnips like your plagiarism court and so when i said i know now where i stole it but whom did you steal it from he said i dont remember i only know i stole it from somebody because i have never originated anything altogether myself nor met anybody who had to think of those solemn donkeys breaking a little childs heart with their ignorant rubbish about plagiarism i couldnt sleep for blaspheming about it last night why their whole lives their whole histories all their learning all their thoughts all their opinions were one solid ruck of plagiarism and they didnt know it and never suspected it a gang of dull and hoary pirates piously setting themselves the task of disciplining and purifying a kitten that they think theyve caught filching a chop oh dam but you finish it dear i am running short of vocabulary today ever lovingly your friend mark edited and modified by clara clemens deputy to her mother who for more than months has been ill in bed and unable to exercise her official function the burden of the clemens household had fallen almost entirely upon clara clemens in addition to supervising its customary affairs she also shouldered the responsibility of an unusual combination of misfortunes for besides the critical condition of her mother her sister jean clemens was down with pneumonia no word of which must come to mrs clemens certainly it was a difficult position in some account of it which he set down later clemens wrote it was fortunate for us all that claras reputation for truthfulness was so well established in her mothers mind it was our daily protection from disaster the mother never doubted claras word clara could tell her large improbabilities without exciting any suspicion whereas if i tried to market even a small and simple one the case would have been different i was never able to get a reputation like claras the accumulation of physical ailments in the clemens home had somewhat modified mark twains notion of medical practice he was no longer radical he had become eclectic it is a good deal of a concession that he makes to twichell after those earlier letters from sweden in which osteopathy had been heralded as the anodyne for all human ills to rev j h twichell in hartford dear joe livy does really make a little progress these past or days progress which is visible to even the untrained eye the physicians are doing good work with her but my notion is that no art of healing is the best for all ills i should distribute the ailments around surgery cases to the surgeons lupus to the actinicray specialist nervous prostration to the christian scientist most ills to the allopath and the homeopath in my own particular case rheumatism gout and bronchial attacks to the osteopathist mr rogers was to sail southward this morning and here is this weather i am sorry i think its a question if he gets away tomorrow ys ever mark it was through j y m macalister to whom the next letter is written that mark twain had become associated with the plasmon company which explains the reference to shares he had seen much of macalister during the winter at tedworth square and had grown fond of him it is a characteristic letter and one of interesting fact to j y m macalister in london riverdale new york april dear macalister yours arrived last night and god knows i was glad to get it for i was afraid i had blundered into an offence in some way and forfeited your friendship a kind of blunder i have made so many times in my life that i am always standing in a waiting and morbid dread of its occurrence three days ago i was in condition during one horribly long night to sympathetically roast with you in your hell of troubles during that night i was back again where i was in the black days when i was buried under a mountain of debt i called the daughters to me in private council and paralysed them with the announcement our outgo has increased in the past months until our expenses are now per cent greater than our income it was a mistake when i came down in the morning a gray and aged wreck and went over the figures again i found that in some unaccountable way unaccountable to a business man but not to me i had multiplied the totals by by god i dropped years on the floor where i stood do you know it affected me as one is affected when he wakes out of a hideous dream and finds that it was only a dream it was a great comfort and satisfaction to me to call the daughters to a private meeting of the board again and say you need not worry any more our outgo is only a third more than our income in a few months your mother will be out of her bed and on her feet again then we shall drop back to normal and be all right certainly there is a blistering and awful reality about a wellarranged unreality it is quite within the possibilities that two or three nights like that night of mine could drive a man to suicide he would refuse to examine the figures they would revolt him so and he could go to his death unaware that there was nothing serious about them i cannot get that night out of my head it was so vivid so real so ghastly in any other year of these the relief would have been simple go where you can cut your cloth to fit your income you cant do that when your wife cant be moved even from one room to the next clam spells the trained nurse afternoons i am allowed to see mrs clemens minutes twice a day and write her two letters a day provided i put no news in them no other person ever sees her except the physician and now and then a nervespecialist from new york she saw there was something the matter that morning but she got no facts out of me but that is nothing she hasnt had anything but lies for months a fact would give her a relapse the doctor and a specialist met in conspiracy five days ago and in their belief she will by and by come out of this as good as new substantially they ordered her to italy for next winter which seems to indicate that by autumn she will be able to undertake the voyage so clara is writing a florence friend to take a look round among the villas for us in the regions near that city it seems early to do this but joan bergheim thought it would be wise he and his wife lunched with us here yesterday they have been abroad in havana months and they sailed for england this morning i am enclosing an order for half of my your founders shares you are not to refuse them this time though you have done it twice before they are yours not mine and for your familys sake if not your own you cannot in these cloudy days renounce this property which is so clearly yours and theirs you have been generous long enough be just now to yourself mr rogers is off yachting for or weeks ill get them when he returns the head of the house joins me in warmest greetings and remembrances to you and mrs macalister ever yours mark may great scott i never mailed this letter i addressed it put registered on it then left it lying unsealed on the arm of my chair and rushed up to my bed quaking with a chill ive never been out of the bed since oh bronchitis rheumatism two sets of teeth aching land ive had a dandy time for weeks and today great guns one of the very worst im devilish sorry and i do apologise for although i am not as slow as you are about answering letters as a rule i see where im standing this time two weeks ago jean was taken down again this time with measles and i havent been able to go to her and she hasnt been able to come to me but mrs clemens is making nice progress and can stand alone a moment or two at a time now ill post this mark the two letters that follow though written only a few days apart were separated in their arrival by a period of seven years the second letter was in some way mislaid and not mailed and it was not until after the writer of it was dead that it was found and forwarded mark twain could never get up much enthusiasm for the writings of scott his praise of quentin durward is about the only approval he ever accorded to the works of the great romanticist to brander matthews in new york new york city may dear brander i havent been out of my bed for four weeks but well i have been reading a good deal and it occurs to me to ask you to sit down some time or other when you have or months to spare and jot me down a certain few literary particulars for my help and elevation your time need not be thrown away for at your further leisure you can make colombian lectures out of the results and do your students a good turn are there in sir walters novels passages done in good english english which is neither slovenly or involved are there passages whose english is not poor and thin and commonplace but is of a quality above that are there passages which burn with real fire not punk foxfire make believe has he heroes and heroines who are not cads and cadesses has he personages whose acts and talk correspond with their characters as described by him has he heroes and heroines whom the reader admires admires and knows why has he funny characters that are funny and humorous passages that are humorous does he ever chain the readers interest and make him reluctant to lay the book down are there pages where he ceases from posing ceases from admiring the placid flood and flow of his own dilutions ceases from being artificial and is for a time long or short recognizably sincere and in earnest did he know how to write english and didnt do it because he didnt want to did he use the right word only when he couldnt think of another one or did he run so much to wrong because he didnt know the right one when he saw it can you read him and keep your respect for him of course a person could in his day an era of sentimentality and sloppy romantics but land can a body do it today brander i lie here dying slowly dying under the blight of sir walter i have read the first volume of rob roy and as far as chapter xix of guy mannering and i can no longer hold my head up nor take my nourishment lord its all so juvenile so artificial so shoddy and such wax figures and skeletons and spectres interest why it is impossible to feel an interest in these bloodless shams these milkandwater humbugs and oh the poverty of the invention not poverty in inventing situations but poverty in furnishing reasons for them sir walter usually gives himself away when he arranges for a situation elaborates and elaborates and elaborates till if you live to get to it you dont believe in it when it happens i cant find the rest of rob roy i cant stand any more mannering i do not know just what to do but i will reflect and not quit this great study rashly he was great in his day and to his proper audience and so was god in jewish times for that matter but why should either of them rank high now and do they honest now do they damd if i believe it my i wish i could see you and leigh hunt sincerely yours s l clemens to brander matthews in new york riverdale may mailed june dear brander im still in bed but the days have lost their dulness since i broke into sir walter and lost my temper i finished guy mannering that curious curious book with its mob of squalid shadows jabbering around a single fleshandblood being dinmont a book crazily put together out of the very refuse of the romanceartists stage properties finished it and took up quentin durward and finished that it was like leaving the dead to mingle with the living it was like withdrawing from the infant class in the college of journalism to sit under the lectures in english literature in columbia university i wonder who wrote quentin durward yrs ever mark in preparations were going on for a great worlds fair to be held in st louis and among other features proposed was a worlds literary convention with a week to be set apart in honor of mark twain and a special mark twain day in it on which the national association would hold grand services in honor of the distinguished missourian a letter asking his consent to the plan brought the following reply to t f gatts of missouri new york may dear mr gatts it is indeed a high compliment which you offer me in naming an association after me and in proposing the setting apart of a mark twain day at the great st louis fair but such compliments are not proper for the living they are proper and safe for the dead only i value the impulse which moves you to tender me these honors i value it as highly as any one can and am grateful for it but i should stand in a sort of terror of the honors themselves so long as we remain alive we are not safe from doing things which however righteously and honorably intended can wreck our repute and extinguish our friendships i hope that no society will be named for me while i am still alive for i might at some time or other do something which would cause its members to regret having done me that honor after i shall have joined the dead i shall follow the customs of those people and be guilty of no conduct that can wound any friend but until that time shall come i shall be a doubtful quantity like the rest of our race very truly yours s l clemens the national mark twain association did not surrender easily mr gatts wrote a second letter full of urgent appeal if mark twain was tempted we get no hint of it in his answer to t f gatts of missouri new york june dear mr gatts while i am deeply touched by the desire of my friends of hannibal to confer these great honors upon me i must still forbear to accept them spontaneous and unpremeditated honors like those which came to me at hannibal columbia st louis and at the village stations all down the line are beyond all price and are a treasure for life in the memory for they are a free gift out of the heart and they come without solicitations but i am a missourian and so i shrink from distinctions which have to be arranged beforehand and with my privity for i then became a party to my own exalting i am humanly fond of honors that happen but chary of those that come by canvass and intention with sincere thanks to you and your associates for this high compliment which you have been minded to offer me i am very truly yours s l clemens we have seen in the letter to macalister that mark twains wife had been ordered to italy and plans were in progress for an establishment there by the end of june mrs clemens was able to leave riverdale and she made the journey to quarry farm elmira where they would remain until october the month planned for their sailing the house in hartford had been sold and a house which prior to mrs clemenss breakdown they had bought near tarrytown expecting to settle permanently on the hudson had been let they were going to europe for another indefinite period at quarry farm mrs clemens continued to improve and clemens once more able to work occupied the study which mrs crane had built for him thirty years before and where tom sawyer and huck finn and the wandering prince had been called into being to rev j h twichell in hartford conn quarry farm elmira n y july dear joe that loveletter delighted livy beyond any like utterance received by her these thirty years and more i was going to answer it for her right away and said so but she reserved the privilege to herself i judge she is accumulating hot stuff as george ade would say livy is coming along eats well sleeps some is mostly very gay not very often depressed spends all day on the porch sleeps there a part of the night makes excursions in carriage and in wheelchair and in the matter of superintending everything and everybody has resumed business at the old stand did you ever go househunting miles away it costs three months of writing and telegraphing to pull off a success we finished or days ago and took the villa papiniano dam the name i have to look at it a minutes after writing it and then am always in doubt for a year by cable three miles outside of florence under fiesole a darling location and apparently a choice house near fiske theres in our gang all women but me it means trunks and things but thanks be today this is private comes a most handsome voluntary document with seals and escutcheons on it from the italian ambassador who is a stranger to me commanding the customs people to keep their hands off the clemenss things now wasnt it lovely of him and wasnt it lovely of me to let livy take a pencil and edit my answer and knock a good third of it out and thats a nice ship the irene new swift tons rooms up in the sky open to sun and air and all that i was desperately troubled for livy about the downcellar cells in the ancient latin the cubs are in riverdale yet they come to us the first week in august with lots and lots of love to you all mark the arrangement for the villa papiniano was not completed after all and through a good friend george gregory smith a resident of florence the villa quarto an ancient home of royalty on the hills west of florence was engaged smith wrote that it was a very beautiful place with a southeastern exposure looking out toward valombrosa and the chianti hills it had extensive grounds and stables and the annual rental for it all was two thousand dollars a year it seemed an ideal place in prospect and there was great hope that mrs clemens would find her health once more in the italian climate which she loved perhaps at this point when mark twain is once more leaving america we may offer two letters from strangers to him letters of appreciation such as he was constantly receiving from those among the thousands to whom he had given happiness the first is from samuel merwin one day to become a popular novelist then in the hour of his beginnings to mark twain from samuel merwin plainfield n j august dear mr clemens for a good many years i have been struggling with the temptation to write you and thank you for the work you have done and today i seem to be yielding during the past two years i have been reading through a group of writers who seem to me to represent about the best we have sir thomas malory spenser shakespeare boswell carlyle le sage in thinking over one and then another and then all of them together it was plain to see why they were great men and writers each brought to his time some new blood new ideas turned a new current into the stream i suppose there have always been the careful painstaking writers the men who are always taken so seriously by their fellow craftsmen it seems to be the unconventional man who is so rare i mean the honestly unconventional man who has to express himself in his own big way because the conventional way isnt big enough because ne needs room and freedom we have a group of the more or less conventional men now men of dignity and literary position but in spite of their influence and of all the work they have done there isnt one of them to whom one can give ones self up without reservation not one whose ideas seem based on the deep foundation of all true philosophy except mark twain i hope this letter is not an impertinence i have just been turning about with my head full of spenser and shakespeare and gil blas looking for something in our own present day literature to which i could surrender myself as to those five gripping old writings and nothing could i find until i took up life on the mississippi and huckleberry finn and just now the connecticut yankee it isnt the first time i have read any of these three and its because i know it wont be the last because these books are the only ones written in my lifetime that claim my unreserved interest and admiration and above all my feelings that ive felt i had to write this letter i like to think that tom sawyer and huckleberry finn will be looked upon fifty or a hundred years from now as the picture of buoyant dramatic human american life i feel deep in my own heart pretty sure that they will be they wont be looked on then as the work of a humorist any more than we think of shakespeare as a humorist now i dont mean by this to set up a comparison between mark twain and shakespeare i dont feel competent to do it and im not at all sure that it could be done until mark twains work shall have its fair share of historical perspective but shakespeare was a humorist and so thank heaven is mark twain and shakespeare plunged deep into the deep sad things of life and so in a different way but in a way that has more than once brought tears to my eyes has mark twain but after all it isnt because of any resemblance for anything that was ever before written that mark twains books strike in so deep its rather because theyve brought something really new into our literature new yet old as adam and eve and the apple and this achievement the achievement of putting something into literature that was not there before is i should think the most that any writer can ever hope to do it is the one mark of distinction between the lonesome little group of big men and the vast herd of medium and small ones anyhow this much i am sure of to the young man who hopes however feebly to accomplish a little something someday as a writer the one inspiring example of our time is mark twain very truly yours samuel merwin mark twain once said he could live a month on a good compliment and from his reply we may believe this one to belong in that class to samuel merwin in plainfield n j aug dear mr merwin what you have said has given me deep pleasure indeed i think no words could be said that could give me more very sincerely yours s l clemens the next compliment is from one who remains unknown for she failed to sign her name in full but it is a lovely letter and loses nothing by the fact that the writer of it was willing to remain in obscurity to mark twain from margaret m portland oregon aug my dear dear mark twain may a little girl write and tell you how dearly she loves and admires your writings well i do and i want to tell you your ownself dont think me too impertinent for indeed i dont mean to be that i have read everything of yours that i could get and parts that touch me i have read over and over again they seem such dear friends to me so like real live human beings talking and laughing working and suffering too one cannot but feel that it is your own life and experience that you have painted so do not wonder that you seem a dear friend to me who has never even seen you i often think of you as such in my own thoughts i wonder if you will laugh when i tell you i have made a hero of you for when people seem very sordid and mean and stupid and it seems as if everybody was then the thought will come like a little crumb of comfort well mark twain isnt anyway and it does really brighten me up you see i have gotten an idea that you are a great bright spirit of kindness and tenderness one who can twist everybodyseven your ownfaults and absurdities into hearty laughs even the person mocked must laugh oh dear how often you have made me laugh and yet as often you have struck something infinite away down deep in my heart so that i want to cry while half laughing so this all means that i want to thank you and to tell you god always love mark twain is often my wish i dearly love to read books and i never tire of reading yours they always have a charm for me goodbye i am afraid i have not expressed what i feel but at least i have tried sincerely yours margaret m clemens and family left elmira october the th for new york city they remained at the hotel grosvenor until their sailing date october th a few days earlier mr frank doubleday sent a volume of kiplings poems and de blowitzs memoirs for entertainment on the ship mark twains acknowledgment follows to f n doubleday in new york the grosvenor october dear doubleday the books came ever so many thanks i have been reading the bell buoy and the old men over and over again my custom with kiplings workand saving up the rest for other leisurely and luxurious meals a bellbuoy is a deeply impressive fellowbeing in these many recent trips up and down the sound in the kanawha mr rogerss yacht he has talked to me nightly sometimes in his pathetic and melancholy way sometimes with his strenuous and urgent note and i got his meaning now i have his words no one but kipling could do this strong and vivid thing some day i hope to hear the poem chanted or sung with the bellbuoy breaking in out of the distance the old men delicious isnt it and so comically true i havent arrived there yet but i suppose i am on the way yours ever mark p s your letter has arrived it makes me proud and glad what kipling says i hope fate will fetch him to florence while we are there i would rather see him than any other man weve let the tarrytown house for a year man you would never have believed a person could let a house in these times that ones for sale the hartford one is sold when we buy again may we may i be damned ive dipped into blowitz and find him quaintly and curiously interesting i think he tells the straight truth too i knew him a little years ago the appreciative word which kipling had sent doubleday was i love to think of the great and godlike clemens he is the biggest man you have on your side of the water by a damn sight and dont you forget it cervantes was a relation of his xliii letters of to various persons life in villa quarto death of mrs clemens the return to america mrs clemens stood the voyage to italy very well and in due time the family were installed in the villa reale di quarto the picturesque old palace of cosimo a spacious luxurious place even if not entirely cheerful or always comfortable during the changeable tuscan winter congratulated in a letter from macalister in being in the midst of florentine sunshine he answered florentine sunshine bless you there isnt any we have heavy fogs every morning and rain all day this house is not merely large it is vast therefore i think it must always lack the home feeling neither was their landlady the american wife of an italian count all that could be desired from a letter to twichell however we learn that mark twains work was progressing well to rev j h twichell in hartford villa di quarto florence jan dear joe i have had a handsome success in one way here i left new york under a sort of half promise to furnish to the harper magazines words this year magazining is difficult work because every third page represents pages that you have put in the fire because you are nearly sure to start wrong twice and so when you have finished an article and are willing to let it go to print it represents only cents a word instead of but this time i had the curious and unprecedented luck to start right in each case i turned out words in working days and the reason i think i started right every time is that not only have i approved and accepted the several articles but the court of last resort livy has done the same on many of the betweendays i did some work but only of an idle and not necessarily necessary sort since it will not see print until i am dead i shall continue this an hour per day but the rest of the year i expect to put in on a couple of long books halfcompleted ones no more magazinework hanging over my head this secluded and silent solitude this clean soft air and this enchanting view of florence the great valley and the snowmountains that frame it are the right conditions for work they are a persistent inspiration today is very lovely when the afternoon arrives there will be a new picture every hour till dark and each of them divine or progressing from divine to diviner and divinest on this second floor claras room commands the finest she keeps a window ten feet high wide open all the time and frames it in i go in from time to time every day and trade sass for a look the central detail is a distant and stately snowhump that rises above and behind blackforested hills and its sloping vast buttresses velvety and sunpolished with purple shadows between make the sort of picture we knew that time we walked in switzerland in the days of our youth i wish i could show your letter to livy but she must wait a week or so for it i think i told you she had a prostrating week of tonsilitis a month ago she has remained very feeble ever since and confined to the bed of course but we allow ourselves to believe she will regain the lost ground in another month her physician is professor grocco she could not have a better and she has a very good trained nurse love to all of you from all of us and to all of our dear hartford friends mark p s days later livy is as remarkable as ever the day i wrote you that night i mean she had a bitter attack of gout or rheumatism occupying the whole left arm from shoulder to fingers accompanied by fever the pains racked her or o hours they have departed now and already she is planning a trip to egypt next fall and a winters sojourn there this is life in her yet you will be surprised that i was willing to do so much magazinewriting a thing i have always been chary about but i had good reasons our expenses have been so prodigious for a year and a half and are still so prodigious that livy was worrying altogether too much about them and doing a very dangerous amount of lying awake on their account it was necessary to stop that and it is now stopped yes she is remarkable joe her rheumatic attack set me to cursing and swearing without limit as to time or energy but it merely concentrated her patience and her unconquerable fortitude it is the difference between us i cant count the different kinds of ailments which have assaulted her in this fiendish year and a half and i forgive none of them but here she comes up again as bright and fresh and enterprising as ever and goes to planning about egypt with a hope and a confidence which are to me amazing clara is calling for me we have to go into town and pay calls mark in florence that winter clemens began dictating to his secretary some autobiographical chapters this was the work which was not to see print until i am dead he found it a pleasant lazy occupation and wrote his delight in it to howells in a letter which seems not to have survived in his reply howells wrote you do stir me mightily with the hope of dictating and i will try it when i get the chance but there is the tempermental difference you are dramatic and unconscious you count the thing more than yourself i am cursed with consciousness to the core and cant say myself out i am always saying myself in and setting myself above all that i say as of more worth lately i have felt as if i were rotting with egotism i dont admire myself i am sick of myself but i cant think of anything else here i am at it now when i ought to be rejoicing with you at the blessing you have found id like immensely to read your autobiography you always rather bewildered me by your veracity and i fancy you may tell the truth about yourself but all of it the black truth which we all know of ourselves in our hearts or only the whitybrown truth of the pericardium or the nice whitened truth of the shirtfront even you wont tell the black hearts truth the man who could do it would be famed to the last day the sun shone upon we gather from mark twains answer that he was not deceiving himself in the matter of his confessions to w d howells in new york villa di quarto florence march dear howells yes i set up the safeguards in the first days dictating taking this position that an autobiography is the truest of all books for while it inevitably consists mainly of extinctions of the truth shirkings of the truth partial revealments of the truth with hardly an instance of plain straight truth the remorseless truth is there between the lines where the author is raking dust upon it the result being that the reader knows the author in spite of his wily diligences the summer in england you cant ask better luck than that then you will run over to florence we shall all be hungry to see youall we are hunting for another villa this one is plenty large enough but has no room in it but even if we find it i am afraid it will be months before we can move mrs clemens of course it will but it comforts us to let on that we think otherwise and these pretensions help to keep hope alive in her goodbye with love amen yours ever mark news came of the death of henry m stanley one of mark twains oldest friends clemens once said that he had met stanley in st louis where he clemens had delivered a lecture which stanley had reported in the following letter he fixes the date of their meeting as early in which would be immediately after mark twains return from california and just prior to the quaker city excursion a fact which is interesting only because it places the two men together when each was at the very beginning of a great career to lady stanley in england villa di quarto firenze may dear lady stanley i have lost a dear and honored friend how fast they fall about me now in my age the world has lost a tried and proved hero and you what have you lost it is beyond estimate we who know you and what he was to you know that how far he stretches across my life i knew him when his work was all before him five years before the great day that he wrote his name faraway up on the blue of the sky for the world to see and applaud and remember i have known him as friend and intimate ever since it is years i have known no other friend and intimate so long except john hay a friendship which dates from the same year and the same half of it the first half of i grieve with you and with your family dear lady stanley it is all i can do but that i do out of my heart it would be we instead of i if mrs clemens knew but in all these months that she has lain a prisoner in her bed we have hidden from her all things that could sadden her many a friend is gone whom she still asks about and still thinks is living in deepest sympathy i beg the privilege of signing myself your friend s l clemens to rev j h twichell in hartford villa di quarto may dear joe yours has this moment arrived just as i was finishing a note to poor lady stanley i believe the last countryhouse visit we paid in england was to stanleys lord how my friends and acquaintances fall about me now in my grayheaded days vereschagin mommsen dvorak lenbach jokai all so recently and now stanley i had known stanley years goodness who is it i havent known as a rule the necrologies find me personally interested when they treat of old stagers generally when a man dies who is worth cabling it happens that i have run across him somewhere some time or other oh say down by the laurentian library theres a marble image that has been sitting on its pedestal some years if my dates are right cosimo i ive seen the back of it many a time but not the front but yesterday i twisted my head around after we had driven by and the profane exclamation burst from my mouth before i could think theres chauncey depew i mean to get a photo of it and use it if it confirms yesterdays conviction thats a very nice word from the catholic magazine and i am glad you sent it i mean to show it to my priest we are very fond of him he is a stealing man and is also learnedly scientific he invented the thing which records the seismatic disturbances for the peoples of the earth and hes an astronomer and has an observatory of his own ah manys the cry i have over reflecting that maybe we could have had young harmony for livy and didnt have wit enough to think of it speaking of livy reminds me that your inquiry arrives at a good time unberufen it has been weeks i dont know how many since we could have said a hopeful word but this morning katy came the minute the daynurse came on watch and said words of a strange and longforgotten sound mr clemens mrs clemens is really and truly better anybody can see it she sees it herself and last night at oclock she said it there it is heartwarming it is splendid it is sublime let us enjoy it let us make the most of it today and bet not a farthing on tomorrow the tomorrows have nothing for us too many times they have breathed the word of promise to our ear and broken it to our hope we take no tomorrows word any more youve done a wonder joe youve written a letter that can be sent in to livy that doesnt often happen when either a friend or a stranger writes you did whirl in a p s that wouldnt do but you wrote it on a margin of a page in such a way that i was able to clip off the margin clear across both pages and now livy wont perceive that the sheet isnt the same size it used to was it was about aldrichs son and i came near forgetting to remove it it should have been written on a loose strip and enclosed that son died on the th of march and aldrich wrote me on the night before that his minutes were numbered on the th livy asked after that patient and i was prepared and able to give her a grateful surprise by telling her the aldriches are no longer uneasy about him i do wish i could have been present and heard charley clark when he cant light up a dark place nobody can with lots of love to you all mark mrs clemens had her bad days and her good daysdays when there seemed no ray of light and others that seemed almost to promise recovery the foregoing letter to twichell and the one which follows to richard watson gilder reflect the hope and fear that daily and hourly alternated at villa quarto to richard watson gilder in new york villa di quarto florence may dear gilder a friend of ours the baroness de nolda was here this afternoon and wanted a note of introduction to the century for she has something to sell to you in case youll want to make her an offer after seeing a sample of the goods i said with pleasure get the goods ready send the same to me i will have jean typewrite them then i will mail them to the century and tonight i will write the note to mr gilder and start it along also write me a letter embodying what you have been saying to me about the goods and your proposed plan of arranging and explaining them and i will forward that to gilder too as to the baroness she is a german years old was married at is very prettyindeed i might say very pretty has a lot of sons running up from seven to years old her husband is a russian they live half the time in russia and the other half in florence and supply population alternately to the one country and then to the other of course it is a family that speaks languages this occurs at their table i know it by experience it is babel come again the other day when no guests were present to keep order the tribes were all talking at once and languages were being traded in at last the littlest boy lost his temper and screamed out at the top of his voice with angry sobs mais vraiment io non capisco gar nichts the baroness is a little afraid of her english therefore she will write her remarks in french i said theres a plenty of translators in new york examine her samples and drop her a line for two entire days now we have not been anxious about mrs clemens unberufen after months of bedridden solitude and bodily misery she all of a sudden ceases to be a pallid shrunken shadow and looks bright and young and pretty she remains what she always was the most wonderful creature of fortitude patience endurance and recuperative power that ever was but ah dear it wont last this fiendish malady will play new treacheries upon her and i shall go back to my prayers again unutterable from any pulpit with love to you and yours s l c may am i have just paid one of my pair of permitted minutes visits per day to the sick room and found what i have learned to expect retrogression and that pathetic something in the eye which betrays the secret of a waning hope the year of the worlds fair had come and an invitation from gov francis of missouri came to mark twain in florence personally inviting him to attend the great celebration and carry off first prize we may believe that clemens felt little in the spirit of humor but to such an invitation he must send a cheerful even if disappointing answer to gov francis of missouri villa di quarto firenze may dear governor francis it has been a dear wish of mine to exhibit myself at the great fair and get a prize but circumstances beyond my control have interfered and i must remain in florence although i have never taken prizes anywhere else i used to take them at school in missouri half a century ago and i ought to be able to repeat now if i could have a chance i used to get the medal for good spelling every week and i could have had the medal for good conduct if there hadnt been so much curruption in missouri in those days still i got it several times by trading medals and giving boot i am willing to give boot now if however those days are forever gone by in missouri and perhaps it is better so nothing ever stops the way it was in this changeable world although i cannot be at the fair i am going to be represented there anyway by a portrait by professor gelli you will find it excellent good judges here say it is better than the original they say it has all the merits of the original and keeps still besides it sounds like flattery but it is just true i suppose you will get a prize because you have created the most prodigious and in all ways most wonderful fair the planet has ever seen very well you have indeed earned it and with it the gratitude of the state and the nation sincerely yours mark twain it was only a few days after the foregoing was written that death entered villa quarto unexpectedly at last for with the first june days mrs clemens had seemed really to improve it was on sunday june th that the end came clemens with his daughter jean had returned from a long drive during which they had visited a villa with the thought of purchase on their return they were told that their patient had been better that afternoon than for three months yet it was only a few hours later that she left them so suddenly and quietly that even those near her did not at first realize that she was gone to w d howells in new york villa di quarto florence june dear howells last night at i entered mrs clemenss room to say the usual goodnight and she was dead tho no one knew it she had been cheerfully talking a moment before she was sitting up in bed she had not lain down for months and katie and the nurse were supporting her they supposed she had fainted and they were holding the oxygen pipe to her mouth expecting to revive her i bent over her and looked in her face and i think i spoke i was surprised and troubled that she did not notice me then we understood and our hearts broke how poor we are today but how thankful i am that her persecutions are ended i would not call her back if i could today treasured in her worn old testament i found a dear and gentle letter from you dated far rockaway sept about our poor susys death i am tired and old i wish i were with livy i send my loveand hersto you all s l c in a letter to twichell he wrote how sweet she was in death how young how beautiful how like her dear girlish self cf thirty years ago not a gray hair showing the family was now without plans for the future until they remembered the summer home of r w gilder at tyringham massachusetts and the possibility of finding lodgment for themselves in that secluded corner of new england clemens wrote without delay as follows to r w gilder in new york villa di quarto florence june dear gilder family i have been worrying and worrying to know what to do at last i went to the girls with an idea to ask the gilders to get us shelter near their summer home it was the first time they have not shaken their heads so tomorrow i will cable to you and shall hope to be in time an hour ago the best heart that ever beat for me and mine went silent out of this house and i am as one who wanders and has lost his way she who is gone was our head she was our hands we are now trying to make plans we we who have never made a plan before nor ever needed to if she could speak to us she would make it all simple and easy with a word and our perplexities would vanish away if she had known she was near to death she would have told us where to go and what to do but she was not suspecting neither were we she had been chatting cheerfully a moment before and in an instant she was gone from us and we did not know it we were not alarmed we did not know anything had happened it was a blessed death she passed away without knowing it she was all our riches and she is gone she was our breath she was our life and now we are nothing we send you our love and with it the love of you that was in her heart when she died s l clemens howells wrote his words of sympathy adding the character which now remains a memory was one of the most perfect ever formed on the earth and again after having received clemenss letter i cannot speak of your wifes having kept that letter of mine where she did you know how it must humiliate a man in his unworthiness to have anything of his so consecrated she hallowed what she touched far beyond priests to w d howells in new york villa di quarto june p m dear howells we have to sit and hold our hands and wait in the silence and solitude of this prodigious house wait until june then we go to naples and sail in the prince oscar the th there is a ship days earlier but we came in that one i see clara twice a day morning and evening greeting nothing more is allowed she keeps her bed and says nothing she has not cried yet i wish she could cry it would break livys heart to see clara we excuse ourselves from all the friends that call though of course only intimates come intimates but they are not the old old friends the friends of the old old times when we laughed shall we ever laugh again if i could only see a dog that i knew in the old times and could put my arms around his neck and tell him all everything and ease my heart thinkin hours it will be a week and soon a month and by and by a year how fast our dead fly from us she loved you so and was always as pleased as a child with any notice you took of her soon your wife will be with you oh fortunate man and john whom mine was so fond of the sight of him was such a delight to her lord the old friends how dear they are s l c to rev j r twichell in hartford villa di quarto florence june dear joe it is days i am bewildered and must remain so for a time longer it was so sudden so unexpected imagine a man worth a hundred millions who finds himself suddenly penniless and fifty million in debt in his old age i was richer than any other person in the world and now i am that pauper without peer some day i will tell you about it not now mark a tide of condolence flowed in from all parts of the world it was impossible to answer all only a few who had been their closest friends received a written line but the little printed acknowledgment which was returned was no mere formality it was a heartfelt personal word they arrived in america in july and were accompanied by twichell to elmira and on the th mrs clemens was laid to rest by the side of susy and little langdon r w gilder had arranged for them to occupy for the summer a cottage on his place at tyringham in the berkshire hills by november they were at the grosvenor in new york preparing to establish themselves in a house which they had taken on the corner of ninth street and fifth avenue number to f n doubleday in new york dear doubleday i did not know you were going to england i would have freighted you with such messages of homage and affection to kipling and i would have pressed his hand through you for his sympathy with me in my crushing loss as expressed by him in his letter to gilder you know my feeling for kipling and that it antedates that expression i was glad that the boys came here to invite me to the housewarming and i think they understood why a man in the shadow of a calamity like mine could not go it has taken three months to repair and renovate our house corner of th and th avenue but i shall be in it in io or days hence much of the furniture went into it today from hartford we have not seen it for years katy leary our old housekeeper who has been in our service more than years cried when she told me about it today she said i had forgotten it was so beautiful and it brought mrs clemens right back to me in that old time when she was so young and lovely jean and my secretary and the servants whom we brought from italy because mrs clemens liked them so well are still keeping house in the berkshire hills and waiting clara nervously wrecked by her mothers death is in the hands of a specialist in th st and i shall not be allowed to have any communication with her even telephone for a year i am in this comfortable little hotel and still in bed for i dasnt budge till im safe from my pet devil bronchitis isnt it pathetic one hour and ten minutes before mrs clemens died i was saying to her today after five months search ive found the villa that will content you tomorrow you will examine the plans and give it your consent and i will buy it her eyes danced with pleasure for she longed for a home of her own and there on that morrow she lay white and cold and unresponsive to my reverent caresses a new thing to me and a new thing to her that had not happened before in five and thirty years i am coming to see you and mrs doubleday by and bye she loved and honored mrs doubleday and her work always yours mark it was a presidential year and the air was thick with politics mark twain was no longer actively interested in the political situation he was only disheartened by the hollowness and pretense of officeseeking and the methods of officeseekers in general grieved that twichell should still pin his faith to any party when all parties were so obviously venal and timeserving he wrote in outspoken and rather somber protest to rev j h twichell in hartford the grosvenor nov oh dear get out of that sewer party politics dear joe at least with your mouth we hail only two men who could make speeches for their parties and preserve their honor and their dignity one of them is dead possibly there were four i am sorry for john hay sorry and ashamed and yet i know he couldnt help it he wears the collar and he had to pay the penalty certainly he had no more desire to stand up before a mob of confiding human incapables and debauch them than you had certainly he took no more real pleasure in distorting history concealing facts propagating immoralities and appealing to the sordid side of human nature than did you but he was his partys property and he had to climb away down and do it it is interesting wonderfully interesting the miracles which partypolitics can do with a mans mental and moral makeup look at mckinley roosevelt and yourself in private life spotless in character honorable honest just humane generous scorning trickeries treacheries suppressions of the truth mistranslations of the meanings of facts the filching of credit earned by another the condoning of crime the glorifying of base acts in public political life the reverse of all this mckinley was a silverite you concealed it roosevelt was a silverite you concealed it parker was a silverite you publish it along with a shudder and a warning he was unsafe then is he any safer now joe even i could be guilty of such a thing as that if i were in partypolitics i really believe it mr cleveland gave the country the gold standard by implication you credit the matter to the republican party by implication you prove the whole annual pensionscoop concealing the fact that the bulk of the money goes to people who in no way deserve it you imply that all the batteners upon this briberyfund are republicans an indiscreet confession since about half of them must have been democrats before they were bought you as good as praise order it is true you do not shout and you do not linger you only whisper and skip still what little you do in the matter is complimentary to the crime it means if it means anything that our outlying properties will all be given up by the democrats and our flag hauled down all of them not only the properties stolen by mr mckinley and mr roosevelt but the properties honestly acquired joe did you believe that hardy statement when you made it yet you made it and there it stands in permanent print now what moral law would suffer if we should give up the stolen ones but you know our standardbearer he will maintain all that we have gained by whatever process land i believe you by george joe you are as handy at the game as if you had been in training for it all your life your campaign address is built from the ground up upon the oldest and best models there isnt a paragraph in it whose facts or morals will wash not even a sentence i believe but you will soon be out of this you didnt want to do it that is sufficiently apparent thanks be but you couldnt well get out of it in a few days you will be out of it and then you can fumigate yourself and take up your legitimate work again and resume your clean and wholesome private character once more and be happy and useful i know i ought to hand you some guff now as propitiation and apology for these reproaches but on the whole i believe i wont i have inquired and find that mitsikuri does not arrive here until tomorrow night i shall watch out and telephone again for i greatly want to see him always yours mark p s nov i wish i could learn to remember that it is unjust and dishonorable to put blame upon the human race for any of its acts for it did not make itself it did not make its nature it is merely a machine it is moved wholly by outside influences it has no hand in creating the outside influences nor in choosing which of them it will welcome or reject its performance is wholly automatic it has no more mastership nor authority over its mind than it has over its stomach which receives material from the outside and does as it pleases with it indifferent to its proprietors suggestions even let alone his commands wherefore whatever the machine does so called crimes and infamies included is the personal act of its maker and he solely is responsible i wish i could learn to pity the human race instead of censuring it and laughing at it and i could if the outside influences of old habit were not so strong upon my machine it vexes me to catch myself praising the clean private citizen roosevelt and blaming the soiled president roosevelt when i know that neither praise nor blame is due to him for any thought or word or deed of his he being merely a helpless and irresponsible coffeemill ground by the hand of god through a misunderstanding clemens something more than a year earlier had severed his connection with the players club of which he had been one of the charter members now upon his return to new york a number of his friends joined in an invitation to him to return it was not exactly a letter they sent but a bit of an old scotch song to mark twain from the clansmen will ye no come back again will ye no come back again better loed ye canna be will ye no come back again those who signed it were david monroe of the north american review robert reid the painter and about thirty others of the round table group so called because its members were accustomed to lunching at a large round table in a bay window of the player diningroom mark twains reply was prompt and heartfelt he wrote to robt reid and the others wellbeloved surely those lovely verses went to prince charleys heart if he had one and certainly they have gone to mine i shall be glad and proud to come back again after such a moving and beautiful compliment as this from comrades whom i have loved so long i hope you can poll the necessary vote i know you will try at any rate it will be many months before i can foregather with you for this black border is not perfunctory not a convention it symbolizes the loss of one whose memory is the only thing i worship it is not necessary for me to thank you and words could not deliver what i feel anyway i will put the contents of your envelope in the small casket where i keep the things which have become sacred to me s l c a year later mark twain did come back again as an honorary life member and was given a dinner of welcome by those who had signed the lines urging his return xliv letters of to twichell mr duneka and others politics and humanity a summer at dublin mark twain at in mark twain had abandoned the republican party to vote for cleveland he believed the party had become corrupt and to his last day it was hard for him to see anything good in republican policies or performance he was a personal friend of thedore roosevelts but as we have seen in a former letter roosevelt the politician rarely found favor in his eyes with or without justification most of the presidents political acts invited his caustic sarcasm and unsparing condemnation another letter to twichell of this time affords a fair example to rev j h twichell in hartford feb dear joe i knew i had in me somewhere a definite feeling about the president if i could only find the words to define it with here they are to a hair from leonard jerome for twenty years i have loved roosevelt the man and hated roosevelt the statesman and politician its mighty good every time in years that i have met roosevelt the man a wave of welcome has streaked through me with the handgrip but whenever as a rule i meet roosevelt the statesman and politician i find him destitute of morals and not respectworthy it is plain that where his political self and his party self are concerned he has nothing resembling a conscience that under those inspirations he is naively indifferent to the restraints of duty and even unaware of them ready to kick the constitution into the back yard whenever it gets in the way and whenever he smells a vote not only willing but eager to buy it give extravagant rates for it and pay the bill not out of his own pocket or the partys but out of the nations by cold pillage as per order and the appropriation of the indian trust funds but roosevelt is excusable i recognize it and ought to concede it we are all insane each in his own way and with insanity goes irresponsibility theodore the man is sane in fairness we ought to keep in mind that theodore as statesman arid politician is insane and irresponsible do not throw these enlightenments aside but study them let them raise you to higher planes and make you better you taught me in my callow days let me pay back the debt now in my old age out of a thesaurus with wisdom smelted from the golden ores of experience ever yours for sweetness and light mark the next letter to twichell takes up politics and humanity in general in a manner complimentary to neither mark twain was never really a pessimist but he had pessimistic intervals such as come to most of us in lifes later years and at such times he let himself go without stint concerning the damned human race as he called it usually with a manifest sense of indignation that he should be a member of it in much of his later writing a mysterious stranger for example he said his say with but small restraint and certainly in his purely intellectual moments he was likely to be a pessimist of the most extreme type capably damning the race and the inventor of it yet at heart no man loved his kind more genuinely or with deeper compassion than mark twain perhaps for its very weaknesses it was only that he had intervals frequent intervals and rather long ones when he did not admire it and was still more doubtful as to the ways of providence to rev j h twichell in hartford march dear joe i have a puddnhead maxim when a man is a pessimist before he knows too much if he is an optimist after it he knows too little it is with contentment therefore that i reflect that i am better and wiser than you joe you seem to be dealing in bulks now the bulk of the farmers and u s senators are honest as regards purchase and sale with money who doubts it is that the only measure of honesty arent there a dozen kinds of honesty which cant be measured by the moneystandard treason is treason and theres more than one form of it the moneyform is but one of them when a person is disloyal to any confessed duty he is plainly and simply dishonest and knows it knows it and is privately troubled about it and not proud of himself judged by this standard and who will challenge the validity of it there isnt an honest man in connecticut nor in the senate nor anywhere else i do not even except myself this time am i finding fault with you and the rest of the populace no i assure you i am not for i know the human races limitations and this makes it my duty my pleasant duty to be fair to it each person in it is honest in one or several ways but no member of it is honest in all the ways required by by what by his own standard outside of that as i look at it there is no obligation upon him am i honest i give you my word of honor private i am not for seven years i have suppressed a book which my conscience tells me i ought to publish i hold it a duty to publish it there are other difficult duties which i am equal to but i am not equal to that one yes even i am dishonest not in many ways but in some fortyone i think it is we are certainly all honest in one or several ways every man in the world though i have reason to think i am the only one whose blacklist runs so light sometimes i feel lonely enough in this lofty solitude yes oh yes i am not overlooking the steady progress from age to age of the coming of the kingdom of god and righteousness from age to age yes it describes that giddy gait i and the rocks will not live to see it arrive but that is all right it will arrive it surely will but you ought not to be always ironically apologizing for the deity if that thing is going to arrive it is inferable that he wants it to arrive and so it is not quite kind of you and it hurts me to see you flinging sarcasms at the gait of it and yet it would not be fair in me not to admit that the sarcasms are deserved when the deity wants a thing and after working at it for ages and ages cant show even a shade of progress toward its accomplishment we well we dont laugh but it is only because we dasnt the source of righteousness is in the heart yes and engineered and directed by the brain yes well history and tradition testify that the heart is just about what it was in the beginning it has undergone no shade of change its good and evil impulses and their consequences are the same today that they were in old bible times in egyptian times in greek times in middle age times in twentieth century times there has been no change meantime the brain has undergone no change it is what it always was there are a few good brains and a multitude of poor ones it was so in old bible times and in all other times greek roman middle ages and twentieth century among the savages all the savages the average brain is as competent as the average brain here or elsewhere i will prove it to you some time if you like and there are great brains among them too i will prove that also if you like well the th century made progress the first progress after ages and ages colossal progress in what materialities prodigious acquisitions were made in things which add to the comfort of many and make life harder for as many more but the addition to righteousness is that discoverable i think not the materialities were not invented in the interest of righteousness that there is more righteousness in the world because of them than there was before is hardly demonstrable i think in europe and america there is a vast change due to them in ideals do you admire it all europe and all america are feverishly scrambling for money money is the supreme ideal all others take tenth place with the great bulk of the nations named moneylust has always existed but not in the history of the world was it ever a craze a madness until your time and mine this lust has rotted these nations it has made them hard sordid ungentle dishonest oppressive did england rise against the infamy of the boer war no rose in favor of it did america rise against the infamy of the phillipine war no rose in favor of it did russia rise against the infamy of the present war no sat still and said nothing has the kingdom of god advanced in russia since the beginning of time or in europe and america considering the vast backward step of the moneylust or anywhere else if there has been any progress toward righteousness since the early days of creation which in my ineradicable honesty i am obliged to doubt i think we must confine it to ten per cent of the populations of christendom but leaving russia spain and south america entirely out this gives us to draw the ten per cent from that is to say have advanced toward righteousness and the kingdom of god since the ages and ages have been flying along the deity sitting up there admiring well you see it leaves out of the race they stand just where they have always stood there has been no change n b no charge for these informations do come down soon joe with love mark st clair mckelway of the brooklyn eagle narrowly escaped injuries in a railway accident and received the following clemens and mckelway were old friends to st clair mckelway in brooklyn fifth ave sunday morning april dear mckelway your innumerable friends are grateful most grateful as i understand the telegrams the engineer of your train had never seen a locomotive before very well then i am once more glad that there is an everwatchful providence to foresee possible results and send ogdens and mcintyres along to save our friends the governments official report showing that our railways killed twelve hundred persons last year and injured sixty thousand convinces me that under present conditions one providence is not enough to properly and efficiently take care of our railroad business but it is characteristically american always trying to get along shorthanded and save wages i am helping your family congratulate themselves and am your friend as always s l clemens clemens did not spend any more summers at quarry farm all its associations were beautiful and tender but they could only sadden him the life there had been as of another world sunlit idyllic now forever vanished for the summer of he leased the copley green house at dublin new hampshire where there was a boston colony of writing and artistic folk including many of his longtime friends among them was colonel thomas wentworth higginson who wrote a hearty letter of welcome when he heard the news clemens replied in kind to col thomas wentworth higginson in boston fifth ave sunday march zo dear col higginson i early learned that you would be my neighbor in the summer and i rejoiced recognizing in you and your family a large asset i hope for frequent intercourse between the two households i shall have my youngest daughter with me the other one will go from the restcure in this city to the restcure in norfolk conn and we shall not see her before autumn we have not seen her since the middle of october jean the youngest daughter went to dublin and saw the house and came back charmed with it i know the thayers of old manifestly there is no lack of attractions up there mrs thayer and i were shipmates in a wild excursion perilously near years ago you say you send with this the story then it should be here but it isnt when i send a thing with another thing the other thing goes but the thing doesnt i find it later still on the premises will you look it up now and send it aldrich was here half an hour ago like a breeze from over the fields with the fragrance still upon his spirit i am tired of waiting for that man to get old sincerely yours s l c mark twain was in his seventieth year old neither in mind nor body but willing to take life more quietly to refrain from travel and gay events a sort of pioneers reunion was to be held on the pacific coast and a letter from robert fulton of reno nevada invited clemens to attend he did not go but he sent a letter that we may believe was the next best thing to those who heard it read to robert fulton in reno nevada in the mountains may dear mr fulton i remember as if it were yesterday that when i disembarked from the overland stage in front of the ormsby in carson city in august i was not expecting to be asked to come again i was tired discouraged white with alkali dust and did not know anybody and if you had said then cheer up desolate stranger dont be downhearted pass on and come again in you cannot think how grateful i would have been and how gladly i would have closed the contract although i was not expecting to be invited i was watching out for it and was hurt and disappointed when you started to ask me and changed it to how soon are you going away but you have made it all right now the wound is closed and so i thank you sincerely for the invitation and with you all reno and if i were a few years younger i would accept it and promptly i would go i would let somebody else do the oration but as for me i would talk just talk i would renew my youth and talk and talk and talk and have the time of my life i would march the unforgotten and unforgettable antiques by and name their names and give them reverent hailandfarewell as they passed goodman mccarthy gillis curry baldwin winters howard nye stewart neely johnson hal clayton north root and my brother upon whom be peace and then the desperadoes who made life a joy and the slaughterhouse a precious possession sam brown farmer pete bill mayfield sixfingered jake jack williams and the rest of the crimson discipleship and so on and so on believe me i would start a resurrection it would do you more good to look at than the next one will if you go on the way you are doing now those were the days those old ones they will come no more youth will come no more they were so full to the brim with the wine of life there have been no others like them it chokes me up to think of them would you like me to come out there and cry it would not beseem my white head goodbye i drink to you all have a good time and take an old mans blessing mark twain a few days later he was writing to h h bancroft of san francisco who had invited him for a visit in event of his coming to the coast henry james had just been there for a week and it was hoped that howells would soon follow to h h bancroft in san francisco up in new hampshire may dear mr bancroft i thank you sincerely for the tempting hospitalities which you offer me but i have to deny myself for my wandering days are over and it is my desire and purpose to sit by the fire the rest of my remnant of life and indulge myself with the pleasure and repose of work work uninterrupted and unmarred by duties or excursions a man who like me is going to strike on the th of next november has no business to be flitting around the way howells does that shameless old fictitious butter fly but if he comes dont tell him i said it for it would hurt him and i wouldnt brush a flake of powder from his wing for anything i only say it in envy of his indestructible youth anyway howells will be in october with thanks again sincerely yours s l c clemens found that the air of the new hampshire hills agreed with him and stimulated him to work he began an entirely new version of the mysterious stranger of which he already had a bulky and nearly finished manuscript written in vienna he wrote several hundred pages of an extravaganza entitled three thousand years among the microbes and then having got his superabundant vitality reduced it was likely to expend itself in these weird mental exploits he settled down one day and wrote that really tender and beautiful idyl eves diary which he had begun or at least planned the previous summer at tyringham in a letter to mr frederick a duneka general manager of harper brothers he tells something of the manner of the story also his revised opinion of adams diary written in and originally published as a souvenir of niagara falls to frederick a duneka in new york dublin july dear mr duneka i wrote eves diary she using adams diary as her unwitting and unconscious text of course since to use any other text would have been an imbecility then i took adams diary and read it it turned my stomach it was not literature yet it had been literature once before i sold it to be degraded to an advertisement of the buffalo fair i was going to write and ask you to melt the plates and put it out of print but this morning i examined it without temper and saw that if i abolished the advertisement it would be literature again so i have done it i have struck out words and inserted ms pages of new matter words and now adams diary is dam good sixty times as good as it ever was before i believe it is as good as eves diary now no its not quite that good i guess but it is good enough to go in the same cover with eves im sure of that i hate to have the old adam go out any more dont put it on the presses again lets put the new one in place of it and next xmas let us bind adam and eve in one cover they score points against each other so if not bound together some of the points would not be perceived p s please send another adams diary so that i can make revised copies eves diary is eves lovestory but we will not name it that yrs ever mark the peacemaking at portsmouth between japan and russia was not satisfactory to mark twain who had fondly hoped there would be no peace until as he said russian liberty was safe one more battle would have abolished the waiting chains of millions upon millions of unborn russians and i wish it could have been fought he set down an expression of his feelings for the associated press and it invited many letters charles francis adams wrote it attracted my attention because it so exactly expresses the views i have myself all along entertained clemens was invited by colonel george harvey to dine with the russian emissaries baron rosen and sergius witte he declined but his telegram so pleased witte that he asked permission to publish it and announced that he would show it to the czar telegram to col george harvey in new york to colonel harvey i am still a cripple otherwise i should be more than glad of this opportunity to meet the illustrious magicians who came here equipped with nothing but a pen and with it have divided the honors of the war with the sword it is fair to presume that in thirty centuries history will not get done admiring these men who attempted what the world regarded as impossible and achieved it witte would not have cared to show the czar the telegram in its original form which follows telegram unsent to col george harvey in new york to colonel harvey i am still a cripple otherwise i should be more than glad of this opportunity to meet those illustrious magicians who with the pen have annulled obliterated and abolished every high achievement of the japanese sword and turned the tragedy of a tremendous war into a gay and blithesome comedy if i may let me in all respect and honor salute them as my fellowhumorists i taking third place as becomes one who was not born to modesty but by diligence and hard work is acquiring it mark nor still another unsent form perhaps more characteristic than either of the foregoing telegram unsent to col george harvey in new york dear colonel no this is a lovefeast when you call a lodge of sorrow send for me mark to mrs crane quarry farm dublin sept susy dear i have had a lovely dream livy dressed in black was sitting up in my bed here at my right and looking as young and sweet as she used to do when she was in health she said what is the name of your sweet sister i said pamela oh yes that is it i thought it was naming a name which has escaped me wont you write it down for me i reached eagerly for a pen and pad laid my hands upon both then said to myself it is only a dream and turned back sorrowfully and there she was still the conviction flamed through me that our lamented disaster was a dream and this a reality i said how blessed it is how blessed it is it was all a dream only a dream she only smiled and did not ask what dream i meant which surprised me she leaned her head against mine and i kept saying i was perfectly sure it was a dream i never would have believed it wasnt i think she said several things but if so they are gone from my memory i woke and did not know i had been dreaming she was gone i wondered how she could go without my knowing it but i did not spend any thought upon that i was too busy thinking of how vivid and real was the dream that we had lost her and how unspeakably blessed it was to find that it was not true and that she was still ours and with us s l c one day that summer mark twain received a letter from the actress minnie maddern fiske asking him to write something that would aid her in her crusade against bullfighting the idea appealed to him he replied at once to mrs fiske dear mrs fiske i shall certainly write the story but i may not get it to suit me in which case it will go in the fire later i will try again and yet again and again i am used to this it has taken me twelve years to write a short story the shortest one i ever wrote i think probably the death disk so do not be discouraged i will stick to this one in the same way sincerely yours s l clemens he did not delay in his beginning and a few weeks later was sending word to his publisher about it to frederick a duneka in new york oct dear mr duneka i have just finished a short story which i greatly admire and so will you a horses tale about words at a rough guess it has good fun in it and several characters and is lively i shall finish revising it in a few days or more then jean will type it dont you think you can get it into the jan and feb numbers and issue it as a dollar booklet just after the middle of jan when you issue the feb number it ought to be ably illustrated why not sell simultaneous rights for this once to the ladies home journal or colliers or both and recoup yourself for i would like to get it to classes that cant afford harpers although it doesnt preach theres a sermon concealed in it yr sincerely mark five days later he added some rather interesting facts concerning the new story to f a duneka in new york oct dear mr duneka ive made a poor guess as to number of words i think there must be my usual page of ms contains about words but when i am deeply interested in my work and dead to everything else my handwriting shrinks and shrinks until theres a great deal more than on a page oh yes a deal more well i discover this morning that this tale is written in that small hand this strong interest is natural for the heroine is my daughter susy whom we lost it was not intentional it was a good while before i found it out so i am sending you her picture to use and to reproduce with photographic exactness the unsurpassable expression and all may you find an artist who has lost an idol take as good care of the picture as you can and restore it to me when i come i hope you will illustrate this tale considerably not humorous pictures no when they are good or bad ones humor gets no chance to play surprises on the reader a humorous subject illustrated seriously is all right but a humorous artist is no fit person for such work you see the humorous writer pretends to absolute seriousness when he knows his trade then for an artist to step in and give his calculated gravity all away with a funny picture oh my land it gives me the dry gripes just to think of it it would be just about up to the average comic artists intellectual level to make a funny picture of the horse kicking the lungs out of a trader hang it the remark is funny because the horse is not aware of it but the fact is not humorous it is tragic and it is no subject for a humorous picture could i be allowed to sit in judgment upon the pictures before they are accepted at least those in which cathy may figure this is not essential it is but a suggestion and it is hereby withdrawn if it would be troublesome or cause delay i hope you will reproduce the catpile full page and save the photo for me in as good condition as possible when susy and clara were little tots those cats had their profoundest worship and there is no duplicate of this picture these cats all had thundering names or inappropriate ones furnished by the children with my help one was named buffalo bill are you interested in coincidences after discovering about the middle of the book that cathy was susy clemens i put her picture with my ms to be reproduced after the book was finished it was discovered that susy had a dim model of soldier boy in her arms i had forgotten all about that toy then i examined the catpicture and laid it with the ms for introduction but it was not until yesterday that i remembered that one of the cats was named buffalo bill sincerely yours mark the reference in this letter to shrinkage of his handwriting with the increasing intensity of his interest and the consequent addition of the number of words to the page recalls another fact noted by mr duneka viz that because of his terse anglosaxon diction mark twain could put more words on a magazine page than any other writer it is hardly necessary to add that he got more force into what he put on the page for the same reason there was always a run of reporters at mark twains new york home his opinion was sought for on every matter of public interest and whatever happened to him in particular was considered good for at least half a column of copy with his name as a catchline at the top when it was learned that he was to spend the summer in new hampshire the reporters had all wanted to find out about it now that the summer was ending they began to want to know how he had liked it what work he had done and what were his plans for another year as they frequently applied to his publishers for these details it was finally suggested to him that he write a letter furnishing the required information his reply handed to mr duneka who was visiting him at the moment is full of interest mem for mr duneka dublin oct as to the other matters here are the details yes i have tried a number of summer homes here and in europe together each of these homes had charms of its own charms and delights of its own and some of them even in europe had comforts several of them had conveniences too they all had a view it is my conviction that there should always be some water in a view a lake or a river but not the ocean if you are down on its level i think that when you are down on its level it seldom inflames you with an ecstasy which you could not get out of a sandflat it is like being on board ship over again indeed it is worse than that for theres three months of it on board ship one tires of the aspects in a couple of days and quits looking the same vast circle of heaving humps is spread around you all the time with you in the centre of it and never gaining an inch on the horizon so far as you can see for variety a flight of flyingfish mornings a flock of porpoises throwing summersaults afternoons a remote whale spouting sundays occasional phosphorescent effects nights every other day a streak of black smoke trailing along under the horizon on the one single red letter day the illustrious iceberg i have seen that iceberg thirtyfour times in thirtyseven voyages it is always the same shape it is always the same size it always throws up the same old flash when the sun strikes it you may set it on any new york doorstep of a june morning and light it up with a mirrorflash and i will engage to recognize it it is artificial and it is provided and anchored out by the steamer companies i used to like the sea but i was young then and could easily get excited over any kind of monotony and keep it up till the monotonies ran out if it was a fortnight last january when we were beginning to inquire about a home for this summer i remembered that abbott thayer had said three years before that the new hampshire highlands was a good place he was right it was a good place any place that is good for an artist in paint is good for an artist in morals and ink brush is here too so is col t w higginson so is raphael pumpelly so is mr secretary hitchcock so is henderson so is learned so is summer so is franklin macveigh so is joseph l smith so is henry copley greene when i am not occupying his house which i am doing this season paint literature science statesmanship history professorship law morals these are all represented here yet crime is substantially unknown the summer homes of these refugees are sprinkled a mile apart among the forestclad hills with access to each other by firm smooth country roads which are so embowered in dense foliage that it is always twilight in there and comfortable the forests are spiderwebbed with these good roads they go everywhere but for the help of the guideboards the stranger would not arrive anywhere the village dublin is bunched together in its own place but a good telephone service makes its markets handy to all those outliars i have spelt it that way to be witty the village executes orders on the boston plan promptness and courtesy the summer homes are highperched as a rule and have contenting outlooks the house we occupy has one monadnock a soaring double hump rises into the sky at its left elbow that is to say it is close at hand from the base of the long slant of the mountain the valley spreads away to the circling frame of the hills and beyond the frame the billowy sweep of remote great ranges rises to view and flows fold upon fold wave upon wave soft and blue and unwordly to the horizon fifty miles away in these october days monadnock and the valley and its framing hills make an inspiring picture to look at for they are sumptuously splashed and mottled and betorched from skyline to skyline with the richest dyes the autumn can furnish and when they lie flaming in the full drench of the midafternoon sun the sight affects the spectator physically it stirs his blood like military music these summer homes are commodious well built and well furnished facts which sufficiently indicate that the owners built them to live in themselves they have furnaces and wood fireplaces and the rest of the comforts and conveniences of a city home and can be comfortably occupied all the year round we cannot have this house next season but i have secured mrs uptons house which is over in the law and science quarter two or three miles from here and about the same distance from the art literary and scholastic groups the science and law quarter has needed improving this good while the nearest railwaystation is distant something like an hours drive it is three hours from there to boston over a branch line you can go to new york in six hours per branch lines if you change cars every time you think of it but it is better to go to boston and stop over and take the trunk line next day then you do not get lost it is claimed that the atmosphere of the new hampshire highlands is exceptionally bracing and stimulating and a fine aid to hard and continuous work it is a just claim i think i came in may and wrought successive days without a break it is possible that i could not have done it elsewhere i do not know i have not had any disposition to try it before i think i got the disposition out of the atmosphere this time i feel quite sure in fact that that is where it came from i am ashamed to confess what an intolerable pile of manuscript i ground out in the days therefore i will keep the number of words to myself i wrote the first half of a long tale the adventures of a microbe and put it away for a finish next summer and started another long tale the mysterious stranger i wrote the first half of it and put it with the other for a finish next summer i stopped then i was not tired but i had no books on hand that needed finishing this year except one that was seven years old after a little i took that one up and finished it not for publication but to have it ready for revision next summer since i stopped work i have had a two months holiday the summer has been my working time for years to have a holiday in it in america is new for me i have not broken it except to write eves diary and a horses tale short things occupying the mill days this year our summer is months long and ends with november and the flight home to new york but next year we hope and expect to stretch it another month and end it the first of december no signature the fact that he was a persistent smoker was widely known and many friends and admirers of mark twain sent him cigars most of which he could not use because they were too good he did not care for havana cigars but smoked the fragrant inexpensive domestic tobacco with plenty of pep in it as we say today now and then he had an opportunity to head off some liberal friend who wrote asking permission to contribute to his cigar collection as instance the following to rev l m powers in haverhill mass nov dear mr powers i should accept your hospitable offer at once but for the fact i couldnt do it and remain honest that is to say if i allowed you to send me what you believe to be good cigars it would distinctly mean that i meant to smoke them whereas i should do nothing of the kind i know a good cigar better than you do for i have had years experience no that is not what i mean i mean i know a bad cigar better than anybody else i judge by the price only if it costs above cents i know it to be either foreign or halfforeign and unsmokeable by me i have many boxes of havana cigars of all prices from cts apiece up to apiece i bought none of them they were all presents they are an accumulation of several years i have never smoked one of them and never shall i work them off on the visitor you shall have a chance when you come pessimists are born not made optimists are born not made but no man is born either pessimist wholly or optimist wholly perhaps he is pessimistic along certain lines and optimistic along certain others that is my case sincerely yours s l clemens in spite of all the fine photographs that were made of him there recurred constantly among those sent him to be autographed a print of one which years before sarony had made and placed on public sale it was a good photograph mechanically and even artistically but it did not please mark twain whenever he saw it he recalled sarony with bitterness and severity once he received an inquiry concerning it and thus feelingly expressed himself to mr row no address fifth avenue new york november dear mr row that alleged portrait has a private history sarony was as much of an enthusiast about wild animals as he was about photography and when du chaillu brought the first gorilla to this country in he came to me in a fever of excitement and asked me if my father was of record and authentic i said he was then sarony without any abatement of his excitement asked if my grandfather also was of record and authentic i said he was then sarony with still rising excitement and with joy added to it said he had found my great grandfather in the person of the gorilla and had recognized him at once by his resemblance to me i was deeply hurt but did not reveal this because i knew saxony meant no offense for the gorilla had not done him any harm and he was not a man who would say an unkind thing about a gorilla wantonly i went with him to inspect the ancestor and examined him from several points of view without being able to detect anything more than a passing resemblance wait said sarony with confidence let me show you he borrowed my overcoat and put it on the gorilla the result was surprising i saw that the gorilla while not looking distinctly like me was exactly what my great grand father would have looked like if i had had one sarong photographed the creature in that overcoat and spread the picture about the world it has remained spread about the world ever since it turns up every week in some newspaper somewhere or other it is not my favorite but to my exasperation it is everybody elses do you think you could get it suppressed for me i will pay the limit sincerely yours s l clemens the year closed triumphantly for mark twain the great seventieth birthday dinner planned by colonel george harvey is remembered today as the most notable festival occasion in new york literary history other dinners and ovations followed at seventy he had returned to the world more beloved more honored than ever before xlv letters to various persons the farewell lecture a second summer in dublin billiards and copyright mark twain at pier seventy as he called it paused to look backward and to record some memoirs of his long eventful past the autobiography dictations begun in florence were resumed and daily he traveled back recalling longago scenes and allbutforgotten places he was not without reminders now and again there came some message that brought back the old days the tom sawyer and huck finn days or the romance of the river that he never recalled other than with tenderness and a tone of regret that it was gone an invitation to the golden wedding of two ancient friends moved and saddened him and his answer to it conveys about all the story of life to mr and mrs gordon fifth avenue jan dear gordons i have just received your goldenwedding at home and am trying to adjust my focus to it and realize how much it means it is inconceivable with a simple sweep it carries me back over a stretch of time measurable only in astronomical terms and geological periods it brings before me mrs gordon young roundlimbed handsome and with her the youngbloods and their two babies and laura wright that unspoiled little maid that fresh flower of the woods and the prairies fortyeight years ago life was a fairytale then it is a tragedy now when i was and john hay he said life was a tragedy after and i disputed it three years ago he asked me to testify again i counted my graves and there was nothing for me to say i am old i recognize it but i dont realize it i wonder if a person ever really ceases to feel young i mean for a whole day at a time my love to you both and to all of us that are left mark though he used very little liquor of any kind it was mark twains custom to keep a bottle of scotch whiskey with his collection of pipes and cigars and tobacco on a little table by his bedside during restless nights he found a small quantity of it conducive to sleep andrew carnegie learning of this custom made it his business to supply scotch of his own special importation the first case came direct from scotland when it arrived clemens sent this characteristic acknowledgment to andrew carnegie in scotland fifth ave feb dear st andrew the whisky arrived in due course from over the water last week one bottle of it was extracted from the wood and inserted into me on the instalment plan with this result that i believe it to be the best smoothest whisky now on the planet thanks oh thanks i have discarded peruna hoping that you three are well and happy and will be coming back before the winter sets in i am sincerely yours mark it must have been a small bottle to be consumed by him in a week or perhaps he had able assistance the next brief line refers to the manuscript of his article saint joan of arc presented to the museum at rouen to edward e clarke fifth ave feb dear sir i have found the original manuscript and with great pleasure i transmit it herewith also a printed copy it is a matter of great pride to me to have any word of mine concerning the worlds supremest heroine honored by a place in that museum sincerely yours s l clemens the series of letters which follows was prepared by mark twain and general fred grant mainly with a view of advertising the lecture that clemens had agreed to deliver for the benefit of the robert fulton monument association it was in fact to be mark twains farewell lecture and the association had really proposed to pay him a thousand dollars for it the exchange of these letters however was never made outside of mark twains bedroom propped against the pillows pen in hand with general grant beside him they arranged the series with the idea of publication later the plan was discarded so that this pleasant foolery appears here for the first time private and confidential correspondence telegram army headquarters date mark twain new york would you consider a proposal to talk at carnegie hall for the benefit of the robert fulton monument association of which you are a vice president for a fee of a thousand dollars f d grant president fulton monument association telegraphic answer majorgeneral f d grant army headquarters i shall be glad to do it but i must stipulate that you keep the thousand dollars and add it to the monument fund as my contribution clemens letters dear mr clemens you have the thanks of the association and the terms shall be as you say but why give all of it why not reserve a portion why should you do this work wholly without compensation truly yours fred d grant major general grant army headquarters dear general because i stopped talking for pay a good many years ago and i could not resume the habit now without a great deal of personal discomfort i love to hear myself talk because i get so much instruction and moral upheaval out of it but i lose the bulk of this joy when i charge for it let the terms stand general if i have your approval i wish to use this good occasion to retire permanently from the platform truly yours s l clemens dear mr clemens certainly but as an old friend permit me to say dont do that why should you you are not old yet yours truly fred d grant dear general i mean the payplatform i shant retire from the gratisplatform until after i am dead and courtesy requires me to keep still and not disturb the others what shall i talk about my idea is this to instruct the audience about robert fulton and tell mewas that his real name or was it his nom de plume however never mind it is not important i can skip it and the house will think i knew all about it but forgot could you find out for me if he was one of the signers of the declaration and which one but if it is any trouble let it alone i can skip it was he out with paul jones will you ask horace porter and ask him if he brought both of them home these will be very interesting facts if they can be established but never mind dont trouble porter i can establish them anyway the way i look at it they are historical gems gems of the very first water well that is my idea as i have said first excite the audience with a spoonful of information about fulton then quiet down with a barrel of illustration drawn by memory from my books and if you dont say anything the house will think they never heard of it before because people dont really read your books they only say they do to keep you from feeling bad next excite the house with another spoonful of fultonian fact then tranquilize them again with another barrel of illustration and so on and so on all through the evening and if you are discreet and dont tell them the illustrations dont illustrate anything they wont notice it and i will send them home as wellinformed about robert fulton as i am myself dont be afraid i know all about audiences they believe everything you say except when you are telling the truth truly yours s l clemens ps mark all the advertisements private and confidential otherwise the people will not read them m t dear mr clemens how long shall you talk i ask in order that we may be able to say when carriages may be called very truly yours hugh gordon miller secretary dear mr miller i cannot say for sure it is my custom to keep on talking till i get the audience cowed sometimes it takes an hour and fifteen minutes sometimes i can do it in an hour sincerely yours s l clemens mem my charge is boxes free not the choicest sell the choicest and give me any seat boxes you please s l c i want fred grant in uniform on the stage also the rest of the officials of the association also other distinguished people all the attractions we can get also a seat for mr albert bigelow paine who may be useful to me if he is near me and on the front s l c the seat chosen for the writer of these notes was to be at the front of the stage in order that the lecturer might lean over now and then and pretend to be asking information concerning fulton i was not entirely happy in the thought of this showy honor and breathed more freely when this plan was abandoned and the part assigned to general grant the lecture was given in carnegie hall which had been gayly decorated for the occasion the house was more than filled and a great sum of money was realized for the fund it was that spring that gorky and tchaikowski the russian revolutionists came to america hoping to arouse interest in their cause the idea of the overthrow of the russian dynasty was pleasant to mark twain few things would have given him greater comfort than to have known that a little more than ten years would see the downfall of russian imperialism the letter which follows was a reply to an invitation from tchaikowski urging him to speak at one of the meetings dear mr tchaikowski i thank you for the honor of the invitation but i am not able to accept it because on thursday evening i shall be presiding at a meeting whose object is to find remunerative work for certain classes of our blind who would gladly support themselves if they had the opportunity my sympathies are with the russian revolution of course it goes without saying i hope it will succeed and now that i have talked with you i take heart to believe it will government by falsified promises by lies by treacheries and by the butcherknife for the aggrandizement of a single family of drones and its idle and vicious kin has been borne quite long enough in russia i should think and it is to be hoped that the roused nation now rising in its strength will presently put an end to it and set up the republic in its place some of us even of the white headed may live to see the blessed day when czars and grand dukes will be as scarce there as i trust they are in heaven most sincerely yours mark twain there came another summer at dublin new hampshire this time in the fine upton residence on the other slope of monadnock a place of equally beautiful surroundings and an even more extended view clemens was at this time working steadily on his socalled autobiography which was not that in fact but a series of remarkable chapters reminiscent reflective commentative written without any particular sequence as to time or subjectmatter he dictated these chapters to a stenographer usually in the open air sitting in a comfortable rocker or pacing up and down the long veranda that faced a vast expanse of wooded slope and lake and distant blue mountains it became one of the happiest occupations of his later years to w d howells in maine dublin sunday june dear howells the dictating goes lazily and pleasantly on with intervals i find that i have been at it off and on nearly two hours a day for days since jan to be exact ive dictated hours in days and loafed days ive added words in the month that ive been here which indicates that ive dictated during days of that time hours at an average of words an hour its a plenty and i am satisfied theres a good deal of fat ive dictated from jan words and the fat adds about more the fat is old pigeonholed things of the years gone by which i or editors didnt dast to print for instance i am dumping in the little old book which i read to you in hartford about years ago and which you said publish and ask dean stanley to furnish an introduction hell do it captain stormfields visit to heaven it reads quite to suit me without altering a word now that it isnt to see print until i am dead tomorrow i mean to dictate a chapter which will get my heirs and assigns burnt alive if they venture to print it this side of ad which i judge they wont therell be lots of such chapters if i live or years longer the edition of ad will make a stir when it comes out i shall be hovering around taking notice along with other dead pals you are invited mark his tendency to estimate the measure of the work he was doing and had completed must have clung to him from his old printer days the chapter which was to get his heirs and assigns burned alive was on the orthodox god and there was more than one such chapter in the next letter he refers to two exquisite poems by howells and the writer of these notes recalls his wonderful reading of them aloud in our town was a collection of short stories then recently issued by william allen white howells had recommended them to w d howells in maine fifth ave tuesday eve dear howells it is lovely of you to say those beautiful things i dont know how to thank you enough but i love you that i know i read after the wedding aloud and we felt all the pain of it and the truth it was very moving and very beautiful would have been overcomingly moving at times but for the haltings and pauses compelled by the difficulties of ms these were a protection in that they furnished me time to brace up my voice and get a new start jean wanted to keep the ms for another readingaloud and for keeps too i suspected but i said it would be safest to write you about it i like in our town particularly that colonel of the lookout mountain oration and very particularly pages i wrote and told white so after after the wedding i read the mother aloud and sounded its human deeps with your deepsea lead i had not read it before since it was first published i have been dictating some fearful things for successive mornings for no eye but yours to see until i have been dead a century if then but i got them out of my system where they had been festering for years and that was the main thing i feel better now i came down today on business from house to house in hours and expected to arrive dead but am neither tired nor sleepy yours as always mark to william allen white in emporia kans dublin new hampshire june dear mr white howells told me that in our town was a charming book and indeed it is all of it is delightful when read ones self parts of it can score finely when subjected to the most exacting of tests the reading aloud pages and are of that grade i have tried them a couple of times on the family and pages and are qualified to fetch any house of any country caste or color endowed with those riches which are denied to no nation on the planet humor and feeling talk again the country is listening sincerely yours s l clemens witter bynner the poet was one of the editors of mcclures magazine at this time but was trying to muster the courage to give up routine work for versemaking and the possibility of poverty clemens was fond of bynner and believed in his work he did not advise him however to break away entirely from a salaried position at least not immediately but one day bynner did so and reported the step he had taken with some doubt as to the answer he would receive to witter bynner in new york dublin oct dear poet you have certainly done right for several good reasons at least of them i can name two with your reputation you can have your freedom and yet earn your living if you fall short of succeeding to your wish your reputation will provide you another job and so in high approval i suppress the scolding and give you the saintly and fatherly pat instead mark twain on another occasion when bynner had written a poem to clara clemens her father pretended great indignation that the first poem written by bynner to any one in his household should not be to him and threatened revenge at dinner shortly after he produced from his pocket a slip of paper on which he had set down what he said was his only poem he read the lines that follow of all sad words of tongue or pen the saddest are these it might have been ah say not so as life grows longer leaner thinner we recognize o god it might have bynner he returned to new york in october and soon after was presented by mrs h h rogers with a handsome billiardtable he had a passion for the game but had played comparatively little since the old hartford days of fifteen years before when a group of his friends used to assemble on friday nights in the room at the top of the house for long strenuous games and much hilarity now the old fever all came back the fascinations of the game superseded even his interest in the daily dictations to mrs h h rogers in new york fifth avenue monday nov dear mrs rogers the billiard table is better than the doctors it is driving out the heartburn in a most promising way i have a billiardist on the premises and i walk not less than ten miles every day with the cue in my hand and the walking is not the whole of the exercise nor the most healthgiving part of it i think through the multitude of the positions and attitudes it brings into play every muscle in the body and exercises them all the games begin right after luncheon daily and continue until midnight with hours intermission for dinner and music and so it is hours exercise per day and or on sunday yesterday and last night it was and i slept until this morning without waking the billiard table as a sabbath breaker can beat any coalbreaker in pennsylvania and give it in the game if mr rogers will take to daily billiards he can do without doctors and the massageur i think we are really going to build a house on my farm an hour and a half from new york it is decided it is to be built by contract and is to come within with love and many thanks s l c ps clara is in the sanitarium till january when her western concert tour will begin she is getting to be a mighty competent singer you must know clara better she is one of the very finest and completest and most satisfactory characters i have ever met others knew it before but i have always been busy with other matters the billiardist on the premises was the writer of these notes who earlier in the year had become his biographer and in the course of time his daily companion and friend the farm mentioned was one which he had bought at redding connecticut where later he built the house known as stormfield henry mills alden for nearly forty years editor of harpers magazine arrived at his seventieth birthday on november th that year and harper brothers had arranged to give him a great dinner in the offices of franklin square where for half a century he had been an active force mark twain threatened with a cold and knowing the dinner would be strenuous did not feel able to attend so wrote a letter which if found suitable could be read at the gathering to mr henry alden alden dear and ancient friend it is a solemn moment you have now reached the age of discretion you have been a long time arriving many years ago you docked me on an article because the subject was too old later you docked me on an article because the subject was too new later still you docked me on an article because the subject was betwixt and between once when i wrote a letter to queen victoria you did not put it in the respectable part of the magazine but interred it in that potters field the editors drawer as a result she never answered it how often we recall with regret that napoleon once shot at a magazine editor and missed him and killed a publisher but we remember with charity that his intentions were good you will reform now alden you will cease from these economies and you will be discharged but in your retirement you will carry with you the admiration and earnest good wishes of the oppressed and toiling scribes this will be better than bread let this console you when the bread fails you will carry with you another thing too the affection of the scribes for they all love you in spite of your crimes for you bear a kind heart in your breast and the sweet and winning spirit that charms away all hostilities and animosities and makes of your enemy your friend and keeps him so you have reigned over us thirtysix years and please god you shall reign another thirtysix and peace to mahmoud on his golden throne always yours mark a copyright bill was coming up in washington and a delegation of authors went down to work for it clemens was not the head of the delegation but he was the most prominent member of it as well as the most useful he invited the writer to accompany him and elsewhere i have told in detail the story of that excursion see mark twain a biography chap ccli which need be but briefly touched upon here his work was mainly done aside from that of the delegation they had him scheduled for a speech however which he made without notes and with scarcely any preparation meantime he had applied to speaker cannon for permission to allow him on the floor of the house where he could buttonhole the congressmen he was not eligible to the floor without having received the thanks of congress hence the following letter to hon joseph cannon house of representatives dec dear uncle joseph please get me the thanks of the congress not next week but right away it is very necessary do accomplish this for your affectionate old friend right away by persuasion if you can by violence if you must for it is imperatively necessary that i get on the floor for two or three hours and talk to the members man by man in behalf of the support encouragement and protection of one of the nations most valuable assets and industries its literature i have arguments with me also a barrel with liquid in it give me a chance get me the thanks of congress dont wait for others there isnt time i have stayed away and let congress alone for seventyone years and i am entitled to thanks congress knows it perfectly well and i have long felt hurt that this quite proper and earned expression of gratitude has been merely felt by the house and never publicly uttered send me an order on the sergeantatarms quick when shall i come with love and a benediction mark twain this was mainly a joke mark twain did not expect any thanks but he did hope for access to the floor which once in an earlier day had been accorded him we drove to the capitol and he delivered his letter to uncle joe by hand uncle joe could not give him the privilege of the floor the rules had become more stringent he declared they would hang him if he did such a thing he added that he had a private room downstairs where mark twain might establish headquarters and that he would assign his colored servant neal of long acquaintanceship with many of the members to pass the word that mark twain was receiving the result was a great success all that afternoon members of congress poured into the speakers room and in an atmosphere blue with tobacco smoke mark twain talked the gospel of copyright to his hearts content the bill did not come up for passage that session but mark twain lived to see his afternoons lobbying bring a return in champ clark and those others who had gathered around him that afternoon passed a measure that added fourteen years to the copyright term the next letter refers to a proposed lobby of quite a different sort to helen keller in wrentham mass fifth avenue dec dear helen keller you say as a reformer you know that ideas must be driven home again and again yes i know it and by old experience i know that speeches and documents and public meetings are a pretty poor and lame way of accomplishing it last year i proposed a sane way one which i had practiced with success for a quarter of a century but i wasnt expecting it to get any attention and it didnt give me a battalion of winsome young girls and matrons and let me tell them what to do and how to do it and i will be responsible for shining results if i could mass them on the stage in front of the audience and instruct them there i could make a public meeting take hold of itself and do something really valuable for once not that the real instruction would be done there for it wouldnt it would be previously done privately and merely repeated there but it isnt going to happen the good old way will be stuck to therell be a public meeting with music and prayer and a wearying report and a verbal description of the marvels the blind can do and speeches then the call upon all present who are still alive to contribute this hoary program was invented in the idiot asylum and will never be changed its function is to breed hostility to good causes some day somebody will recruit my my dear beguilesome knights of the golden fleece and you will see them make good their ominous name mind we must meet not in the grim and ghastly air of the platform mayhap but by the friendly fire here at affectionately your friend s l clemens they did meet somewhat later that winter in the friendly parlors of no and friends gathered in to meet the marvelous blind girl and to pay tribute to miss sullivan mrs macy for her almost incredible achievement
