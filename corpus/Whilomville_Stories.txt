seafog heres another batch of lovely puddings from this boot he emptied about a quart of snow the execution the funeral oration stamping bravely and noisily on the porch the first time i catch you ill lam the head offn you no time for academics he ran who hurt him he said ferociously niggerrr niggerrr one approaching from behind laid hold of his ear the professional bright boy of the class suddenly awoke whilomville stories i the angel child i although whilomville was in no sense a summer resort the advent of the warm season meant much to it for then came visitors from the city people of considerable confidence alighting upon their country cousins moreover many citizens who could afford to do so escaped at this time to the seaside the town with the commercial life quite taken out of it drawled and drowsed through long months during which nothing was worse than the white dust which arose behind every vehicle at blinding noon and nothing was finer than the cool sheen of the hose sprays over the cropped lawns under the many maples in the twilight one summer the trescotts had a visitation mrs trescott owned a cousin who was a painter of high degree i had almost said that he was of national reputation but come to think of it it is better to say that almost everybody in the united states who knew about art and its travail knew about him he had picked out a wife and naturally looking at him one wondered how he had done it she was quick beautiful imperious while he was quiet slow and misty she was a veritable queen of health while he apparently was of a most brittle constitution when he played tennis particularly he looked every minute as if he were going to break they lived in new york in awesome apartments wherein japan and persia and indeed all the world confounded the observer at the end was a cathedrallike studio they had one child perhaps it would be better to say that they had one child it was a girl when she came to whilomville with her parents it was patent that she had an inexhaustible store of white frocks and that her voice was high and commanding these things the town knew quickly other things it was doomed to discover by a process her effect upon the children of the trescott neighborhood was singular they at first feared then admired then embraced in two days she was a begum all day long her voice could be heard directing drilling and compelling those freeborn children and to say that they felt oppression would be wrong for they really fought for records of loyal obedience all went well until one day was her birthday on the morning of this day she walked out into the trescott garden and said to her father confidently papa give me some money because this is my birthday he looked dreamily up from his easel your birthday he murmured her envisioned father was never energetic enough to be irritable unless some one broke through into that place where he lived with the desires of his life but neither wife nor child ever heeded or even understood the temperamental values and so some part of him had grown hardened to their inroads money he said here he handed her a fivedollar bill it was that he did not at all understand the nature of a fivedollar bill he was deaf to it he had it he gave it that was all she sallied forth to a waiting people jimmie trescott dan earl ella earl the margate twins the three phelps children and others ive got some pennies now she cried waving the bill and i am going to buy some candy they were deeply stirred by this announcement most children are penniless three hundred days in the year and to another possessing five pennies they pay deference to little cora waving a bright green note these children paid heathenish homage in some disorder they thronged after her to a small shop on bridge street hill first of all came icecream seated in the comic little back parlor they clamored shrilly over plates of various flavors and the shopkeeper marvelled that cream could vanish so quickly down throats that seemed wide open always for the making of excited screams these children represented the families of most excellent people they were all born in whatever purple there was to be had in the vicinity of whilomville the margate twins for example were outandout prizewinners with their long golden curls and their countenances of similar vacuity they shone upon the front bench of all sundayschool functions hand in hand while their uplifted mother felt about her the envy of a hundred other parents and less heavenly children scoffed from near the door then there was little dan earl probably the nicest boy in the world gentle finegrained obedient to the point where he obeyed anybody jimmie trescott himself was indeed the only child who was at all versed in villany but in these particular days he was on his very good behavior as a matter of fact he was in love the beauty of his regal little cousin had stolen his manly heart yes they were all most excellent children but loosened upon this candyshop with five dollars they resembled in a tiny way drunken revelling soldiers within the walls of a stormed city upon the heels of icecream and cake came chocolate mice butterscotch everlastings chocolate cigars taffyonastick taffyonaslatepencil and many semitransparent devices resembling lions tigers elephants horses cats dogs cows sheep tables chairs engines both railway and for the fighting of fire soldiers fine ladies oddlooking men clocks watches revolvers rabbits and bedsteads a cent was the price of a single wonder some of the children going quite daft soon had thought to make fight over the spoils but their queen ruled with an iron grip her first inspiration was to satisfy her own fancies but as soon as that was done she mingled prodigality with a fine justice dividing balancing bestowing and sometimes taking away from somebody even that which he had it was an orgy in thirtyfive minutes those respectable children looked as if they had been dragged at the tail of a chariot the sacred margate twins blinking and grunting wished to take seat upon the floor and even the most durable jimmie trescott found occasion to lean against the counter wearing at the time a solemn and abstracted air as if he expected something to happen to him shortly of course their belief had been in an unlimited capacity but they found there was an end the shopkeeper handed the queen her change two seventythree from five leaves two twentyseven miss cora he said looking upon her with admiration she turned swiftly to her clan ooh she cried in amazement look how much i have left they gazed at the coins in her palm they knew then that it was not their capacities which were endless it was the five dollars the queen led the way to the street we must think up some way of spending more money she said frowning they stood in silence awaiting her further speech suddenly she clapped her hands and screamed with delight come on she cried i know what lets do now behold she had discovered the red and white pole in front of the shop of one william neeltje a barber by trade it becomes necessary to say a few words concerning neeltje he was new to the town he had come and opened a dusty little shop on dusty bridge street hill and although the neighborhood knew from the courier winds that his diet was mainly cabbage they were satisfied with that meagre data of course riefsnyder came to investigate him for the local barbers union but he found in him only sweetness and light with a willingness to charge any price at all for a shave or a haircut in fact the advent of neeltje would have made barely a ripple upon the placid bosom of whilomville if it were not that his name was neeltje at first the people looked at his signboard out of the eye corner and wondered lazily why any one should bear the name of neeltje but as time went on men spoke to other men saying how do you pronounce the name of that barber up there on bridge street hill and then before any could prevent it the best minds of the town were splintering their lances against william neeltjes signboard if a man had a mental superior he guided him seductively to this name and watched with glee his wrecking the clergy of the town even entered the lists there was one among them who had taken a collegiate prize in syriac as well as in several less opaque languages and the other clergymen at one of their weekly meetings sought to betray him into this ambush he pronounced the name correctly but that mattered little since none of them knew whether he did or did not and so they took triumph according to their ignorance under these arduous circumstances it was certain that the town should look for a nickname and at this time the nickname was in process of formation so william neeltje lived on with his secret smiling foolishly towards the world come on cried little cora lets all get our hair cut thats what lets do lets all get our hair cut come on come on come on the others were carried off their feet by the fury of this assault to get their hair cut what joy little did they know if this were fun they only knew that their small leader said it was fun chocolatestained but confident the band marched into william neeltjes barber shop we wish to get our hair cut said little cora haughtily neeltje in his shirtsleeves stood looking at them with his halfidiot smile hurry now commanded the queen a drayhorse toiled step by step step by step up bridge street hill a far womans voice arose there could be heard the ceaseless hammers of shingling carpenters all was summer peace come on now whos goin first come on ella you go first gettin our hair cut oh what fun little ella earl would not however be first in the chair she was drawn towards it by a singular fascination but at the same time she was afraid of it and so she hung back saying no you go first no you go first the question was precipitated by the twins and one of the phelps children they made simultaneous rush for the chair and screamed and kicked each pair preventing the third child the queen entered this mкlйe and decided in favor of the phelps boy he ascended the chair thereat an awed silence fell upon the band and always william neeltje smiled fatuously he tucked a cloth in the neck of the phelps boy and taking scissors began to cut his hair the group of children came closer and closer even the queen was deeply moved does it hurt any she asked in a wee voice naw said the phelps boy with dignity anyhow ive had m hair cut afore when he appeared to them looking very soldierly with his cropped little head there was a tumult over the chair the margate twins howled jimmie trescott was kicking them on the shins it was a fight but the twins could not prevail being the smallest of all the children the queen herself took the chair and ordered neeltje as if he were a ladysmaid to the floor there fell proud ringlets blazing even there in their humiliation with a full fine bronze light then jimmie trescott then ella earl two long ashcolored plaits then a phelps girl then another phelps girl and so on from head to head the ceremony received unexpected check when the turn came to dan earl this lad usually docile to any rein had suddenly grown mulishly obstinate no he would not he would not he himself did not seem to know why he refused to have his hair cut but despite the shrill derision of the company he remained obdurate anyhow the twins long held in check and now feverishly eager were already struggling for the chair illustration the queen herself took the chair and so to the floor at last came the golden margate curls the heart treasure and glory of a mother three aunts and some feminine cousins all having been finished the children highly elate thronged out into the street they crowed and cackled with pride and joy anon turning to scorn the cowardly dan earl ella earl was an exception she had been pensive for some time and now the shorn little maiden began vaguely to weep in the door of his shop william neeltje stood watching them upon his face a grin of almost inhuman idiocy ii it now becomes the duty of the unfortunate writer to exhibit these children to their fond parents come on jimmie cried little cora lets go show mamma and they hurried off these happy children to show mamma the trescotts and their guests were assembled indolently awaiting the luncheonbell jimmie and the angel child burst in upon them oh mamma shrieked little cora see how fine i am ive had my hair cut isnt it splendid and jimmie too the wretched mother took one sight emitted one yell and fell into a chair mrs trescott dropped a large ladys journal and made a nerveless mechanical clutch at it the painter gripped the arms of his chair and leaned forward staring until his eyes were like two little clock faces dr trescott did not move or speak to the children the next moments were chaotic there was a loudly wailing mother and a palefaced aghast mother a stammering father and a grim and terrible father the angel child did not understand anything of it save the voice of calamity and in a moment all her little imperialism went to the winds she ran sobbing to her mother oh mamma mamma mamma the desolate jimmie heard out of this inexplicable situation a voice which he knew well a sort of colonels voice and he obeyed like any good soldier jimmie he stepped three paces to the front yes sir how did this how did this happen said trescott now jimmie could have explained how had happened anything which had happened but he did not know what had happened so he said i i nothin and oh look at her frock said mrs trescott brokenly illustration look she declaimed the words turned the mind of the mother of the angel child she looked up her eyes blazing frock she repeated frock what do i care for her frock frock she choked out again from the depths of her bitterness then she arose suddenly and whirled tragically upon her husband look she declaimed all her lovely hair all her lovely hair gone gone the painter was apparently in a fit his jaw was set his eyes were glazed his body was stiff and straight all gone all her lovely hair all gone my poor little darlin my poor little darlin and the angel child added her heartbroken voice to her mothers wail as they fled into each others arms in the mean time trescott was patiently unravelling some skeins of jimmies tangled intellect and then you went to this barbers on the hill yes and where did you get the money yes i see and who besides you and cora had their hair cut the margate twi oh lord over at the margate place old eldridge margate the grandfather of the twins was in the back garden picking pease and smoking ruminatively to himself suddenly he heard from the house great noises doors slammed women rushed upstairs and downstairs calling to each other in voices of agony and then full and mellow upon the still air arose the roar of the twins in pain old eldridge stepped out of the peapatch and moved towards the house puzzled staring not yet having decided that it was his duty to rush forward then around the corner of the house shot his daughter mollie her face pale with horror whats the matter he cried oh father she gasped the children they then around the corner of the house came the twins howling at the top of their power their faces flowing with tears they were still hand in hand the ruling passion being strong even in this suffering at sight of them old eldridge took his pipe hastily out of his mouth good god he said and now what befell one william neeltje a barber by trade and what was said by angry parents of the mother of such an angel child and what was the fate of the angel child herself there was surely a tempest with the exception of the margate twins the boys could well be eliminated from the affair of course it didnt matter if their hair was cut also the two little phelps girls had had very short hair anyhow and their parents were not too greatly incensed in the case of ella earl it was mainly the pathos of the little girls own grieving but her mother played a most generous part and called upon mrs trescott and condoled with the mother of the angel child over their equivalent losses but the margate contingent they simply screeched illustration around the corner of the house came the twins trescott composed and coolblooded was in the middle of a giddy whirl he was not going to allow the mobbing of his wifes cousins nor was he going to pretend that the spoliation of the margate twins was a virtuous and beautiful act he was elected gratuitously to the position of a buffer but curiously enough the one who achieved the bulk of the misery was old eldridge margate who had been picking pease at the time the feminine margates stormed his position as individuals in pairs in teams and en masse in two days they may have aged him seven years he must destroy the utter neeltje he must midnightly massacre the angel child and her mother he must dip his arms in blood to the elbows trescott took the first opportunity to express to him his concern over the affair but when the subject of the disaster was mentioned old eldridge to the doctors great surprise actually chuckled long and deeply oh well lookahere he said i never was so much in love with them there damn curls the curls was purty yes but then id a darn sight rather see boys look more like boys than like two little wax figgers an ye know the little cusses like it themselves they never took no stock in all this washin an combin an fixin an goin to church an paradin an showin off they stood it because they were told to thats all of course this here neeltegee er whatever his name is is a plumb dumb ijit but i dont see whats to be done now that the kids is full well cropped i might go and burn his shop over his head but that wouldnt bring no hair back onto the kids theyre even kicking on sashes now and thats all right cause what fer does a boy want a sash whereupon trescott perceived that the old man wore his brains above his shoulders and trescott departed from him rejoicing greatly that it was only women who could not know that there was finality to most disasters and that when a thing was fully done no amount of doorslammings rushing upstairs and downstairs calls lamentations tears could bring back a single hair to the heads of twins illustration at the railway station but the rains came and the winds blew in the most biblical way when a certain fact came to light in the trescott household little cora corroborated by jimmie innocently remarked that five dollars had been given her by her father on her birthday and with this money the evil had been wrought trescott had known it but he thoughtful man had said nothing for her part the mother of the angel child had up to that moment never reflected that the consummation of the wickedness must have cost a small sum of money but now it was all clear to her he was the guilty one he my angel child the scene which ensued was inspiriting a few days later loungers at the railway station saw a lady leading a shorn and still undaunted lamb attached to them was a husband and father who was plainly bewildered but still more plainly vexed as if he would be saying damn em why cant they leave me alone ii lynxhunting jimmie lounged about the diningroom and watched his mother with large serious eyes suddenly he said ma now can i borrow pas gun she was overcome with the feminine horror which is able to mistake preliminary words for the full accomplishment of the dread thing why jimmie she cried of all wonders your fathers gun no indeed you cant he was fairly well crushed but he managed to mutter sullenly well willie dalzel hes got a gun in reality his heart had previously been beating with such tumult he had himself been so impressed with the daring and sin of his request that he was glad that all was over now and his mother could do very little further harm to his sensibilities he had been influenced into the venture by the larger boys illustration ma now can i borrow pas gun huh the dalzel urchin had said your fathers got a gun hasnt he well why dont you bring that puffing himself jimmie had replied well i can if i want to it was a black lie but really the dalzel boy was too outrageous with his eternal billposting about the gun which a beaming uncle had intrusted to him its possession made him superior in manfulness to most boys in the neighborhood or at least they enviously conceded him such position but he was so overbearing and stuffed the fact of his treasure so relentlessly down their throats that on this occasion the miserable jimmie had lied as naturally as most animals swim willie dalzel had not been checkmated for he had instantly retorted why dont you get it then well i can if i want to well get it then well i can if i want to thereupon jimmie had paced away with great airs of surety as far as the door of his home where his manner changed to one of tremulous misgiving as it came upon him to address his mother in the diningroom there had happened that which had happened when jimmie returned to his two distinguished companions he was blown out with a singular pomposity he spoke these noble words oh well i guess i dont want to take the gun out today they had been watching him with gleaming ferret eyes and they detected his falsity at once they challenged him with shouted gibes but it was not in the rules for the conduct of boys that one should admit anything whatsoever and so jimmie backed into an ethical corner lied as stupidly as desperately as hopelessly as ever lone savage fights when surrounded at last in his jungle such accusations were never known to come to any point for the reason that the number and kind of denials always equalled or exceeded the number of accusations and no boy was ever brought really to book for these misdeeds in the end they went off together willie dalzel with his gun being a trifle in advance and discoursing upon his various works they passed along a maplelined avenue a highway common to boys bound for that free land of hills and woods in which they lived in some part their romance of the moment whether it was of indians miners smugglers soldiers or outlaws the paths were their paths and much was known to them of the secrets of the dark green hemlock thickets the wastes of sweetfern and huckleberry the cliffs of gaunt bluestone with the sumach burning red at their feet each boy had i am sure a conviction that some day the wilderness was to give forth to him a marvellous secret they felt that the hills and the forest knew much and they heard a voice of it in the silence it was vague thrilling fearful and altogether fabulous the grown folk seemed to regard these wastes merely as so much distance between one place and another place or as a rabbitcover or as a district to be judged according to the value of the timber but to the boys it spoke some great inspiring word which they knew even as those who pace the shore know the enigmatic speech of the surf in the mean time they lived there in season lives of ringing adventure by dint of imagination the boys left the avenue skirted hastily through some private grounds climbed a fence and entered the thickets it happened that at school the previous day willie dalzel had been forced to read and acquire in some part a solemn description of a lynx the meagre information thrust upon him had caused him grimaces of suffering but now he said suddenly im goin to shoot a lynx the other boys admired this statement but they were silent for a time finally jimmie said meekly whats a lynx he had endured his ignorance as long as he was able the dalzel boy mocked him why dont you know what a lynx is a lynx why a lynx is a animal somethin like a cat an its got great big green eyes and it sits on the limb of a tree an jus glares at you its a pretty bad animal i tell you why when i huh said the third boy whered you ever see a lynx oh ive seen em plenty of em i bet youd be scared if you seen one once jimmie and the other boy each demanded how do you know i would they penetrated deeper into the wood they climbed a rocky zigzag path which led them at times where with their hands they could almost touch the tops of giant pines the gray cliffs sprang sheer towards the sky willie dalzel babbled about his impossible lynx and they stalked the mountainside like chamoishunters although no noise of bird or beast broke the stillness of the hills below them whilomville was spread out somewhat like the cheap green and black lithograph of the time a birdseye view of whilomville n y illustration the dalzel boy taking the part of a bandit chief in the end the boys reached the top of the mountain and scouted off among wild and desolate ridges they were burning with the desire to slay large animals they thought continually of elephants lions tigers crocodiles they discoursed upon their immaculate conduct in case such monsters confronted them and they all lied carefully about their courage the breeze was heavy with the smell of sweetfern the pines and hemlocks sighed as they waved their branches in the hollows the leaves of the laurels were lacquered where the sunlight found them no matter the weather it would be impossible to long continue an expedition of this kind without a fire and presently they built one snapping down for fuel the brittle underbranches of the pines about this fire they were willed to conduct a sort of play the dalzel boy taking the part of a bandit chief and the other boys being his trusty lieutenants they stalked to and fro longstrided stern yet devilmaycare three terrible little figures jimmie had an uncle who made game of him whenever he caught him in this kind of play and often this uncle quoted derisively the following classic once aboard the lugger bill and the girl is mine now to burn the chвteau and destroy all evidence of our crime but harke bill no wiolence wheeling abruptly he addressed these dramatic words to his comrades they were impressed they decided at once to be smugglers and in the most ribald fashion they talked about carrying off young women at last they continued their march through the woods the smuggling motif was now grafted fantastically upon the original lynx idea which willie dalzel refused to abandon at any price once they came upon an innocent bird who happened to be looking another way at the time after a great deal of manoevering and big words willie dalzel reared his fowlingpiece and blew this poor thing into a mere rag of wet feathers of which he was proud afterwards the other big boy had a turn at another bird then it was plainly jimmies chance the two others had of course some thought of cheating him out of this chance but of a truth he was timid to explode such a thunderous weapon and as soon as they detected this fear they simply overbore him and made it clearly understood that if he refused to shoot he would lose his caste his scalplock his girdle his honor they had reached the old deathcolored snakefence which marked the limits of the upper pasture of the fleming farm under some hickorytrees the path ran parallel to the fence behold a small priestly chipmonk came to a rail and folding his hands on his abdomen addressed them in his own tongue it was jimmies shot adjured by the others he took the gun his face was stiff with apprehension the dalzel boy was giving forth fine words go ahead aw dont be afraid its nothin to do why ive done it a million times dont shut both your eyes now jus keep one open and shut the other one hell get away if you dont watch out now youre all right why dont you leter go go ahead illustration there was a frightful roar jimmie with his legs braced apart was in the centre of the path his back was greatly bent owing to the mechanics of supporting the heavy gun his companions were screeching in the rear there was a wait then he pulled trigger to him there was a frightful roar his cheek and his shoulder took a stunning blow his face felt a hot flush of fire and opening his two eyes he found that he was still alive he was not too dazed to instantly adopt a becoming egotism it had been the first shot of his life but directly after the wellmannered celebration of this victory a certain cow which had been grazing in the line of fire was seen to break wildly across the pasture bellowing and bucking the three smugglers and lynxhunters looked at each other out of blanched faces jimmie had hit the cow the first evidence of his comprehension of this fact was in the celerity with which he returned the discharged gun to willie dalzel they turned to flee the land was black as if it had been overshadowed suddenly with thick stormclouds and even as they fled in their horror a gigantic swedish farmhand came from the heavens and fell upon them shrieking in eerie triumph in a twinkle they were clouted prostrate the swede was elate and ferocious in a foreign and fulsome way he continued to beat them and yell from the ground they raised their dismal appeal oh please mister we didnt do it he did it i didnt do it we didnt do it we didnt mean to do it oh please mister in these moments of childish terror little lads go halfblind and it is possible that few moments of their afterlife made them suffer as they did when the swede flung them over the fence and marched them towards the farmhouse they begged like cowards on the scaffold and each one was for himself oh please let me go mister i didnt do it mister he did it oh please let me go mister illustration i thought she was a lynx the boyish view belongs to boys alone and if this tall and knotted laborer was needlessly without charity none of the three lads questioned it usually when they were punished they decided that they deserved it and the more they were punished the more they were convinced that they were criminals of a most subterranean type as to the hitting of the cow being a pure accident and therefore not of necessity a criminal matter such reading never entered their heads when things happened and they were caught they commonly paid dire consequences and they were accustomed to measure the probabilities of woe utterly by the damage done and not in any way by the culpability the shooting of the cow was plainly heinous and undoubtedly their dungeons would be kneedeep in water he did it mister this was a general outcry jimmie used it as often as did the others as for them it is certain that they had no direct thought of betraying their comrade for their own salvation they thought themselves guilty because they were caught when boys were not caught they might possibly be innocent but captured boys were guilty when they cried out that jimmie was the culprit it was principally a simple expression of terror old henry fleming the owner of the farm strode across the pasture towards them he had in his hand a most cruel whip this whip he flourished at his approach the boys suffered the agonies of the fire regions and yet anybody with half an eye could see that the whip in his hand was a mere accident and that he was a kind old man when he cared when he had come near he spoke crisply what you boys ben doin to my cow the tone had deep threat in it they all answered by saying that none of them had shot the cow their denials were tearful and clamorous and they crawled knee by knee the vision of it was like three martyrs being dragged towards the stake old fleming stood there grim tightlipped after a time he said which boy done it there was some confusion and then jimmie spake i done it mister fleming looked at him then he asked well what did you shoot er fer jimmie thought hesitated decided faltered and then formulated this i thought she was a lynx old fleming and his swede at once lay down in the grass and laughed themselves helpless iii the lover and the telltale when the angel child returned with her parents to new york the fond heart of jimmie trescott felt its bruise greatly for two days he simply moped becoming a stranger to all former joys when his old comrades yelled invitation as they swept off on some interesting quest he replied with mournful gestures of disillusion he thought often of writing to her but of course the shame of it made him pause write a letter to a girl the mere enormity of the idea caused him shudders persons of his quality never wrote letters to girls such was the occupation of mollycoddles and snivellers he knew that if his acquaintances and friends found in him evidences of such weakness and general milkiness they would fling themselves upon him like so many wolves and bait him beyond the borders of sanity however one day at school in that time of the morning session when children of his age were allowed fifteen minutes of play in the schoolgrounds he did not as usual rush forth ferociously to his games commonly he was of the worst hoodlums preying upon his weaker brethren with all the cruel disregard of a grown man on this particular morning he stayed in the schoolroom and with his tongue stuck from the corner of his mouth and his head twisting in a painful way he wrote to little cora pouring out to her all the poetry of his hungry soul as follows my dear cora i love thee with all my hart oh come bac again bac bac gain for i love thee best of all oh come bac again when the spring come again wel fly and wel fly like a brid as for the last word he knew under normal circumstances perfectly well how to spell bird but in this case he had transposed two of the letters through excitement supreme agitation nor had this letter been composed without fear and furtive glancing there was always a number of children who for the time cared more for the quiet of the schoolroom than for the tempest of the playground and there was always that dismal company who were being forcibly deprived of their recess who were being kept in more than one curious eye was turned upon the desperate and lawless jimmie trescott suddenly taken to ways of peace and as he felt these eyes he flushed guiltily with felonious glances from side to side it happened that a certain vigilant little girl had a seat directly across the aisle from jimmies seat and she had remained in the room during the intermission because of her interest in some absurd domestic details concerning her desk parenthetically it might be stated that she was in the habit of imagining this desk to be a house and at this time with an important little frown indicative of a proper matron she was engaged in dramatizing her ideas of a household but this small rose goldege happened to be of a family which numbered few males it was in fact one of those curious middleclass families that hold much of their ground retain most of their position after all their visible means of support have been dropped in the grave it contained now only a collection of women who existed submissively defiantly securely mysteriously in a pretentious and often exasperating virtue it was often too triumphantly clear that they were free of bad habits however bad habits is a term here used in a commoner meaning because it is certainly true that the principal and indeed solitary joy which entered their lonely lives was the joy of talking wickedly and busily about their neighbors it was all done without dream of its being of the vulgarity of the alleys indeed it was simply a constitutional but not incredible chastity and honesty expressing itself in its ordinary superior way of the whirling circles of life and the vehemence of the criticism was not lessened by a further infusion of an acid of worldly defeat worldly suffering and worldly hopelessness out of this family circle had sprung the typical little girl who discovered jimmie trescott agonizingly writing a letter to his sweetheart of course all the children were the most abandoned gossips but she was peculiarly adapted to the purpose of making jimmie miserable over this particular point it was her life to sit of evenings about the stove and hearken to her mother and a lot of spinsters talk of many things during these evenings she was never licensed to utter an opinion either one way or the other way she was then simply a very little girl sitting openeyed in the gloom and listening to many things which she often interpreted wrongly they on their part kept up a kind of a smugfaced pretence of concealing from her information in detail of the widespread crime which pretence may have been more elaborately dangerous than no pretence at all thus all her hometeaching fitted her to recognize at once in jimmie trescotts manner that he was concealing something that would properly interest the world she set up a scream oh oh oh jimmie trescotts writing to his girl oh oh jimmie cast a miserable glance upon her a glance in which hatred mingled with despair through the open window he could hear the boisterous cries of his friends his hoodlum friends who would no more understand the utter poetry of his position than they would understand an ancient tribal signlanguage his face was set in a truer expression of horror than any of the romances describe upon the features of a man flung into a moat a man shot in the breast with an arrow a man cleft in the neck with a battleaxe he was suppedaneous of the fullest power of childish pain his one course was to rush upon her and attempt by an impossible means of strangulation to keep her important news from the public the teacher a thoughtful young woman at her desk upon the platform saw a little scuffle which informed her that two of her scholars were larking she called out sharply the command penetrated to the middle of an early world struggle in jimmies age there was no particular scruple in the minds of the male sex against laying warrior hands upon their weaker sisters but of course this voice from the throne hindered jimmie in what might have been a berserk attack even the little girl was retarded by the voice but without being unlawful she managed soon to shy through the door and out upon the playground yelling oh jimmie trescotts been writing to his girl the unhappy jimmie was following as closely as he was allowed by his knowledge of the decencies to be preserved under the eye of the teacher jimmie himself was mainly responsible for the scene which ensued on the playground it is possible that the little girl might have run shrieking his infamy without exciting more than a general but unmilitant interest these barbarians were excited only by the actual appearance of human woe in that event they cheered and danced jimmie made the strategic mistake of pursuing little rose and thus exposed his thin skin to the whole school he had in his cowering mind a vision of a hundred children turning from their play under the mapletrees and speeding towards him over the gravel with sudden wild taunts upon him drove a yelping demoniac mob to which his words were futile he saw in this mob boys that he dimly knew and his deadly enemies and his retainers and his most intimate friends the virulence of his deadly enemy was no greater than the virulence of his intimate friend from the outskirts the little informer could be heard still screaming the news like a toy parrot with clockwork inside of it it broke up all sorts of games not so much because of the mere fact of the letterwriting as because the children knew that some sufferer was at the last point and like little bloodfanged wolves they thronged to the scene of his destruction they galloped about him shrilly chanting insults he turned from one to another only to meet with howls he was baited then in one instant he changed all this with a blow bang the most pitiless of the boys near him received a punch fairly and skilfully which made him bellow out like a walrus and then jimmie laid desperately into the whole world striking out frenziedly in all directions boys who could handily whip him and knew it backed away from this onslaught here was intention serious intention they themselves were not in frenzy and their cooler judgment respected jimmies efforts when he ran amuck they saw that it really was none of their affair in the mean time the wretched little girl who had caused the bloody riot was away by the fence weeping because boys were fighting illustration they galloped about him shrilly chanting insults jimmie several times hit the wrong boy that is to say he several times hit a wrong boy hard enough to arouse also in him a spirit of strife jimmie wore a little shirtwaist it was passing now rapidly into oblivion he was sobbing and there was one blood stain upon his cheek the schoolground sounded like a pinetree when a hundred crows roost in it at night then upon the situation there pealed a brazen bell it was a bell that these children obeyed even as older nations obey the formal law which is printed in calfskin it smote them into some sort of inaction even jimmie was influenced by its potency although as a finale he kicked out lustily into the legs of an intimate friend who had been one of the foremost in the torture when they came to form into line for the march into the schoolroom it was curious that jimmie had many admirers it was not his prowess it was the soul he had infused into his gymnastics and he still panting looked about him with a stern and challenging glare and yet when the long tramping line had entered the schoolroom his status had again changed the other children then began to regard him as a boy in disrepair and boys in disrepair were always accosted ominously from the throne jimmies march towards his seat was a feat it was composed partly of a most slinking attempt to dodge the perception of the teacher and partly of pure braggadocio erected for the benefit of his observant fellowmen the teacher looked carefully down at him jimmie trescott she said yesm he answered with businesslike briskness which really spelled out falsity in all its letters come up to the desk he rose amid the awe of the entire schoolroom when he arrived she said jimmie youve been fighting yesm he answered this was not so much an admission of the fact as it was a concessional answer to anything she might say who have you been fighting she asked i dunno m whereupon the empress blazed out in wrath you dont know who youve been fighting jimmie looked at her gloomily no m she seemed about to disintegrate to mere flaming fagots of anger you dont know who youve been fighting she demanded blazing well you stay in after school until you find out as he returned to his place all the children knew by his vanquished air that sorrow had fallen upon the house of trescott when he took his seat he saw gloating upon him the satanic black eyes of the little goldege girl iv showin off jimmie trescotts new velocipede had the largest front wheel of any velocipede in whilomville when it first arrived from new york he wished to sacrifice school food and sleep to it evidently he wished to become a sort of a perpetual velocipederider but the powers of the family laid a number of judicious embargoes upon him and he was prevented from becoming a fanatic of course this caused him to retain a fondness for the threewheeled thing much longer than if he had been allowed to debauch himself for a span of days but in the end it was an immaterial machine to him for long periods he left it idle in the stable one day he loitered from school towards home by a very circuitous route he was accompanied by only one of his retainers the object of this dйtour was the wooing of a little girl in a red hood he had been in love with her for some three weeks his desk was near her desk in school but he had never spoken to her he had been afraid to take such a radical step it was not customary to speak to girls even boys who had schoolgoing sisters seldom addressed them during that part of a day which was devoted to education the reasons for this conduct were very plain first the more robust boys considered talking with girls an unmanly occupation second the greater part of the boys were afraid third they had no idea of what to say because they esteemed the proper sentences should be supernaturally incisive and eloquent in consequence a small contingent of blueeyed weaklings were the sole intimates of the frail sex and for it they were boisterously and disdainfully called girlboys but this situation did not prevent serious and ardent wooing for instance jimmie and the little girl who wore the red hood must have exchanged glances at least two hundred times in every schoolhour and this exchange of glances accomplished everything in them the two children renewed their curious inarticulate vows jimmie had developed a devotion to school which was the admiration of his father and mother in the mornings he was so impatient to have it made known to him that no misfortune had befallen his romance during the night that he was actually detected at times feverishly listening for the first bell dr trescott was exceedingly complacent of the change and as for mrs trescott she had ecstatic visions of a whitehaired jimmie leading the nations in knowledge comprehending all from bugs to comets it was merely the doing of the little girl in the red hood when jimmie made up his mind to follow his sweetheart home from school the project seemed such an arbitrary and shameless innovation that he hastily lied to himself about it no he was not following abbie he was merely making his way homeward through the new and rather longer route of bryant street and oakland park it had nothing at all to do with a girl it was a mere eccentric notion come on said jimmie gruffly to his retainer lets go home this way what fer demanded the retainer oh bcause huh oh its more fun goin this way the retainer was bored and loath but that mattered very little he did not know how to disobey his chief together they followed the trail of redhooded abbie and another small girl these latter at once understood the object of the chase and looking back giggling they pretended to quicken their pace but they were always looking back jimmie now began his courtship in earnest the first thing to do was to prove his strength in battle this was transacted by means of the retainer he took that devoted boy and flung him heavily to the ground meanwhile mouthing a preposterous ferocity the retainer accepted this behavior with a sort of bland resignation after his overthrow he raised himself coolly brushed some dust and dead leaves from his clothes and then seemed to forget the incident i can jump farthern you can said jimmie in a loud voice i know it responded the retainer simply but this would not do there must be a contest come on shouted jimmie imperiously lets see you jump the retainer selected a footing on the curb balanced and calculated a moment and jumped without enthusiasm jimmies leap of course was longer there he cried blowing out his lips i beat you didnt i easy i beat you he made a great hubbub as if the affair was unprecedented yes admitted the other emotionless later jimmie forced his retainer to run a race with him held more jumping matches flung him twice to earth and generally behaved as if a retainer was indestructible if the retainer had been in the plot it is conceivable that he would have endured this treatment with mere whispered halflaughing protests but he was not in the plot at all and so he became enigmatic one cannot often sound the profound well in which lie the meanings of boyhood following the two little girls jimmie eventually passed into that suburb of whilomville which is called oakland park at his heels came a badly battered retainer oakland park was a somewhat strange country to the boys they were dubious of the manners and customs and of course they would have to meet the local chieftains who might look askance upon this invasion jimmies girl departed into her home with a last backward glance that almost blinded the thrilling boy on this pretext and that pretext he kept his retainer in play before the house he had hopes that she would emerge as soon as she had deposited her schoolbag a boy came along the walk jimmie knew him at school he was tommie semple one of the weaklings who made friends with the fair sex hello tom said jimmie you live round here yeh said tom with composed pride at school he was afraid of jimmie but he did not evince any of this fear as he strolled well inside his own frontiers jimmie and his retainer had not expected this boy to display the manners of a minor chief and they contemplated him attentively there was a silence finally jimmie said i can put you down he moved forward briskly cant i he demanded the challenged boy backed away i know you can he declared frankly and promptly the little girl in the red hood had come out with a hoop she looked at jimmie with an air of insolent surprise in the fact that he still existed and began to trundle her hoop off towards some other little girls who were shrilly playing near a nursemaid and a perambulator jimmie adroitly shifted his position until he too was playing near the perambulator pretentiously making mincemeat out of his retainer and tommie semple of course little abbie had defined the meaning of jimmies appearance in oakland park despite this nonchalance and grand air of accident nothing could have been more plain whereupon she of course became insufferably vain in manner and whenever jimmie came near her she tossed her head and turned away her face and daintily swished her skirts as if he were contagion itself but jimmie was happy his soul was satisfied with the mere presence of the beloved object so long as he could feel that she furtively gazed upon him from time to time and noted his extraordinary prowess which he was proving upon the persons of his retainer and tommie semple and he was making an impression there could be no doubt of it he had many times caught her eye fixed admiringly upon him as he mauled the retainer indeed all the little girls gave attention to his deeds and he was the hero of the hour presently a boy on a velocipede was seen to be tooling down towards them whos this comin said jimmie bluntly to the semple boy thats horace glenn said tommie an hes got a new velocipede an he can ride it like anything can you lick him asked jimmie i dont i never fought with im answered the other he bravely tried to appear as a man of respectable achievement but with horace coming towards them the risk was too great however he added maybe i could the advent of horace on his new velocipede created a sensation which he haughtily accepted as a familiar thing only jimmie and his retainer remained silent and impassive horace eyed the two invaders hello jimmie hello horace after the typical silence jimmie said pompously i got a velocipede have you asked horace anxiously he did not wish anybody in the world but himself to possess a velocipede yes sang jimmie an its a bigger one than that too a good deal bigger an its a better one too huh retorted horace sceptically aint i clarence aint i aint i got one biggern that the retainer answered with alacrity yes he has a good deal bigger an its a dindy too this corroboration rather disconcerted horace but he continued to scoff at any statement that jimmie also owned a velocipede as for the contention that this supposed velocipede could be larger than his own he simply wouldnt hear of it jimmie had been a very gallant figure before the coming of horace but the new velocipede had relegated him to a squalid secondary position so he affected to look with contempt upon it voluminously he bragged of the velocipede in the stable at home he painted its virtues and beauty in loud and extravagant words flaming words and the retainer stood by glibly endorsing everything the little company heeded him and he passed on vociferously from extravagance to utter impossibility horace was very sick of it his defence was reduced to a mere mechanical grumbling dont believe you got one tall dont believe you got one tall jimmie turned upon him suddenly how fast can you go how fast can you go he demanded lets see i bet you cant go fast horace lifted his spirits and answered with proper defiance cant i he mocked cant i no you cant said jimmie you cant go fast horace cried well you see me now ill show you ill show you if i cant go fast taking a firm seat on his vermilion machine he pedalled furiously up the walk turned and pedalled back again there now he shouted triumphantly aint that fast there now there was a low murmur of appreciation from the little girls jimmie saw with pain that even his divinity was smiling upon his rival there aint that fast aint that fast he strove to pin jimmie down to an admission he was exuberant with victory notwithstanding a feeling of discomfiture jimmie did not lose a moment of time why he yelled that aint goin fast tall that aint goin fast tall why i can go almost twice as fast as that almost twice as fast cant i clarence the royal retainer nodded solemnly at the wideeyed group course you can why spouted jimmie you just ought to see me ride once you just ought to see me why i can go like the wind cant i clarence and i can ride far too oh awful far cant i clarence why i wouldnt have that one taint any good you just ought to see mine once the overwhelmed horace attempted to reconstruct his battered glories i can ride right over the curbstone at some of the crossins he announced brightly jimmies derision was a splendid sight right over the curbstone why that wouldnt be nothin for me to do ive rode mine down bridge street hill yessir aint i clarence why it aint nothin to ride over a curbstone not for me is it clarence down bridge street hill you never said horace hopelessly well didnt i clarence didnt i now the faithful retainer again nodded solemnly at the assemblage at last horace having fallen as low as was possible began to display a spirit for climbing up again oh you can do wonders he said laughing you can do wonders i spose you could ride down that bank there he asked with art he had indicated a grassy terrace some six feet in height which bounded one side of the walk at the bottom was a small ravine in which the reckless had flung ashes and tins i spose you could ride down that bank illustration i he began then he vanished from the edge of the walk all eyes now turned upon jimmie to detect a sign of his weakening but he instantly and sublimely arose to the occasion that bank he asked scornfully why ive ridden down banks like that many a time aint i clarence this was too much for the company a sound like the wind in the leaves arose it was the song of incredulity and ridicule o o o o o and on the outskirts a little girl suddenly shrieked out storyteller horace had certainly won a skirmish he was gleeful oh you can do wonders he gurgled you can do wonders the neighborhoods superficial hostility to foreigners arose like magic under the influence of his sudden success and horace had the delight of seeing jimmie persecuted in that manner known only to children and insects jimmie called angrily to the boy on the velocipede if youll lend me yours ill show you whether i can or not horace turned his superior nose in the air oh no i dont ever lend it then he thought of a blow which would make jimmies humiliation complete besides he said airily taint really anything hard to do i could do it easy if i wanted to but his supposed adherents instead of receiving this boast with cheers looked upon him in a sudden blank silence jimmie and his retainer pounced like cats upon their advantage oh they yelled you could eh well lets see you do it then lets see you do it lets see you do it now in a moment the crew of little spectators were gibing at horace the blow that would make jimmies humiliation complete instead it had boomeranged horace into the mud he kept up a sullen muttering taint really anything i could if i wanted to dare you to screeched jimmie and his partisans dare you to dare you to dare you to there were two things to be done to make gallant effort or to retreat somewhat to their amazement the children at last found horace moving through their clamor to the edge of the bank sitting on the velocipede he looked at the ravine and then with gloomy pride at the other children a hush came upon them for it was seen that he was intending to make some kind of an antemortem statement i he began then he vanished from the edge of the walk the start had been unintentional an accident the stupefied jimmie saw the calamity through a haze his first clear vision was when horace with a face as red as a red flag arose bawling from his tangled velocipede he and his retainer exchanged a glance of horror and fled the neighborhood they did not look back until they had reached the top of the hill near the lake they could see horace walking slowly under the maples towards his home pushing his shattered velocipede before him his chin was thrown high and the breeze bore them the sound of his howls v making an orator in the school at whilomville it was the habit when children had progressed to a certain class to have them devote friday afternoon to what was called elocution this was in the piteously ignorant belief that orators were thus made by process of school law unfortunate boys and girls were dragged up to address their fellowscholars in the literature of the midcentury probably the children who were most capable of expressing themselves the children who were most sensitive to the power of speech suffered the most wrong little blockheads who could learn eight lines of conventional poetry and could get up and spin it rapidly at their classmates did not undergo a single pang the plan operated mainly to agonize many children permanently against arising to speak their thought to fellowcreatures jimmie trescott had an idea that by exhibition of undue ignorance he could escape from being promoted into the first class room which exacted such penalty from its inmates he preferred to dwell in a less classic shade rather than venture into a domain where he was obliged to perform a certain duty which struck him as being worse than death however willynilly he was somehow sent ahead into the place of torture every friday at least ten of the little children had to mount the stage beside the teachers desk and babble something which none of them understood this was to make them orators if it had been ordered that they should croak like frogs it would have advanced most of them just as far towards oratory alphabetically jimmie trescott was near the end of the list of victims but his time was none the less inevitable tanner timmens trass trescott he saw his downfall approaching he was passive to the teacher while she drove into his mind the incomprehensible lines of the charge of the light brigade half a league half a league half a league onward he had no conception of a league if in the ordinary course of life somebody had told him that he was half a league from home he might have been frightened that half a league was fifty miles but he struggled manfully with the valley of death and a mystic six hundred who were performing something there which was very fine he had been told he learned all the verses but as his own friday afternoon approached he was moved to make known to his family that a dreadful disease was upon him and was likely at any time to prevent him from going to his beloved school on the great friday when the children of his initials were to speak their pieces dr trescott was away from home and the mother of the boy was alarmed beyond measure at jimmies curious illness which caused him to lie on the rug in front of the fire and groan cavernously she bathed his feet in hot mustard water until they were lobsterred she also placed a mustard plaster on his chest he announced that these remedies did him no good at all no good at all with an air of martyrdom he endured a perfect downpour of motherly attention all that day thus the first friday was passed in safety with singular patience he sat before the fire in the diningroom and looked at picturebooks only complaining of pain when he suspected his mother of thinking that he was getting better the next day being saturday and a holiday he was miraculously delivered from the arms of disease and went forth to play a blatantly healthy boy he had no further attack until thursday night of the next week when he announced that he felt very very poorly the mother was already chronically alarmed over the condition of her son but dr trescott asked him questions which denoted some incredulity on the third friday jimmie was dropped at the door of the school from the doctors buggy the other children notably those who had already passed over the mountain of distress looked at him with glee seeing in him another lamb brought to butchery seated at his desk in the schoolroom jimmie sometimes remembered with dreadful distinctness every line of the charge of the light brigade and at other times his mind was utterly empty of it geography arithmetic and spelling usually great tasks quite rolled off him his mind was dwelling with terror upon the time when his name should be called and he was obliged to go up to the platform turn bow and recite his message to his fellowmen desperate expedients for delay came to him if he could have engaged the services of a real pain he would have been glad but steadily inexorably the minutes marched on towards his great crisis and all his plans for escape blended into a mere panic fear the maples outside were defeating the weakening rays of the afternoon sun and in the shadowed schoolroom had come a stillness in which nevertheless one could feel the complacence of the little pupils who had already passed through the flames they were calmly prepared to recognize as a spectacle the torture of others little johnnie tanner opened the ceremony he stamped heavily up to the platform and bowed in such a manner that he almost fell down he blurted out that it would ill befit him to sit silent while the name of his fair ireland was being reproached and he appealed to the gallant soldier before him if every british battlefield was not sown with the bones of sons of the emerald isle he was also heard to say that he had listened with deepening surprise and scorn to the insinuation of the honorable member from north glenmorganshire that the loyalty of the irish regiments in her majestys service could be questioned to what purpose then he asked had the blood of irishmen flowed on a hundred fields to what purpose had irishmen gone to their death with bravery and devotion in every part of the world where the victorious flag of england had been carried if the honorable member for north glenmorganshire insisted upon construing a mere pothouse row between soldiers in dublin into a grand treachery to the colors and to her majestys uniform then it was time for ireland to think bitterly of her dead sons whose graves now marked every step of englands progress and yet who could have their honors stripped from them so easily by the honorable member for north glenmorganshire furthermore the honorable member for north glenmorganshire it is needless to say that little johnnie tanners language made it exceedingly hot for the honorable member for north glenmorganshire but johnnie was not angry he was only in haste he finished the honorable member for north glenmorganshire in what might be called a gallop susie timmens then went to the platform and with a face as pale as death whisperingly reiterated that she would be queen of the may the child represented there a perfect picture of unnecessary suffering her small lips were quite blue and her eyes opened wide stared with a look of horror at nothing the phlegmatic trass boy with his moon face only expressing peasant parentage calmly spoke some undeniably true words concerning destiny in his seat jimmie trescott was going half blind with fear of his approaching doom he wished that the trass boy would talk forever about destiny if the schoolhouse had taken fire he thought that he would have felt simply relief anything was better death amid the flames was preferable to a recital of the charge of the light brigade but the trass boy finished his remarks about destiny in a very short time jimmie heard the teacher call his name and he felt the whole world look at him he did not know how he made his way to the stage parts of him seemed to be of lead and at the same time parts of him seemed to be light as air detached his face had gone as pale as had been the face of susie timmens he was simply a child in torment that is all there is to be said specifically about it and to intelligent people the exhibition would have been not more edifying than a dogfight illustation and then he suddenly said half a leg he bowed precariously choked made an inarticulate sound and then he suddenly said half a leg league said the teacher coolly half a leg league said the teacher league repeated jimmie wildly half a league half a league half a league onward he paused here and looked wretchedly at the teacher half a league he muttered half a league he seemed likely to keep continuing this phrase indefinitely so after a time the teacher said well go on half a league responded jimmie the teacher had the opened book before her and she read from it all in the valley of death rode the go on she concluded jimmie said all in the valley of death rode the the the he cast a glance of supreme appeal upon the teacher and breathlessly whispered rode the what the young woman flushed with indignation to the roots of her hair rode the six hundred she snapped at him the class was arustle with delight at this cruel display they were no better than a roman populace in neros time jimmie started off again half a leg league half a league half a league onward all in the valley of death rode the six hundred forward forward forward the light brigade suggested the teacher sharply the light brigade said jimmie he was about to die of the ignoble pain of his position as for tennysons lines they had all gone grandly out of his mind leaving it a whited wall the teachers indignation was still rampant she looked at the miserable wretch before her with an angry stare you stay in after school and learn that all over again she commanded and be prepared to speak it next friday i am astonished at you jimmie go to your seat if she had suddenly and magically made a spirit of him and left him free to soar high above all the travail of our earthly lives she could not have overjoyed him more he fled back to his seat without hearing the lowtoned gibes of his schoolmates he gave no thought to the terrors of the next friday the evils of the day had been sufficient and to a childish mind a week is a great space of time with the delightful inconsistency of his age he sat in blissful calm and watched the sufferings of an unfortunate boy named zimmerman who was the next victim of education jimmie of course did not know that on this day there had been laid for him the foundation of a finished incapacity for public speaking which would be his until he died vi shame dont come in here botherin me said the cook intolerantly what with your mother bein away on a visit an your father comin home soon to lunch i have enough on my mind and that without bein bothered with you the kitchen is no place for little boys anyhow run away and dont be interferin with my work she frowned and made a grand pretence of being deep in herculean labors but jimmie did not run away now theyre goin to have a picnic he said half audibly what now theyre goin to have a picnic whos goin to have a picnic demanded the cook loudly her accent could have led one to suppose that if the projectors did not turn out to be the proper parties she immediately would forbid this picnic jimmie looked at her with more hopefulness after twenty minutes of futile skirmishing he had at least succeeded in introducing the subject to her question he answered eagerly oh everybody lots and lots of boys and girls everybody whos everybody according to custom jimmie began to singsong through his nose in a quite indescribable fashion an enumeration of the prospective picnickers willie dalzel an dan earl an ella earl an wolcott margate an reeves margate an walter phelps an homer phelps an minnie phelps an oh lots more girls an everybody an their mothers an big sisters too then he announced a new bit of information theyre goin to have a picnic well let them said the cook blandly jimmie fidgeted for a time in silence at last he murmured i now i thought maybe youd let me go the cook turned from her work with an air of irritation and amazement that jimmie should still be in the kitchen whos stoppin you she asked sharply i aint stoppin you am i no admitted jimmie in a low voice well why dont you go then nobodys stoppin you but said jimmie i you now each fellow has got to take somethin to eat with m oh ho cried the cook triumphantly so thats it is it so thats what youve been shyin round here fer eh well you may as well take yourself off without more words what with your mother bein away on a visit an your father comin home soon to his lunch i have enough on my mind an that without being bothered with you jimmie made no reply but moved in grief towards the door the cook continued some people in this house seem to think theres bout a thousand cooks in this kitchen where i used to work bfore there was some reason in em i aint a horse a picnic jimmie said nothing but he loitered seems as if i had enough to do without havin you come round talkin about picnics nobody ever seems to think of the work i have to do nobody ever seems to think of it then they come and talk to me about picnics what do i care about picnics jimmie loitered where i used to work bfore there was some reason in em i never heard tell of no picnics right on top of your mother bein away on a visit an your father comin home soon to his lunch its all foolishness little jimmie leaned his head flat against the wall and began to weep she stared at him scornfully cryin eh cryin what are you cryin fer nnnothin sobbed jimmie there was a silence save for jimmies convulsive breathing at length the cook said stop that blubberin now stop it this kitchen aint no place fer it stop it very well if you dont stop i wont give you nothin to go to the picnic with there for the moment he could not end his tears you never said he sputtered you never said youd give me anything an why would i she cried angrily why would i with you in here acryin an ablubberin an ableatin round enough to drive a woman crazy i dont see how you could expect me to the idea suddenly jimmie announced ive stopped cryin i aint goin to cry no more tall well then grumbled the cook well then stop it ive got enough on my mind it chanced that she was making for luncheon some salmon croquettes a tin still half full of pinky prepared fish was beside her on the table still grumbling she seized a loaf of bread and wielding a knife she cut from this loaf four slices each of which was as big as a sixshilling novel she profligately spread them with butter and jabbing the point of her knife into the salmontin she brought up bits of salmon which she flung and flattened upon the bread then she crashed the pieces of bread together in pairs much as one would clash cymbals there was no doubt in her own mind but that she had created two sandwiches there she cried thatll do you all right lemme see what ll i put em in there ive got it she thrust the sandwiches into a small pail and jammed on the lid jimmie was ready for the picnic oh thank you mary he cried joyfully and in a moment he was off running swiftly the picnickers had started nearly half an hour earlier owing to his inability to quickly attack and subdue the cook but he knew that the rendezvous was in the grove of tall pillarlike hemlocks and pines that grew on a rocky knoll at the lake shore his heart was very light as he sped swinging his pail but a few minutes previously his soul had been gloomed in despair now he was happy he was going to the picnic where privilege of participation was to be bought by the contents of the little tin pail when he arrived in the outskirts of the grove he heard a merry clamor and when he reached the top of the knoll he looked down the slope upon a scene which almost made his little breast burst with joy they actually had two campfires two campfires at one of them mrs earl was making something chocolate no doubt and at the other a young lady in white duck and a sailor hat was dropping eggs into boiling water other grownup people had spread a white cloth and were laying upon it things from baskets in the deep cool shadow of the trees the children scurried laughing jimmie hastened forward to join his friends homer phelps caught first sight of him ho he shouted here comes jimmie trescott come on jimmie you be on our side the children had divided themselves into two bands for some purpose of play the others of homer phelpss party loudly endorsed his plan yes jimmie you be on our side then arose the usual dispute well we got the weakest side taint any weakern ours homer phelps suddenly started and looking hard said what you got in the pail jim jimmie answered somewhat uneasily got m lunch in it instantly that brat of a minnie phelps simply tore down the sky with her shrieks of derision got his lunch in it in a pail she ran screaming to her mother oh mamma oh mamma jimmie trescotts got his picnic in a pail now there was nothing in the nature of this fact to particularly move the others notably the boys who were not competent to care if he had brought his luncheon in a coalbin but such is the instinct of childish society that they all immediately moved away from him in a moment he had been made a social leper all old intimacies were flung into the lake so to speak they dared not compromise themselves at safe distances the boys shouted scornfully huh got his picnic in a pail never again during that picnic did the little girls speak of him as jimmie trescott his name now was him his mind was dark with pain as he stood the hangdog kicking the gravel and muttering as defiantly as he was able well i can have it in a pail if i want to this statement of freedom was of no importance and he knew it but it was the only idea in his head illustration jimmy trescotts got his picnic in a pail he had been baited at school for being detected in writing a letter to little cora the angel child and he had known how to defend himself but this situation was in no way similar this was a social affair with grown people on all sides it would be sweet to catch the margate twins for instance and hammer them into a state of bleating respect for his pail but that was a matter for the jungles of childhood where grown folk seldom penetrated he could only glower the amiable voice of mrs earl suddenly called come children everythings ready they scampered away glancing back for one last gloat at jimmie standing there with his pail he did not know what to do he knew that the grown folk expected him at the spread but if he approached he would be greeted by a shameful chorus from the children more especially from some of those damnable little girls still luxuries beyond all dreaming were heaped on that cloth one could not forget them perhaps if he crept up modestly and was very gentle and very nice to the little girls they would allow him peace of course it had been dreadful to come with a pail to such a grand picnic but they might forgive him oh no they would not he knew them better and then suddenly he remembered with what delightful expectations he had raced to this grove and selfpity overwhelmed him and he thought he wanted to die and make every one feel sorry the young lady in white duck and a sailor hat looked at him and then spoke to her sister mrs earl whos that hovering in the distance emily mrs earl peered why its jimmie trescott jimmie come to the picnic why dont you come to the picnic jimmie he began to sidle towards the cloth but at mrs earls call there was another outburst from many of the children hes got his picnic in a pail in a pail got it in a pail minnie phelps was a shrill fiend oh mamma hes got it in that pail see isnt it funny isnt it dreadful funny what ghastly prigs children are emily said the young lady they are spoiling that boys whole day breaking his heart the little cats i think ill go over and talk to him maybe you had better not answered mrs earl dubiously somehow these things arrange themselves if you interfere you are likely to prolong everything well ill try at least said the young lady at the second outburst against him jimmie had crouched down by a tree half hiding behind it half pretending that he was not hiding behind it he turned his sad gaze towards the lake the bit of water seen through the shadows seemed perpendicular a slatecolored wall he heard a noise near him and turning he perceived the young lady looking down at him in her hand she held plates may i sit near you she asked coolly jimmie could hardly believe his ears after disposing herself and the plates upon the pine needles she made brief explanation theyre rather crowded you see over there i dont like to be crowded at a picnic so i thought id come here i hope you dont mind jimmie made haste to find his tongue oh i dont mind i like to have you here the ingenuous emphasis made it appear that the fact of his liking to have her there was in the nature of a lawdispelling phenomenon but she did not smile how large is that lake she asked jimmie falling into the snare at once began to talk in the manner of a proprietor of the lake oh its almost twenty miles long an in one place its almost four miles wide an its deep too awful deep an its got real steamboats on it an oh lots of other boats an an an do you go out on it sometimes oh lots of times my fathers got a boat he said eying her to note the effect of his words she was correctly pleased and struck with wonder oh has he she cried as if she never before had heard of a man owning a boat jimmie continued yes an its a grea big boat too with sails real sails an sometimes he takes me out in her too an once he took me fishin an we had sandwiches plenty of em an my father he drank beer right out of the bottle right out of the bottle the young lady was properly overwhelmed by this amazing intelligence jimmie saw the impression he had created and he enthusiastically resumed his narrative an after he let me throw the bottles in the water and i throwed em way way way out an they sank an never comed up he concluded dramatically his face was glorified he had forgotten all about the pail he was absorbed in this communion with a beautiful lady who was so interested in what he had to say she indicated one of the plates and said indifferently perhaps you would like some of those sandwiches i made them do you like olives and theres a deviled egg i made that also did you really said jimmie politely his face gloomed for a moment because the pail was recalled to his mind but he timidly possessed himself of a sandwich hope you are not going to scorn my deviled egg said his goddess i am very proud of it he did not he scorned little that was on the plate their gentle intimacy was ineffable to the boy he thought he had a friend a beautiful lady who liked him more than she did anybody at the picnic to say the least this was proved by the fact that she had flung aside the luxuries of the spread cloth to sit with him the exile thus early did he fall a victim to womans wiles where do you live he asked suddenly oh a long way from here in new york his next question was put very bluntly are you married oh no she answered gravely jimmie was silent for a time during which he glanced shyly and furtively up at her face it was evident that he was somewhat embarrassed finally he said when i grow up to be a man oh that is some time yet said the beautiful lady but when i do i i should like to marry you well i will remember it she answered but dont talk of it now because its such a long time and i wouldnt wish you to consider yourself bound she smiled at him he began to brag when i grow up to be a man im goin to have lots an lots of money an im goin to have a grea big house an a horse an a shotgun an lots an lots of books bout elephants an tigers an lots an lots of icecream an pie an caramels as before she was impressed he could see it an im goin to have lots an lots of children bout three hundred i guess an there wont none of em be girls theyll all be boys like me oh my she said his garment of shame was gone from him the pail was dead and well buried it seemed to him that months elapsed as he dwelt in happiness near the beautiful lady and trumpeted his vanity at last there was a shout come on were going home the picnickers trooped out of the grove the children wished to resume their jeering for jimmie still gripped his pail but they were restrained by the circumstances he was walking at the side of the beautiful lady during this journey he abandoned many of his habits for instance he never travelled without skipping gracefully from crack to crack between the stones or without pretending that he was a train of cars or without some mumming device of childhood but now he behaved with dignity he made no more noise than a little mouse he escorted the beautiful lady to the gate of the earl home where he awkwardly solemnly and wistfully shook hands in goodby he watched her go up the walk the door clanged on his way home he dreamed one of these dreams was fascinating supposing the beautiful lady was his teacher in school oh my wouldnt he be a good boy sitting like a statuette all day long and knowing every lesson to perfection and everything and then supposing that a boy should sass her jimmie painted himself waylaying that boy on the homeward road and the fate of the boy was a thing to make strong men cover their eyes with their hands and she would like him more and more more and more and he he would be a little god but as he was entering his fathers grounds an appalling recollection came to him he was returning with the breadandbutter and the salmon untouched in the pail he could imagine the cook nine feet tall waving her fist an so thats what i took trouble for is it sos you could bring it back sos you could bring it back he skulked towards the house like a marauding bushranger when he neared the kitchen door he made a desperate rush past it aiming to gain the stables and there secrete his guilt he was nearing them when a thunderous voice hailed him from the rear jimmie trescott where you goin with that pail it was the cook he made no reply but plunged into the shelter of the stables he whirled the lid from the pail and dashed its contents beneath a heap of blankets then he stood panting his eyes on the door the cook did not pursue but she was bawling jimmie trescott what you doin with that pail he came forth swinging it nothin he said in virtuous protest i know better she said sharply as she relieved him of his curse in the morning jimmie was playing near the stable when he heard a shout from peter washington who attended dr trescotts horse jim oh jim what come yah jimmie went reluctantly to the door of the stable and peter washington asked wuts dish yere fish an brade doin unner dese yer blankups i dont know i didnt have nothin to do with it answered jimmie indignantly don tell me cried peter washington as he flung it all away don tell me when i fin fish an brade unner dese yer blankups i don go an think dese yer hoses er yer pops put em i know an if i caitch enny more dish yer fish an brade in dish yer stable ill tell yer pop vii the carriagelamps it was the fault of a small nickelplated revolver a most incompetent weapon which wherever one aimed would fling the bullet as the devil willed and no man when about to use it could tell exactly what was in store for the surrounding country this treasure had been acquired by jimmie trescott after arduous bargaining with another small boy jimmie wended homeward patting his hip pocket at every three paces peter washington working in the carriagehouse looked out upon him with a shrewd eye oh jim he called wut you got in yer hind pocket nothin said jimmie feeling carefully under his jacket to make sure that the revolver wouldnt fall out peter chuckled smore foolishness i raikon you gwine be hung one day jim you keep up all dish yer nonsense jimmie made no reply but went into the back garden where he hid the revolver in a box under a lilacbush then he returned to the vicinity of peter and began to cruise to and fro in the offing showing all the signals of one wishing to open treaty pete he said how much does a box of cartridges cost peter raised himself violently holding in one hand a piece of harness and in the other an old rag catridgers catridgers lansake wut the kid want with catridgers knew it knew it come home erholdin on to his hind pocket like he got money in it an now he want catridgers jimmie after viewing with dismay the excitement caused by his question began to move warily out of the reach of a possible hostile movement catridgers continued peter in scorn and horror kid like you no biggern er minute look yah jim you done been swappin round an you done got hol of er pistol the charge was dramatic the wind was almost knocked out of jimmie by this display of peters terrible miraculous power and as he backed away his feeble denials were more convincing than a confession ill tell yer pop cried peter in virtuous grandeur ill tell yer pop in the distance jimmie stood appalled he knew not what to do the dread adult wisdom of peter washington had laid bare the sin and disgrace stared at jimmie there was a whirl of wheels and a high lean trottingmare spun doctor trescotts buggy towards peter who ran forward busily as the doctor climbed out peter holding the mares head began his denunciation docteh i gwine tell on jim he come home erholdin on to his hind pocket an proud like he won a tuhkeyraffle an i sure know what he been up to an i done challenge him an he nev say he didnt why what do you mean said the doctor whats this jimmie the boy came forward glaring wrathfully at peter in fact he suddenly was so filled with rage at peter that he forgot all precautions its about a pistol he said bluntly ive got a pistol i swapped for it i done tol im his pop wouldn stand no fiahawms an him a kid like he is i done tol im lan sake he strut like he was a soldier come in yere proud an erholdin on to his hind pocket he think he was jesse james i

kids come foolishin round me with fiahawms no seh i retiahs oh be quiet peter said the doctor where is this thing jimmie the boy went sulkily to the box under the lilacbush and returned with the revolver here tis he said with a glare over his shoulder at peter the doctor looked at the silly weapon in critical contempt its not much of a thing jimmie but i dont think you are quite old enough for it yet ill keep it for you in one of the drawers of my desk peter washington burst out proudly i done tol im th docteh wouldn stan no traffickin round yere with fiahawms i done tol im jimmie and his father went together into the house and as peter unharnessed the mare he continued his comments on the boy and the revolver he was not cast down by the absence of hearers in fact he usually talked better when there was no one to listen save the horses but now his observations bore small resemblance to his earlier and public statements admiration and the keen family pride of a southern negro who has been long in one place were now in his tone that boy hes er devil when he get to be er man wow hell jes take an make things whirl round yere raikon well all take er back seat when he come erlong erraisin cain he had unharnessed the mare and with his back bent was pushing the buggy into the carriagehouse er pistol an him no bigger than er minute a small stone whizzed past peters head and clattered on the stable he hastily dropped all occupation and struck a curious attitude his right knee was almost up to his chin and his arms were wreathed protectingly about his head he had not looked in the direction from which the stone had come but he had begun immediately to yell illustration you jim quit quit i tell yer you jim quit quit i tell yer jim watch out you gwine break somethin jim yah taunted the boy as with the speed and ease of a lightcavalryman he manoeuvred in the distance yah told on me did you told on me hey there how do you like that the missiles resounded against the stable watch out jim you gwine break something jim i tell yer quit yer foolishness jim ow watch out boy i there was a crash with diabolic ingenuity one of jimmies pebbles had entered the carriagehouse and had landed among a row of carriagelamps on a shelf creating havoc which was apparently beyond all reason of physical law it seemed to jimmie that the racket of falling glass could have been heard in an adjacent county peter was a prophet who after persecution was suffered to recall everything to the mind of the persecutor there knew it knew it now i raikon youll quit hi jes look ut dese yer lamps fer lan sake oh now yer pop jes break evry bone in yer body in the doorway of the kitchen the cook appeared with a startled face jimmies father and mother came suddenly out on the front veranda what was that noise called the the doctor peter went forward to explain jim he was erheavin rocks at me docteh an erlong come one rock an go blam inter all th lamps an jes skitter em t bits i declayah jimmie half blinded with emotion was nevertheless aware of a lightning glance from his father a glance which cowed and frightened him to the ends of his toes he heard the steady but deadly tones of his father in a fury go into the house and wait until i come bowed in anguish the boy moved across the lawn and up the steps his mother was standing on the veranda still gazing towards the stable he loitered in the faint hope that she might take some small pity on his state but she could have heeded him no less if he had been invisible he entered the house when the doctor returned from his investigation of the harm done by jimmies hand mrs trescott looked at him anxiously for she knew that he was concealing some volcanic impulses well she asked it isnt the lamps he said at first he seated himself on the rail i dont know what we are going to do with that boy it isnt so much the lamps as it is the other thing he was throwing stones at peter because peter told me about the revolver what are we going to do with him im sure i dont know replied the mother weve tried almost everything of course much of it is pure animal spirits jimmie is not naturally vicious oh i know interrupted the doctor impatiently do you suppose when the stones were singing about peters ears he cared whether they were flung by a boy who was naturally vicious or a boy who was not the question might interest him afterward but at the time he was mainly occupied in dodging these effects of pure animal spirits dont be too hard on the boy ned theres lots of time yet hes so young yet and i believe he gets most of his naughtiness from that wretched dalzel boy that dalzel boy well hes simply awful then with true motherly instinct to shift blame from her own boys shoulders she proceeded to sketch the character of the dalzel boy in lines that would have made that talented young vagabond stare it was not admittedly her feeling that the doctors attention should be diverted from the main issue and his indignation divided among the camps but presently the doctor felt himself burn with wrath for the dalzel boy why dont you keep jimmie away from him he demanded jimmie has no business consorting with abandoned little predestined jailbirds like him if i catch him on the place ill box his ears it is simply impossible unless we kept jimmie shut up all the time said mrs trescott i cant watch him every minute of the day and the moment my back is turned hes off i should think those dalzel people would hire somebody to bring up their child for them said the doctor they dont seem to know how to do it themselves presently you would have thought from the talk that one willie dalzel had been throwing stones at peter washington because peter washington had told doctor trescott that willie dalzel had come into possession of a revolver in the mean time jimmie had gone into the house to await the coming of his father he was in a rebellious mood he had not intended to destroy the carriagelamps he had been merely hurling stones at a creature whose perfidy deserved such action and the hitting of the lamps had been merely another move of the great conspirator fate to force one jimmie trescott into dark and troublous ways the boy was beginning to find the world a bitter place he couldnt win appreciation for a single virtue he could only achieve quick rigorous punishment for his misdemeanors everything was an enemy now there were those silly old lamps what were they doing up on that shelf anyhow it would have been just as easy for them at the time to have been in some other place but no there they had been like the crowd that is passing under the wall when the mason for the first time in twenty years lets fall a brick furthermore the flight of that stone had been perfectly unreasonable it had been a sort of freak in physical law jimmie understood that he might have thrown stones from the same fatal spot for an hour without hurting a single lamp he was a victim that was it fate had conspired with the detail of his environment to simply hound him into a grave or into a cell but who would understand who would understand and here the boy turned his mental glance in every direction and found nothing but what was to him the black of cruel ignorance very well some day they would from somewhere out in the street he heard a peculiar whistle of two notes it was the common signal of the boys in the neighborhood and judging from the direction of the sound it was apparently intended to summon him he moved immediately to one of the windows of the sittingroom it opened upon a part of the grounds remote from the stables and cut off from the veranda by a wing he perceived willie dalzel loitering in the street jimmie whistled the signal after having pushed up the windowsash some inches he saw the dalzel boy turn and regard him and then call several other boys they stood in a group and gestured these gestures plainly said come out weve got something on hand jimmie sadly shook his head but they did not go away they held a long consultation presently jimmie saw the intrepid dalzel boy climb the fence and begin to creep among the shrubbery in elaborate imitation of an indian scout in time he arrived under jimmies window and raised his face to whisper come on out were going on a bearhunt a bearhunt of course jimmie knew that it would not be a real bearhunt but would be a sort of carouse of pretension and big talking and preposterous lying and valor wherein each boy would strive to have himself called kit carson by the others he was profoundly affected however the parental word was upon him and he could not move no he answered i cant ive got to stay in are you a prisoner demanded the dalzel boy eagerly noo yes i spose i am the other lad became much excited but he did not lose his wariness dont you want to be rescued why no i dunno replied jimmie dubiously willie dalzel was indignant why of course you want to be rescued well rescue you ill go and get my men and thinking this a good sentence he repeated pompously ill go and get my men he began to crawl away but when he was distant some ten paces he turned to say keep up a stout heart remember that you have friends who will be faithful unto death the time is not now far off when you will again view the blessed sunlight the poetry of these remarks filled jimmie with ecstasy and he watched eagerly for the coming of the friends who would be faithful unto death they delayed some time for the reason that willie dalzel was making a speech now men he said our comrade is a prisoner in yon in yond in that there fortress we must to the rescue who volunteers to go with me he fixed them with a stern eye there was a silence and then one of the smaller boys remarked if doc trescott ketches us trackin over his lawn willie dalzel pounced upon the speaker and took him by the throat the two presented a sort of a burlesque of the woodcut on the cover of a dime novel which willie had just been reading the red captain a tale of the pirates of the spanish main you are a coward said willie through his clinched teeth no i aint willie piped the other as best he could i say you are cried the great chieftain indignantly dont tell me im a liar he relinquished his hold upon the coward and resumed his speech you know me men many of you have been my followers for long years you saw me slay sixhanded dick with my own hand you know i never falter our comrade is a prisoner in the cruel hands of our enemies aw pete washington he dassent my pa says if pete ever troubles me hell brain im come on to the rescue who will go with me to the rescue aw come on what are you afraid of illustration he turned to say keep up a stout heart it was another instance of the power of eloquence upon the human mind there was only one boy who was not thrilled by this oration and he was a boy whose favorite reading had been of the roadagents and gunfighters of the great west and he thought the whole thing should be conducted in the deadwood dick manner this talk of a comrade was silly pard was the proper word he resolved that he would make a show of being a pirate and keep secret the fact that he really was holdup harry the terror of the sierras but the others were knit close in piratical bonds one by one they climbed the fence at a point hidden from the house by tall shrubs with many a lowbreathed caution they went upon their perilous adventure jimmie was grown tired of waiting for his friends who would be faithful unto death finally he decided that he would rescue himself it would be a gross breach of rule but he couldnt sit there all the rest of the day waiting for his faithfuluntodeath friends the window was only five feet from the ground he softly raised the sash and threw one leg over the sill but at the same time he perceived his friends snaking among the bushes he withdrew his leg and waited seeing that he was now to be rescued in an orthodox way the brave pirates came nearer and nearer jimmie heard a noise of a closing door and turning he saw his father in the room looking at him and the open window in angry surprise boys never faint but jimmie probably came as near to it as may the average boy whats all this asked the doctor staring involuntarily jimmie glanced over his shoulder through the window his father saw the creeping figures what are those boys doing he said sharply and he knit his brows nothin nothing dont tell me that are they coming here to the window yes sir what for to to see me what about about about nothin what about jimmie knew that he could conceal nothing illustration the boy turned again to his friend he said theyre comin to to to rescue me he began to whimper the doctor sat down heavily what to rescue you he gasped yyes sir the doctors eyes began to twinkle very well he said presently i will sit here and observe this rescue and on no account do you warn them that i am here understand of course jimmie understood he had been mad to warn his friends but his fathers mere presence had frightened him from doing it he stood trembling at the window while the doctor stretched in an easychair near at hand they waited the doctor could tell by his sons increasing agitation that the great moment was near suddenly he heard willie dalzels voice hiss out a word sssilence then the same voice addressed jimmie at the window good cheer my comrade the time is now at hand i have come never did the red captain turn his back on a friend one minute more and you will be free once aboard my gallant craft and you can bid defiance to your haughty enemies why dont you hurry up what are you standin there lookin like a cow for i er now you stammered jimmie here holdup harry the terror of the sierras evidently concluded that willie dalzel had had enough of the premier part so he said brace up pard dont ye turn whitelivered now fer ye know that holdup harry the terrar of the sarahs aint the man ter oh stop it said willie dalzel he wont understand that you know hes a pirate now jimmie come on be of light heart my comrade soon you i low arter all this here long time in jail ye thought ye had no friends mebbe but i tell ye holdup harry the terrar of the sarahs a boat is waitin i have ready a trusty horse willie dalzel could endure his rival no longer look here henry youre spoilin the whole thing were all pirates dont you see and youre a pirate too i aint a pirate im holdup harry the terrar of the sarahs you aint i say said willie in despair youre spoilin everything you are all right now you wait ill fix you for this see if i dont oh come on jimmie a boat awaits us at the foot of the rocks in one short hour youll be free forever from your ex exewable enemies and their vile plots hasten for the dawn approaches illustration they whirled and scampered away like deer the suffering jimmie looked at his father and was surprised at what he saw the doctor was doubled up like a man with the colic he was breathing heavily the boy turned again to his friends i now look here he began stumbling among the words you i i dont think ill be rescued today the pirates were scandalized what they whispered angrily aint you goin to be rescued well all right for you jimmie trescott thats a nice way to act that is their upturned eyes glowered at jimmie suddenly doctor trescott appeared at the window with jimmie oh go home boys he gasped but they did not hear him upon the instant they had whirled and scampered away like deer the first lad to reach the fence was the red captain but holdup harry the terror of the sierras was so close that there was little to choose between them doctor trescott lowered the window and then spoke to his son in his usual quiet way jimmie i wish you would go and tell peter to have the buggy ready at seven oclock yes sir said jimmie and he swaggered out to the stables pete father wants the buggy ready at seven oclock peter paid no heed to this order but with the tender sympathy of a true friend he inquired hut hurt did what hurt yer trouncin trouncin said jimmie contemptuously i didnt get any trouncin no said peter he gave jimmie a quick shrewd glance and saw that he was telling the truth he began to mutter and mumble over his work ump ump dese yer white folks act like they think er boys made er glass no trouncin ump he was consumed with curiosity to learn why jimmie had not felt a heavy parental hand but he did not care to lower his dignity by asking questions about it at last however he reached the limits of his endurance and in a voice pretentiously careless he asked didn yer pop take on like mad erbout dese yer caygelamps carriagelamps inquired jimmie ump no he didnt say anything about carriagelamps not that i remember maybe he did though lemme see no he never mentioned em viii the knife i si bryants place was on the shore of the lake and his gardenpatch shielded from the north by a bold little promontory and a higher ridge inland was accounted the most successful and surprising in all whilomville township one afternoon si was working in the gardenpatch when doctor trescotts man peter washington came trudging slowly along the road observing nature he scanned the white mans fine agricultural results take your eye off them there mellons you rascal said si placidly the negros face widened in a grin of delight well mist bryant i raikon i aint ony make msef covertous erlookin at dem yere mellums sure nough dey suhtainly is grand thats all right responded si with affected bitterness of spirit thats all right just dont you admire em too much thats all peter chuckled and chuckled ma lode mist bryant yyyou don think im gwine come prowlin in dish yer gawden no i know you haint said si with solemnity bcause if you did id shoot you so full of holes you couldnt tell yourself from a sponge um no seh no seh i don raikon youll get chance at pete mist bryant no seh ill take an run long an rob er bank fore ill come foolishin round your gawden mist bryant bryant gnarled and strong as an old tree leaned on his hoe and laughed a yankee laugh his mouth remained tightly closed but the sinister lines which ran from the sides of his nose to the meetings of his lips developed to form a comic oval and he emitted a series of grunts while his eyes gleamed merrily and his shoulders shook pete on the contrary threw back his head and guffawed thunderously the effete joke in regard to an american negros fondness for watermelons was still an admirable pleasantry to them and this was not the first time they had engaged in badinage over it in fact this venerable survival had formed between them a friendship of casual roadside quality afterwards peter went on up the road he continued to chuckle until he was far away he was going to pay a visit to old alek williams a negro who lived with a large family in a hut clinging to the side of a mountain the scattered colony of negroes which hovered near whilomville was of interesting origin being the result of some contrabands who had drifted as far north as whilomville during the great civil war the descendants of these adventurers were mainly conspicuous for their bewildering number and the facility which they possessed for adding even to this number speaking for example of the jacksons one couldnt hurl a stone into the hills about whilomville without having it land on the roof of a hut full of jacksons the town reaped little in labor from these curious suburbs there were a few men who came in regularly to work in gardens to drive teams to care for horses and there were a few women who came in to cook or to wash these latter had usually drunken husbands in the main the colony loafed in high spirits and the industrious minority gained no direct honor from their fellows unless they spent their earnings on raiment in which case they were naturally treated with distinction on the whole the hardships of these people were the wind the rain the snow and any other physical difficulties which they could cultivate about twice a year the lady philanthropists of whilomville went up against them and came away poorer in goods but rich in complacence after one of these attacks the colony would preserve a comic air of rectitude for two days and then relapse again to the genial irresponsibility of a crew of monkeys peter washington was one of the industrious class who occupied a position of distinction for he surely spent his money on personal decoration on occasion he could dress better than the mayor of whilomville himself or at least in more colors which was the main thing to the minds of his admirers his ideal had been the late gallant henry johnson whose conquests in watermelon alley as well as in the hill shanties had proved him the equal if not the superior of any pullmancar porter in the country perhaps peter had too much virginia laziness and humor in him to be a wholly adequate successor to the fastidious henry johnson but at any rate he admired his memory so attentively as to be openly termed a dude by envious people illustration he heaved one of his eightounce rocks on this afternoon he was going to call on old alek williams because aleks eldest girl was just turned seventeen and to peters mind was a triumph of beauty he was not wearing his best clothes because on his last visit aleks halfbreed hound susie had taken occasion to forcefully extract a quite large and valuable part of the visitors trousers when peter arrived at the end of the rocky field which contained old aleks shanty he stooped and provided himself with several large stones weighing them carefully in his hand and finally continuing his journey with three stones of about eight ounces each when he was near the house three gaunt hounds rover and carlo and susie came sweeping down upon him his impression was that they were going to climb him as if he were a tree but at the critical moment they swerved and went growling and snapping around him their heads low their eyes malignant the afternoon caller waited until susie presented her side to him then he heaved one of his eightounce rocks when it landed her hollow ribs gave forth a drumlike sound and she was knocked sprawling her legs in the air the other hounds at once fled in horror and she followed as soon as she was able yelping at the top of her lungs the afternoon caller resumed his march at the wild expressions of susies anguish old alek had flung open the door and come hastily into the sunshine yah you suse come erlong outa dat now what fer you oh how do how do mist washton how do how do mist willums i done foun it necessay fer ter damnearkill dish yer dawg a yourn mist willums come in come in mist washton dawg no count mist washton then he turned to address the unfortunate animal hut did it hut pears like you gwine dun some saince by time somebody brek yer back pears like i gwine club yer inter er frazzle fore you fin out some saince gwon way fm yah as the old man and his guest entered the shanty a body of black children spread out in crescentshape formation and observed peter with awe fat old mrs williams greeted him turbulently while the eldest girl mollie lurked in a corner and giggled with finished imbecility gazing at the visitor with eyes that were shy and bold by turns she seemed at times absurdly overconfident at times foolishly afraid but her giggle consistently endured it was a giggle on which an irascible but rightminded judge would have ordered her forthwith to be buried alive illustration mollie lurked in a corner and giggled amid a great deal of hospitable gabbling peter was conducted to the best chair out of the three that the house contained enthroned therein he made himself charming in talk to the old people who beamed upon him joyously as for mollie he affected to be unaware of her existence this may have been a method for entrapping the sentimental interest of that young gazelle or it may be that the giggle had worked upon him he was absolutely fascinating to the old people they could talk like rotary snowploughs and he gave them every chance while his face was illumined with appreciation they pressed him to stay for supper and he consented after a glance at the pot on the stove which was too furtive to be noted during the meal old alek recounted the high state of judge oglethorpes kitchengarden which alek said was due to his unremitting industry and fine intelligence alek was a gardener whenever impending starvation forced him to cease temporarily from being a lily of the field mist bryant he suhtainly got er grand gawden observed peter dat so dat so mist washton assented alek he got fine gawden seems like i nev did see sech mellums big as er barl layin dere i dont raikon anbody in dish yer county kin hol it with mist bryant when comes ter mellums dat so mist washton they did not talk of watermelons until their heads held nothing else as the phrase goes but they talked of watermelons until when peter started for home that night over a lonely road they held a certain dominant position in his mind alek had come with him as far as the fence in order to protect him from a possible attack by the mongrels there they had cheerfully parted two honest men the night was dark and heavy with moisture peter found it uncomfortable to walk rapidly he merely loitered on the road when opposite si bryants place he paused and looked over the fence into the garden he imagined he could see the form of a huge melon lying in dim stateliness not ten yards away he looked at the bryant house two windows downstairs were lighted the bryants kept no dog old sis favorite child having once been bitten by a dog and having since died within that year of pneumonia peering over the fence peter fancied that if any lowminded nightprowler should happen to note the melon he would not find it difficult to possess himself of it this person would merely wait until the lights were out in the house and the people presumably asleep then he would climb the fence reach the melon in a few strides sever the stem with his ready knife and in a trice be back in the road with his prize there need be no noise and after all the house was some distance selecting a smooth bit of turf peter took a seat by the roadside from time to time he glanced at the lighted window ii when peter and alek had said goodbye the old man turned back in the rocky field and shaped a slow course towards that high dim light which marked the little window of his shanty it would be incorrect to say that alek could think of nothing but watermelons but it was true that si bryants watermelonpatch occupied a certain conspicuous position in his thoughts he sighed he almost wished that he was again a conscienceless pickaninny instead of being one of the most ornate solemn and lookatmesinner deacons that ever graced the handle of a collectionbasket at this time it made him quite sad to reflect upon his granite integrity a weaker man might perhaps bow his moral head to the temptation but for him such a fall was impossible he was a prince of the church and if he had been nine princes of the church he could not have been more proud in fact religion was to the old man a sort of personal dignity and he was on sundays so obtrusively good that you could see his sanctity through a door he forced it on you until you would have felt its influence even in a forecastle it was clear in his mind that he must put watermelon thoughts from him and after a moment he told himself with much ostentation that he had done so but it was cooler under the sky than in the shanty and as he was not sleepy he decided to take a stroll down to si bryants place and look at the melons from a pinnacle of spotless innocence reaching the road he paused to listen it would not do to let peter hear him because that graceless rapscallion would probably misunderstand him but assuring himself that peter was well on his way he set out walking briskly until he was within four hundred yards of bryants place here he went to the side of the road and walked thereafter on the damp yielding turf he made no sound he did not go on to that point in the main road which was directly opposite the watermelonpatch he did not wish to have his ascetic contemplation disturbed by some chance wayfarer he turned off along a short lane which led to si bryants barn here he reached a place where he could see over the fence the faint shapes of the melons alek was affected the house was some distance away there was no dog and doubtless the bryants would soon extinguish their lights and go to bed then some poor lost lamb of sin might come and scale the fence reach a melon in a moment sever the stem with his ready knife and in a trice be back in the road with his prize and this poor lost lamb of sin might even be a bishop but no one would ever know it alek singled out with his eye a very large melon and thought that the lamb would prove his judgment if he took that one he found a soft place in the grass and arranged himself comfortably he watched the lights in the windows iii it seemed to peter washington that the bryants absolutely consulted their own wishes in regard to the time for retiring but at last he saw the lighted windows fade briskly from left to right and after a moment a window on the second floor blazed out against the darkness si was going to bed in five minutes this window abruptly vanished and all the world was night peter spent the ensuing quarterhour in no mental debate his mind was fixed he was here and the melon was there he would have it but an idea of being caught appalled him he thought of his position he was the beau of his community honored right and left he pictured the consternation of his friends and the cheers of his enemies if the hands of the redoubtable si bryant should grip him in his shame he arose and going to the fence listened no sound broke the stillness save the rhythmical incessant clicking of myriad insects and the guttural chanting of the frogs in the reeds at the lakeside moved by sudden decision he climbed the fence and crept silently and swiftly down upon the melon his open knife was in his hand there was the melon cool fair to see as pompous in its fatness as the cook in a monastery peter put out a hand to steady it while he cut the stem but at the instant he was aware that a black form had dropped over the fence lining the lane in front of him and was coming stealthily towards him in a palsy of terror he dropped flat upon the ground not having strength enough to run away the next moment he was looking into the amazed and agonized face of old alek williams there was a moment of loaded silence and then peter was overcome by a mad inspiration he suddenly dropped his knife and leaped upon alek i got che he hissed i got che i got che the old man sank down as limp as rags i got che i got che steal mist bryants mellums hey alek in a low voice began to beg oh mist peter washton don go fer ter be too had on er ole man i nev come yere fer ter steal em deed i didnt mist washton i come yere jes fer ter feel em oh please mist washton come erlong outa yere you ol rip said peter an don trumple on dese yer baids i gwine put you wah you won ketch col without difficulty he tumbled the whining alek over the fence to the roadway and followed him with sherifflike expedition he took him by the scruff come erlong deacon i raikon i gwine put you wah you kin pray deacon come erlong deacon the emphasis and reiteration of his laymans title in the church produced a deadly effect upon alek he felt to his marrow the heinous crime into which this treacherous night had betrayed him as peter marched his prisoner up the road towards the mouth of the lane he continued his remarks come erlong deacon nev see er man so anxious like erbout er mellumpaitch deacon seem like you jes must seeem ergrowin an feel em deacon mist bryant hell be sprised deacon findin out you come fer ter feel his mellums come erlong deacon mist bryant he expectin some ole rip like you come soon they had almost reached the lane when aleks cur susie who had followed her master approached in the silence which attends dangerous dogs and seeing indications of what she took to be war she appended herself swiftly but firmly to the calf of peters left leg the mкlйe was short but spirited alek had no wish to have his dog complicate his already serious misfortunes and went manfully to the defence of his captor he procured a large stone and by beating this with both hands down upon the resounding skull of the animal he induced her to quit her grip breathing heavily peter dropped into the long grass at the roadside he said nothing illustration the next moment he was looking into the amazed and agonized face of old alek mist washton said alek at last in a quavering voice i raikon i gwine wait yere see what you gwine do ter me whereupon peter passed into a spasmodic state in which he rolled to and fro and shook mist washton i hope dish yer dog aint gone an give you fitses peter sat up suddenly no she aint he answered but she gin me er big skeer an fer yer sistance with er cobblestone mist willums i tell you what i gwine do i tell you what i gwine do he waited an impressive moment i gwine lease you old alek trembled like a little bush in a wind mist washton quoth peter deliberately i gwine lease you the old man was filled with a desire to negotiate this statement at once but he felt the necessity of carrying off the event without an appearance of haste yes seh thank e seh thank e mist washton i raikon i ramble home pressenly he waited an interval and then dubiously said goodevenin mist washton goodevenin deacon don come foolin roun feelin no mellums and i say troof goodevenin deacon alek took off his hat and made three profound bows thank e seh thank e seh thank e seh peter underwent another severe spasm but the old man walked off towards his home with a humble and contrite heart iv the next morning alek proceeded from his shanty under the complete but customary illusion that he was going to work he trudged manfully along until he reached the vicinity of si bryants place then by stages he relapsed into a slink he was passing the gardenpatch under full steam when at some distance ahead of him he saw si bryant leaning casually on the garden fence goodmornin alek goodmawnin mist bryant answered alek with a new deference he was marching on when he was halted by a word alek he stopped yes seh i found a knife this mornin in th road drawled si an i thought maybe it was yourn improved in mind by this divergence from the direct line of attack alek stepped up easily to look at the knife no seh he said scanning it as it lay in sis palm while the cold steelblue eyes of the white man looked down into his stomach taint no knife er mine but he knew the knife he knew it as if it had been his mother and at the same moment a spark flashed through his head and made wise his understanding he knew everything taint much of er knife mist bryant he said deprecatingly taint much of a knife i know that cried si in sudden heat but i found it this mornin in my watermelonpatch hear watahmellumpaitch yelled alek not astounded yes in my watermelonpatch sneered si an i think you know something about it too me cried alek me yes you said si with icy ferocity yes you he had become convinced that alek was not in any way guilty but he was certain that the old man knew the owner of the knife and so he pressed him at first on criminal lines alek you might as well own up now youve been meddlin with my watermelons me cried alek again yahs ma knife i done cahe it foh yeahs bryant changed his ways look here alek he said confidentially i know you and you know me and there aint no use in any more skirmishin i know that you know whose knife that is now whose is it this challenge was so formidable in character that alek temporarily quailed and began to stammer er now mist bryant you you frien er mine i know im a friend of yours but said bryant inexorably who owns this knife alek gathered unto himself some remnants of dignity and spoke with reproach mist bryant dish yer knife ain mine no said bryant it aint but you know who it belongs to an i want you to tell me quick well mist bryant answered alek scratching his wool i wont say s i do know who blongs ter dish yer knife an i wont say s i dont bryant again laughed his yankee laugh but this time there was little humor in it it was dangerous alek seeing that he had gotten himself into hot water by the fine diplomacy of his last sentence immediately began to flounder and totally submerge himself no mist bryant he repeated i wont say s i do know who blongs ter dish yer knife an i wont say s i dont and he began to parrot this fatal sentence again and again it seemed wound about his tongue he could not rid himself of it its very power to make trouble for him seemed to originate the mysterious afric reason for its repetition is he a very close friend of yourn said bryant softly ffrien stuttered alek he appeared to weigh this question with much care well seems like he was er frien an then agin it seems like he it seems like he wasnt asked bryant yes seh jest so jest so cried alek sometimes it seems like he wasnt then agin he stopped for profound meditation the patience of the white man seemed inexhaustible at length his low and oily voice broke the stillness oh well of course if hes a friend of yourn alek you know i wouldnt want to make no trouble for a friend of yourn yes seh cried the negro at once hes er frien er mine he is dat well then it seems as if about the only thing to do is for you to tell me his name sos i can send him his knife and thats all there is to it alek took off his hat and in perplexity ran his hand over his wool he studied the ground but several times he raised his eyes to take a sly peep at the imperturbable visage of the white man y y yes mist bryant i raikon dats erbout all what kin be done i gwine tell you who blongs ter dish yer knife of course said the smooth bryant it aint a very nice thing to have to do but no seh cried alek brightly im gwine tell you mist bryant i gwine tell you erbout dat knife mist bryant he asked solemnly does you know who blongs ter dat knife no i well i gwine tell i gwine tell who mr bryant the old man drew himself to a stately pose and held forth his arm i gwine tell who mist bryant dish yer knife blongs ter sam jackson illustration the old man drew himself to a stately pose bryant was startled into indignation who in hell is sam jackson he growled hes a nigger said alek impressively and he wuks in er lumberyawd up yere in hoswego ix the stove i theyll bring her said mrs trescott dubiously her cousin the painter the bewildered father of the angel child had written to say that if they were asked he and his wife would come to the trescotts for the christmas holidays but he had not officially stated that the angel child would form part of the expedition but of course theyll bring her said mrs trescott to her husband the doctor assented yes theyll have to bring her they wouldnt dare leave new york at her mercy well sighed mrs trescott after a pause the neighbors will be pleased when they see her theyll immediately lock up their children for safety anyhow said trescott the devastation of the margate twins was complete she cant do that particular thing again i shall be interested to note what form her energy will take this time oh yes thats it cried the wife youll be interested youve hit it exactly youll be interested to note what form her energy will take this time and then when the real crisis comes youll put on your hat and walk out of the house and leave me to straighten things out this is not a scientific question this is a practical matter well as a practical man i advocate chaining her out in the stable answered the doctor when jimmie trescott was told that his old flame was again to appear he remained calm in fact time had so mended his youthful heart that it was a regular apple of oblivion and peace her image in his thought was as the track of a bird on deep snow it was an impression but it did not concern the depths however he did what befitted his state he went out and bragged in the street my cousin is comin next week fom new york my cousin is comin tomorrow fom new york girl or boy said the populace bluntly but when enlightened they speedily cried oh we remember her they were charmed for they thought of her as an outlaw and they surmised that she could lead them into a very ecstasy of sin they thought of her as a brave bandit because they had been whipped for various pranks into which she had led them when jimmie made his declaration they fell into a state of pleased and shuddering expectancy mrs trescott pronounced her point of view the child is a nice child if only caroline had some sense but she hasnt and willis is like a wax figure i dont see what can be done unless unless you simply go to willis and put the whole thing right at him then for purposes of indication she improvised a speech look here willis youve got a little daughter havent you but confound it man she is not the only girl child ever brought into the sunlight there are a lot of children children are an ordinary phenomenon in china they drown girl babies if you wish to submit to this frightful impostor and tyrant that is all very well but why in the name of humanity do you make us submit to it doctor trescott laughed i wouldnt dare say it to him anyhow said mrs trescott determinedly that is what you should say to him it wouldnt do the slightest good it would only make him very angry and i would lay myself perfectly open to a suggestion that i had better attend to my own affairs with more rigor well i suppose you are right mrs trescott again said why dont you speak to caroline asked the doctor humorously speak to caroline why i wouldnt for the world shed fly through the roof shed snap my head off speak to caroline you must be mad one afternoon the doctor went to await his visitors on the platform of the railway station he was thoughtfully smiling for some quaint reason he was convinced that he was to be treated to a quick manifestation of little coras peculiar and interesting powers and yet when the train paused at the station there appeared to him only a pretty little girl in a furlined hood and with her nose reddening from the sudden cold and attended respectfully by her parents he smiled again reflecting that he had comically exaggerated the dangers of dear little cora it amused his philosophy to note that he had really been perturbed as the big sleigh sped homeward there was a sudden shrill outcry from the angel child oh mamma mamma theyve forgotten my stove hush dear hush said the mother its all right oh but mamma theyve forgotten my stove the doctor thrust his chin suddenly out of his topcoat collar stove he said stove what stove oh just a toy of the childs explained the mother shes grown so fond of it she loves it so that if we didnt take it everywhere with her shed suffer dreadfully so we always bring it oh said the doctor he pictured a little tin trinket but when the stove was really unmasked it turned out to be an affair of cast iron as big as a portmanteau and as the stage people say practicable there was some trouble that evening when came the hour of childrens bedtime little cora burst into a wild declaration that she could not retire for the night unless the stove was carried upstairs and placed at her bedside while the mother was trying to dissuade the child the trescotts held their peace and gazed with awe the incident closed when the lambeyed father gathered the stove in his arms and preceded the angel child to her chamber illustration the lambeyed father preceded the angel child to her chamber in the morning trescott was standing with his back to the dining room fire awaiting breakfast when he heard a noise of descending guests presently the door opened and the party entered in regular order first came the angel child then the cooing mother and last the great painter with his arm full of the stove he deposited it gently in a corner and sighed trescott wore a wide grin what are you carting that thing all over the house for he said brutally why dont you put it some place where she can play with it and leave it there the mother rebuked him with a look well if it gives her pleasure ned she expostulated softly if it makes the child happy to have the stove with her why shouldnt she have it just so said the doctor with calmness jimmies idea was the roaring fireplace in the cabin of the lone mountaineer at first he was not able to admire a girls stove built on wellknown domestic lines he eyed it and thought it was very pretty but it did not move him immediately but a certain respect grew to an interest and he became the angel childs accomplice and even if he had not had an interest grow upon him he was certain to have been implicated sooner or later because of the imperious way of little cora who made a serf of him in a few swift sentences together they carried the stove out into the desolate garden and squatted it in the snow jimmies snug little muscles had been pitted against the sheer nervous vigor of this little goldenhaired girl and he had not won great honors when the mind blazed inside the small body the angel child was pure force she began to speak now jim get some paper get some woodlittle sticks at first now we want a match you got a match well go get a match get some more wood hurry up now no no ill light it my own self you get some more wood there isnt that splendid you get a whole lot of wood an pile it up here by the stove an now whatll we cook we must have somethin to cook you know else it aint like the real potatoes said jimmie at once the day was clear cold bright an icy wind sped from over the waters of the lake a grown person would hardly have been abroad save on compulsion of a kind and yet when they were called to luncheon the two little simpletons protested with great cries ii the ladies of whilomville were somewhat given to the pagan habit of tea parties when a tea party was to befall a certain house one could read it in the manner of the prospective hostess who for some previous days would go about twitching this and twisting that and dusting here and polishing there the ordinary habits of the household began then to disagree with her and her unfortunate husband and children fled to the lengths of their tethers then there was a hush then there was a tea party on the fatal afternoon a small picked company of latent enemies would meet there would be a fanfare of affectionate greetings during which everybody would measure to an inch the importance of what everybody else was wearing those who wore old dresses would wish then that they had not come and those who saw that in the company they were well clad would be pleased or exalted or filled with the joys of cruelty then they had tea which was a habit and a delight with none of them their usual beverage being coffee with milk usually the party jerked horribly in the beginning while the hostess strove and pulled and pushed to make its progress smooth then suddenly it would be off like the wind eight fifteen or twentyfive tongues clattering with a noise like a cottonmill combined with the noise of a few penny whistles then the hostess had nothing to do but to look glad and see that everybody had enough tea and cake when the door was closed behind the last guest the hostess would usually drop into a chair and say thank heaven theyre gone there would be no malice in this expression it simply would be that womanlike she had flung herself headlong at the accomplishment of a pleasure which she could not even define and at the end she felt only weariness the value and beauty or oddity of the teacups was another element which entered largely into the spirit of these terrible enterprises the quality of the tea was an element which did not enter at all uniformly it was rather bad but the cups some of the more ambitious people aspired to have cups each of a different pattern possessing in fact the sole similarity that with their odd curves and dips of form they each resembled anything but a teacup others of the more ambitious aspired to a quite severe and godly set which when viewed appalled one with its austere and rigid family resemblances and made one desire to ask the hostess if the teapot was not the father of all the little cups and at the same time protesting gallantly that such a young and charming creamjug surely could not be their mother but of course the serious part is that these collections so differed in style and the obvious amount paid for them that nobody could be happy the poorer ones envied the richer ones feared the poorer ones continually striving to overtake the leaders the leaders always with their heads turned back to hear overtaking footsteps and none of these things here written did they know instead of seeing that they were very stupid they thought they were very fine and they gave and took heartbruises fierce deep heartbruises under the clear impression that of such kind of rubbish was the kingdom of nice people the characteristics of outsiders of course emerged in shreds from these tea parties and it is doubtful if the characteristics of insiders escaped entirely in fact these tea parties were in the large way the result of a conspiracy of certain unenlightened people to make life still more uncomfortable mrs trescott was in the circle of teafighters largely through a sort of artificial necessity a necessity in short which she had herself created in a spirit of femininity when the painter and his family came for the holidays mrs trescott had for some time been feeling that it was her turn to give a tea party and she was resolved upon it now that she was reinforced by the beautiful wife of the painter whose charms would make all the other women feel badly and mrs trescott further resolved that the affair should be notable in more than one way the painters wife suggested that as an innovation they give the people good tea but mrs trescott shook her head she was quite sure they would not like it it was an impressive gathering a few came to see if they could not find out the faults of the painters wife and these added to those who would have attended even without that attractive prospect swelled the company to a number quite large for whilomville there were the usual preliminary jolts and then suddenly the tea party was in full swing and looked like an unprecedented success mrs trescott exchanged a glance with the painters wife they felt proud and superior this tea party was almost perfection iii jimmie and the angel child after being oppressed by innumerable admonitions to behave correctly during the afternoon succeeded in reaching the garden where the stove awaited them they were enjoying themselves grandly when snow began to fall so heavily that it gradually dampened their ardor as well as extinguished the fire in the stove they stood ruefully until the angel child devised the plan of carrying the stove into the stable and there safe from the storm to continue the festivities but they were met at the door of the stable by peter washington what you bout jim now its snowin so hard we thought wed take the stove into the stable an have er fiah in it no seh gwon way fm heh gwon don low no sech foolishin round yer no seh well we aint goin to hurt your old stable are we asked jimmie ironically dat you aint jim not so longs i keep my two eyes right plumb squaah pinted at ol jim no seh peter began to chuckle in derision the two vagabonds stood before him while he informed them of their iniquities as well as their absurdities and further made clear his own masterly grasp of the spirit of their devices nothing affects children so much as rhetoric it may not involve any definite presentation of commonsense but if it is picturesque they surrender decently to its influence peter was by all means a rhetorician and it was not long before the two children had dismally succumbed to him they went away depositing the stove in the snow they straightened to look at each other it did not enter either head to relinquish the idea of continuing the game but the situation seemed invulnerable the angel child went on a scouting tour presently she returned flying i know lets have it in the cellar in the cellar oh itll be lovely the outer door of the cellar was open and they proceeded down some steps with their treasure there was plenty of light the cellar was highwalled warm and dry they named it an ideal place two huge cylindrical furnaces were humming away one at either end overhead the beams detonated with the different emotions which agitated the tea party jimmie worked like a stoker and soon there was a fine bright fire in the stove the fuel was of small brittle sticks which did not make a great deal of smoke now whatll we cook cried little cora whatll we cook jim we must have something to cook you know potatoes said jimmie but the angel child made a scornful gesture no ive cooked bout a million potatoes i guess potatoes arent nice any more jimmies mind was all said and done when the question of potatoes had been passed and he looked weakly at his companion havent you got any turnips in your house she inquired contemptuously in my house we have turnips oh turnips exclaimed jimmie immensely relieved to find that the honor of his family was safe turnips oh bushels an bushels an bushels out in the shed well go an get a whole lot commanded the angel child go an get a whole lot grea big ones we always have grea big ones jimmie went to the shed and kicked gently at a company of turnips which the frost had amalgamated he made three journeys to and from the cellar carrying always the very largest types from his fathers store four of them filled the oven of little coras stove this fact did not please her so they placed three rows of turnips on the hot top then the angel child profoundly moved by an inspiration suddenly cried out oh jimmie lets play were keepin a hotel an have got to cook for bout a thousand people an those two furnaces will be the ovens an ill be the chief cook no i want to be chief cook some of the time interrupted jimmie no ill be chief cook my own self you must be my sistant now ill prepare em see an then you put em in the ovens get the shovel well play thats the pan ill fix em an then you put em in the oven hold it still now jim held the coalshovel while little cora with a frown of importance arranged turnips in rows upon it she patted each one daintily and then backed away to view it with her head critically sideways there she shouted at last thatll do i guess put em in the oven jimmie marched with his shovelful of turnips to one of the furnaces the door was already open and he slid the shovel in upon the red coals come on cried little cora ive got another batch nearly ready but what am i goin to do with these asked jimmie there aint only one shovel leave m in there retorted the girl passionately leave m in there an then play youre comin with another pan taint right to stand there an hold the pan you goose so jimmie expelled all his turnips from his shovel out upon the furnace fire and returned obediently for another batch these are puddings yelled the angel child gleefully dozens an dozens of puddings for the thousand people at our grea big hotel iv at the first alarm the painter had fled to the doctors office where he hid his face behind a book and pretended that he did not hear the noise of feminine revelling when the doctor came from a round of calls he too retreated upon the office and the men consoled each other as well as they were able once mrs trescott dashed in to say delightedly that her tea party was not only the success of the season but it was probably the very nicest tea party that had ever been held in whilomville after vainly beseeching them to return with her she dashed away again her face bright with happiness the doctor and the painter remained for a long time in silence trescott tapping reflectively upon the windowpane finally he turned to the painter and sniffing said what is that willis dont you smell something the painter also sniffed why yes its like its like turnips turnips no it cant be well its very much like it the puzzled doctor opened the door into the hall and at first it appeared that he was going to give back two paces a result of frizzling turnips which was almost as tangible as mist had blown in upon his face and made him gasp good god willis what can this be he cried whee said the painter its awful isnt it the doctor made his way hurriedly to his wife but before he could speak with her he had to endure the business of greeting a score of women then he whispered out in the hall theres an awful illustration the solemn odor of burning turnips rolled in like a seafog but at that moment it came to them on the wings of a sudden draught the solemn odor of burning turnips rolled in like a seafog and fell upon that dainty perfumed tea party it was almost a personality if some unbidden and extremely odious guest had entered the room the effect would have been much the same the sprightly talk stopped with a jolt and people looked at each other then a few brave and considerate persons made the usual attempt to talk away as if nothing had happened they all looked at their hostess who wore an air of stupefaction the odor of burning turnips grew and grew to trescott it seemed to make a noise he thought he could hear the dull roar of this outrage under some circumstances he might have been able to take the situation from a point of view of comedy but the agony of his wife was too acute and for him too visible she was saying yes we saw the play the last time we were in new york i liked it very much that scene in the second act the gloomy church you know and all that and the organ playing and then when the four singing little girls came in but trescott comprehended that she did not know if she was talking of a play or a parachute he had not been in the room twenty seconds before his brow suddenly flushed with an angry inspiration he left the room hastily leaving behind him an incoherent phrase of apology and charged upon his office where he found the painter somnolent willis he cried sternly come with me its that damn kid of yours the painter was immediately agitated he always seemed to feel more than any one else in the world the peculiar ability of his child to create resounding excitement but he seemed always to exhibit his feelings very late he arose hastily and hurried after trescott to the top of the inside cellar stairway trescott motioned him to pause and for an instant they listened hurry up jim cried the busy little cora heres another whole batch of lovely puddings hurry up now an put em in the oven trescott looked at the painter the painter groaned then they appeared violently in the middle of the great kitchen of the hotel with a thousand people in it jimmie go upstairs said trescott and then he turned to watch the painter deal with the angel child with some imitation of wrath the painter stalked to his daughters side and grasped her by the arm illustration heres another batch of lovely puddings oh papa papa she screamed youre pinching me youre pinching me youre pinching me papa at first the painter had seemed resolved to keep his grip but suddenly he let go her arm in a panic ive hurt her he said turning to trescott trescott had swiftly done much towards the obliteration of the hotel kitchen but he looked up now and spoke after a short period of reflection youve hurt her have you well hurt her again spank her he cried enthusiastically spank her confound you man she needs it heres your chance spank her and spank her good spank her the painter naturally wavered over this incendiary proposition but at last in one supreme burst of daring he shut his eyes and again grabbed his precious offspring the spanking was lamentably the work of a perfect bungler it couldnt have hurt at all but the angel child raised to heaven a loud clear soprano howl that expressed the last word in even mediжval anguish soon the painter was aghast stop it darling i didnt mean i didnt mean to to hurt you so much you know he danced nervously trescott sat on a box and devilishly smiled but the pasture call of suffering motherhood came down to them and a moment later a splendid apparition appeared on the cellar stairs she understood the scene at a glance willis what have you been doing trescott sat on his box the painter guiltily moved from foot to foot and the angel child advanced to her mother with arms outstretched making a piteous wail of amazed and pained pride that would have moved peter the great regardless of her frock the panting mother knelt on the stone floor and took her child to her bosom and looked then bitterly scornfully at the cowering father and husband the painter for his part at once looked reproachfully at trescott as if to say there you see trescott arose and extended his hands in a quiet but magnificent gesture of despair and weariness he seemed about to say something classic and quite instinctively they waited the stillness was deep and the wait was longer than a moment well he said we cant live in the cellar lets go upstairs x the trial execution and burial of homer phelps from time to time an enwearied pine bough let fall to the earth its load of melting snow and the branch swung back glistening in the faint wintry sunlight down the gulch a brook clattered amid its ice with the sound of a perpetual breaking of glass all the forest looked drenched and forlorn the skyline was a ragged enclosure of gray cliffs and hemlocks and pines if one had been miraculously set down in this gulch one could have imagined easily that the nearest human habitation was hundreds of miles away if it were not for an old halfdiscernible woodroad that led towards the brook halt whos there this low and gruff cry suddenly dispelled the stillness which lay upon the lonely gulch but the hush which followed it seemed even more profound the hush endured for some seconds and then the voice of the challenger was again raised this time with a distinctly querulous note in it halt whos there why dont you answer when i holler dont you know youre likely to get shot a second voice answered oh you knew who i was easy enough that dont make no diffrence one of the margate twins stepped from a thicket and confronted homer phelps on the old woodroad the majestic scowl of official wrath was upon the brow of reeves margate a long stick was held in the hollow of his arm as one would hold a rifle and he strode grimly to the other boy that dont make no diffrence youve got to answer when i holler anyhow willie says so at the mention of the dread chieftains name the phelps boy daunted a trifle but he still sulkily murmured well you knew it was me he started on his way through the snow but the twin sturdily blocked the path you cant pass lessn you give the countersign huh said the phelps boy countersign yes countersign sneered the twin strong in his sense of virtue but the phelps boy became very angry cant i hey cant i hey ill show you whether i can or not ill show you reeves margate there was a short scuffle and then arose the anguished clamor of the sentry hey fellers heres a man tryin to run apast the guard hey fellers hey there was a great noise in the adjacent underbrush the voice of willie could be heard exhorting his followers to charge swiftly and bravely then they appeared willie dalzel jimmie trescott the other margate twin and dan earl the chieftains face was dark with wrath whats the matter cant you play it right aint you got any sense he asked the phelps boy the sentry was yelling out his grievance now he came along an i hollered at im an he didnt pay no tention an when i ast im for the countersign he wouldnt say nothin that aint no way cant you play it right asked the chief again with gloomy scorn he knew it was me easy enough said the phelps boy that aint got nothin to do with it cried the chief furiously that aint got nothin to do with it if youre goin to play youve got to play it right it aint no fun if you go spoilin the whole thing this way cant you play it right i forgot the countersign lied the culprit weakly whereupon the remainder of the band yelled out with one triumphant voice war to the knife war to the knife i remember it willie dont i willie the leader was puzzled evidently he was trying to develop in his mind a plan for dealing correctly with this unusual incident he felt no doubt that he must proceed according to the books but unfortunately the books did not cover the point precisely however he finally said to homer phelps you are under arrest then with a stentorian voice he shouted seize him his loyal followers looked startled for a brief moment but directly they began to move upon the phelps boy the latter clearly did not intend to be seized he backed away expostulating wildly he even seemed somewhat frightened no no dont you touch me i tell you dont you dare touch me the others did not seem anxious to engage they moved slowly watching the desperate light in his eyes the chieftain stood with folded arms his face growing darker and darker with impatience at length he burst out oh seize him i tell you why dont you seize him grab him by the leg dannie hurry up all of you seize him i keep asayin thus adjured the margate twins and dan earl made another pained effort while jimmie trescott manoeuvred to cut off a retreat but to tell the truth there was a boyish law which held them back from laying hands of violence upon little phelps under these conditions perhaps it was because they were only playing whereas he was now undeniably serious at any rate they looked very sick of their occupation dont you dare snarled the phelps boy facing first one and then the other he was almost in tears dont you dare touch me the chieftain was now hopping with exasperation oh seize him cant you youre no good at all then he loosed his wrath upon the phelps boy stand still homer cant you youve got to be seized you know that aint the way it aint any fun if you keep adodgin that way stand still cant you youve got to be seized i dont want to be seized retorted the phelps boy obstinate and bitter but youve got to be seized yelled the maddened chief dont you see thats the way to play it the phelps boy answered promptly but i dont want to play that way but thats the right way to play it dont you see youve got to play it the right way youve got to be seized an then well hold a trial on you an an all sorts of things but this prospect held no illusions for the phelps boy he continued doggedly to repeat i dont want to play that way of course in the end the chief stooped to beg and beseech this unreasonable lad oh come on homer dont be so mean youre aspoilin everything we wont hurt you any not the tintiest bit its all just playin whats the matter with you the different tone of the leader made an immediate impression upon the other he showed some signs of the beginning of weakness well he asked what you goin to do why first were goin to put you in a dungeon or tie you to a stake or something like that just pertend you know added the chief hurriedly an then well hold a trial awful solemn but there wont be anything whatll hurt you not a thing illustration from this boot he emptied about a quart of snow and so the game was readjusted the phelps boy was marched off between dan earl and a margate twin the party proceeded to their camp which was hidden some hundred feet back in the thickets there was a miserable little hut with a pinebark roof which so frankly and constantly leaked that existence in the open air was always preferable at present it was noisily dripping melted snow into the black mouldy interior in front of this hut a feeble fire was flickering through its unhappy career underfoot the watery snow was of the color of lead the party having arrived at the camp the chief leaned against a tree and balancing on one foot drew off a rubber boot from this boot he emptied about a quart of snow he squeezed his stocking which had a hole from which protruded a lobsterred toe he resumed his boot bring up the prisoner said he they did it guilty or not guilty he asked huh said the phelps boy guilty or not guilty demanded the chief peremptorily guilty or not guilty dont you understand homer phelps looked profoundly puzzled guilty or not guilty he asked slowly and weakly the chief made a swift gesture and turned in despair to the others oh he dont do it right he does it all wrong he again faced the prisoner with an air of making a last attempt now lookahere homer when i say guilty or not guilty you want to up an say not guilty dont you see not guilty said homer at once no no no wait till i ask you now wait he called out pompously pards if this prisoner before us is guilty what shall be his fate all those welltrained little infants with one voice sung out death prisoner continued the chief are you guilty or not guilty but lookahere argued homer you said it wouldnt be nothin that would hurt i thunder an lightnin roared the wretched chief keep your mouth shut cant ye what in the mischief but there was an interruption from jimmie trescott who shouldered a twin aside and stepped to the front here he said very contemptuously let me be the prisoner ill show im how to do it all right jim cried the chief delighted you be the prisoner then now all you fellers with guns stand there in a row get out of the way homer he cleared his throat and addressed jimmie prisoner are you guilty or not guilty not guilty answered jimmie firmly standing there before his judge unarmed slim quiet modest he was ideal the chief beamed upon him and looked aside to cast a triumphant and withering glance upon homer phelps he said there thats the way to do it the twins and dan earl also much admired jimmie thats all right so far anyhow said the satisfied chief an now well now well well perceed with the execution that aint right said the new prisoner suddenly that aint the next thing youve got to have a trial first youve got to fetch up a lot of people first wholl say i done it thats so said the chief i didnt think here reeves you be first witness did the prisoner do it the twin gulped for a moment in his anxiety to make the proper reply he was at the point where the roads forked finally he hazarded yes there said the chief thats one of em now dan you be a witness did he do it dan earl having before him the twins example did not hesitate yes he said well then pards what shall be his fate again came the ringing answer death with jimmie in the principal rфle this drama hidden deep in the hemlock thicket neared a kind of perfection you must blindfold me cried the condemned lad briskly an then ill go off an stand an you must all get in a row an shoot me the chief gave this plan his urbane countenance and the twins and dan earl were greatly pleased they blindfolded jimmie under his careful directions he waded a few paces into snow and then turned and stood with quiet dignity awaiting his fate the chief marshalled the twins and dan earl in line with their sticks he gave the necessary commands load ready aim fire at the last command the firing party all together yelled bang jimmie threw his hands high tottered in agony for a moment and then crashed full length into the snow into one would think a serious case of pneumonia it was beautiful illustration the execution he arose almost immediately and came back to them wondrously pleased with himself they acclaimed him joyously the chief was particularly grateful he was always trying to bring off these little romantic affairs and it seemed after all that the only boy who could ever really help him was jimmie trescott there he said to the others thats the way it ought to be done they were touched to the heart by the whole thing and they looked at jimmie with big smiling eyes jimmie blown out like a balloonfish with pride of his performance swaggered to the fire and took seat on some wet hemlock boughs fetch some more wood one of you kids he murmured negligently one of the twins came fortunately upon a small cedartree the lower branches of which were dead and dry an armful of these branches flung upon the sick fire soon made a high ruddy warm blaze which was like an illumination in honor of jimmies success the boys sprawled about the fire and talked the regular language of the game waal pards remarked the chief its many a night weve had together here in the rockies among the bars an the indyuns hey yes pard replied jimmie trescott i reckon youre right our wild free life is there aint nothin to compare with our wild free life whereupon the two lads arose and magnificently shook hands while the others watched them in an ecstasy ill allus stick by ye pard said jimmie earnestly when yer in trouble dont forgit that lightnin lou is at yer back thanky pard quoth willie dalzel deeply affected ill not forgit it pard an dont you forgit either that deadshot demon the leader of the red raiders never forgits a friend but homer phelps was having none of this great fun since his disgraceful refusal to be seized and executed he had been hovering unheeded on the outskirts of the band he seemed very sorry he cast a wistful eye at the romantic scene he knew too well that if he went near at that particular time he would be certain to encounter a pitiless snubbing so he vacillated modestly in the background at last the moment came when he dared venture near enough to the fire to gain some warmth for he was now bitterly suffering with the cold he sidled close to willie dalzel no one heeded him eventually he looked at his chief and with a bright face said now if i was seized now to be executed i could do it as well as jimmie trescott i could the chief gave a crow of scorn in which he was followed by the otherboys ho he cried why didnt you do it then why didnt you do it homer phelps felt upon him many pairs of disdainful eyes he wagged his shoulders in misery youre dead said the chief frankly thats what you are we executed you we did when demanded the phelps boy with some spirit just a little while ago didnt we fellers hey fellers didnt we the trained chorus cried yes of course we did youre dead homer you cant play any more youre dead that wasnt me it was jimmie trescott he said in a low and bitter voice his eyes on the ground he would have given the world if he could have retracted his mad refusals of the early part of the drama no said the chief it was you were playin it was you an it was you youre dead you are and seeing the cruel effect of his words he did not refrain from administering some advice the next time dont be such a chucklehead presently the camp imagined that it was attacked by indians and the boys dodged behind trees with their stickrifles shouting out bang and encouraging each other to resist until the last in the mean time the dead lad hovered near the fire looking moodily at the gay and exciting scene after the fight the gallant defenders returned one by one to the fire where they grandly clasped hands calling each other old pard and boasting of their deeds parenthetically one of the twins had an unfortunate inspiration i killed the indyun chief fellers did you see me kill the indyun chief but willie dalzel his own chief turned upon him wrathfully you didnt kill no chief i killed im with me own hand oh said the twin apologetically at once it must have been some other indyun whos wounded cried willie dalzel aint anybody wounded the party professed themselves well and sound the roving and inventive eye of the chief chanced upon homer phelps ho heres a dead man come on fellers heres a dead man weve got to bury him you know and at his bidding they pounced upon the dead phelps lad the unhappy boy saw clearly his road to rehabilitation but mind and body revolted at the idea of burial even as they had revolted at the thought of execution no he said stubbornly no i dont want to be buried i dont want to be buried illustration the funeral oration youve got to be buried yelled the chief passionately taint goin to hurt ye is it think youre made of glass come on fellers get the grave ready they scattered hemlock boughs upon the snow in the form of a rectangle and piled other boughs near at hand the victim surveyed these preparations with a glassy eye when all was ready the chief turned determinedly to him come on now homer weve got to carry you to the grave get him by the legs jim little phelps had now passed into that state which may be described as a curious and temporary childish fatalism he still objected but it was only feeble muttering as if he did not know what he spoke in some confusion they carried him to the rectangle of hemlock boughs and dropped him then they piled other boughs upon him until he was not to be seen the chief stepped forward to make a short address but before proceeding with it he thought it expedient from certain indications to speak to the grave itself lie still cant ye lie still until i get through there was a faint movement of the boughs and then a perfect silence the chief took off his hat those who watched him could see that his face was harrowed with emotion pards he began brokenly pards weve got one more debt to pay them murderin redskins bowieknife joe was a brave man an a good pard but hes gone now gone he paused for a moment overcome and the stillness was only broken by the deep manly grief of jimmie trescott xi the fight i the child life of the neighborhood was sometimes moved in its deeps at the sight of wagonloads of furniture arriving in front of some house which with closed blinds and barred doors had been for a time a mystery or even a fear the boys often expressed this fear by stamping bravely and noisily on the porch of the house and then suddenly darting away with screams of nervous laughter as if they expected to be pursued by something uncanny there was a group who held that the cellar of a vacant house was certainly the abode of robbers smugglers assassins mysterious masked men in council about the dim rays of a candle and possessing skulls emblematic bloody daggers and owls then near the first of april would come along a wagonload of furniture and children would assemble on the walk by the gate and make serious examination of everything that passed into the house and taking no thought whatever of masked men one day it was announced in the neighborhood that a family was actually moving into the hannigan house next door to dr trescotts jimmie was one of the first to be informed and by the time some of his friends came dashing up he was versed in much any boys they demanded eagerly yes answered jimmie proudly ones a little feller and ones most as big as me i saw em i did where are they asked willie dalzel as if under the circumstances he could not take jimmies word but must have the evidence of his senses oh theyre in there said jimmie carelessly it was evident he owned these new boys willie dalzel resented jimmies proprietary way ho he cried scornfully why dont they come out then why dont they come out how d i know said jimmie illustration stamping bravely and noisily on the porch well retorted willie dalzel you seemed to know so thundering much about em at the moment a boy came strolling down the gravel walk which led from the front door to the gate he was about the height and age of jimmie trescott but he was thick through the chest and had fat legs his face was round and rosy and plump but his hair was curly black and his brows were naturally darkling so that he resembled both a pudding and a young bull he approached slowly the group of older inhabitants and they had grown profoundly silent they looked him over he looked them over they might have been savages observing the first white man or white men observing the first savage the silence held steady as he neared the gate the strange boy wandered off to the left in a definite way which proved his instinct to make a circular voyage when in doubt the motionless group stared at him in time this unsmiling scrutiny worked upon him somewhat and he leaned against the fence and fastidiously examined one shoe in the end willie dalzel authoritatively broke the stillness whats your name said he gruffly johnnie hedge tis answered the new boy then came another great silence while whilomville pondered this intelligence again came the voice of authority whered you live bfore jersey city these two sentences completed the first section of the formal code the second section concerned itself with the establishment of the newcomers exact position in the neighborhood i kin lick you announced willie dalzel and awaited the answer the hedge boy had stared at willie dalzel but he stared at him again after a pause he said i know you kin well demanded willie kin he lick you and he indicated jimmie trescott with a sweep which announced plainly that jimmie was the next in prowess whereupon the new boy looked at jimmie respectfully but carefully and at length said i dunno this was the signal for an outburst of shrill screaming and everybody pushed jimmie forward he knew what he had to say and as befitted the occasion he said it fiercely kin you lick me the new boy also understood what he had to say and despite his unhappy and lonely state he said it bravely yes well retorted jimmie bluntly come out and do it then jest come out and do it and these words were greeted with cheers these little rascals yelled that there should be a fight at once they were in bliss over the prospect go on jim make im come out he said he could lick you awawaw he said he could lick you there probably never was a fight among this class in whilomville which was not the result of the goading and guying of two proud lads by a populace of urchins who simply wished to see a show willie dalzel was very busy he turned first to the one and then to the other you said you could lick him well why dont you come out and do it then you said you could lick him didnt you yes answered the new boy dogged and dubious willie tried to drag jimmie by the arm aw go on jimmie you aint afraid are you no said jimmie the two victims opened wide eyes at each other the fence separated them and so it was impossible for them to immediately engage but they seemed to understand that they were ultimately to be sacrificed to the ferocious aspirations of the other boys and each scanned the other to learn something of his spirit they were not angry at all they were merely two little gladiators who were being clamorously told to hurt each other each displayed hesitation and doubt without displaying fear they did not exactly understand what were their feelings and they moodily kicked the ground and made low and sullen answers to willie dalzel who worked like a circusmanager aw go on jim whats the matter with you you aint afraid are you well then say something this sentiment received more cheering from the abandoned little wretches who wished to be entertained and in this cheering there could be heard notes of derision of jimmie trescott the latter had a position to sustain he was well known he often bragged of his willingness and ability to thrash other boys well then here was a boy of his size who said that he could not thrash him what was he going to do about it the crowd made these arguments very clear and repeated them again and again finally jimmie driven to aggression walked close to the fence and said to the new boy the first time i catch you out of your own yard ill lam the head offn you this was received with wild plaudits by the whilomville urchins but the new boy stepped back from the fence he was awed by jimmies formidable mien but he managed to get out a semidefiant sentence maybe you will and maybe you wont said he however his short retreat was taken as a practical victory for jimmie and the boys hooted him bitterly he remained inside the fence swinging one foot and scowling while jimmie was escorted off down the street amid acclamations the new boy turned and walked back towards the house his face gloomy lined deep with discouragement as if he felt that the new environments antagonism and palpable cruelty were sure to prove too much for him ii the mother of johnnie hedge was a widow and the chief theory of her life was that her boy should be in school on the greatest possible number of days he himself had no sympathy with this ambition but she detected the truth of his diseases with an unerring eye and he was required to be really ill before he could win the right to disregard the first bell morning and noon the chickenpox and the mumps had given him vacations vacations of misery wherein he nearly died between pain and nursing but bad colds in the head did nothing for him and he was not able to invent a satisfactory hacking cough his mother was not consistently a tartar in most things he swayed her to his will he was allowed to have more jam pickles and pie than most boys she respected his profound loathing of sundayschool on summer evenings he could remain outofdoors until but in this matter of school she was inexorable this single point in her character was of steel the hedges arrived in whilomville on a saturday and on the following monday johnnie wended his way to school with a note to the principal and his jersey city schoolbooks he knew perfectly well that he would be told to buy new and different books but in those days mothers always had an idea that old books would do and they invariably sent boys off to a new school with books which would not meet the selected and unchangeable views of the new administration the old books never would do then the boys brought them home to annoyed mothers and asked for ninety cents or sixty cents or eightyfive cents or some number of cents for another outfit in the garret of every house holding a large family there was a collection of effete schoolbooks with mother rebellious because james could not inherit his books from paul who should properly be peters heir while peter should be a beneficiary under henrys will illustration the first time i catch you ill lam the head offn you but the matter of the books was not the measure of johnnie hedges unhappiness this whole business of changing schools was a complete torture alone he had to go among a new people a new tribe and he apprehended his serious time there were only two fates for him one meant victory one meant a kind of serfdom in which he would subscribe to every word of some superior boy and support his every word it was not anything like an english system of fagging because boys invariably drifted into the figurative service of other boys whom they devotedly admired and if they were obliged to subscribe to everything it is true that they would have done so freely in any case one means to suggest that johnnie hedge had to find his place willie dalzel was a type of the little chieftain and willie was a master but he was not a bully in a special physical sense he did not drag little boys by the ears until they cried nor make them tearfully fetch and carry for him they fetched and carried but it was because of their worship of his prowess and genius and so all through the strata of boy life were chieftains and subchieftains and assistant subchieftains there was no question of little hedge being towed about by the nose it was as one has said that he had to find his place in a new school and this in itself was a problem which awed his boyish heart he was a stranger cast away upon the moon none knew him understood him felt for him he would be surrounded for this initiative time by a horde of jackal creatures who might turn out in the end to be little boys like himself but this last point his philosophy could not understand in its fulness he came to a white meetinghouse sort of a place in the squat tower of which a great bell was clanging impressively he passed through an iron gate into a playground worn bare as the bed of a mountain brook by the endless runnings and scufflings of little children there was still a halfhour before the final clangor in the squat tower but the playground held a number of frolicsome imps a loitering boy espied johnnie hedge and he howled oh oh heres a new feller heres a new feller he advanced upon the strange arrival whats your name he demanded belligerently like a particularly offensive customhouse officer johnnie hedge responded the newcomer shyly this name struck the other boy as being very comic all new names strike boys as being comic he laughed noisily oh fellers he says his name is johnnie hedge haw haw haw the new boy felt that his name was the most disgraceful thing which had ever been attached to a human being johnnie hedge haw haw what room you in said the other lad i dunno said johnnie in the mean time a small flock of interested vultures had gathered about him the main thing was his absolute strangeness he even would have welcomed the sight of his tormentors of saturday he had seen them before at least these creatures were only so many incomprehensible problems he diffidently began to make his way towards the main door of the school and the other boys followed him they demanded information are you through subtraction yet we study jogerfre did you ever you live here now you goin to school here now to many questions he made answer as well as the clamor would permit and at length he reached the main door and went quaking unto his new kings as befitted them the rabble stopped at the door a teacher strolling along a corridor found a small boy holding in his hand a note the boy palpably did not know what to do with the note but the teacher knew and took it thereafter this little boy was in harness a splendid lady in gorgeous robes gave him a seat at a double desk at the end of which sat a hoodlum with grimy fingernails who eyed the inauguration with an extreme and personal curiosity the other desks were gradually occupied by children who first were told of the new boy and then turned upon him a speculative and somewhat derisive eye the school opened little classes went forward to a position in front of the teachers platform and tried to explain that they knew something the new boy was not requisitioned a great deal he was allowed to lie dormant until he became used to the scenes and until the teacher found approximately his mental position in the mean time he suffered a shower of stares and whispers and giggles as if he were a manape whereas he was precisely like other children from time to time he made funny and pathetic little overtures to other boys but these overtures could not yet be received he was not known he was a foreigner the village school was like a nation it was tight its amiability or friendship must be won in certain ways at recess he hovered in the schoolroom around the weak lights of society and around the teacher in the hope that somebody might be good to him but none considered him save as some sort of a specimen the teacher of course had a secondary interest in the fact that he was an additional one to a class of sixtythree at twelve oclock when the ordered files of boys and girls marched towards the door he exhibited to no eye the tremblings of a coward in a charge he exaggerated the lawlessness of the playground and the street but the reality was hard enough a shout greeted him oh heres the new feller heres the new feller small and utterly obscure boys teased him he had a hard time of it to get to the gate there never was any actual hurt but everything was competent to smite the lad with shame it was a curious groundless shame but nevertheless it was shame he was a newcomer and he definitely felt the disgrace of the fact in the street he was seen and recognized by some lads who had formed part of the group of saturday they shouted oh jimmie jimmie here he is heres that new feller jimmie trescott was going virtuously towards his luncheon when he heard these cries behind him he pretended not to hear and in this deception he was assisted by the fact that he was engaged at the time in a furious argument with a friend over the relative merits of two uncle toms cabin companies it appeared that one company had only two bloodhounds while the other had ten on the other hand the first company had two topsys and two uncle toms while the second had only one topsy and one uncle tom but the shouting little boys were hard after him finally they were even pulling at his arms jimmie what he demanded turning with a snarl what dyou want leggo my arm here he is heres the new feller heres the new feller now i dont care if he is said jimmie with grand impatience he tilted his chin i dont care if he is then they reviled him thought you was goin to lick him first time you caught him yah youre a fraidcat they began to sing fraidcat fraidcat fraidcat he expostulated hotly turning from one to the other but they would not listen in the mean time the hedge boy slunk on his way looking with deep anxiety upon this attempt to send jimmie against him but jimmie would have none of the plan iii when the children met again on the playground jimmie was openly challenged with cowardice he had made a big threat in the hearing of comrades and when invited by them to take advantage of an opportunity he had refused they had been fairly sure of their amusement and they were indignant jimmie was finally driven to declare that as soon as school was out for the day he would thrash the hedge boy when finally the children came rushing out of the iron gate filled with the delights of freedom a hundred boys surrounded jimmie in high spirits for he had said that he was determined they waited for the lone lad from jersey city when he appeared jimmie wasted no time he walked straight to him and said did you say you kin lick me johnnie hedge was cowed shrinking affrighted and the roars of a hundred boys thundered in his ears but again he knew what he had to say yes he gasped in anguish then said jimmie resolutely youve got to fight there was a joyous clamor by the mob the beleaguered lad looked this way and that way for succor as willie dalzel and other officious youngsters policed an irregular circle in the crowd he saw jimmie facing him there was no help for it he dropped his books the old books which would not do now it was the fashion among tiny whilomville belligerents to fight much in the manner of little bear cubs two boys would rush upon each other immediately grapple and the best boy having probably succeeded in getting the coveted under hold there would presently be a crash to the earth of the inferior boy and he would probably be mopped around in the dust or the mud or the snow or whatever the material happened to be until the engagement was over whatever havoc was dealt out to him was ordinarily the result of his wild endeavors to throw off his opponent and arise both infants wept during the fight as a common thing and if they wept very hard the fight was a harder fight the result was never very bloody but the complete dishevelment of both victor and vanquished was extraordinary as for the spectacle it more resembled a collision of boys in a fog than it did the manly art of hammering another human being into speechless inability the fight began when jimmie made a mad bearcub rush at the new boy amid savage cries of encouragement willie dalzel for instance almost howled his head off very timid boys on the outskirts of the throng felt their hearts leap to their throats it was a time when certain natures were impressed that only man is vile but it appeared that bearcub rushing was no part of the instruction received by boys in jersey city boys in jersey city were apparently schooled curiously upon the onslaught of jimmie the stranger had gone wild with rage boylike some spark had touched his fightingblood and in a moment he was a cornered desperate fireeyed little man he began to swing his arms to revolve them so swiftly that one might have considered him a small working model of an extrafine patented windmill which was caught in a gale for a moment this defence surprised jimmie more than it damaged him but two moments later a small knotty fist caught him squarely in the eye and with a shriek he went down in defeat he lay on the ground so stunned that he could not even cry but if he had been able to cry he would have cried over his prestige or something not over his eye there was a dreadful tumult the boys cast glances of amazement and terror upon the victor and thronged upon the beaten jimmie trescott it was a moment of excitement so intense that one cannot say what happened never before had whilomville seen such a thing not the little tots they were aghast dumfounded and they glanced often over their shoulders at the new boy who stood alone his clinched fists at his side his face crimson his lips still working with the fury of battle but there was another surprise for whilomville it might have been seen that the little victor was silently debating against an impulse illustration no time for academics he ran but the impulse won for the lone lad from jersey city suddenly wheeled sprang like a demon and struck another boy a curtain should be drawn before this deed a knowledge of it is really too much for the heart to bear the other boy was willie dalzel the lone lad from jersey city had smitten him full sore there is little to say of it it must have been that a feeling worked gradually to the top of the little strangers wrath that jimmie trescott had been a mere tool that the front and centre of his persecutors had been willie dalzel and being rendered temporarily lawless by his fightingblood he raised his hand and smote for revenge willie dalzel had been in the middle of a vandals cry which screeched out over the voices of everybody the new boys fist cut it in half so to say and then arose the howl of an amazed and terrorized walrus one wishes to draw a second curtain without discussion or inquiry or brief retort willie dalzel ran away he ran like a hare straight for home this redoubtable chieftain following him at a heavy and slow pace ran the impassioned new boy the scene was long remembered willie dalzel was no coward he had been panicstricken into running away from a new thing he ran as a man might run from the sudden appearance of a vampire or a ghoul or a gorilla this was no time for academics he ran jimmie slowly gathered himself and came to his feet wheres willie said he first of all the crowd sniggered wheres willie said jimmie again why he licked him too answered a boy suddenly he did said jimmie he sat weakly down on the roadway he did after allowing a moment for the fact to sink into him he looked up at the crowd with his one good eye and his one bunged eye and smiled cheerfully xii the city urchin and the chaste villagers after the brief encounters between the hedge boy and jimmie trescott and the hedge boy and willie dalzel the neighborhood which contained the homes of the boys was as far as child life is concerned in a state resembling anarchy this was owing to the signal overthrow and shameful retreat of the boy who had for several years led a certain little clan by the nose the adherence of the little community did not go necessarily to the boy who could whip all the others but it certainly could not go to a boy who had run away in a manner that made his shame patent to the whole world willie dalzel found himself in a painful position this tiny tribe which had followed him with such unwavering faith was now largely engaged in whistling and catcalling and hooting he chased a number of them into the sanctity of their own yards but from these coigns they continued to ridicule him but it must not be supposed that the fickle tribe went over in a body to the new light they did nothing of the sort they occupied themselves with avenging all which they had endured gladly enough too for many months as for the hedge boy he maintained a curious timid reserve minding his own business with extreme care and going to school with that deadly punctuality of which his mother was the genius jimmie trescott suffered no adverse criticism from his fellows he was entitled to be beaten by a boy who had made willie dalzel bellow like a bullcalf and run away indeed he received some honors he had confronted a very superior boy and received a bang in the eye which for a time was the wonder of the children and he had not bellowed like a bullcalf as a matter of fact he was often invited to tell how it had felt and this he did with some pride claiming arrogantly that he had been superior to any particular pain early in the episode he and the hedge boy had patched up a treaty living next door to each other they could not fail to have each other often in sight one afternoon they wandered together in the strange indefinite diplomacy of boyhood as they drew close the new boy suddenly said napple yes said jimmie and the new boy bestowed upon him an apple it was one of those greencoated winterapples which lie for many months in safe and dry places and can at any time be brought forth for the persecution of the unwary and inexperienced an older age would have fled from this apple but to the unguided youth of jimmie trescott it was a thing to be possessed and cherished wherefore this apple was the emblem of something more than a truce despite the fact that it tasted like wet indian meal and jimmie looked at the hedge boy out of one good eye and one bunged eye the longdrawn animosities of men have no place in the life of a boy the boys mind is flexible he readjusts his position with an ease which is derived from the fact simply that he is not yet a man but there were other and more important matters johnnie hedges exploits had brought him into such prominence among the schoolboys that it was necessary to settle a number of points once and for all there was the usual number of boys in the school who were popularly known to be champions in their various classes among these johnnie hedge now had to thread his way every boy taking it upon himself to feel anxious that johnnies exact position should be soon established his fame as a fighter had gone forth to the world but there were other boys who had fame as fighters and the world was extremely anxious to know where to place the newcomer various heroes were urged to attempt this classification usually it was not accounted a matter of supreme importance but in this boy life it was essential in all cases the heroes were backward enough it was their followings who agitated the question and so johnnie hedge was more or less beset he maintained his bashfulness he backed away from altercation it was plain that to bring matters to a point he must be forced into a quarrel it was also plain that the proper person for the business was some boy who could whip willie dalzel and these formidable warriors were distinctly averse to undertaking the new contract it is a kind of a law in boy life that a quiet decent peaceloving lad is able to thrash a widemouthed talker and so it had transpired that by a peculiar system of elimination most of the real chiefs were quiet decent peaceloving boys and they had no desire to engage in a fight with a boy on the sole grounds that it was not known who could whip johnnie hedge attended his affairs they attended their affairs and around them waged this discussion of relative merit jimmie trescott took a prominent part in these arguments he contended that johnnie hedge could thrash any boy in the world he was certain of it and to any one who opposed him he said you just get one of those smashes in the eye and then youll see in the mean time there was a grand and impressive silence in the direction of willie dalzel he had gathered remnants of his clan but the main parts of his sovereignty were scattered to the winds he was an enemy owing to the circumspect behavior of the new boy the commotions on the school grounds came to nothing he was often asked kin you lick him and he invariably replied i dunno this idea of waging battle with the entire world appalled him a war for complete supremacy of the tribe which had been headed by willie dalzel was fought out in the country of the tribe it came to pass that a certain halfdime bloodandthunder pamphlet had a great vogue in the tribe at this particular time this story relates the experience of a lad who began his career as cabinboy on a pirate ship throughout the first fifteen chapters he was ropesended from one end of the ship to the other end and very often he was felled to the deck by a heavy fist he lived through enough hardships to have killed a battalion of turkish soldiers but in the end he rose upon them yes he rose upon them hordes of pirates fell before his intrepid arm and in the last chapters of the book he is seen jauntily careering on his own hook as one of the most gallous pirate captains that ever sailed the seas naturally when this tale was thoroughly understood by the tribe they had to dramatize it although it was a dramatization that would gain no royalties for the author now it was plain that the urchin who was cast for the cabinboys part would lead a life throughout the first fifteen chapters which would attract few actors willie dalzel developed a scheme by which some small lad would play cabinboy during this period of misfortune and abuse and then when the cabinboy came to the part where he slew all his enemies and reached his zenith that he willie dalzel should take the part this fugitive and disconnected rendering of a great play opened in jimmie trescotts back garden the path between the two lines of gooseberrybushes was elected unanimously to be the ship then willie dalzel insisted that homer phelps should be the cabinboy homer tried the position for a time and then elected that he would resign in favor of some other victim there was no other applicant to succeed him whereupon it became necessary to press some boy jimmie trescott was a great actor as is well known but he steadfastly refused to engage for the part ultimately they seized upon little dan earl whose disposition was so milky and docile that he would do whatever anybody asked of him but dan earl made the one firm revolt of his life after trying existence as cabinboy for some ten minutes willie dalzel was in despair then he suddenly sighted the little brother of johnnie hedge who had come into the garden and in a poorlittlestranger sort of fashion was looking wistfully at the play when he was invited to become the cabinboy he accepted joyfully thinking that it was his initiation into the tribe then they proceeded to give him the ropes end and to punch him with a realism which was not altogether painless directly he began to cry out they exhorted him not to cry out not to mind it but still they continued to hurt him there was a commotion among the gooseberrybushes two branches were swept aside and johnnie hedge walked down upon them every boy stopped in his tracks johnnie was boiling with rage who hurt him he said ferociously did you he had looked at willie dalzel willie dalzel began to mumble we was ony playin wasnt nothin fer him to cry fer the new boy had at his command some big phrases and he used them i am goin to whip you within an inch of your life i am goin to tan the hide offn you and immediately there was a mixture an infusion of two boys which looked as if it had been done by a chemist the other children stood back stricken with horror but out of this whirl they presently perceived the figure of willie dalzel seated upon the chest of the hedge boy got enough asked willie hoarsely no choked out the hedge boy then there was another flapping and floundering and finally another calm illustration who hurt him he said ferociously got enough asked willie no said the hedge boy a sort of warcloud again puzzled the sight of the observers both combatants were breathless bloodless in their faces and very weak got enough said willie no said the hedge boy the carnage was again renewed all the spectators were silent but johnnie hedges little brother who shrilly exhorted him to continue the struggle but it was not plain that the hedge boy needed any encouragement for he was crying bitterly and it has been explained that when a boy cried it was a bad time to hope for peace he had managed to wriggle over upon his hands and knees but willie dalzel was tenaciously gripping him from the back and it seemed that his strength would spend itself in futility the bear cub seemed to have the advantage of the working model of the windmill they heaved uttered strange words wept and the sun looked down upon them with steady unwinking eye peter washington came out of the stable and observed this tragedy of the back garden he stood transfixed for a moment and then ran towards it shouting hi whats all dish yere hi stopper dat stopper dat you two for lan sake whats all dish yere he grabbed the struggling boys and pulled them apart he was stormy and fine in his indignation for lan sake you two kids act like you gwine mad dogs stopper dat the whitened tearful soiled combatants their clothing all awry glared fiercely at each other as peter stood between them lecturing they made several futile attempts to circumvent him and again come to battle as he fended them off with his open hands he delivered his reproaches at jimmie is sprised at you i suhtainly is why said jimmie i aint done nothin what have i done yyyou done courage dese yere kids ter scrap said peter virtuously me cried jimmie i aint had nothin to do with it i raikon you aint retorted peter with heavy sarcasm i raikon you been erprayin aint you turning to willie dalzel he said you jest take

you jest take an trot erlong off home an don lemme caitch you round yere erfightin or ill break yer back the hedge boy moved away with dignity followed by his little brother the latter when he had placed a sufficient distance between himself and peter played his fingers at his nose and called out illustration niggerrr niggerrr niggerrr niggerrr peter washingtons resentment poured out upon jimmie pears like you never would understan you aint reglar common trash you take an sociate with anbody what done come erlong aw go on retorted jimmie profanely go soak your head pete the remaining boys retired to the street whereupon they perceived willie dalzel in the distance he ran to them i licked him he shouted exultantly i licked him didnt i now from the whilomville point of view he was entitled to a favorable answer they made it yes they said you did i run in cried willie an i grabbed im an afore he knew what it was i throwed im an then it was easy he puffed out his chest and smiled like an english recruitingsergeant an now said he suddenly facing jimmie trescott whose side were you on the question was direct and startling jimmie gave back two paces he licked you once he explained haltingly he never saw the day when he could lick one side of me i could lick him with my left hand tied behind me why i could lick him when i was asleep willie dalzel was magnificent a gate clicked and johnnie hedge was seen to be strolling towards them you said he remarked coldly you licked me didnt you willie dalzel stood his ground yes he said stoutly well youre a liar said the hedge boy youre another retorted willie no i aint either but youre a liar youre another retorted willie dont you dare tell me im a liar or ill smack your mouth for you said the hedge boy well i did didnt i barked willie an whatche goin to do about it im goin to lam you said the hedge boy he approached to attack warily and the other boys held their breaths willie dalzel winced back a pace hol on a minute he cried raising his palm im not illustration one approaching from behind laid hold of his ear but the comic windmill was again in motion and between gasps from his exertions johnnie hedge remarked ill show you whether you kin lick me or not the first blows did not reach home on willie for he backed away with expedition keeping up his futile cry hol on a minute soon enough a swinging fist landed on his cheek it did not knock him down but it hurt him a little and frightened him a great deal he suddenly opened his mouth to an amazing and startling extent tilted back his head and howled while his eyes glittering with tears were fixed upon this scowling butcher of a johnnie hedge the latter was making slow and vicious circles evidently intending to renew the massacre but the spectators really had been desolated and shocked by the terrible thing which had happened to willie dalzel they now cried out no no dont hit im any more dont hit im any more jimmie trescott in a panic of bravery yelled well all jump on you if you do the hedge boy paused at bay he breathed angrily and flashed his glance from lad to lad they still protested no no dont hit im any more dont hit im no more ill hammer him until he cant stand up said johnnie observing that they all feared him ill fix him so he wont know hisself an if any of you kids bother with me suddenly he ceased he trembled he collapsed the hand of one approaching from behind had laid hold upon his ear and it was the hand of one whom he knew the other lads heard a loud ironfiling voice say caught ye at it again ye brat ye they saw a dreadful woman with gray hair with a sharp red nose with bare arms with spectacles of such magnifying quality that her eyes shone through them like two fierce white moons she was johnnie hedges mother still holding johnnie by the ear she swung out swiftly and dexterously and succeeded in boxing the ears of two boys before the crowd regained its presence of mind and stampeded yes the war for supremacy was over and the question was never again disputed the supreme power was mrs hedge xiii a little pilgrimage one november it became clear to childish minds in certain parts of whilomville that the sundayschool of the presbyterian church would not have for the children the usual tree on christmas eve the funds free for that ancient festival would be used for the relief of suffering among the victims of the charleston earthquake the plan had been born in the generous head of the superintendent of the sundayschool and during one session he had made a strong plea that the children should forego the vain pleasures of a tree and in glorious application of the golden rule refuse a local use of the fund and will that it be sent where dire pain might be alleviated at the end of a tearfully eloquent speech the question was put fairly to a vote and the children in a burst of virtuous abandon carried the question for charleston many of the teachers had been careful to preserve a finely neutral attitude but even if they had cautioned the children against being too impetuous they could not have checked the wild impulses but this was a long time before christmas very early boys held important speech together huh you aint goin to have no christmas tree at the presbyterian sundayschool sullenly the victim answered no we aint huh scoffed the other denomination we are goin to have the allfiredest biggest tree that you ever saw in the world the little presbyterians were greatly downcast it happened that jimmie trescott had regularly attended the presbyterian sundayschool the trescotts were consistently undenominational but they had sent their lad on sundays to one of the places where they thought he would receive benefits however on one day in december jimmie appeared before his father and made a strong spiritual appeal to be forthwith attached to the sundayschool of the big progressive church doctor trescott mused this question considerably well jim he said why do you conclude that the big progressive sundayschool is better for you than the presbyterian sundayschool now its nicer answered jimmie looking at his father with an anxious eye how do you mean why now some of the boys what go to the presbyterian place they aint very nice explained the flagrant jimmie trescott mused the question considerably once more in the end he said well you may change if you wish this one time but you must not be changing to and fro you decide now and then you must abide by your decision yessir said jimmie brightly big progressive all right said the father but remember what ive told you on the following sunday morning jimmie presented himself at the door of the basement of the big progressive church he was conspicuously washed notably raimented prominently polished and incidentally he was very uncomfortable because of all these virtues a number of acquaintances greeted him contemptuously hello jimmie what you doin here thought you was a presbyterian jimmie cast down his eyes and made no reply he was too cowed by the change however homer phelps who was a regular patron of the big progressive sundayschool suddenly appeared and said hello jim jimmie seized upon him homer phelps was amenable to trescott laws tribal if you like but ironbound almost compulsory hello homer said jimmie and his manner was so good that homer felt a great thrill in being able to show his superior a new condition of life you aint never come here afore have you he demanded with a new arrogance no i aint said jimmie then they stared at each other and manoeuvred you dont know my teacher said homer no i dont know her admitted jimmie but in a way which contended modestly that he knew countless other sundayschool teachers better join our class said homer sagely she wears spectacles dont see very well sometimes we do almost what we like all right said jimmie glad to place himself in the hands of his friends in due time they entered the sundayschool room where a man with benevolent whiskers stood on a platform and said we will now sing no pull for the shore sailor pull for the shore and as the obedient throng burst into melody the man on the platform indicated the time with a fat white and graceful hand he was an ideal sundayschool superintendent one who had never felt hunger or thirst or the wound of the challenge of dishonor a man indeed with beautiful flat hands who waved them in greasy victorious beneficence over a crowd of children jimmie walking carefully on his toes followed homer phelps he felt that the kingly superintendent might cry out and blast him to ashes before he could reach a chair it was a desperate journey but at last he heard homer muttering to a young lady who looked at him through glasses which greatly magnified her eyes a new boy she said in an oily and deeply religious voice yesm said jimmie trembling the five other boys of the class scanned him keenly and derided his condition we will proceed to the lesson said the young lady then she cried sternly like a sergeant the seventh chapter of jeremiah there was a swift fluttering of leaflets then the name of jeremiah a wise man towered over the feelings of these boys homer phelps was doomed to read the fourth verse he took a deep breath he puffed out his lips he gathered his strength for a great effort his beginning was childishly explosive he hurriedly said trust ye not in lying words saying the temple of the lord the temple of the lord the temple of the lord are these now said the teacher johnnie scanlan tell us what these words mean the scanlan boy shamefacedly muttered that he did not know the teachers countenance saddened her heart was in her work she wanted to make a success of this sundayschool class perhaps homer phelps can tell us she remarked homer gulped he looked at jimmie through the great room hummed a steady hum a little circle very near was being told about daniel in the lions den they were deeply moved at the moment they liked sundayschool why now it means said homer with a grand pomposity born of a sense of hopeless ignorance it means why it means that they were in the wrong place no said the teacher profoundly it means that we should be good very good indeed that is what it means it means that we should love the lord and be good love the lord and be good that is what it means illustration the professional bright boy of the class suddenly awoke the little boys suddenly had a sense of black wickedness as their teacher looked austerely upon them they gazed at her with the wideopen eyes of simplicity they were stirred again this thing of being good this great business of life apparently it was always successful they knew from the fairy tales but it was difficult wasnt it it was said to be the most heartbreaking task to be generous wasnt it one had to pay the price of ones eyes in order to be pacific didnt one as for patience it was tortured martyrdom to be patient wasnt it sin was simple wasnt it but virtue was so difficult that it could only be practised by heavenly beings wasnt it and the angels the sundayschool superintendent and the teacher swam in the high visions of the little boys as beings so good that if a boy scratched his shin in the same room he was a profane and sentenced devil and said the teacher the temple of the lord what does that mean ill ask the new boy what does that mean i dunno said jimmie blankly but here the professional bright boy of the class suddenly awoke to his obligations teacher he cried it means church same as this exactly said the teacher deeply satisfied with this reply you know your lesson well clarence i am much pleased the other boys instead of being envious looked with admiration upon clarence while he adopted an air of being habituated to perform such feats every day of his life still he was not much of a boy he had the virtue of being able to walk on very high stilts but when the season of stilts had passed he possessed no rank save this sundayschool rank this cleverlittleclarence business of knowing the bible and the lesson better than the other boys the other boys sometimes looking at him meditatively did not actually decide to thrash him as soon as he cleared the portals of the church but they certainly decided to molest him in such ways as would reestablish their selfrespect back of the superintendents chair hung a lithograph of the martyrdom of st stephen jimmie feeling stiff and encased in his best clothes waited for the ordeal to end a bell pealed the fat hand of the superintendent had tapped a bell slowly the rustling and murmuring dwindled to silence the benevolent man faced the school i have to announce he began waving his body from side to side in the conventional bows of his kind that bang went the bell give me your attention please children i have to announce that the board has decided that this year there will be no christmas tree but the instantly the room buzzed with the subdued clamor of the children jimmie was speechless he stood morosely during the singing of the closing hymn he passed out into the street with the others pushing no more than was required speedily the whole idea left him if he remembered sundayschool at all it was to remember that he did not like it transcribers note archaic and inconsistent punctuation spelling and syntax have been retained
