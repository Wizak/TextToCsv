the man with the golden gun by ian fleming can i help you the secret service holds much that is kept secret even from very senior officers in the organization only m and his chief of staff know absolutely everything there is to know the latter is responsible for keeping the top secret record known as the war book so that in the event of the death of both of them the whole story apart from what is available to individual sections and stations would be available to their successors one thing that james bond for instance didnt know was the machinery at headquarters for dealing with the public whether friendly or otherwisedrunks lunatics bona fide applications to join the service and enemy agents with plans for penetration or even assassination on that cold clear morning in november he was to see the careful cogwheels in motion the girl at the switchboard at the ministry of defence flicked the switch to hold and said to her neighbour its another nut who says hes james bond even knows his code number says he wants to speak to m personally the senior girl shrugged the switchboard had had quite a few such calls since a year before james bonds death on a mission to japan had been announced in the press there had even been one pestiferous woman who at every full moon passed on messages from bond on uranus where it seemed he had got stuck while awaiting entry into heaven she said put him through to liaison pat the liaison section was the first cog in the machine the first sieve the operator got back on the line just a moment sir ill put you on to an officer who may be able to help you james bond sitting on the edge of his bed said thank you he had expected some delay before he could establish his identity he had been warned to expect it by the charming colonel boris who had been in charge of him for the past few months after he had finished his treatment in the luxurious institute on the nevsky prospekt in leningrad a mans voice came on the line captain walker speaking can i help you james bond spoke slowly and clearly this is commander james bond speaking number would you put me through to m or his secretary miss moneypenny i want to make an appointment captain walker pressed two buttons on the side of his telephone one of them switched on a tape recorder for the use of his department the other alerted one of the duty officers in the action room of the special branch at scotland yard that he should listen to the conversation trace the call and at once put a tail on the caller it was now up to captain walker who was in fact an extremely bright exprisonerofwar interrogator from military intelligence to keep the subject talking for as near five minutes as possible he said im afraid i dont know either of these two people are you sure youve got the right number james bond patiently repeated the regent number which was the main outside line for the secret service together with so much else he had forgotten it but colonel boris had known it and had made him write it down among the small print on the front page of his forged british passport that said his name was frank westmacott company director yes said captain walker sympathetically we seem to have got that part of it right but im afraid i cant place these people you want to talk to who exactly are they this mr em for instance i dont think weve got anyone of that name at the ministry do you want me to spell it out you realize this is an open line captain walker was rather impressed by the confidence in the speakers voice he pressed another button and so that bond would hear it a telephone bell rang he said hang on a moment would you theres someone on my other line captain walker got on to the head of his section sorry sir ive got a chap on who says hes james bond and wants to talk to m i know it sounds crazy and ive gone through the usual motions with the special branch and so on but would you mind listening for a minute thank you sir two rooms away a harassed man who was the chief security officer for the secret service said blast and pressed a switch a microphone on his desk came to life the chief security officer sat very still he badly needed a cigarette but his room was now live to captain walker and to the lunatic who called himself james bond captain walkers voice came over at full strength im so sorry now then this man mr em you want to talk to im sure we neednt worry about security could you be more specific james bond frowned he didnt know that he had frowned and he wouldnt have been able to explain why he had done so he said and lowered his voice again inexplicably admiral sir miles messervy he is head of a department in your ministry the number of his room used to be twelve on the eighth floor he used to have a secretary called miss moneypenny goodlooking girl brunette shall i give you the chief of staffs name no well lets see its wednesday shall i tell you whatll be the main dish on the menu in the canteen it should be steakandkidney pudding the chief security officer picked up the direct telephone to captain walker captain walker said to james bond damn theres the other telephone again shant be a minute he picked up the green telephone yes sir i dont like that bit about the steakandkidney pudding pass him on to the hard man no cancel that make it the soft there was always something odd about s death no body no solid evidence and the people on that japanese island always seemed to me to be playing it pretty close to the chest the stoneface act its just possible keep me informed would you captain walker got back to james bond sorry about that its being a busy day now then this inquiry of yours afraid i cant help you myself not my part of the ministry the man you want is major townsend he should be able to locate this man you want to see got a pencil its number fortyfour kensington cloisters got that kensington double five double five give me ten minutes and ill have a word with him and see if he can help all right james bond said dully thats very kind of you he put down the telephone he waited exactly ten minutes and picked up the receiver and asked for the number james bond was staying at the ritz hotel colonel boris had told him to do so bonds file in the kgb archive described him as a highliver so on arrival in london he must stick to the kgb image of the high life bond went down in the lift to the arlington street entrance a man at the newsstand got a good profile of him with a buttonhole minox when bond went down the shallow steps to the street and asked the commissionaire for a taxi a canonflex with a telescopic lens clicked away busily from a red roses laundry van at the neighbouring goods entrance and in due course the same van followed bonds taxi while a man inside the van reported briefly to the action room of the special branch number fortyfour kensington cloisters was a dull victorian mansion in grimy red brick it had been chosen for its purpose because it had once been the headquarters of the empire league for noise abatement and its entrance still bore the brass plate of this longdefunct organization the empty shell of which had been purchased by the secret service through the commonwealth relations office it also had a spacious oldfashioned basement reequipped as detention cells and a rear exit into a quiet mews the red roses laundry van watched the front door shut behind james bond and then moved off at a sedate speed to its garage not far from scotland yard while the process of developing the canonflex film went on in its interior appointment with major townsend said bond yes hes expecting you sir shall i take your raincoat the powerfullooking doorman put the coat on a coat hanger and hung it up on one of a row of hooks beside the door as soon as bond was safely closeted with major townsend the coat would go swiftly to the laboratory on the first floor where its provenance would be established from an examination of the fabric pocket dust would be removed for more leisurely research would you follow me sir it was a narrow corridor of freshly painted clapboard with a tall single window which concealed the fluoroscope triggered automatically from beneath the ugly patterned carpet the findings of its xray eye would be fed into the laboratory above the passage the passage ended intwo facing doors marked a and b the doorman knocked on room b and stood aside for bond to enter it was a pleasant very light room closecarpeted in dovegrey wilton the military prints on the cream walls were expensively framed a small bright fire burned under an adam mantelpiece which bore a number of silver trophies and two photographs in leather framesone of a nicelooking woman and the other of three nicelooking children there was a central table with a bowl of flowers and two comfortable club chairs on either side of the fire no desk or filing cabinets nothing officiallooking a tall man as pleasant as the room got up from the far chair dropped the times on the carpet beside it and came forward with a welcoming smile he held out a firm dry hand this was the soft man come in come in take a pew cigarette not the ones i seem to remember you favour just the good old senior service major townsend had carefully prepared the loaded remarka reference to bonds liking for the morland specials with the three gold rings he noted bonds apparent lack of comprehension bond took a cigarette and accepted a light they sat down facing one another major townsend crossed his legs comfortably bond sat up straight major townsend said well now how can i help you across the corridor in room aa cold office of works cube equipped only with a hissing gas fire an ugly desk under a naked neon light and two wooden chairs bonds reception by the hard man an expolice superintendent would have been very different there the man who went under the name of mr robson would have given him the full intimidation treatment harsh bullying interrogation threats of imprisonment for false representation and god knows what else and perhaps if he had shown signs of hostility or developing a nuisance value a little judicious roughingup in the basement such was the ultimate sieve which sorted out the wheat from the chaff from among those members of the public who desired access to the secret service there were other people in the building who dealt with the letters those written in pencil or in multicoloured inks and those enclosing a photograph remained unanswered those which threatened or were litigious were referred to the special branch the solid serious ones were passed with a comment from the best graphologist in the business to the liaison section at headquarters for further action parcels went automatically and fast to the bomb disposal squad at knightsbridge barracks the eye of the needle was narrow on the whole it discriminated appropriately it was an expensive setup but it is the first duty of a secret service to remain not only secret but secure there was no reason why james bond who had always been on the operative side of the business should know anything about the entrails of the service any more than he should have understood the mysteries of the plumbing or electricity supply of his flat in chelsea or the working of his own kidneys colonel boris however had known the whole routine the secret services of all the great powers know the public face of their opponents and colonel boris had very accurately described the treatment that james bond must expect before he was cleared and was allowed access to the office of his former chief so now james bond paused before he replied to major townsends question about how he could be of help he looked at the soft man and then into the fire he added up the accuracy of the description he had been given of major townsends appearance and before he said what he had been told to say he gave colonel boris ninety out of a hundred the big friendly face the wideapart palebrown eyes bracketed by the wrinkles of a million smiles the military moustache the rimless monocle dangling from a thin black cord the brushedback thinning sandy hair the immaculate doublebreasted blue suit stiff white collar and brigade tieit was all there but what colonel boris hadnt said was that the friendly eyes were as cold and steady as gunbarrels and that the lips were thin and scholarly james bond said patiently its really quite simple im who i say i am im doing what i naturally would do and thats report back to m quite but you must realizea sympathetic smile that youve been out of contact for nearly a year youve been officially posted as missing believed killed your obituary has even appeared in the times have you any evidence of identity i admit that you look very much like your photographs but you must see that we have to be very sure before we pass you on up the ladder a miss mary goodnight was my secretary shed recognize me all right so would dozens of other people at hq miss goodnights been posted abroad can you give me a brief description of hq just the main geography bond did so right now who was a miss maria freudenstadt was yes shes dead thought she wouldnt last long she was a double working for kgb section one hundred controlled her i wouldnt get any thanks for telling you any more major townsend had been pruned with this very secret top question he had been given the answer more or less as bond had put it this was the clincher this had to be james bond well were getting on fine now it only remains to find out where youve come from and where youve been all these months and i wont keep you any longer sorry i can only tell that to m personally i see major townsend put on a thoughtful expression well just let me make a telephone call or two and ill see what can be done he got to his feet seen todays times he picked it up and handed it to bond it had been specially treated to give good prints bond took it shant be long major townsend shut the door behind him and went across the passage and through the door marked a where he knew that mr robson would be alone sorry to bother you fred can i use your scrambler the chunky man behind the desk grunted through the stem of his pipe and remained bent over the midday evening standard racing news major townsend picked up the green receiver and was put through to the laboratory major townsend speaking any comment he listened carefully said thank you and got through to the chief security officer at headquarters well sir i think it must be bit thinner than his photographs ill be giving you his prints as soon as hes gone wearing his usual rigdarkblue singlebreasted suit white shirt thin black knitted silk tie black casuals but they all look brandnew raincoat bought yesterday from burberrys got the freudenstadt question right but says he wont say anything about himself except to m personally but whoever he is i dont like it much he fluffed on his special cigarettes hes got an odd sort of glazed sort of faraway look and the scope shows that hes carrying a gun inhis righthand coat pocketcurious sort of contraption doesnt seem to have got a butt to it id say hes a sick man i wouldnt personally recommend that m should see him but i wouldnt know how were to get him to talk unless he does he paused very good sir ill stay by the telephone im on mr robsons extension there was silence in the room the two men didnt get on well together major townsend gazed into the gas fire wondering about the man next door the telephone burred yes sir very good sir would your secretary send along a car from the pool thank you sir bond was sitting in the same upright posture the times still unopened in his hand major townsend said cheerfully well thats fixed message from m that hes tremendously relieved youre all right and hell be free in about half an hour car should be here in ten minutes or so and the chief of staff says he hopes youll be free for lunch afterwards james bond smiled for the first time it was a thin smile which didnt light up his eyes he said thats very kind of nun would you tell him im afraid i shant be free attentat the chief of staff stood in front of ms desk and said firmly i really wouldnt do it sir i can see him or someone else can i dont like the smell of it at all i think s round the bend theres no doubt its him all right the prints have just been confirmed by chief of security and the pictures are all rightand the recording of his voice but there are too many things that dont add up this forged passport we found in his room at the ritz for instance all right so he wanted to come back into the country quietly but its too good a job typical kgb sample and the last entry is west germany day before yesterday why didnt he report to station b or w both those heads of station are friends of his particularly in berlin and why didnt he go and have a look at his flat hes got some sort of a housekeeper there scotswoman called may whos always sworn he was still alive and has kept the place going on her savings the ritz is sort of stage bond and these new clothes why did he have to bother doesnt matter what he was wearing when he came in through dover normal thing if he was in rags would have been to give me a ringhe had my home number and get me to fix him up have a few drinks and run over his story and then report here instead of that weve got this typical penetration approach and security worried as hell the chief of staff paused he knew he wasnt getting through as soon as he had begun m had swivelled his chair sideways and had remained occasionally sucking at an unlighted pipe gazing moodily out through the window at the jagged skyline of london obstinately the chief of staff concluded do you think you could leave this one to me sir i can get hold of sir james molony in no time and have put into the park for observation and treatment itll all be done very gently vip handling and so on i can say youve been called to the cabinet or something security says s looking a bit thin build him up convalescence and all that that can be the excuse if he cuts up rough we can always give him some dope hes a good friend of mine he wont hold it against us he obviously needs to be got back in the grooveif we can do it that is m slowly swivelled his chair round he looked up at the tired worried face that showed the strain of being the equivalent of number two in the secret service for ten years and more m smiled thank you chief of staff but im afraid its not as easy as all that i sent out on his last job to shake him out of his domestic worries you remember how it all came about well we had no idea that what seemed a fairly peaceful mission was going to end up in a pitched battle with blofeld or that was going to vanish off the face of the earth for a year now weve got to know what happened during that year and s quite right i sent him out on that mission and hes got every right to report back to me personally i know hes a stubborn fellow if he says he wont tell anyone else he wont of course i want to hear what happened to him youll listen in have a couple of good men at hand if he turns rough come and get him as for his gunm gestured vaguely at the ceilingi can look after that have you tested the damned thing yes sir it works all right but m held up a hand sorry chief of staff its an order a light winked on the intercom thatll be him send him straight in would you very good sir the chief of staff went out and closed the door james bond was standing smiling vaguely down at miss moneypenny she looked distraught when james bond shifted his gaze and said hullo bill he still wore the same distant smile he didnt hold out his hand bill tanner said with a heartiness that rang with a terrible falsity in his ears hullo james long time no see at the same time out of the corner of his eyes he saw miss moneypenny give a quick emphatic shake of the head he looked her straight in the eyes m would like to see straight away miss moneypenny lied desperately you know ms got a chiefs of staff meeting at the cabinet office in five minutes yes he says you must somehow get him out of it the chief of staff turned to james bond okay james go ahead sorry you cant manage lunch come and have a gossip after ms finished with you bond said thatll be fine he squared his shoulders and walked through the door over which the red light was already burning miss moneypenny buried her face in her hands oh bill she said desperately theres something wrong with him im frightened bill tanner said take it easy penny im going to do what i can he walked quickly into his office and shut the door he went over to his desk and pressed a switch ms voice came into the room hullo james wonderful to have you back take a seat and tell me all about it bill tanner picked up the office telephone and asked for head of security james bond took his usual place across the desk from m a storm of memories whirled through his consciousness like badly cut film on a projector that had gone crazy bond closed his mind to the storm he must concentrate on what he had to say and do and on nothing else im afraid theres a lot i still cant remember sir i got a bang on the headhe touched his right temple somewhere along the line on that job you sent me to do in japan then theres a blank until i got picked up by the police on the waterfront at vladivostok no idea how i got there they roughed me up a bit and in the process i must have got another bang on the head because suddenly i remembered who i was and that i wasnt a japanese fisherman which was what i thought i was so then of course the police passed me on to the local branch of the kgbits a big grey building on the morskaya ulitsa facing the harbour near the railway station by the wayand when they belinographed my prints to moscow there was a lot of excitement and they flew me there from the military airfield just north of the town at vtoraya rechka and spent weeks interrogating meor trying to rather because i couldnt remember anything except when they prompted me with something they knew themselves and then i could give them a few hazy details to add to their knowledge very frustrating for them very commented m a small frown had gathered between his eyes and you told them everything you could wasnt that rather er generous of you they were very nice to me in every way sir it seemed the least i could do there was this institute place in leningrad they gave me vip treatment top brain specialists and everything they didnt seem to hold it against me that id been working against them for most of my life and other people came and talked to me very reasonably about the political situation and so forth the need for east and west to work together for world peace they made clear a lot of things that hadnt occurred to me before they quite convinced me bond looked obstinately across the table into the clear blue sailors eyes that now held a red spark of anger i dont suppose you understand what i mean sir youve been making war against someone or other all your life youre doing so at this moment and for most of my adult life youve used me as a tool fortunately thats all over now m said fiercely it certainly is i suppose among other things youve forgotten is reading reports of our pows in the korean war who were brainwashed by the chinese if the russians are so keen on peace what do they need the kgb for at the last estimate that was about one hundred thousand men and women making waras you call itagainst us and other countries this is the organization that was so charming to you in leningrad did they happen to mention the murder of horcher and stutz in munich last month oh yes sir bonds voice was patient equable they have to defend themselves against the secret services of the west if you would demobilize all this bond waved a handthey would be only too delighted to scrap the kgb they were quite open about it all and the same thing applies to their two hundred divisions and their uboat fleet and their icbms i suppose ms voice rasped of course sir well if you found these people so reasonable and charming why didnt you stay there others have burgess is dead but you could have chummed up with maclean we thought it more important that i should come back and fight for peace here sir you and your agents have taught me certain skills for use in the underground war it was explained to me how these skills could be used in the cause of peace james bonds hand moved nonchalantly to his righthand coat pocket m with equal casualness shifted his chair back from his desk his left hand felt for the button under the arm of the chair for instance said m quietly knowing that death had walked into the room and was standing beside him and that this was an invitation for death to take his place in the chair james bond had become tense there was a whiteness round his lips the bluegrey eyes still stared blankly almost unseeingly at m the words rang out harshly as if forced out of him by some inner compulsion it would be a start if the warmongers could be eliminated sir this is for number one on the list the hand snubnosed with black metal flashed out of the pocket but even as the poison hissed down the barrel of the bulbbutted pistol the great sheet of armorplate glass hurtled down from the baffled slit in the ceiling and with a last sigh of hydraulics braked to the floor the jet of viscous brown fluid splashed harmlessly into its centre and trickled slowly down distorting the reflection of ms face and the arm he had automatically thrown up for additional protection the chief of staff had burst into the room followed by the head of security they threw themselves on james bond even as they seized his arms his head fell forward on his chest and he would have slid from his chair to the ground if they hadnt supported him they hauled him to his feet he was in a dead faint the head of security sniffed cyanide he said curtly we must all get out of here and bloody quick the pistol lay on the carpet where it had fallen he kicked it away he said to m who had walked out from behind his glass shield would you mind leaving the room sir quickly ill have this cleaned up during the lunch hour it was an order m went to the open door miss moneypenny stood with her clenched hand up to her mouth she watched with horror as james bonds supine body was hauled out and the heels of its shoes leaving tracks on the carpet taken into the chief of staffs room m said sharply close that door miss moneypenny get the duty mo up right away come along girl dont just stand there gawking and not a word of this to anyone understood miss moneypenny pulled herself back from the edge of hysterics she said an automatic yes sir pulled the door shut and reached for the interoffice telephone m walked across and into the chief of staffs office and closed the door head of security was on his knees beside bond he had loosened his tie and collar button and was feeling his pulse bonds face was white and bathed in sweat his breathing was a desperate rattle as if he had just run a race m looked briefly down at him and then his face hidden from the others at the wall beyond the body he turned to the chief of staff he said briskly well thats that my predecessor died in that chair then it was a simple bullet but from much the same sort of a crazed officer one cant legislate against the lunatic but the office of works certainly did a good job with that gadget now then chief of staff this is of course to go no further get sir james molony as soon as you can and have taken down to the park ambulance surreptitious guard ill explain things to sir james this afternoon briefly as you heard the kgb got hold of him brainwashed him he was already a sick man amnesia of some kind ill tell you all i know later have his things collected from the ritz and his bill paid and put something out to the press association something on these lines the ministry of defense is pleasedno say delighted to announce that commander james bond etc who was posted as missing believed killed while on a mission to japan last november has returned to this country after a hazardous journey across the soviet union which is expected to yield much valuable information commander bonds health has inevitably suffered from his experiences and he is convalescing under medical supervision m smiled frostily that bit about informationll give no joy to comrade semichastny and his troops and add a d noticetoeditors it is particularly requested for security reasons that the minimum of speculation or comment be added to the above communique and that no attempts be made to trace commander bonds whereabouts all right bill tanner had been writing furiously to keep up with m he looked up from his scratchpad bewildered but arent you going to make any charges sir after all treason and attempted murder i mean not even a court martial certainly not ms voice was gruff was a sick man not responsible for his actions if one can brainwash a man presumably one can unbrainwash him if anyone can sir james can put him back on half pay for the time being in his old section and see he gets full back pay and allowances for the past year if the kgb has the nerve to throw one of my best men at me i have the nerve to throw him back at them was a good agent once theres no reason why he shouldnt be a good agent again within limits that is after lunch give me the file on scaramanga if we can get him fit again thats the rightsized target for the chief of staff protested but thats suicide sir even could never take him m said coldly what would get for this mornings bit of work twenty years as a minimum id say better for him to fall on the battlefield if he brings it off hell have won his spurs back again and we can all forget the past anyway thats my decision there was a knock on the door and the duty medical officer came into the room m bade him good afternoon and turned stiffly on his heel and walked out through the open door the chief of staff looked at the retreating back he said under his breath you coldhearted bastard then with his usual minute thoroughness and sense of duty he set about the tasks he had been given his not to reason why pistols scaramanga at blades m ate his usual meagre luncheona grilled dover sole followed by the ripest spoonful he could gouge from the club stilton and as usual he sat by himself in one of the window seats and barricaded himself behind the times occasionally turning a page to demonstrate that he was reading it which in fact he wasnt but porterfield commented to the head waitress lily a handsome muchloved ornament of the club that theres something wrong with the old man today or maybe not exactly wrong but theres something up with him porterfield prided himself on being something of an amateur psychologist as headwaiter and father confessor to many of the members he knew a lot about all of them and liked to think he knew everything so that in the tradition of incomparable servants he could anticipate their wishes and their moods now standing with lily in a quiet moment behind the finest cold buffet on display at that date anywhere in the world he explained himself you know that terrible stuff sir miles always drinks that algerian red wine that the wine committee wont even allow on the wine list they only have it in the club to please sir miles well he explained to me once that in the navy they used to call it the infuriator because if you drank too much of it it seems that it used to put you into a rage well now in the ten years that ive had the pleasure of looking after sir miles hes never ordered more than half a carafe of the stuff porterfields benign almost priestly countenance assumed an expression of theatrical solemnity as if he had read something really terrible in the tea leaves then what happens today lily clasped her hands tensely and bent her head fractionally closer to get the full impact of the news the old man says porterfield a bottle of infuriator you understand a full bottle so of course i didnt say anything but went off and brought it to him but you mark my words lilyhe noticed a lifted hand down the long room and moved offtheres something hit sir miles hard this morning and no mistake m sent for his bill as usual he paid whatever the amount of the bill with a fivepound note for the pleasure of receiving in change crisp new pound notes new silver and gleaming copper pennies for it is the custom at blades to give its members only freshly minted money porterfield pulled back his table and m walked quickly to the door acknowledging the occasional greeting with a preoccupied nod and a brief lifting of the hand it was two oclock the old black phantom rolls took him quietly and quickly northwards through berkeley square across oxford street and via wigmore street into regents park m didnt look out at the passing scene he sat stiffly in the back his bowler hat squarely set on the middle of his head and gazed unseeing at the back of the chauffeurs head with hooded brooding eyes for the hundredth time since he had left his office that morning he assured himself that his decision was right if james bond could be straightened outand m was certain that that supreme neurologist sir james molony could bring it offit would be ridiculous to reassign him to normal staff duties in the doubleo section the past could be forgiven but not forgottenexcept with the passage of time it would be most irksome for those in the know to have bond moving about headquarters as if nothing had happened it would be doubly embarrassing for m to have to face bond across that desk and james bond if aimed straight at a known targetm put it in the language of battleshipswas a supremely effective firingpiece well the target was there and it desperately demanded destruction bond had accused m of using him as a tool naturally every officer in the service was a tool for one secret purpose or another the problem on hand could only be solved by a killing james bond would not possess the doubleo prefix if he had not high talents frequently proved as a gunman so be it in exchange for the happenings of that morning in expiation of them bond must prove himself at his old skills if he succeeded he would have regained his prevous status if he failed well it would be a death for which he would be honoured win or lose the plan would solve a vast array of problems m closed his mind once and for all on his decision he got out of the car and went up in the lift to the eighth floor and along the corridor smelling the smell of some unknown disinfectant more and more powerfully as he approached his office instead of using his key to the private entrance at the end of the corridor m turned right through miss moneypennys door she was sitting in her usual place typing away at the usual routine correspondence she got to her feet whats this dreadful stink miss moneypenny i dont know what its called sir head of security brought along a squad from chemical warfare at the war office he says your office is all right to use again but to keep the windows open for a while so ive turned on the heating chief of staff isnt back from lunch yet but he told me to tell you that everything you wanted done is under way sir james is operating until four but will expect your call after that heres the file you wanted sir m took the brown folder with the red top secret star in its top righthand corner hows did he come round all right miss moneypennys face was expressionless i gather so sir the mo gave him a sedative of some kind and he was taken off on a stretcher during the lunch hours he was covered up they took him down in the service lift to the garage i havent had any inquiries good well bring me in the signals would you theres been a lot of tune wasted today on all these domestic excitements carrying the brown folder m went through the door into his office miss moneypenny brought in the signals and stood dutifully beside him while he went through them occasionally dictating a comment or a query she looked down at the bowed irongrey head with the bald patch polished for years by a succession of naval caps and wondered as she had wondered so often over the past ten years whether she loved or hated this man one thing was certain she respected him more than any man she had known or had read of m handed her the file thank you now just give me a quarter of an hour and then ill see whoever wants me the call to sir james has priority of course m opened the brown folder reached for his pipe and began absentmindedly filling it as he glanced through the list of subsidiary files to see if there was any other docket he immediately needed then he set a match to his pipe and settled back in his chair and read francisco pistols scaramanga and underneath in lowercase type freelance assassin mainly under kgb control through dss havana cuba but often as an independent operator for other organizations in the caribbean and central american states has caused widespread damage particularly to the ss but also to cia and other friendly services by murder and scientific maiming since the

keen and successful dealing in real estate and plantations became consolidated for trujillo of the dominican republic and batista of cuba in settled in havana and seeing the way the wind blew while remaining ostensibly a batista man began working undercover for the castro party and after the revolution obtained an influential post as foreign enforcer for the dss in this capacity on behalf that is of the cuban secret police he undertook the assassinations mentioned above passport various including cuban diplomatic disguises none they are not necessary the myth surrounding this man the equivalent let us say of that surrounding the most famous film star and the fact that he has no police record have hitherto given him complete freedom of movement and indemnity from interference in his territory in most of the islands and mainland republics which constitute this territory he has groups of admirers and commands powerful pressure groups who give him protection and succour when called upon to do so moreover as the ostensible purchaser and usually the legal front for the hot money properties mentioned above he has legitimate access frequently supported by his diplomatic status to any part of his territory resources considerable but of unknown extent travels on various credit cards of the diners club variety has a numbered account with the union des banques de credit zurich and appears to have no difficulty in obtaining foreign currency from the slim resources of cuba when he needs it motivation m refilled and relit his pipe which had died what had gone before was routine information which added nothing to his basic knowledge of the man what followed would be of more interest cc covered the identity of a former regius professor of history at oxford who lived a to mpampered existence at headquarters in a small andin ms opinionovercomfortable office in between again in ms opinionoverluxurious and overlong meals at the garrick club he wandered at his ease into headquarters examined such files as the present one asked questions and had signals of inquiry sent and then delivered his judgment but m for all his prejudices against the man his haircut the casualness of his clothes what he knew of his way of life and the apparently haphazard processes of his ratiocination appreciated the sharpness of the mind the knowledge of the world that cc brought to his task and so often the accuracy of his judgments in short m always enjoyed what cc had to say and he now picked up the file again with relish i am interested in this man and i have caused inquiries to be made on a somewhat wider front than usual since it is not common to be confronted with a secret agent who it at once so much of a public figure and yet appears to be infinitely successful in the difficult and dangerous field of his choicethat of being in common parlance a gun for hire i think i may have found the origin of this partiality for killing his fellow men in cold blood men against whom he has no personal animosity but merely the reflected animosity of his employers in the following bizarre anecdote from his youth in the travelling circus of his father enrico scaramanga the boy had several roles he was a most spectacular trick shot he was a standin strong man in the acrobatic troop often taking the place of the usual artiste as bottom man in the human pyramid act and he was the mahout in gorgeous turban indian robes etc who rode the leading elephant in a troupe of three this elephant by the name of max was a male and it is a peculiarity of the male elephant which i have learned with much interest and verified with eminent zoologists that at intervals during the year they go on heat sexually during these pe nods a mucous deposit forms behind the animals ears and this needs to be scraped off since otherwise it causes the elephant intense irritation max developed this symptom during a visit of the circus to trieste but through an oversight the condition was not noticed and given the necessary treatment the big top of the circus had been erected on the outskirts of the town adjacent to the coastal railway line and on the night which was in my opinion to determine the future way of life of the young scaramanga max went berserk threw the youth and screaming horrifically trampled his way through the auditorium causing many casualties and charged off across the fairground and onto the railway line down which he galloped at full speed the local carabinieri were alerted and set off in pursuit by car along the main road that flanks the railway line in due course they caught up with the unfortunate monster which his frenzy expired stood peacefully facing back the way he had come not realizing that the elephant if approached by his handler could now be led peacefully back to his stall the police opened rapid fire and bullets from their carbines and revolvers wounded the animal superficially in many places infuriated afresh the miserable beast now pursued by the police car from which the hail of fire continued charged off again along the railway line on arrival at the fairground the elephant seemed to recognize his home the big top and turning off the railway line lumbered back through the fleeing spectators to the centre of the deserted arena and there weakened by loss of blood pathetically continued with his interrupted act trumpeting dreadfully in his agony the mortally wounded max endeavoured again and again to raise himself and stand upon one leg meanwhile the young scaramanga now armed with his pistols tried to throw a lariat over the animals head while calling out the elephant talk with which he usually controlled him max seems to have recognized the youth andit must have been a truly pitiful sightlowered his trunk to allow the youth to be hoisted to his usual seat behind the elephants head but at this moment the police burst into the sawdust ring and their captain approaching very close emptied his revolver into the elephants right eye at a range of a few feet upon which max fell dying to the ground upon this the young scaramanga who according to the press had a deep devotion for his charge drew one of his pistols and shot the policeman through the heart and fled off into the crowd of bystanders pursued by the other policemen who could not fire because of the throng of people he made good his escape found his way south to naples and thence as noted above stowed away to america now i see in this dreadful experience a possible reason for the transformation of scaramanga into the most vicious gunman of recent years in him was i believe born on that day a coldblooded desire to avenge himself on all humanity that the elephant had run amok and trampled many innocent people that the man truly responsible was his handler and that the police were only doing their duty would be psychopathologically either forgotten or deliberately suppressed by a youth of hotblooded stock whose subconscious had been so deeply lacerated at all events scaramangas subsequent career requires some explanation and i trust i am not being fanciful in putting forward my own prognosis from the known facts m rubbed the bowl of his pipe thoughtfully down the side of his nose well fair enough he turned back to the file i have comment to make on this mans alleged sexual potency when seen in relation to his profession it is a freudian thesis with which i am inclined to agree that the pistol whether in the hands of an amateur or of a professional gunman has significance for the owner as a symbol of virilityan extension of the male organand that excessive interests in guns is a form of fetishism the partiality of scaramanga for a particularly showy variation of weapon and his use of silver and gold bullets clearly point i think to his being a slave to this fetishand if i am right i have doubts about his alleged sexual prowess for the lack of which his gun fetish would be either a substitute or a compensation i have also noted from a profile of this man in time magazine one fact which supports my thesis that scaramanga may be sexually abnormal in listing his accomplishments time notes but does not comment upon the fact that this man cannot whistle now it may only be myth and it is certainly not medical science but there is a popular theory that a man who cannot whistle has homosexual tendencies m hadnt whistled since he was a boy unconsciously his mouth pursed and a clear note was emitted he uttered an impatient tchah and continued with his reading so i would not be surprised to learn that scaramanga is not the casanova of popular fancy passing to the wider implications of gunmanship we enter the realms of the adlerian power urge as compensation for the inferiority complex and here i will quote some wellturned phrases of a certain mr harold l peterson in his preface to his finely illustrated the book of the gun mr peterson writes in the vast array of things man has invented to better his condition few have fascinated him more than the gun its function is simple as oliver winchester said with nineteenthcentury complacency a gun is a machine for throwing balls but its everincreasing efficiency in performing this task and its awesome ability to strike home from long range have given it tremendous psychological appeal for possession of a gun and the skill to use it enormously augments the gunners personal power and extends the radius of his influence and effect a thousand times beyond his arms length and since strength resides in the gun the man who wields it may be less than strong without being disadvantaged the flashing sword the couched lance the bent longbow performed to the limit of the man who held it the guns power is inherent and needs only to be released a steady eye and an accurate aim are enough wherever the muzzle points the bullet goes bearing the gunners wish or intention swiftly to the target perhaps more than any other implement the gun has shaped the course of nations and the destiny of men in the freudian thesis his arms length would become the length of the masculine organ but we need not linger over these esoterica the support for my premise is well expressed in mr petersons sinewy prose andthough i would substitute the printing press for the gun in his concluding paragraph his points are well taken the subject scaramanga is in my opinion a paranoiac in subconscious revolt against the father figure and a sexual fetishist with possible homosexual tendencies he has other qualities which are selfevident from the earlier testimony in conclusion and having regard to the damage he has already wrought upon the personnel of the ss i conclude that his career should be terminated with the utmost dispatchif necessary by the inhuman means he himself employs in the unlikely event an agent of equal courage and dexterity can be made available beneath at the end of the docket the head of the caribbean and central american section had minuted i concur signed ca to this chief of staff had added in red ink noted cos m gazed into space for perhaps five minutes then he reached for his pen and in green ink scrawled the word action followed by the italic authoritative m then he sat very still for another five minutes and wondered if he had signed james bonds death warrant the stars foretell there are few less prepossessing places to spend a hot afternoon than kingston international airport in jamaica all the money has been spent on lengthening the runway out into the harbour to take the big jets and little was left over for the comfort of transit passengers james bond had come in an hour before on a bwia flight from trinidad and there were two hours to go before he could continue the roundabout journey to havana he had taken off his coat and tie and now sat on a hard bench gloomily surveying the contents of the inbound shop with its expensive scents liquor and piles of overdecorated native ware he had had luncheon on the plane it was the wrong time for a drink and it was too hot and too far to take a taxi into kingston even had he wanted to he wiped his already soaking handkerchief over his face and neck and cursed softly and fluently a cleaner ambled in and with the exquisite languor of such people throughout the caribbean proceeded to sweep very small bits of rubbish hither and thither occasionally dipping a boneless hand into a bucket to sprinkle water over the dusty cement floor through the slatted jalousies a small breeze reeking of the mangrove swamps briefly stirred the dead air and then was gone there were only two other passengers in the lounge cubans perhaps with jippajappa luggage a man and a woman they sat close together against the opposite wall and stared fixedly at james bond adding minutely to the oppression of the atmosphere bond got up and went over to the shop he bought a daily gleaner and returned to his place because of its inconsequence and occasionally bizarre choice of news the gleaner was a favourite paper of bonds almost the whole of that days front page was taken up with new ganja laws to prevent the consumption sale and cultivation of this local version of marijuana the fact that de gaulle had just sensationally announced his recognition of red china was boxed well down the page bond read the whole papercountry newsbits and allwith the minute care bred of desperation his horoscope said cheer up today will bring a pleasant surprise and the fulfilment of a dear wish but you must earn your good fortune by watching closely for the golden opportunity when it presents itself and then seizing it with both hands bond smiled grimly he would be unlikely to get on the scent of scaramanga on his first evening in havana it was not even certain that scaramanga was there this was a last resort for six weeks bond had been chasing his man round the caribbean and central america he had missed him by a day in trinidad and by only a matter of hours in caracas now he had rather reluctantly taken the decision of try and ferret him out on his home ground a particularly inimical home ground with which bond was barely familiar at least he had fortified himself in british guiana with a diplomatic passport and he was now courier bond with splendidly engraved instructions from her majesty to pick up the jamaican diplomatic bag in havana and return with it he had even borrowed the famous silver greyhound the british couriers emblem for three hundred years if he could do his job and then get a few hundred yards start this would at least give him sanctuary in the british embassy then it would be up to the po to bargain him out if he could find his man if he could carry out his instructions if he could get away from the scene of the shooting if if if bond turned to the advertisements on the back page at once an item caught his eye it was so typically old jamaica this is what he read for sale by auction at harbour street kingston at am on wednesday th may under powers of sale contained in a mortgage from cornelius brown et ux no love lane savannah la mar containing the substantial residence and all that parcel of land by measurement oh the northern boundary three chains and fivee perches on the southern boundary five chains and one perch on the eastern boundary two chains exactly and on the western boundary four chains and two perches be the same in each case and more or less and butting northerly on no love lane the c d alexander co ltd harbour street kingston phone james bond was delighted he had had many assignments in jamaica and many adventures on the island the splendid address and all the stuff about chains and perches and the oldfashioned abracadabra at the end of the advertisement brought back all the authentic smell of one of the oldest and most romantic of former british possessions for all her newfound independence he would bet his bottom dollar that the statue of queen victoria in the centre of kingston had not been destroyed or removed to a museum as similar relics of an historic infancy had been in the resurgent african states he looked at his watch the gleaner had consumed a whole hour for him he picked up his coat and briefcase not much longer to go in the last analysis life wasnt all that dismal one must forget the bad and remember the good what were a couple of hours of heat and boredom in this island compared with memories of beau desert and honeychile wilder and his survival against the mad dr no james bond smiled to himself as the dusty pictures clicked across his brain how long ago it all was what had happened to her she never wrote the last he had heard she had had two children by the philadelphia doctor she had married he wandered off into the grandly named concourse where the booths of many airlines stood empty and promotion folders and little company flags on their counters gathered the dust blown in with the mangrove breeze there was the customary central display stand holding messages for incoming and outgoing passengers as usual bond wondered whether there would be something for him in all his life there never had been automatically he ran his eye over the scattered envelopes held under tape beneath each parent letter nothing under b and nothing under his alias h for hazard mark of the transworld consortium successor to the old universal export that had recently been discarded as cover for the secret service nothing he ran a bored eye over the other envelopes he suddenly froze he looked around him languidly casually the cuban couple was out of sight nobody else was looking he reached out a quick hand wrapped in his handkerchief and pocketed the buff envelope that said scaramanga boac passenger from luna he stayed where he was for a few minutes and then wandered slowly off to the door marked men he locked the door and sat down the envelope was not sealed it contained a bwia message form the neat bwia writing said message received from kingston at the samples will be available at slm as from midday tomorrow there was no signature bond uttered a short bark of laughter and triumph slmsavannah la mar could it be it must be at last the three red stars of a jackpot had clicked into line what was it his gleaner horoscope had said well he would go nap on this clue from outer spaceseize it with both hands as the gleaner had instructed he read the message again and carefully put it back in the envelope his damp handkerchief had left marks on the buff envelope in this heat they would dry out in a matter of minutes he went out and sauntered over to the stand there was no one in sight he slipped the message back into its place under s and walked over to the aeronaves de mexico booth and cancelled his reservation he then went to the boac counter and looked through the timetable yes the luna flight for kingston new york and london was due in at the next day he was going to need help he remembered the name of head of station j he went over to the telephone booth and got through to the high commissioners office he asked for commander ross after a moment a girls voice came on the line commander rosss assistant can i help you there was something vaguely familiar in the lilt of the voice bond said could i speak to commander ross this is a friend from london the girls voice became suddenly alert im afraid commander ross is away from jamaica is there anything i can do there was a pause what name did you say i didnt say any name but in fact its the voice broke in excitedly dont tell me its james bond laughed well im damned its goodnight what the hell are you doing here more or less what i used to do for you i heard you were back but i thought you were ill or something how absolutely marvellous but where are you talking from kingston airport now listen darling i need help we can talk later can you get cracking of course wait till i get a pencil right first i need a car anything thatll go then i want the name of the top man at frome you know the wisco estate beyond savannah la mar largescale survey map of that area a hundred pounds in jamaican money then be an angel and ring up alexanders the auctioneers and find out anything you can about a property thats advertised in todays gleaner say youre a prospective buyer threeandahalf love lane youll see the details then i want you to come out to morgans harbour where im going in a minute be staying the night there and well have dinner and swop secrets until the dawn steals over the blue mountains can do of course but thats a hell of a lot of secrets what shall i wear something thats tight in the right places not too many buttons she laughed youve established your identity now ill get on with all this see you about seven bye gasping for air james bond pushed his way out of the little sweatbox he ran his handkerchief over his face and neck hed be damned mary goodnight his darling secretary from the old days in the doubleo section at headquarters they had said she was abroad he hadnt asked any questions perhaps she had opted for a change when he had gone missing anyway what a break now hed got an ally someone he knew good old gleaner he got his bag from the aeronaves de mexico booth and went out and hailed a taxi and said morgans harbour and sat back and let the air from the open windows begin to dry him the romantic little hotel is on the site of port royal at the tip of the palisadoes the proprietor an englishman who had once been in intelligence himself and who guessed what bonds job was was glad to see him he showed bond to a comfortable airconditioned room with a view of the pool and the wide mirror of kingston harbour he said what is it this time cubans or smuggling theyre the popular targets these days just on my way through got any lobsters of course be a good chap and save two for dinner broiled with melted butter and a pot of that ridiculously expensive foie gras of yours all right wilco celebration champagne on the ice good idea now i must get a shower and some sleep that kingston airports murder james bond awoke at six at first he didnt know where he was he lay and remembered sir james molony had said that his memory would be sluggish for a while the ect treatment at the park a discreet socalled convalescent home in a vast mansion in kent had been fierce twentyfour bashes at his brain from the black box in thirty days after it was over sir james had confessed that if he had been practising in america he wouldnt have been allowed to administer more than eighteen at first bond had been terrified at the sight of the box and of the two cathodes that would be cupped to each temple he had heard that people undergoing shock treatment had to be strapped down that their jerking twitching bodies impelled by the volts often hurtled off the operating table but that it seemed was old hat now there was the longedfor needle with the pentathol and sir james said there was no movement of the body when the current flashed through except a slight twitching of the eyelids and the results had been miraculous after the pleasant quietspoken analyst had explained to him what had been done to him in russia and after he had passed through the mental agony of knowing what he had nearly done to m the old fierce hatred of the kgb and all its works had been reborn in him and six weeks after he had entered the park all he wanted was to get back at the people who had invaded his brain for their own murderous purposes and then had come his physical rehabilitation and the inexplicable amount of gun practice he had had to do at the maidstone police range and then the day arrived when the chief of staff had come down and spent the day briefing bond on his new assignment the reason for the gun practice became clear and the scribble of green ink wishing him luck signed mboosted his spirits two days later he was ready to enjoy the excitement of the ride to london airport on his way across the world bond took another shower and dressed in shirt slacks and sandals and wandered over to the little bar on the waterfront and ordered a double walkers deluxe bourbon on the rocks and watched the pelicans diving for their dinner then he had another drink with a water chaser to break it down and wondered about threeandahalf love lane and what the samples would consist of and how he would take scaramanga this had been worrying him since he had been given his orders it was all very fine to be told to eliminate the man but james bond had never liked killing in cold blood and to provoke a draw against a man who was possibly the fastest gun in the world was suicide well he would just have to see which way the cards fell the first thing to do was to clean up his cover the diplomatic passport he would leave with goodnight he would now be mark hazard of the transworld consortium the splendidly vague title which could cover almost any kind of human activity his business would have to be with the west indian sugar company because that was the only business apart from kaiser bauxite that existed in the comparatively deserted western districts of jamaica and at negril there was also the project for developing one of the most spectacular beaches in the world beginning with the building of the thunderbird hotel he could be a rich man looking around for a building site if his hunch and the childish predictions of his horoscope were right and he came up with scaramanga at the romantic love lane address it would be a question of playing it by ear the prairie fire of the sunset raged briefly in the west and the molten sea cooled off into moonlit gunmetal a naked arm smelling of chanel number snaked round his neck and warm lips kissed the corner of his mouth as he reached up to hold the arm where it was a breathless voice said oh james im sorry i just had to its so wonderful to have you back bond put his hand under the soft chin and lifted up her mouth and kissed her full on the halfopen lips he said why didnt we ever think of doing that before goodnight three years with only that door between us what must we have been thinking of she stood away from him the golden bell of hair fell back to embrace her neck she hadnt changed still only the faintest trace of makeup but now the face was golden with sunburn from which the wideapart blue eyes now ablaze with the moon shone out with that challenging directness that had disconcerted him when they had argued over some office problem still the same glint of health over the good bones and the broad uninhibited smile from the full lips that in repose were so exciting but now the clothes were different instead of the severe shirt and skirt of the days at headquarters she was wearing a single string of pearls and a onepiece shortskirted frock in the colour of a pink gin with a lot of bitters in itthe orangeypink of the inside of a conch shell it was all tight against the bosom and the hips she smiled at his scrutiny the buttons are down the back this is standard uniform for a tropical station i can just see q branch dreaming it up i suppose one of the pearls has a death pill in it of course but i cant remember which ill just have to swallow the whole string can i have a daiquiri please instead bond gave the order sorry goodnight my manners are slipping i was dazzled its so tremendous finding you here and ive never seen you in your working clothes before now then tell me the news wheres ross how long have you been here have you managed to cope with all that junk i gave you her drink came she sipped it carefully bond remembered that she rarely drank and didnt smoke he ordered another for himself and felt vaguely guilty that this was his third double and that she wouldnt know it and when it came wouldnt recognize it as a double he lit a cigarette nowadays he was trying to keep to twenty and failing by about five he stabbed the cigarette out he was getting near to his target and the rigid training rules that had been drilled into him at the park must from now on be observed meticulously the champagne wouldnt count he was amused by the conscience this girl had awakened in him he was also surprised and impressed mary goodnight knew that the last question was the one he would want answered first she reached into a plain straw handbag on a gold metal chain and handed him a thick envelope she said mostly in used singles a few fivers shall i debit you direct or put it in as expenses direct please the top man at frome is tony hugill nice man nice wife nice children weve had a lot to do with him so hell be friendly he was in naval intelligence during the war sort of commando job so he knows the score does a good jobfrome produces about a quarter of jamaicas sugar outputbut hurricane flora and the tremendous rains weve been having here have delayed the crop besides that hes having a lot of trouble with cane burning and other small sabotagemostly with thermite bombs brought in from cuba jamaicas sugar is competition for castro you see and with flora and all the rains the cuban crop is going to be only about three million tons this year compared with a batista level of about sevenand very late because the rains have played havoc with the sucrose content she smiled her wide smile no secrets just reading the gleaner i dont understand it all but apparently because theres a tremendous chess game going on all over the world in sugarin what they call sugar futures thats sort of buying the stuff forward for delivery dates later in the year washingtons trying to keep the price down to upset cubas economy and castros out to keep the world price up so that he can bargain with russia so its worth castros trouble to do as much damage as possible to rival sugar crops hes only got his sugar to sell and he wants food badly this wheat the americans are selling to russia a lot of that will find its way back to cuba in exchange for sugar to feed the cuban sugar croppers she smiled again pretty daft business isnt it i dont think castro can hold out much longer the missile business in cuba must have cost russia about a billion pounds and now theyre having to pour money into cuba money and goods to keep the place on its feet i cant help thinking theyll pull out soon and leave castro to go the way batista went its a fiercely catholic country and hurricane flora was considered as the final judgment from heaven it sat over the island and simply whipped it day after day for five days no hurricane in history has ever behaved like that the churchgoers dont miss an omen like that it was a straight indictment of the regime bond said with admiration goodnight youre a treasure youve certainly been doing your homework the direct blue eyes looked straight into his dodging the compliment this is the stuff i live with here its built into the station but i thought you might like some background to frome and what ive said explains why wisco are getting these cane fires at least we think it is she took a sip of her drink well thats all about sugar the cars outside you remember strangways well its his old sunbeam alpine the station bought it and now i use it its a bit aged but its still pretty fast and it wont let you down its rather bashed about so it wont be conspicuous the tanks full and ive put the survey map in the glove compartment thats fine now last question and then well go and have dinner and tell each other our life stories but by the way whats happened to your chief ross mary goodnight looked worried to tell you the truth i dont exactly know he went off last week on some job to trinidad it was to try and locate a man called scaramanga hes a local gunman of some sort i dont know much about him apparently headquarters wants him traced for some reason she smiled ruefully nobody ever tells me anything thats interesting i just do the donkey work well commander ross was due back two days ago and he hasnt turned up ive had to send off a red warning but ive been told to give him another week well im glad hes out of the way id rather have his number two last question what about this threeandonehalf love lane did you get anywhere mary goodnight blushed did i not that was a fine question to get me mixed up with alexanders was noncommittal and i finally had to go to the special branch i shant be able to show my face there for weeks heaven knows what they must think of you that place is a is a ershe wrinkled her noseits a famous disorderly house in sav la mar bond laughed out loud at her discomfiture he teased her with malicious but gentle sadism you mean its a whorehouse james for heavens sake must you be so crude no love lane the south coast of jamaica is not as beautiful as the north and it is a long hundredandtwentymile hack over very mixed road surfaces from kingston to savannah la mar mary goodnight had insisted on coming along to navigate and help with the punctures bond had not demurred spanish town may pen alligator pond black river whitehouse inn where they had luncheonthe miles unrolled under the fierce sun until late the afternoon a stretch of good straight road brought them among the spruce little villas each with its patch of brownish lawn its bougainvillaea and its single bed of canna lilies and crotons which make up the smart suburbs of the modes little coastal township that is in the vernacular sav la mar except for the old quarter on the waterfront it is not a typically jamaican town or a very attractive one the villas built for the senior staff of the frome sugar estates are drably respectable and the small straight streets smack of a most unjamaican bout of town planning around the s bond stopped at the first garage took in petrol and put mary goodnight into a hired car for the return trip he had told her nothing of his assignment and she had asked no questions when bond told her vaguely that it was something to do with cuba bond said he would keep in touch when he could and get back to her when his job was done and then businesslike she was off back down the dusty road and bond drove slowly down to the waterfront he identified love lane a narrow street of brokendown shops and houses that meandered back into the town from the jetty he circled the area to get the neighbouring geography clear in his mind and parked the car in a deserted area near the spit of sand on which fishing canoes were drawn up on raised stilts he locked the car and sauntered back and into love lane there were a few people about poor people of the fisherman class bond bought a packet of royal blend at a small general store that smelled of spices he asked where number threeandahalf was and got a look of polite curiosity further up de street mebbe a chain big house on de right bond moved over to the shady side and strolled on he slit open the packet with his thumbnail and lit a cigarette to help the picture of an idle tourist examining a corner of old jamaica there was only one big house on the right he took some time lighting the cigarette while he examined it it must once have had importance perhaps as the private house of a merchant it was of two storeys with balconies running all the way round and it was wooden built with silvering shingles but the gingerbread tracery beneath the eaves was broken in many places and there was hardly a scrap of paint left on the jalousies that closed off all the upstairs windows and most of those below the patch of yard bordering the street was inhabited by a clutch of vulturinenecked chickens that pecked at nothing and three skeletal jamaican blackandtan mongrels they gazed lazily across the street at bond and scratched and bit at invisible flies but in the background there was one very beautiful lignum vitae tree in full blue blossom bond guessed that it was as old as the houseperhaps fifty years it certainly owned the property by right of strength and adornment in its delicious black shade a girl in a rocking chair sat reading a magazine at the range of about thirty yards she looked tidy and pretty bond strolled up the opposite side of the street until a corner of the house hid the girl then he stopped and examined the house more closely wooden steps ran up to an open front door over whose lintel whereas few of the other buildings in the street bore numbers a big enamelled metal sign announced in white on dark blue of the two broad windows that bracketed the door the lefthand one was shuttered but the righthand one was a single broad sheet of rather dusty glass through which tables and chairs and a serving counter could be seen over the door a swinging sign said dreamland cafe in sunbleached letters and round this window were advertisements for red stripe beer royal blend four aces cigarettes and cocacola a handpainted sign said snax and underneath hot cock soup fresh daily bond walked across the street and up the steps and parted the bead curtain that hung over the entrance he walked over to the counter and was inspecting its contents a plate of drylooking ginger cakes a pile of packeted banana crisps and some jarswhen he heard quick steps outside the girl from the garden came in the beads clashed softly behind her she was an octoroon pretty as in bonds imagination the word octoroon suggested she had bold brown eyes slightly uptilted at the corners beneath a fringe of silken black hair she was dressed in a short frock of shocking pink which went well with the coffee and cream of her skin her wrists and ankles were tiny she smiled politely the eyes flirted evenin good evening could i have a red stripe sure she went behind the counter she gave him a quick glimpse of fine bosoms as she bent to the door of the iceboxa glimpse not dictated by the geography of the place she nudged the door shut with a knee deftly uncapped the bottle and put it on the counter beside an almost clean glass thatll be one and six bond paid she rang the money into the cash register bond drew up a stool to the counter and sat down she rested her arms on the wooden top and looked across at him passing through more or less i saw this place was for sale in yesterdays gleaner i thought id take a look at it nice big house does it belong to you she laughed it was a pity because she was a pretty girl but the teeth had been sharpened by munching raw sugar cane what a hope im sort of well sort of manager theres the cafeshe pronounced it caifand mebbe you heard we got other attractions bond looked puzzled what sort girls six bedrooms upstairs very clean it only cost a pound theres sarah up there now care to meet up with her not today thanks its too hot but do you only have one at a time theres lindy but shes engaged shes a big girl if you like them big shell be free in half an hour she glanced at a kitchen clock on the wall behind her

name my names mark she flirted you a saint too no ones ever accused me of it ive been up at frome doing a job i like this part of the island and it crossed my mind to find some place to rent but i want to be closer to the sea than this ill have to look around a bit more do you rent rooms by the night she reflected sure why not but you may find it a bit noisy theres sometime a customer whos taken some drinks too many and theres not too much plumbing she leaned closer and lowered her voice but i wouldnt have advised you to rent the place the shingles are in bad shape cost you mebbe five hunnerd mebbe a thousand to get the roof done its nice of you to tell me that but whys the place being sold trouble with the police not so much we operate a respectable place but in the gleaner after mr brown thats my boss you read that et ux yes well seems that means and his wife and mistress brown mistress agatha brown she was church of england but she just done gone to the catholics and it seems they dont hold with places like three and onehalf not even when theyre decently run and their church here just up the street seems that needs a new roof like here so mistress brown figures to kill two birds with the same stone and she goes on at mr brown to close the place down and sell it and with her portion she goin fix the roof for the catholics thats a shame it seems a nice quiet place whats going to happen to you guess ill move to kingston live with one of my sisters and mebbe work in one of the big storesissas mebbe or nathans sav la mar is sort of quiet the brown eyes became introspective but ill sure miss the place folks have fun here and love lanes a pretty street were all friends up and down the lane its got sort of sort of atmosphere right thats what its got like sort of old jamaica like it must have been in the old days everyones friends with each other help each other when they have trouble youd be surprised how often the girls do it for free if the mans a good feller regular customer sort of and hes short the brown eyes gazed inquiringly at bond to see if he understood the strength of the evidence thats nice of them but it cant be good for business she laughed this aint no business mister mark not while im running it this is a public service like water and electricity and health and education and she broke off and glanced over her shoulder at the clock which said hell you got me talking so much ive forgot joe and may its their supper she went to the cafe window and wound it down at once from the direction of the lignum vitae tree two large black birds slightly smaller than ravens whirled in circled the interior of the cafe amidst a metallic clangour of song unlike the song of any other bird in the world and untidily landed on the counter within reach of bonds hand they strutted up and down imperiously eyeing bond without fear from bold golden eyes and went through a piercing repertoire of tinny whistles and trills some of which required them to ruffle themselves up to almost twice their normal size tiffy went back behind the bar took two pennies out of her purse rang them up on the register and took two ginger cakes out of the flyblown display case she broke off bits and fed the two birds always the smaller of the two the female first and they greedily seized the pieces from her fingers and holding the scraps of the wooden counter with a claw tore them into smaller fragments and devoured them when it was all over and tiffy had chided them both for pecking her fingers they made small neat white messes on the counter and looked pleased with themselves tiffy took a cloth and cleaned up the messes she said we call them klingklings but learned folk call them jamaican grackles theyre very friendly folk the doctorbird the humming bird with the streamer tail is the jamaican national bird but i like these best theyre not so beautiful but theyre the friendliest birds and theyre funny besides they seem to know it theyre like naughty black thieves the klingklings eyed the cake stand and complained stridently that their supper was over james bond produced twopence and handed it over theyre wonderful like mechanical toys give them a second course from me tiffy rang up the money and took out two more cakes now listen joe and may this nice gemmuns been nice to tiffy and hes now being nice to you so dont you peck my fingers and make messes or mebbe he wont visit us again she was halfway through feeding the birds when she cocked an ear there was the noise of creaking boards somewhere overhead and then the sound of quiet footsteps treading stairs all of a sudden tiffys animated face became quiet and tense she whispered to bond thats lindys man important man hes a good customer here but he dont like me because i wont go with him so he can talk rough sometimes and he dont like joe and may because he reckons they make two much noise she shooed the birds in the direction of the open window but they saw there was half their cake to come and they just fluttered into the air and then down to the counter again tiffy appealed to bond be a good friend and just sit quiet whatever he says he likes to get people mad and then she stopped will you have another red stripe mister bead curtains swished in the shadowy back of the room bond had been sitting with his chin propped on his right hand he now dropped the hand to the counter and sat back the walther ppk inside the waistband of his trousers to the left of his flat stomach signalled its presence to his skin the fingers of his right hand curled slightly ready to receive its butt he moved his left foot off the rail of the stool onto the floor he said thatd be fine he unbuttoned his coat with his left hand and then with the same hand took out his handkerchief and wiped his face with it it always gets extra hot around six before the undertakers wind has started to blow mister the undertakers right here you care to feel his wind james bond turned his head slowly dusk had crept into the big room and all he could see was a pale tall outline the man was carrying a suitcase he put it down on the floor and came forward he must have been wearing rubbersoled shoes for his feet made no sound tiffy moved nervously behind the counter and a switch clicked half a dozen lowvoltage bulbs came to life in rusty brackets around the walls bond said easily you made me jump scaramanga came up and leant against the counter the description in records was exact but it had not caught the catlike menace of the big man the extreme breadth of the shoulders and the narrow waist or the cold immobility of the eyes that now examined bond with an expression of aloof disinterest he was wearing a wellcut singlebreasted tan suit and corespondent shoes in brown and white instead of a tie he wore a high stock in white silk secured by a gold pin the shape of a miniature pistol there should have been something theatrical about the getup but perhaps because of the mans fine figure there wasnt he said i sometimes make em dance then i shoot their feet off there was no trace of a foreign accent underneath the american bond said that sounds rather drastic what do you do it for the last time it was five thousand dollars seems like you dont know who i am didnt the cool cat tell you bond glanced at tiffy she was standing very still her hands by her sides the knuckles were white bond said why should she why would i want to know there was a quick flash of gold the small black hole looked directly at bonds navel because of this what are you doing here stranger kind of a coincidence finding a city slicker at three and onehalf or at sav la mar for the matter of that not by any chance from the police or any of then friends kamerad bond raised his hands in mock surrender he lowered them and turned to tiffy who is this man a oneman takeover bid for jamaica or a refugee from a circus ask him what hed like to drink whoever he is it was a good act james bond knew that he had very nearly pulled the trigger of the gun hit a gunman in his vanity he had a quick vision of himself writhing on the floor his right hand without the power to reach for his own weapon tiffys pretty face was no longer pretty it was a taut skull she stared at james bond her mouth opened but no sound came from the gaping lips she liked him and she knew he was dead the klingklings joe and may smelled the same electricity with a tremendous din of metallic squawks they fled for the open window like black thieves escaping into the night the explosions from the colt were deafening the two birds disintegrated against the violet backdrop of the dusk the scraps of feathers and pink flesh blasting out of the yellow light of the cafe into the limbo of the deserted street like shrapnel there was a moment of deafening silence james bond didnt move he sat where he was waiting for the tension of the deed to relax it didnt with an inarticulate scream that was half a filthy word tiffy took james bonds bottle of red stripe off the counter and clumsily flung it there came a distant crash of glass from the back of the room then having made her puny gesture tiffy fell to her knees behind the counter and went into sobbing hysterics james bond drank down the rest of his beer and got slowly to his feet he walked towards scaramanga and was about to pass him when the man reached out a languid left arm and caught him at the biceps he held the snout of his gun to his nose sniffing delicately the expression in the dead brown eyes was faraway he said mister theres something quite extra about the smell of death care to try it he held out the glittering gun as if he was offering james bond a rose bond stood quite still he said mind your manners take your hand off me scaramanga raised his eyebrows the flat leaden gaze seemed to take in bond for the first time he released his grip james bond went on round the edge of the counter when he came opposite the other man he found the eyes were now looking at him with faint scornful curiosity bond stopped the sobbing of the girl was the crying of a small dog somewhere down the street a sound systema loudspeaker record playerbegan braying calypso bond looked the man in the eye he said thanks ive tried it i recommend the berlin vintage nineteen fortyfive he smiled a friendly only slightly ironical smile but i expect you were too young to be at that tasting the easy grand bond knelt down beside tiffy and gave her a couple of sharp slaps on the right cheek then on the left the wet eyes came back into focus she put her hand up to her face and looked at bond with surprise bond got to his feet he took a cloth and wetted it at the tap then leant down and put his arm round her and wiped the cloth gently over her face then he lifted her up and handed her her bag that was on a shelf behind the counter he said come on tiffy make up that pretty face again businessll be warming up soon the leading ladys got to look her best tiffy took the bag and opened it she looked past bond and saw scaramanga for the first time since the shooting the pretty lips drew back in a snarl she whispered fiercely so that only bond could hear im goin fix that man but good theres mother edna up orange hill way shes an obeah top woman ill go up there tomorrow come a few days he wont know what hit him she took out a mirror and began doing up her face bond reached into his hip pocket and counted out five onepound notes he stuffed them into her open bag you forget all about it thisll buy you a nice canary in a cage to keep you company anyway another pair of klingsll come along if you put some food out he patted her shoulder and moved away when he came up with scaramanga he stopped and said that may have been a good circus acthe used the word again on purpose but it was rough on the girl give her some money scaramanga said shove it out of the corner of his mouth he said suspiciously and whats all this yack about circuses he turned to face bond just stop where you are mister and answer a few questions like i said are you from the police youve sure got the smell of cops around you if not what are you doing hereabouts bond said people dont tell me what to do i tell them he walked on into the middle of the room and sat down at a table he said come and sit down and stop trying to lean on me im unleanableon scaramanga shrugged he took two long strides picked up one of the metal chairs twirled it round and thrust it between his legs and sat assbackwards his left arm lying along the back of the chair his right arm rested on his thigh inches from the pistol butt that showed above the waistband of his trousers bond recognized that it was a good working position for a gunman the metal back of the chair acting as a shield for most of the body this was certainly a most careful and professional man bond both hands in full view of the tabletop said cheerfully no im not from the police my names mark hazard im from a company called transworld consortium ive been doing a job up at frome the wisco sugar place know it sure i know it what you been doing there not so fast my friend first of all who are you and whats your business scaramanga francisco scaramanga labour relations ever heard of me bond frowned cant say i have should i have some people who hadnt are dead a lot of people who havent heard of me are dead bond leaned back he crossed one leg over the other above the knee and grasped the ankle in a clubman pose i do wish youd stop talking in heroics for instance seven hundred million chinese have certainly heard of neither of us you must be a frog in a very small pool scaramanga did not rise to the jibe he said reflectively yeah i guess you could call the caribbean a pretty small pool but theres good pickins to be had from it the man with the golden gun thats what they call me in these parts its a handy tool for solving labour problems we could do with you up at frome been having trouble up there scaramanga looked bored too many cane fires was that your business sort of one of the jobs of my company is insurance investigation security work ive come across guys like you before thought i could smell the copsmell scaramanga looked satisfied that his guess had been right did you get anywhere picked up a few rastafari id have liked to get rid of the lot of them but they went crying to their union that they were being discriminated against because of their religion so we had to call a halt so the firesll begin again soon thats why i say we could do with a good enforcer up there bond added blandly i take it thats another name for your profession again scaramanga dodged the sneer he said you carry a gun of course you dont go after the rastas without one what kind of a gun walther ppk seven sixtyfive millimetre yes thats a stopper all right scaramanga turned towards the counter hey cool cat couple of red stripes if youre in business again he turned back and the blank eyes looked hard at bond whats your next job dont know ill have to contact london and find out if theyve got any other problems in the area but im in no hurry i work for them more or less on a freelance basis why any suggestions the other man sat quiet while tiffy came out from behind the counter she came over to the table and placed the tin tray with the bottles and glasses in front of bond she didnt look at scaramanga scaramanga uttered a harsh bark of laughter he reached inside his coat and took out all alligatorskin billfold he extracted a hundreddollar bill and threw it on the table no hard feelings cool cat youd be okay if you didnt always keep your legs together go buy yourself some more birds with that i like to have smiling people around me tiffy picked up the bill she said thanks mister youd be surprised what im going to spend your money on she gave him a long hard look and turned on her heel scaramanga shrugged he reached for a bottle of beer and a glass and both men poured and drank scaramanga took out an expensive cigar case selected a pencilthin cheroot and lit it with a match he let the smoke dribble out between his lips and inhaled the thin stream up his nostrils he did this several times with the same mouthful of smoke until the smoke was dissipated all the while he stared across the table at bond seeming to weigh up something in his mind he said care to earn yourself a grand a thousand bucks bond said possibly he paused and added probably what he meant was of course if it means staying close to you my friend scaramanga smoked awhile in silence a car stopped outside and two laughing men came quickly up the steps when they came through the bead curtains workingclass jamaicans they stopped laughing and went quietly over to the counter and began whispering to tiffy then they both slapped a pound note on the counter and making a wide detour away from the white men disappeared through the curtains at the back of the room their laughter began again as bond heard their footsteps on the stairs scaramanga hadnt taken his eyes from bonds face now he said keeping his voice low i got myself a problem some partners of mine theyve taken an interest in this negril development far end of the property place called bloody bay know it ive seen it on the map just short of green island harbour right so ive got some shares in the business so we start building the thunderbird hotel and get the first storey finished and the main living rooms and restaurant and so on so then the tourist boom slackens offamericans get frightened of being so close to cuba or some such crap and the banks get difficult and money begins to run short follow me so youre a stale bull of the place right so im opening the hotel for a few days because i got a halfdozen of the main stockholders to fly in for a meeting on the spot sort of look the place over and get our heads together and figure what to do next now i want to give these guys a good time so im getting a smart combo over from kingston calypso singers limbo dancers plenty of girlsall the jazz and theres swimming and one of the features of the place is a smallscale railway that used to handle the sugar cane runs to green island harbour where ive got a fortyfoot chriscraft roamer deepsea fishing thatll be another outing get me give the guys a real good tune so that theyll get all enthusiastic and buy out your share of the stock scaramanga frowned angrily im not paying you a grand to get the wrong ideas or any ideas for that matter what for then for a moment or two scaramanga went through his smoking routine the little pillars of smoke vanishing again and again into the black nostrils it seemed to calm him his forehead cleared he said some of these men are kind of rough were all stockholders of course but that dont necessarily mean were friends understand ill be wanting to hold some meetings private meetings with maybe only two or three guys at a time sort of sounding out the different interests could be that some of the other guys the ones not invited to a particular meeting might get it into their heads to bug a meeting or try and get wise to what goes on in one way or another so it just occurs to me that you being live to security and such that you could act as a kind of guard at these meetings clean the room for mikes stay outside the door and see that no one comes nosing around see that when i want to be private i git private dyou get the picture bond had to laugh he said so you want to hire me as a kind of personal bodyguard is that it the frown was back and whats so funny about that mister its good money aint it three maybe four days in a luxury joint like the thunderbird a thousand bucks at the end of it whats so screwy about that proposition eh scaramanga mashed out the butt of his cigar against the underside of the table a shower of sparks fell he let them lie bond scratched the back of his head as if reflecting which he wasfuriously he knew that he hadnt heard the full story he also knew that it was odd to say the least of it for this man to hire a complete stranger to do this job for him the job itself stood up but only just it made sense that scaramanga would not want to hire a local man an expoliceman for instance even if one could be found such a man might have friends in the hotel business who would be interested in the speculative side of the negril development and of course on the plus side bond would be achieving what he had never thought possible he would have got right inside scaramangas guard or would he there was the strong smell of a trap but assuming that bond had not by some obscure bit of ill luck been blown he couldnt for the life of him see what the trap could be well clearly he must make the gamble in so many respects it was a chance in a million bond lit a cigarette he said i was only laughing at the idea of a man of your particular skills wanting protection but it all sounds great fun of course ill come along when do we start ive got a car at the bottom of the road scaramanga thrust out an inside wrist and looked at a thin gold watch on a twocoloured gold bracelet he said six thirtytwo my carll be outside he got up lets go but dont forget one thing mister whoosis i rile mighty easy get me bond said easily i saw how annoyed you got with those inoffensive birds he stood up i dont see any reason why either of us should get riled scaramanga said indifferently okay then he walked to the back of the room and picked up his suitcase newlooking but cheap strode to the exit and clashed through the bead curtains and down the steps bond went quickly over to the counter goodbye tiffy hope ill be coming by again one day if anyone should ask after me say im at the thunderbird hotel at bloody bay tiffy reached out a hand and timidly touched his sleeve go careful over there mister mark theres gangster money in that place and watch out for yourself she jerked her head towards the exit thats the worstest man i ever heard tell of then she leaned forward and whispered thats a thousand pounds worth of ganja hes got in the bag a rasta left it for him this morning so i smelled the bag she drew quickly back bond said thanks tiffy see mother edna puts a good hex on him ill tell you why someday i hope bye he went quickly out and down into the street where a red thunderbird convertible was waiting its exhaust making a noise like an expensive motorboat the chauffeur was a jamaican smartly dressed with a peaked cap a red pennant on the wireless aerial said thunderbird hotel in gold scaramanga was sitting beside the chauffeur he said impatiently get in the back and well give you a lift down to your car then follow along it gets a good road after a while james bond got into the car behind scaramanga and wondered whether to shoot the man now in the back of the headthe old gestapokgb point of puncture a mixture of reasons prevented himthe itch of curiosity an inbuilt dislike of cold murder the feeling that this was not the predestined moment the likelihood that he would have to murder the chauffeur alsothese combined with the softness of the night and the fact that the sound system was now playing a good recording of one of his favourites after youve gone and that cicadas were singing from the lignum vitae tree said no but at that moment as the car coasted down love lane towards the bright mercury of the sea james bond knew that he was not only disobeying orders or at best dodging them but also being a bloody fool unreal estate when he arrives at a place on a dark night particularly in an alien land which he has never seen beforea strange house perhaps or an hoteleven the most alert man is assailed by the confused sensations of the meanest tourist james bond more or less knew the map of jamaica he knew that the sea had always been close to him on his left and as he followed the twin red glares of the leading car through an impressive entrance gate of wrought iron and up an avenue of young royal palms he heard the waves scrolling into a beach very close to his car the fields of sugar cane would he guessed from the approach come close up against the new high wall that surrounded the thunderbird property and there was a slight smell of mangrove swamp coming down from below the high hills whose silhouette he had occasionally glimpsed under a scudding threequarter moon on his right but otherwise he had no clue to exactly where he was or what sort of a place he was now approaching and particularly for him the sensation was an uncomfortable one the first law for a secret agent is to get his geography right his means of access and exit and assure his communications with the outside world james bond was uncomfortably aware that for the past hour he had been driving into limbo and that his nearest contact was a girl in a brothel thirty miles away the situation was not reassuring half a mile ahead someone must have seen the approaching lights of the leading car and pressed switches for there was a sudden blaze of brilliant yellow illumination through the trees and a final sweep of the drive revealed the hotel with the theatrical lighting and the surrounding blackness to conceal any evidence of halted construction work the place made a brave show a vast palepinkandwhite pillared portico gave the hotel an aristocratic frontage and when bond drew up behind the other car at the entrance he could see through the tall regency windows a vista of blackandwhite marble flooring beneath blazing chandeliers a bell captain and his jamaican staff in red jackets and black trousers hurried down the steps and after showing great deference to scaramanga took his suitcase and bonds then the small cavalcade moved into the entrance hall where bond wrote mark hazard and the kensington address of transworld consortium in the register scaramanga had been talking to a man who appeared to be the manager a young american with a neat face and a neat suit he turned to bond youre in number twentyfour in the west wing im close by in number twenty order what you want from room service see you about ten in the morning the guysll be coming in from kingston around midday okay the cold eyes in the gaunt face didnt mind whether it was or not bond said it was he followed one of the bellboys with his suitcase across the slippery marble floor and was led into a long white corridor with a closefitted carpet in royalblue wilton there was a smell of new paint and jamaican cedar the numbered doors and the light fittings were in good taste bonds room was almost at the end on the left number was opposite the bellhop unlocked number and held the door for bond airconditioned air gushed out it was a pleasant modern double bedroom and bath in grey and white when he was alone bond went to the airconditioning control and turned it to zero then he drew back the curtains and wound down the two broad windows to let in real air outside the sea whispered softly on an invisible beach and the moonlight splashed the black shadows of palms across trim lawns to his left where the yellow light of the entrance showed a corner of the gravel sweep bond heard his car being started up and driven away presumably to a parking lot which would he guessed be at the rear so as not to spoil the impact of the facade he turned back into his room and inspected it minutely the only objects of suspicion were a large picture on the wall above the two beds and the telephone the picture was a jamaican market scene painted locally bond lifted it off its nail but the wall behind was innocent he then took out a pocketknife laid the telephone carefully so as not to shift the receiver upside down on a bed and very quietly and carefully unscrewed the bottom plate he smiled his satisfaction behind the plate was a small microphone joined by leads to the main cable inside the cradle he screwed back the plate with the same care and put the telephone quietly back on the night table he knew the gadget it would be transistorized and of sufficient power to pick up a conversation in normal tones anywhere in the room it crossed his mind to say very devout prayers out loud before he went to bed that would be a fitting prologue for the central recording device james bond unpacked his few belongings and called room service a jamaican voice answered bond ordered a bottle of walkers deluxe bourbon three glasses ice and for nine oclock eggs benedict the voice said sure sir bond then took off his clothes put his gun and holster under a pillow rang for the valet and had his suit taken away to be pressed by the time he had taken a hot shower followed by an icecold one and pulled on a fresh pair of sea island cotton underpants the bourbon had arrived the best drink in the day is just before the first one james bond put ice in the glass and three fingers of the bourbon and swilled it round the glass to cool it and break it down with the ice he pulled a chair up to the window put a low table beside it took profiles in courage by jack kennedy out of his suitcase happened to open it at edmund g ross then went and sat down letting the scented air a compound of sea and trees breathe over his body naked save for the underpants he drank the bourbon down in two long draughts and felt its friendly bite at the back of his throat and in his stomach he filled up his glass again this time with more ice to make it a weaker drink and sat back and thought about scaramanga what was the man doing now talking long distance with havana or the states organizing things for tomorrow it would be interesting to see these fat frightened stockholders if bond knew anything they would be a choice bunch of hoods the type that had owned the havana hotels and casinos in the old batista days the men that held the stock in las vegas that looked after the action in miami and whose money was scaramanga representing there was so much hot money drifting around the caribbean that it might be any of the syndicates any of the banana dictators from the islands or the mainland and the man himself it had been damned fine shooting that had killed the two birds swerving through the window of how in hell was bond going to take him on an impulse bond went over to his bed and took the walther from under the pillow he slipped out the magazine and pumped the single round onto the counterpane he tested the spring of the magazine and of the breech and drew a quick bead on various objects round the room he found he was aiming an inch or so high but that would be because the gun was lighter without its loaded magazine he snapped the magazine back and tried again yes that was better he pumped a round into the breech put up the safety and replaced the gun under the pillow then he went back to his drink and picked up the book and forgot his worries in the high endeavours of great men the eggs came and were good the mousseline sauce might have been mixed at maxims bond had the tray removed poured himself a last drink and prepared for bed scaramanga would certainly have a master key tomorrow bond would whittle himself a wedge to jam the door for tonight he upended his suitcase just inside the door and balanced the three glasses on top of it it was a simple booby trap but it would give him all the warning he needed then he took off his shorts and got into bed and slept a nightmare woke him sweating around two in the morning he had been defending a fort there were other defenders with him but they seemed to be wandering around aimlessly ineffectively and when bond shouted to rally them they seemed not to hear him out of the plain scaramanga sat assbackwards on the cafe chair beside a huge golden cannon every now and then he put his long cigar to the touchhole and there came a tremendous flash of soundless flame a black cannonball as big as a football lobbed up high in the air and crashed down into the fort with a shattering noise of breaking timber bond was armed with nothing but a longbow but even this he could not fire because every time he tried to fit the notch of the arrow into the gut the arrow slipped out of his fingers to the ground he cursed his clumsiness any moment now and a huge cannonball would land on the small open space where he was standing out on the plain scaramanga reached his cigar to the touchole the black ball soared up it was coming straight for bond it landed just in front of him and came rolling very slowly towards him getting bigger and bigger smoke and sparks coming from its shortening fuse bond threw up an arm to protect himself painfully the arm crashed into the side of the night table and bond woke up bond got out of bed gave himself a cold shower and drank a glass of water by the time he was back in bed he had forgotten the nightmare and he went quickly to sleep and slept dreamlessly until in the morning he put on swimming trunks removed the barricade from in front of the door and went out into the passage to his left a door into the garden was open and sun streamed in he went out and was walking over the dewy grass towards the beach when he heard a curious thumping noise from among the palms to his right he walked over it was scaramanga in trunks attended by a goodlooking young negro holding a flamecoloured terrycloth robe doing exercises on a trampoline scaramangas body gleamed with sweat in the sunshine as he hurled himself high in the air from the stretched canvas and bounded back sometimes from his knees or his buttocks and sometimes even from his head it was an impressive exercise in gymnastics the prominent third nipple over the heart made an obvious target bond walked thoughtfully down to the beautiful crescent of white sand fringed with gently clashing palm trees he dived in and because of the other mans example swam twice as far as he had intended james bond had a quick and small breakfast in his room dressed reluctantly because of the heat in his dark blue suit armed himself and went for a walk round the property he quickly got the picture the night and the lighted facade had covered up a halfproject the east wing on the other side of the lobby was still lath and plaster the body of the hotelthe restaurant nightclub and living rooms that were the tail of the tshaped structure were mockups stages for a dress rehearsal hastily assembled with the essential props carpets light fixtures and a scattering of furniture but stinking of fresh paint and wood shavings perhaps fifty men and women were at work tacking up curtains vacuuming carpets fixing the electricity but no one was employed on the essentialsthe big cement mixers the drills the ironwork that lay about behind the hotel like the abandoned toys of a giant at a guess the place would need another year and another few million pounds to become what the plans had said it was to be bond saw scaramangas problem someone was going to complain about this others would want to get out but then again others would want to buy in but cheaply and use it as a tax loss to set against more profitable enterprises elsewhere better to have a capital asset with the big tax concessions that jamaica gave than pay the money to uncle sam uncle fidel uncle leoni of venezuela so scaramangas job would be to blind his guests with pleasure send them back half drunk to their syndicates would it work bond knew such people and he doubted it they might go to bed drunk with a pretty coloured girl but they would awake sober or else they wouldnt have their jobs they wouldnt be coming here with their discreet briefcases he walked farther back on the property he wanted to locate his car he found it on a deserted lot behind the west wing the sun would get at it where it was so he drove it forward and into the shade of a giant ficus tree he checked the petrol and pocketed the ignition key there were not too many small precautions he could take on the parking lot the smell of the swamps was very strong while it was still comparatively cool he decided to walk farther he soon came to the end of the young shrubs and guinea grass the landscaper had laid on behind these was desolationa great area of sluggish streams and swampland from which the hotel land had been recovered egrets shrikes and louisiana herons rose and settled lazily and there were strange insect noises and the call of frogs and gekkos on what would probably be the border of the property a biggish stream meandered towards the sea its muddy banks pitted with the holes of land crabs and water rats as bond approacned there was a heavy splash and a mansized alligator left the bank and showed its snout before submerging bond smiled to himself no doubt if the hotel got off the ground all this area would be turned into an asset there would be native boatmen suitably attired as arawak indians a landing stage and comfortable boats with fringed shades from which the guests could view the tropical jungle for an extra ten dollars on the bill bond glanced at his watch he strolled back to the left not yet screened by the young oleanders and crotons that had been planted for this eventual purpose were the kitchens and laundry and staff quarters the usual back quarters of a luxury hotel and music the heartbeat thump of jamaican calypso came from their directionpresumably the kingston combo rehearsing bond walked round and under the portico into the main lobby scaramanga was at the desk talking to the manager when he heard bonds footsteps on the marble he turned and looked and gave bond a curt nod he was dressed as on the previous day and the high white cravat suited the elegance of the hall he said okay then to the manager and to bond lets go take a look at the conference room bond followed him through the restaurant door and then through another door to the right that opened into a lobby one of whose walls was taken up with the glasses and plates of a buffet beyond this was another door scaramanga led the way through into what would one day perhaps be a card room or writing room now there was nothing but a round table in the centre of a winered carpet and seven white leatherette armchairs with scratchpads and pencils in front of them the chair facing the door presumably scaramangas had a white telephone in front of it bond went round the room and examined the windows and the curtains and glanced at the wall brackets of the lighting he said the brackets could be bugged and of course theres the telephone like me to go over it scaramanga looked at bond stonily he said no need to its bugged all right by me got to have a record of whats said bond said all right then where do you want me to be outside the door sitting reading a magazine or something therell be the general meeting this afternoon around four tomorrow therell maybe be one or two smaller meetings maybe just me and one of the guys i dont want any of these meetings to be disturbed got it seems simple enough now isnt it about time you told me the names of these men and more or less who they represent and which ones if any youre expecting trouble from scaramanga said take a chair and a paper and pencil he strolled up and down the room first theres mr hendriks dutchman represents the european money mostly swiss you neednt bother with him hes not the arguing type then theres sam binion from detroit the purple gang scaramanga stopped in his stride and looked hard at bond these are all respectable guys mister whoosis hazard is the name all right hazard then but respectable you understand dont go getting the notion that this is another appalachia these are all solid businessmen get me this sam binion for instance hes in real estate he and his friends are worth maybe twenty million bucks see what i mean then theres leroy gengerella miami owns gengerella enterprises big shots in the entertainment world he may cut up rough guys in that line of business like quick profits and a quick turnover and ruby rotkopf the hotel man from vegas hell ask the difficult questions because hell already know most of the answers from experience hal garfinkel from chicago hes in labour relations like me represents a lot of teamster union funds he shouldnt be any trouble those unions have got so much money they dont know where to put it that makes five last comes louis paradise from phoenix arizona owns paradise slots the biggest people in the onearmed bandit business got casino interests too i cant figure which way hell bet thats the lot and who do you represent mr scaramanga caribbean money cuban i said caribbean cubas in the caribbean isnt it castro or batista the frown was back scaramangas right hand balled into a fist i told you not to rile me mister so dont go prying into my affairs or youll get hurt and thats for sure as if he could hardly control himself longer the big man turned on his heel and strode brusquely out of the room james bond smiled he turned back to the list in front of him a strong reek of high gangsterdom rose from the paper but the name he was most interested in was mr hendriks who represented european money if that was his real name and he was a dutchman so james bond reflected was he he tore off three sheets of paper to efface the impression of his pencil and walked out and along into the lobby a bulky man was approaching the desk from the entrance he was sweating mightily in his unseasonable woodenlooking suit he might have been anybodyan antwerp diamond merchant a german dentist a swiss bank manager the pale squarejowled face was totally anonymous he put a heavy briefcase on the desk and said in a thick central european accent i am mr hendriks i think it is that you have a room for me isnt it pass the canapes the cars began rolling up scaramanga was in evidence he switched a careful smile of welcome on and off no hands were shaken the host was greeted either as pistol or mr s except by mr hendriks who called him nothing bond stood within earshot of the desk and fitted the names to the men in general appearance they were all much of a muchness darkfaced cleanshaven around five feet six hardeyed above thinly smiling mouths curt of speech to the manager they all held firmly on to their briefcases when the bellboys tried to add them to the luggage on the rubbertired barrows they dispersed to their rooms along the west wing bond took out his list and added hatcheck notations to each one except hendriks who was clearly etched in bonds memory gengerella became italian origin mean pursed mouth rotkopf thick neck totally bald jew binion bat ears scar down left cheek limp garfinkel the toughest bad teeth gun under right armpit and finally paradise showman type cocky false smile diamond ring scaramanga came up whats that youre writing just notes to remember them by lets see it scaramanga held out a demanding hand bond gave him the list scaramanga ran his eyes down it he handed it back fair enough but you neednt have mentioned the only gun you noticed theyll all be protected except hendriks i guess these kinda guys are nervous when they move abroad what of scaramanga shrugged maybe the natives the last people who worried about the natives were the redcoats perhaps a hundred and fifty years ago who cares see you in the bar around twelve ill be introducing you as my personal assistant thatll be fine scaramangas brows came together bond strolled off in the direction of his bedroom he proposed to needle this man and go on needling until it came to a fight for the time being the other man would probably take it because it seemed he needed bond but there would come a moment probably on an occasion when there were witnesses when his vanity would be so sharply pricked that he would draw then bond would have a small edge for it would be he who had thrown down the glove the tactic was a crude one but bond could think of no other bond verified that his room had been searched at some time during the morningand by an expert he always used a hoffritz safety razor patterned on the oldfashioned heavytoothed gillette type his american friend felix leiter had once bought him one in new york to prove that they were the best and bond had stayed with them the handle of a safety razor is a reasonably sophisticated hideout for the minor tools of espionagecodes microdot developers cyanide and other pills that morning bond had set a minute nick on the screw base of the handle in line with the z of the makers name engraved on the shaft the nick was now a millimetre to the right of the z none of his other little trapshandkerchiefs with indelible dots in particular places arranged in a certain order the angle of his suitcase with the wall of the wardrobe the semiextracted lining of the breast pocket of his spare suit the particular symmetry of certain dents in his tube of macleans toothpastehad been bungled or disturbed they all might have been by a meticulous servant a trained valet but jamaican servants for all their charm and willingness are not of this calibre no between nine and ten when bond was doing his rounds and was well away from the hotel his room had received a thorough goingover by someone who knew his business bond was pleased it was good to know that the fight was well and truly joined if he found a chance of making a foray into number he hoped that he would do better he took a shower afterwards as he brushed his hair he looked at himself in the mirror with inquiry he was feeling a hundred percent fit but he remembered the dull lacklustre eyes that had looked back at him when he shaved after first entering the parkthe tense preoccupied expression on his face now the greyblue eyes looked back at him from the tanned face with the brilliant glint of suppressed excitement and accurate focus of the old days he smiled ironically back at the introspective scrutiny that so many people make of themselves before a race a contest of wits a trial of some sort he had no excuses he was ready to go the bar was through a brassstudded leather door opposite the lobby to the conference room it wasin the fashiona mockenglish publichouse saloon bar with luxury accessories the scrubbed wooden chairs and benches had foamrubber squabs in red leather behind the bar the tankards were of silver or simulated silver instead of pewter the hunting prints copper and brass hunting horns muskets and powder horns on the walls could have come from the parker galleries in london instead of tankards of beer bottles of champagne in antique coolers stood on the tables and instead of yokels the hoods stood around in what looked like brooks brothers tropical attire and carefully sipped their drinks while mine host leant against the polished mahogany bar and twirled his golden gun round and round on the first finger of his right hand like the snide poker cheat out of an old western as the door closed behind bond with a pressurized sigh the golden gun halted in midwhirl and sighted on bonds stomach fellows said scaramanga mock boisterous meet my personal assistant mr mark hazard from london england hes come along to make things run smoothly over this weekend mark come over and meet the gang and pass round the canapes he lowered the gun and shoved it into his waistband james bond stitched a personal assistant smile on his face and walked up to the bar perhaps because he was an englishman there was a round of handshaking the redcoated barman asked him what he would have and he said some pink gin plenty of bitters beefeaters there was desultory talk about the relative merits of gins everyone else seemed to be drinking champagne except mr hendriks who stood away from the group and nursed a schweppes bitter lemon bond moved among the men he made small talk about their flight the weather in the states the beauties of jamaica he wanted to fit the voices to the names he gravitated towards mr hendriks seems were the only two europeans here gather youre from holland often passed through never stayed there long beautiful country the very pale blue eyes regarded bond unenthusiastically sank you what part do you come from den haag have you lived there long many many years beautiful town sank you is this your first visit to jamaica no how do you like it its a beautiful place bond nearly said sank you he smiled encouragingly at mr hendriks as much as to say ive made all the running so far now you say something mr hendriks looked past bonds right ear at nothing the pressure of the silence built up mr hendriks shifted his weight from one foot to the other and finally broke down his eyes shifted and looked thoughtfully at bond and you you are from london isnt it yes do you know it i have been there yes where do you usually stay there was hesitation with friends that must be convenient pliss i mean its pleasant to have friends in a foreign town hotels are so much alike i have not found this excuse pliss with a germanic bob of the head mr hendriks moved decisively away from bond and went up to scaramanga who was still lounging in solitary splendour at the bar mr hendriks said something his words acted like a command on the other man scaramanga straightened himself and followed mr hendriks into a far corner of the room he stood and listened with deference as mr hendriks talked rapidly in a low tone bond joining the other men was interested it was his guess that no other man in the room could have buttonholed scaramanga with so much authority he noticed that many fleeting glances were cast in the direction of the couple apart for bonds money this was either the mafia or kgb probably even the other five wouldnt know which but they would certainly recognize the secret smell of the machine which mr hendriks exuded so strongly luncheon was announced the jamaican headwaiter hovered between two richly prepared tables there were place cards bond found that while scaramanga was host at one of them he himself was at the head of the other table between mr paradise and mr rotkopf as he expected mr paradise was the better value of the two and as they went through the conventional shrimp cocktail steak fruit salad of the americanized hotel abroad bond cheerfully got himself involved in an argument about the odds at roulette when there are one zero or two mr rotkopf s only contribution was to say through a mouthful of steak and french fries that he had once tried three zeros at the black cat casino in miami but that the experiment had failed mr paradise said that so it should have you got to let the suckers win sometimes ruby or they wont come back sure you can squeeze the juice out of them but you oughta leave them the pips like with my slots i tell the customers dont be too greedy dont set em at thirty percent for the house set em at twenty you ever heard of mr j p morgan turning down a net profit of twenty percent hell no so why try and be smarter than guys like that mr rotkopf said sourly you got to make big profits to put against a bum steer like this he waved a hand if you ask mehe held up a bit of steak on ms fork youre eating the only money youre going to see out of this dump at this minute mr paradise leaned across the table and said softly you know something mr rotkopf said i always told my money that the bindweed would get this place the damn fools wouldnt listen and look where we are in three years second mortgage nearly run out and weve only got one storey up what i say is the argument went off into the realms of high finance at the nextdoor table there was not even this amount of animation scaramanga was a man of few words there were clearly none available for social occasions opposite him mr hendriks exuded a silence as thick as gouda cheese the three hoods addressed an occasional glum sentence to anyone who would listen james bond wondered how scaramanga was going to electrify this unpromising company into having a good time luncheon broke up and the company dispersed to their rooms james bond wandered round to the back of the hotel and found a discarded shingle on a rubbish dump it was blazing hot under the afternoon sun but the doctors wind was blowing in from the sea for all its airconditioning there was something grim about the impersonal grey and white of bonds bedroom bond walked along the shore took off his coat and tie and sat in the shade of a bush of sea grapes and watched the fiddler crabs about their minuscule business in the sand while he whittled two chunky wedges out of the jamaican cedar then he closed his eyes and thought about mary goodnight she would now be having her siesta in some villa on the outskirts of kingston it would probably be high up in the blue mountains for the coolness in bonds imagination she would be lying on her bed under a mosquito net because of the heat she would have nothing on and one could see only an ivoryandgold shape through the fabric of the net but one would know that there were small beads of sweat on her upper lip and between her breasts and the fringes of the golden hair would be damp bond took off his clothes and lifted up the corner of the mosquito net not wanting to wake her until he had fitted himself against her thighs but she turned in halfsleep towards turn and held out her arms james under the seagrape bush a hundred and twenty miles away from the scene of the dream james bonds had came up with a jerk he looked quickly guiltily at his watch threethirty he went off to his room and had a cold shower verified that his cedar wedges would do what they were meant to do and strolled down the corridor to the lobby the manager with the neat suit and neat face came out from behind his desk er mr hazard yes i dont think youve met my assistant mr travis no i dont think i have would you care to step into the office for a moment and shake him by the hand later perhaps weve got this conference on in a few minutes the neat man came a step closer he said quietly he particularly wants to meet you mrerbond bond cursed himself this was always happening in his particular trade you were looking in the dark for a beetle with red wings your eyes were focused for that particular pattern on the bark of the tree you didnt notice the moth with cryptic colouring that crouched quietly nearby itself like a piece of the bark itself just as important to the collector the focus of your eyes was too narrow your mind was too concentrated you were using by magnification and your by was not in focus bond looked at the man with the recognition that exists between crooks between homosexuals between secret agents it is the look common to men bound by secrecyby common trouble better make it quick the neat man stepped behind his desk and opened a door bond went in and the neat man closed the door behind them a tall slim man was standing at a filing cabinet he turned he had a lean bronzed texan face under an unruly mop of straight fair hair and instead of a right hand a bright steel hook bond stopped in his tracks his face split into a smile broader than he had smiled for what was it three years or four he said you goddamned lousy crook what in hell are you doing here he went up to the man and hit him hard on the biceps of the left arm the grin was slightly more creased than bond remembered but it was just as friendly and ironical mr travis said the name is leiter mr felix leiter temporary accountant on loan from morgan guaranty trust to the thunderbird hotel were just checking up on your credit rating mr hazard would you kindly in your royal parlance extract your finger and give me some evidence that you are who you claim to be minutes of the meeting james bond almost lightheaded with pleasure picked up a handful of travel literature from the front desk said hi to mr gengerella who didnt reply and followed him into the conference room lobby they were the last to show scaramanga beside the open door to the conference room looked pointedly at his watch and said to bond okay feller lock the door when were all settled and dont let anyone in even if the hotel catches fire he turned to the barman behind the buffet get lost joe ill call for you later he said to the room right were all set lets go he led the way into the conference room and the six men followed bond stood by the door and noted the seating order round the table he closed the door and locked it and quickly also locked the exit from he lobby then he picked up a champagne glass from the buffet pulled over a chair and sited the chair very close to the door of the conference room he placed the bowl of the champagne glass as near as possible to a hinge of the door and holding the glass by the stem put his left ear up against its base through the crude amplifier what had been the rumble of a voice became mr hendriks speaking and so it is that i will now report from my superiors in europe the voice paused and bond heard another noise the creak of a chair like lightning he pulled his chair back a few feet opened one of the travel folders on his lap and raised the glass to his lips the door jerked open and scaramanga stood in the opening twirling his passkey on a chain he examined the innocent figure on the chair he said okay feller just checking and kicked the door shut bond noisily locked it and took up his place again mr hendriks said i have one most important message for our chairman it is from a sure source there is a man that is called james bond that is looking for him in this territory this is a man who is from the british secret service i have no informations or descriptions of this man but it seems that he is highly rated by my superiors mr scaramanga have you heard of this man scaramanga snorted hell no and should i care i eat one of their famous secret agents for breakfast from time to time only ten days ago i disposed of one of them who came nosing after me man called ross his body is now very slowly sinking to the bottom of a pitch lake in eastern trinidadplace called la brea the oil company the trinidad lake asphalt people will obtain an interesting barrel of crude one of these days next question please mr hendriks next i am wishing to know what is the policy of the group in the matter of cane sabotage at our meeting six months ago in havana against my minority vote it was decided in exchange for certain favours to come to the aid of fidel castro and assist in maintaining and indeed increasing the world price of sugar to offset the damage caused by hurricane flora since this time there have been very numerous fires in the cane fields of jamaica and trinidad in this connection it has come to the ears of my superiors that individual members of the group notably there was the rustle of papermessrs gengerella rotkopf and binion in addition to our chairman have engaged in extensive purchasing of july sugar futures for the benefit of private gain there came an angry murmur from round the table why shouldnt we why shouldnt they the voice of gengerella dominated the others he shouted who in hell said we werent to make money isnt that one of the objects of the group i ask you again mr hendriks as i asked you six months ago who in hell is it among your socalled superiors who wants to keep the price of raw sugar down for my money the most interested party in such a gambit would be soviet russia theyre selling goods to cuba including let me say the recently abortive shipment of missiles to fire against my country in exchange for raw sugar theyre sharp traders the reds in their doubledealing way even from a friend and ally they would want more sugar for fewer goods yes i suppose the voice sneered one of your superiors mr hendriks would not by any chance be in the kremlin the voice of scaramanga cut through the ensuing hubbub hey you guys cut it out a reluctant silence fell when we formed this cooperative it was agreed that the first object was to cooperate with one another okay then mr hendriks let me put you more fully in the picture so far as the total finances of the group are concerned we have a fine situation coming up as an investment group we have good bets and bad bets sugar is a good bet and we should ride that bet even though certain members of the group have chosen not to be on the horse get me now hear me through there are six ships controlled by the group at this moment riding at anchor outside new york and other us harbours these ships are loaded with raw sugar these ships mr hendriks will not dock and unload until sugar futures july futures have risen another ten cents in washington the department of agriculture and the sugar lobby know this they know that we have them by the balls meantimes the liquor lobby is leaning on themlet alone russia the price of molasses is going up with sugar and the rum barons are kicking up hell and want our ships let in before theres a real shortage and the price goes through the roof but theres another side to it were having to pay our crews and our charter bills and so on and squatting ships are dead ships dead losses so somethings going to give in the business the situation weve developed is called the floating crop gameour ships lying offshore lined up against the government of the united states all right so now four of us stand to win or lose ten million bucks or sous and our backers and weve got this little business of the thunderbird on the red side of the sheet so what do you think mr hendriks of course we burn the crops where we can get away with it i got a good in with the rastafaristhats a beat sect here that grows beards and smokes ganja and mostly lives on a bit of land outside kingston called the dungle the dunghill and believes it owes allegiance to the king of ethiopia this king zog or whathaveyou and that thats their rightful home so ive got a man in there a man who wants the ganja for them and i keep him supplied in exchange for plenty fires and troubles on the cane lands so all right mr hendriks you just tell your superiors that what goes up must come down and that applies to the price of sugar like anything else okay mr hendriks said i will pass on your saying mr scaramanga it will not cause pleasure now there is this business of the hotel how is she standing if you pliss i think we are all wishing to know the true situation isnt it there was a growl of assent scaramanga went off into a long dissertation which was only of passing interest to bond felix leiter would in any case be getting it all on the tape in a drawer of his filing cabinet he had reassured bond on this score the neat american leiter had explained filling him in with the essentials was in fact a certain mr nick nicholson of the cia his particular concern was mr hendriks who as bond had suspected was a top man of the kgb the kgb favours oblique controla man in geneva being the resident director for italy for instanceand mr hendriks at the hague was in fact resident director for the caribbean and in charge of the havana centre leiter was still working for pinkertons but was also on the reserve of the cia who had drafted him for this particular assignment because of his knowledge gained in the past mostly with james bond of jamaica his job was to get a breakdown of the group and find out what they were up to they were all wellknown hoods who would normally have been the concern of the fbi but gengerella was a capo mafioso and this was the first time the mafia had been found consorting with the kgba most disturbing partnership which must at all costs be quickly broken up by physical elimination if need be nick nicholson whose front name was stanley jones was an electronics expert he had traced the main lead to scaramangas recording device under the floor of the central switch room and had bled off the microphone cable to his own tape recorder in the filing cabinet so bond had not much to worry about he was listening to satisfy his own curiosity and to fill in on anything that might transpire in the lobby or out of range of the bug in the telephone on the conference room table bond had explained his own presence leiter had given a long low whistle of respectful apprehension bond had agreed to keep well clear of the other two men and to paddle his own canoe but they had arranged an emergency meeting place and a postal drop in the uncompleted and out of order mens room off the lobby nicholson had given him a passkey for this place and all other rooms and then bond had had to hurry off to his meeting james bond was immensely reassured by finding these unexpected reinforcements he had worked with leiter on some of his most hazardous assignments there was no man like him when the chips were down although leiter had only a steel hook instead of a right arma memento of one of those assignmentshe was one of the finest lefthanded onearmed shots in the states and the hook itself could be a devastating weapon at close quarters scaramanga was finishing his exposition so the net of it is gentlemen that we need to find ten million bucks the interests i represent which are the majority interests suggest that this sum should be provided by a note issue bearing interest at ten percent and repayable in ten years such an issue to have priority over all other loans the voice of mr rotkopf broke in angrily the hell it will not on your life mister what about the seven percent second mortgage put up by me and my friends only a year back what do you think id get if i went back to vegas with that kind of parley the old heaveho arid at that im being optimistic beggars cant be choosers ruby its that or close what have you other fellows got to say hendriks said ten percent on a first charge is good pizzness my friends and i will take one million dollars on the understanding it is natural that the conditions of the issue are how shall i say more substantial less open to misunderstandings than the second mortgage of mr rotkopf and his friends of course and i and my friends will also take a million sam mr binion said reluctantly okay okay count us in for the same but by golly this has got to be the last touch mr gengerella it sounds a good bet ill take the rest the voices of mr garfinkel and mr paradise broke in excitedly garfinkel in the lead like hell you will im taking a million and so am i shouted mr paradise cut the cake equally but dammit lets be fair to ruby ruby you oughta have first pick how much do you want you can have it off the top i dont want a damned cent of your phoney notes as soon as i get back im going to reach for the best damned lawyers in the statesall of them you think you can scrub a mortgage just by saying so youve all got another think coming there was silence the voice of scaramanga was soft and deadly youre making a big mistake ruby youve just got yourself a nice fat tax loss to put against your vegas interests and dont forget that when we formed this group we all took an oath none of us was to operate against the interests of the others is that your last word it damn well is would this help you change your mind theyve got a slogan for it in cubarapido seguro economica this is how the system operates the scream of terror and the explosion were simultaneous a chair crashed to the floor and there was a moments silence then someone coughed nervously mr gengerella said calmly i think that was the correct solution of an embarrassing conflict of interests rubys friends in vegas like a quiet life i doubt if they will even complain it is better to be a live owner of some finely engraved paper than to be a dead holder of a second mortgage put them in for a million pistol i think you behaved with speed and correctness now then can you clean this up sure sure scaramangas voice was relaxed happy rubys left here to go back to vegas never heard of again we dont know nuthin ive got some hungry crocs out back there in the river theyll give him free transportation to where hes goingand his baggage if its good leather i shall need some help tonight what about you sam and you louie the voice of mr paradise pleaded count me out pistol im a good catholic mr hendriks said i will take his place i am not a catholic person so it be then well fellers any other business if not well break up the meeting and have a drink hal garfinkel said nervously just a minute pistol what about that guy outside the door that limey feller whats he going to say about the fireworks and all scaramangas chuckle was like the dry chuckle of a gekko just dont you worry your liny head about the limey hal hell be looked after when the weekends over picked him up in a bordello in a village nearby place where i go get my weed and a bit of local tail got only temporary staff here to see you fellers have a good tune over the weekend hes the temporariest of the lot those crocs have a big appetite rubyll be the main dish but theyll need a dessert just you leave him to me for all i know he may be this james bond man mr hendriks has told us about i should worry i dont like limeys like some good yankee once said for every britisher that dies theres a song in my heart remember the guy around the time of the israeli war against them i dig that viewpoint stuckup bastards stuffed shirts when the time comes im going to let the stuffing out of this one just you leave him to me or lets just say leave him to this bond smiled a thin smile he could imagine the golden gun being produced and twirled round the finger and stuck back in the waistband he got up and moved his chair away from the door and poured champagne into the useful glass and leant against the buffet and studied the latest handout from the jamaica tourist board the click of scaramangas passkey sounded in the lock scaramanga looked at bond from the doorway he ran a finger along the small moustache okay fellow i guess thats enough of the house champagne cut along to the manager and tell him mr ruby rotkopfll be checking out tonight ill fix the details and say a major fuse blew during the meeting and im going to seal off this room and find out why were having so much bad workmanship around the place okay then drinks and dinner and bring on the dancing girls got the picture james bond said that he had he weaved slightly as he went to the lobby door and unlocked it e oe as the financial prospectuses say he thought that he had indeed now got the picture and it was an exceptionally clear print in black and white without fuzz bellylick etc in the back office james bond went quickly over the highlights of the meeting nick nicholson and felix leiter agreed they had enough on the tape supported by bond to send scaramanga to the chair that night one of them would do some snooping while the body of rotkopf was being disposed of and try and get enough evidence to have garfinkel and better still hendriks indicted as accessories but they didnt at all like the outlook for james bond felix commanded him now dont you move an inch without that old equalizer of yours we dont want to have to read that obituary of yours in the times all over again all that crap about what a great guy you are nearly made me throw up when i saw it picked up in our papers i damn nearly fired off a piece to the trib putting the record straight bond laughed he said youre a fine friend felix when i think of all the trouble ive been to to set you a good example all these years he went off to his room swallowed two heavy slugs of bourbon had a cold shower and lay on his bed and looked at the ceiling until it was and time for dinner the meal was less stuffy than luncheon everyone seemed satisfied with the way the business of the day had gone and all except scaramanga and mr hendriks had obviously had plenty to drink bond found himself excluded from the happy talk eyes avoided his and replies to his attempts at conversation were monosyllabic he was bad news he had been dealt the death card by the boss he was certainly not a man to be pally with dinnerthe conventional expensive dinner of a cruise shipwas as predictable as such things usually are the waiters brought on the desiccated smoked salmon with a thimbleful of smallgrained black caviar fillets of some unnamed native fish in a cream sauce a poulet supreme and the bombe surprise and while the meal moved sluggishly on the diningroom was being turned into a tropical jungle with the help of potted plants piles of oranges and coconuts and an occasional stem of bananas this was a backdrop for the calypso band which in winered and goldfrilled shirts assembled in due course and began playing linstead market too loud the tune closed an acceptable but heavily clad girl appeared and began singing bellylick with the printable words she wore a false pineapple as a headdress bond saw a cruise ship evening stretching ahead he decided that he was either too old or too young for the worst torture of all boredom and got up and went to the head of the table he said to scaramanga ive got a headache im going to bed scaramanga looked up at him under lizard eyelids no if you figure the evenings not going so good make it go better thats what youre being paid for you act as if you know jamaica okay get those people off the pad it was many years since james bond had accepted a dare he felt the eyes of the group on him what he had drunk had made him carelessperhaps wanting to show off like the man at the party who insists on playing the drums stupidly he wanted to assert his personality over this bunch of tough guys who rated him insignificant he didnt stop to think that it was bad tactics that he would be better off being the ineffectual limey he said all right mr scaramanga give me a hundred dollar bill and your gun scaramanga didnt move he looked up at bond with surprise and controlled uncertainty louie paradise shouted thickly cmon pistol lets see some action maybe the guy can produce scaramanga reached for his hip pocket took out his billfold and thumbed out a bill next he slowly reached to his waistband and took out his gun the subdued light from the spot on the girl glowed on its gold he laid the two objects on the table side by side james bond his back to the cabaret picked up the gun and hefted it he thumbed back the hammer and twirled the cylinder with a flash of his hands to verify that it was loaded then he suddenly whirled dropped on his knee so that his aim would be above the shadowy musicians in the background and his arm at full length let fly the explosion was deafening in the confined space the music died there was a tense silence the remains of the false pineapple hit something in the dark background with a soft thud the girl stood under the spot and put her hands up to her face and slowly folded to the dance floor like something graceful out of swan lake the maitre dhotel came running from among the shadows as chatter broke out among the group james bond picked up the hundred dollar bill and walked out into the spotlight he bent down and lifted the girl up bv her arm he pushed the bill down into her cleavage he said that was a fine act we did together sweetheart dont worry you were in no danger i aimed for the top half of the pineanple now run off and get ready for your next turn he turned her round and gave her a sharp pat in the behind she gave him a horrified glance and scurried off into the shadows bond strolled on and came up with the band whos in charge here whos in command of the show the guitarist a tall gaunt negro got slowly to his feet the whites of his eyes showed he squinted at the golden gun in bonds hand he said uncertainly as if signing his own death warrant me sah whats your name kong tiger sah all right then king now listen to me this isnt a salvation army fork supper mr scaramangas friends want some action and they want it hot ill be sending plenty of rum over to loosen things up smoke weed if you like were private here no ones going to tell on you and get that pretty girl back but with only half the clothes on and tell her to come up close and sing bellylick very clearly with the blue words and by the end of the show she and the other girls have got to end up stripped understand now get cracking or the eveningll fold and therell be no tips at the end okay then lets go there was nervous laughter and whispered exhortation to king tiger from the sixpiece combo king tiger grinned broadly okay captain sah we was just holding off until the party got warmed up a little he turned to his men give em iron bar but hot and ill go get some steam up with daisy and her friends he strode to the service exit and the band crashed into its stride bond walked back and laid the pistol down in front of scaramanga who gave bond a long inquisitive look and slid it back into his waistband he said flatly we must have a shooting match one of these days mister how about it twenty paces and no wounding thanks said bond but my mother wouldnt approve would you have some rum sent over to the band these people cant play dry he went back to his seat he was hardly noticed the five men or rather four of them because hendriks sat impassively through the whole evening were straining their ears to catch the lewd words of the fanny hill version of iron bar that were coming across clearly from the soloist four girls plump busty little animals wearing nothing but white sequined gstrings ran out on to the floor and advancing towards the audience did an enthusiastic belly dance that brought sweat to the temples of louie paradise and hal garfinkel the number ended amidst applause the girls ran off and the lights were dowsed leaving only the circular spot in the middle of the floor the drummer on his calypso box began a hasty beat like a quickened pulse the service door opened and shut and a curious object was wheeled into the circle of light it was a huge hand perhaps six feet tall at its highest point upholstered in black leather it stood half open on its broad base with the thumb and fingers outstretched as if ready to catch something the drummer hastened his beat the service door sighed a glistening figure slipped through and after pausing in the darkness moved into the pool of light round the hand with a strutting jerk of belly and limbs there was chinese blood in her and her body totally naked and shining with palm oil was almost white against the black hand as she jerked round the hand she caressed its outstretched fingers with her hands and arms and then with wellacted swooning motions climbed into the palm of the hand and proceeded to perform languorous but explicit and ingenious acts of passion with each of the fingers in turn the scene the black hand now shining with her oil and seeming to clutch at the squirming white body was of an incredible lewdness and bond himself aroused noticed that even scaramanga was watching with rapt attention his eyes narrow slits the drummer had now worked up to his crescendo the girl in wellsimulated ecstasy mounted the thumb slowly expired upon it and then with a last grind of her rump slid down it and vanished through the exit the act was over the lights came on and everyone including the band applauded loudly the men came out of their separate animal trances scaramanga clapped his hand for the bandleader took a note out of his case and said something to him under his breath the chieftain bond suspected had chosen his bride for the night after this inspired piece of sexual dumb crambo the rest of the carbaret was an anticlimax one of the girls only after her gstring had been slashed off with a cutlass by the bandleader was able to squirm under a bamboo pole balanced just eighteen inches off the floor on the top of two beer bottles the first girl the one who had acted as an unwitting pineapple tree to bonds william tell act came on and combined an acceptable striptease with a rendering of bellylick that got the audience straining its ears again and then the whole team less the chinese beauty came up to the audience and invited them to dance scaramanga and hendriks refused with adequate politeness and bond stood the two leftout girls glasses of champagne and learned that their names were mabel and pearl while he watched the four others being almost bent in half by the bearlike embraces of the four sweating hoods as they clumsily chachad round the room to the now riotous music of the halfdrunk band the climax to what could certainly class as an orgy was clearly in sight bond told his two girls that he must go to the mens room and slipped away when scaramanga was looking elsewhere but as he went he noted that hendriks gaze as cool as if he had been watching an indifferent film was firmly on him as he made his escape when bond got to his room it was midnight his windows had been closed and the airconditioning turned on he switched it off and opened the windows halfway and then with heartfelt relief took a shower and went to bed he worried for a while about having shown off with the gun but it was an act of folly which he couldnt undo and he soon went to sleep to dream of three blackcloaked men dragging a shapeless bundle through dappled moonlight towards dark waters that were dotted with glinting red eyes the gnashing white teeth and the crackling bones resolved themselves into a persistent scrabbling noise that brought him suddenly awake he looked at the luminous dial of his watch it said the scrabbling became a quiet tapping from behind the curtains james bond slid quietly out of bed took his gun from under his pillow and crept softly along the wall to the edge of the curtains he pulled them aside with one swift motion the golden hair shone almost silver in the moonlight mary goodnight whispered urgently quick james help me in bond cursed softly to himself what the hell he laid his gun down on the carpet and reached for her outstretched hands and halfdragged halfpulled her over the sill at the last moment her heel caught in the frame and the window banged shut with a noise like a pistol shot bond cursed again softly and fluently under his breath mary goodnight whispered penitently im terribly sorry james bond shushed her he picked up his gun and put it back under his pillow and led her across the room and into the bathroom he turned on the light and as a precaution the shower and simultaneously with her gasp remembered he was naked he said sorry goodnight and reached for a towel and wound it round his waist and sat down on the edge of the bath he gestured to the girl to sit down on the lavatory seat and said with icy control what in hell are you doing here mary her voice was desperate i had to come i had to find you somehow i got on to you through the girl at that er dreadful place i left the car in the trees down the drive and just sniffed about there were lights on in some of the rooms and i listened and ershe blushed crimsoni gathered you couldnt be in any of them and then i saw the open window and i just somehow knew you would be the only one to sleep with his window open so i just had to take the chance well weve got to get you out of here as quick as we can anyway whats the trouble a most immediate in triplex came over this evening i mean yesterday evening it was to be passed to you at all costs hq thinks youre in havana it said that one of the kgb top men who goes under the name of hendriks is in the area and that hes known to be visiting this hotel youre to keep away from him they know from a delicate but sure sourcebond smiled at the old euphemism for cypherbreakingthat among his other jobs is to find you and er well kill you so i put two and two together and what with you being in this corner of the island and the questions you asked me i guessed that you might be already on his track but that you might be walking into an ambush sort of not knowing i mean that while you were after him he was after you she put out a tentative hand as if for reassurance that she had done the right thing bond took it and patted it absentmindedly while his mind chewed on this new complication he said the mans here all right sos a gunman called scaramanga you might as well know mary that scaramanga killed ross in trinidad she put her hand up to her mouth you can report it as a fact from me if i can get you out of here that is as for hendriks hes here all right but he doesnt seem to have identified me for certain did hq say whether he was given a description of me you were simply described as the notorious secret agent james bond but this doesnt seem to have meant much to hendriks because he asked for particulars that was two days ago he may get them cabled or telephoned here at any minute you do see why i had to come james yes of course and thanks mary now ive got to get you out of that window and then you must just make your own way dont worry about me i think i can handle the situation all right besides ive got help he told her about felix leiter and nicholson you just tell hq youve delivered the message and that im here and about the two cia men hq can get the cia angles from washington direct okay he got to his feet she stood up beside him and looked up at him but you will take care sure sure he patted her shoulder he turned off the shower and opened the bathroom door now come on we must pray for a stroke of luck a silken voice from the darkness at the end of the bed said well the holy man just aint running for you today mister step forward both of you hands clasped behind the neck ballcock and other trouble scaramanga walked to the door and turned the lights on he was naked save for his shorts and the holster below his left arm the golden gun remained trained on bond as he moved bond looked at him incredulously then to the carpet inside the door the wedges were still there undisturbed he could not possibly have got through the window unaided then he saw that his clothes cupboard stood open and that light showed through into the next room it was the simplest of secret doorsjust the whole of the back of the cupboard impossible to detect from bonds side of the wall and on the other probably in appearance a locked communicating door scaramanga came back into the centre of the room and stood looking at them both his mouth and eyes sneered he said i didnt see this piece of tail in the lineup where you been keeping it buster and why dyou have to hide it away in the bathroom like doing it under the shower bond said were engaged to be married she works in the british high commissioners office in kingston cypher clerk she found out where i was staying from that place you and i met she came out to tell me that my mothers in the hospital in london had a bad fall her names mary goodnight whats wrong with that and what do you mean coming busting into my room in the middle of the night waving a gun about and kindly keep your foul tongue to yourself bond was pleased with his bluster and decided to take the next step towards mary goodnights freedom he dropped his hands to his sides and turned to the girl put your hands down mary mr scaramanga must have thought there were burglars about when he heard that window bang now ill get some clothes on and take you out to your car youve got a long drive back to kingston are you sure you wouldnt rather stay here for the rest of the night im sure mr scaramanga could find us a spare room he turned back to mr scaramanga its all right mr scaramanga ill pay for it mary goodnight chipped in she had dropped her hands she picked up her small bag from the bed where she had thrown it opened it and began busying herself with her hair in a fussy feminine way she chattered falling in well with bonds bland piece of very british nowlookheremymanmanship no honestly darling i really think id better go id be in terrible trouble if i was late at the office and the prime minister sir alexander bustamante you know will have his eightieth birthday well hes coming to lunch and you know his excellency always likes me to do the flowers and arrange the place cards and as a matter of factshe turned charmingly towards mr scaramangaits quite a day for me the party was going to make up thirteen so his excellency has asked me to be the fourteenth isnt that marvellous but heaven knows what im going to look like after tonight the roads really are terrible in parts arent they mrerscramble but there it is and i do apologize for causing all this disturbance and keeping you from your beauty sleep she went towards him like the queen mother opening a bazaar her hand outstretched now you run along off back to bed again and my fiance will see me safely off the premises goodbye mr er james bond was proud of her it was almost pure joyce grenfell but scaramanga wasnt going to be taken in by any doubletalk limey or otherwise she almost had bond covered from scaramanga he moved swiftly aside he said hold it lady and you mister stand where you are mary goodnight let her hand drop to her side she looked inquiringly at scaramanga as if he had just rejected the cucumber sandwiches really these americans the golden gun didnt go for polite conversation it held dead steady between the two of them scaramanga said to bond okay ill buy it put her through the window again then ive got something to say to you he waved his gun at the girl okay bimbo get going and dont come trespassing on other peoples lands again right and you can tell his friggin excellency where to shove his place cards his writ dont run over the thunderbird mine does got the picture okay dont bust your stays getting through the window mary goodnight said icily very good mr er i will deliver your message im sure the high commissioner will take more careful note than he has done of your presence on the island and the jamaican government also bond reached out and took her arm she was on the edge of overplaying her role he said come on mary and please tell mother that ill be through here in a day or two and ill be telephoning her from kingston he led her to the window and helped or rather bundled her out she gave a brief wave and ran off across the lawn bond came away from the window with considerable relief he hadnt expected the ghastly mess to sort itself out so painlessly he went and sat down on his bed he sat on the pillow he was reassured to feel the hard shape of his gun against his thighs he looked across at scaramanga the man had put his gun back in his shoulder holster he leant up against the clothes cupboard and ran his finger reflectively along the black line of his moustache he said high commissioners office that also houses the local representative of your famous secret service i suppose mister hazard that your real name wouldnt be james bond you showed quite a turn of speed with the gun tonight i seem to have read somewhere that this man bond fancies himself with the hardware i also have information to the effect that hes somewhere in the caribbean and that hes looking for me funny coincidence department eh bond laughed easily i thought the secret service packed up at the end of the war anyway im afraid i cant change my identity to suit your book all youve got to do in the morning is ring up frome and ask for mr tony hugill the boss up there and check on my story and can you explain how this bond chap could possible have tracked you down to a brothel in sav la mar and what does he want from you anyway scaramanga contemplated him silently for a while then he said guess he may be lookin for a shootin lesson be glad to oblige him but youve got something about number three and onehalf thats what i figgered when i hired you but coincidence doesnt come in that size mebbe i should have thought again i said from the first i smelled cops that girl may be your fiancee or she may notbut that play with the shower bath thats an old hoods trick probably a secret service one too unless that is you were screwin her he raised one eyebrow i was anything wrong with that what have you been doing with the chinese girl playing mahjongg bond got to his feet he stitched impatience and outrage on his face in equal quantities now look here mr scaramanga ive had just about enough of this just stop leaning on me you go around waving that damned gun of yours and acting like god almighty and insinuating a lot of tommyrot about the secret service and you expect me to kneel down and lick your boots well my friend youve come to the wrong address if youre dissatisfied with the job im doing just hand over the thousand dollars and ill be on my way scaramanga smiled his thin cruel smile you may be getting wise to that sooner than you think shamus he shrugged okay okay but just you remember this mister if it turns out youre not who you say you are ill blow you to bits get me and ill start with the little bits and go onto the bigger ones just so it lasts a heck of a long tune right now youd better get some shuteye ive got a meeting with mr hendriks at ten in the conference room and i dont want to be disturbed after that the whole party goes on an excursion on the railroad i was tellin you about itll be your job to see that that gets properly organized talk to the manager first thing right okay then be seeing ya scaramanga walked into the clothes cupboard brushed bonds suit aside and disappeared there came a decisive click from the next room bond got to his feet he said phew at the top of his voice and walked off into the bathroom to wash the last two hours away in the shower he awoke at by arrangement with that curious extrasensory alarm clock that some people keep in their heads that always seems to know the exact time he put on his bathing trunks and went out to the beach and did his long swim again when at he saw scaramanga come out of the west whig followed by the boy carrying his towel he made for the shore he listened for the twanging thump of the trampoline and then keeping well out of sight of it entered the hotel by the main entrance and moved quickly down the corridor to his room he listened at his window to make sure the man was still exercising then he took the master key nick nicholson had given him and slipped across the corridor to number and was quickly inside he left the door on the latch yes there was his target lying on the dressing table he strode across the room picked up the gun and slipped out the round in the cylinder that would next come up for firing he put the gun down exactly as he had found it got back to the door listened and then was out and across the corridor and into his own room he went back to the window and listened yes scaramanga was still at it it was an amateurish ploy that bond had executed but it might gain him just that fraction of a second thathe felt it in his boneswas going to be life or death for him in the next twentyfour hours in his mind he smelled that slight whiff of smoke that indicated that his cover was smouldering at the edges at any moment mark hazard of the transworld consortium might go up in flames like some clumsy effigy on guy fawkes night and james bond would stand there revealed with nothing between him and a possible force of six other gunmen but his own quick hand and the walther ppk so every shade of odds that he could shift to his side of the board would be worthwhile undismayed by the prospect in fact rather excited by it he ordered a large breakfast consumed it with relish and after pulling the connecting pin out of the ballcock in his lavatory went along to the managers office felix leiter was on duty he gave a thin managerial smile and said good morning mr hazard can i help you leiters eyes were looking beyond bond over his right shoulder mr hendriks materialized at the desk before bond could answer bond said good morning mr hendriks replied with his little germanic bow he said to leiter the telephone operator is saying that there is a longdistance call from my office in havana where is the most private place to take it pliss not in your bedroom sir is not sufficiently private bond guessed that he too had bowled out the microphone leiter looked helpful he came out from behind his desk just over here sir the lobby telephone the box is soundproof mr hendriks looked stonily at him and the machine that also is soundproof leiter looked politely puzzled im afraid i dont understand sir it is connected directly with the operator is no matter show me pliss mr hendriks followed leiter to the far corner of the lobby and was shown into the booth he carefully closed the leatherpadded door and picked up the receiver and talked into it then he stood waiting watching leiter come back across the marble floor and speak deferentially to bond you were saying sir its my lavatory something wrong with the ballcock is there anywhere else im so sorry sir ill have the house engineer look at it at once yes certainly theres the lobby toilet the decoration isnt completed and its not officially in use but its in perfectly good working order he lowered his voice and theres a connecting door with my office leave it for ten minutes while i run back the tape of what this bastards saying i heard the call was coming through dont like the sound of it may be your worry he gave a little bow and waved bond towards the central table with magazines on it if youll just take a seat for a few moments sir and then ill take care of you bond nodded his thanks and turned away in the booth hendriks was talking his eyes were fixed on bond with a terrible intensity bond felt the skin crawl at the base of his stomach this was it all right he sat down and picked up an old wall street journal surreptitiously he tore a small piece out of the centre of page one it could have been a tear at the crossfold he held the paper up at page two and watched hendriks through the little hole hendriks watched the back of the paper and talked and listened he suddenly put down the receiver and came out of the booth his face gleamed with sweat he took out a clean white handkerchief and ran it over his face and neck and walked rapidly off down the corridor nick nicholson as neat as a pin came across the lobby and with a courtly smile and a bow for bond took up his place behind the desk it was five minutes later felix leiter came out from the inner office he said something to nicholson and came over to bond there was a pale pinched look round his mouth he said and now if youll follow me sir he led the way across the lobby unlocked the mens room door followed bond in and locked the door behind him they stood among the carpentry work by the washbasins leiter said tensely i guess youve had it james they were talking russian but your name and number kept on cropping up guess youd better get out of here just as quickly as that old jalopy of yoursll carry you bond smiled thinly forewarned is forearmed felix i knew it already hendriks has been told to rub me our old friend at kgb headquarters semichastny has got it in for me ill tell you why one of these days he told leiter of the mary goodnight episode of the early hours leiter listened gloomily bond concluded so theres no object in getting out now we shall hear all the dope and probably their plans for me at this meeting at ten then theyve got this excursion business afterwards personally i guess the shooting matchll take place somewhere out in the country where there are no witnesses now if you and nick could work out something thatd upset the away engagement ill make myself responsible for the home pitch leiter looked thoughtful some of the cloud lifted from his face he said i know the plans for this afternoon off on this miniature train through the cane fields picnic then the boat out of green island harbour deepsea fishing and all that ive reconnoitred the route for it all he raised the thumb of his left hand and pinged the end of his steel hook thoughtfully yeees its going to mean some quick action and a heap of luck and ill have to get the hell up to frome for some supplies from your friend hugill will he hand over some gear on your sayso okay then come into my office and write him a note its only a halfhours drive and nick can hold the front desk for that time come on he opened a side door and went through into his office he beckoned bond to follow and shut the door behind him at leiters dictation bond took down the note to the manager of the wisco sugar estates and then went out and along to his room he took a strong nip of straight bourbon and sat on the edge of his bed and looked unseeingly out of the window and across the lawn to the seas horizon like a dozing hound chasing a rabbit in its dreams or like the audience at an athletics meeting that lifts a leg to help the highjumper over the bar every now and then his right hand twitched involuntarily in his minds eye in a variety of imagined circumstances it was leaping for his gun time passed and james bond still sat there occasionally smoking halfway through a royal blend and then absentmindedly stubbing it out in the bedtable ashtray no observer could have guessed what bond was thinking aboutor how intently he was concentrating there were some signs of tensionthe pulse in his left temple was beating a little fast the lips were slightly pursedbut the brooding bluegrey eyes that saw nothing were relaxed almost sleepy it would have been impossible to guess that james bond was contemplating the possibility of his own death later that day feelmg the softnosed bullets tearing into him seeing his body jerking on the ground his mouth perhaps screaming those were certainly part of his thoughts but the twitching right hand was evidence that in much of the whirring film of his thoughts the enemys fire was not going unansweredperhaps had even been anticipated james bond gave a deep relaxed sigh his eyes came back into focus he looked at his watch it said he got up ran both hands down his lean face with a scrubbing motion and went out and along the corridor to the conference room in a glass very darkly the setup was the same bonds travel literature was on the buffet table where he had left it he went through into the conference room it had only been cursorily tidied scaramanga had probably said it was not to be entered by the staff the chairs were roughly in position but the ashtrays had not been emptied there were no stains on the carpet and no signs of the carpet having been washed it had probably been a single shot through the heart with scaramangas softnosed bullets the internal damage would be devastating but the fragments of the bullet would stay in the body and there would be no bleeding bond went round the table ostentatiously positioning the chairs more accurately he identified the one ruby rotkopf must have sat in across the table from scaramanga because it had a cracked leg he dutifully examined the windows and looked behind the curtains doing his job scaramanga came into the room followed by mr hendriks he said roughly okay mr hazard lock both doors like yesterday no one to come in right yes as bond passed mr hendriks he said cheerfully good morning mr hendriks enjoy the party last night mr hendriks gave his usual curt bow he said nothing his eyes were granite marbles bond went out and locked the doors and took up his position with the brochures and the champagne glass immediately hendriks began talking quickly and urgently fumbling for the english words mister s i have bad troubles to report my zentrale in havana spoke with me this morning they have heard direct from moscow this manhe must have made a gesture towards the door this man is the british secret agent the man bond there is no doubt i am given the exact descriptions when he goes swimming this morning i am examining his body through glasses the wounds on his body are clearly to be seen the scar down the right side of the face leaves no doubt and his shooting last night the ploddy fool is proud of his shooting i would like to see a member of my organization behave in zees stupid fashions i would have him shot immediately there was a pause the mans tone altered became slightly menacing his target was now scaramanga but mister s how can this have come about how can you possibly have let it arrive my zentrale is dumbfounded at the mistake the man might have done much damage but for the watchfulness of my superiors please explain mister s i must be making the very full report how is it that you are meeting this man how is that you are then carrying him efen into the centre of the group the details pliss mister s the full accounting my superiors will be expressing sharp criticism of the lack of vigilance against the enemy bond heard the rasp of a match against a box he could imagine scaramanga sitting back and going through the smoking routine the voice when it came was decisive uncowed mr hendriks i appreciate your outfits concern about this and i congratulate them on their sources of information but you tell your central this i met this man completely by accident at least i thought so at the time and theres no use worrying about how it happened it hasnt been easy to set up this conference and i needed help i had to get two managers in a hurry from new york to handle the hotel people theyre doing a good job right the floor staff and all the rest i had to get from kingston but what i really needed was a kind of personal assistant who could be around to make sure that everything went smoothly personally i just couldnt be bothered with all the details when this guy dropped out of the blue he looked all right to me so i picked him up but im not stupid i knew that when this show was over id have to get rid of him just in case hed learned anything he shouldnt have now you say hes a member of the secret service i told you at the beginning of this conference that i eat these people for breakfast when i have a mind to what youve told me changes just one thing hell die today instead of tomorrow and heres how its going to happen scaramanga lowered his voice now bond could only hear disjointed words the sweat ran down from his ear as he pressed it to the base of the champagne glass our train trip rats in the cane unfortunate accident before i do it one hell of a shock details to myself promise you a big laugh scaramanga must have sat back again now his voice was normal so you can rest easy therell be nothing left of the guy by this evening okay i could get it over with now by just opening the door but two blown fuses in two days might stir up gossip around here and this way therell be a heap of fun for everyone on the picnic mr hendriks voice was flat and uninterested he had carried out his orders and action was about to follow definitive action there could be no complaint of delay in carrying out orders he said yes what you are proposing will be satisfactory i shall observe the proceedings with much amusement and now to other business plan orange my superiors are wishing to know that everything is in order yes everythings in order at reynolds metal kaiser bauxite and alumina of jamaica but your stuffs plenty what do they call itvolatile got to be replaced in the demolition chambers every five years hey there was a dry chuckle i sure snickered when i saw that the howtodoit labels on the drums were in some of these african languages as well as english ready for the big black uprising huh you better warn me about the day i hold some pretty vulnerable stocks on wall street then youll lose a lot of money said mr hendriks flatly i shall not be told the date i do not mind i hold no stocks you would be wise to keep your money in gold or diamonds or rare postage stamps and now the next matter it is of interest to my superiors to be able to place their hands on a very great quantity of narcotics you have a source for the supply of ganja or marijuana as we call it you are now receiving your supplies in pound weight i am asking whether you can stimulate your sources of supply to providing the weed by the hundredweight it is suggested that you then run shipments to the pedro cays my friends can arrange for collection from there there was a brief silence scaramanga would be smoking his thin cheroot he said yeah i think we could swing that but theyve just put some big teeth into these ganja laws real rough jail sentences see so the goddam price has up and gone through the roof the going price today is sixteen pounds an ounce a hundredweight of the stuff could cost thousands of pounds and its darned bulky in those quantities my fishing boat could probably only ship one hundredweight at a time anyway wheres it for youll be lucky to get those quantities ashore a pound or two is difficult enough i am not being told the destinations i assume it is for america i am under the impression that they are the largest consumers arrangements have been made to receive this and other consignments initially off the coast of georgia i am being told that this area is full of small islands and swamps and is already much favoured by smugglers the money is of no importance i have instructions to make an initial outlay of a million dollars but at keen market prices you will be receiving your usual ten percent commission is it that you are interested im always interested in a hundred thousand dollars ill have to get in touch with my growers they have their plantations in the maroon country thats in the centre of the island this is going to take time i can give you a quotation in about two weeksa hundredweight of the stuff fob the pedro cays okay and a date the cays are very flat this is not stuff to be left lying about isnt it sure sure now then any other business okay well ive got something id like to bring up this casino lark now this is the picture the government is tempted they think itll stimulate the tourist industry but the heavies the boys who were kicked out of havana the vegas machine the miami jokers chicago the whole worksdidnt take the measure of these people before they put the heat on and they overplayed the slush fund approachput too much money in the wrong pockets guess they should have employed a public relations outfit jamaica looks small on the map and i guess the syndicates thought they could hurry through a neat little operation like the nassau job but the opposition party got wise and the church and the old women and there was talk of the mafia taking over in jamaica the old cosa nostra and all that crap and the boys lost out remember we were offered an in coupla years back that was when they saw it was a bust and wanted to unload their promotion expenses coupla million bucks or so onto the group you recall i advised against and gave my reasons okay so we said no but things have changed different party in power bit of a tourist slump last year and a certain minister has been in touch with me says the climates changed independence has come along and theyve got out from behind the skirts of aunty england want to show that jamaicas with it got oomph and all that so this friend of mine says he can get gambling off the pad here he told me how and it makes sense before i said stay out now i say come in but its going to cost money each of usll have to chip in with a hundred thousand bucks to give local encouragement miamill be the operators and get the franchise the deal is that theyll put us in for five percentbut off the top get me on these figures and theyre not loaded our juice should have been earned in eighteen months after that its gravy get the picture but your er friends dont seem too keen on these er capitalist enterprises how do you figure it will they ante up i dont want for us to go outside for the green and as from yesterday were missing a shareholder come to think of it weve got to think of that too who we goin to rope in as number seven were short of a game for now james bond wiped his ear and the bottom of the glass with his handkerchief it was almost unbearable he had heard his own death sentence pronounced the involvement of the kgb with scaramanga and the caribbean spelled out and such minor dividends as sabotage of the bauxite industry massive drug smuggling into the states and gambling politics thrown in it was a majestic haul in area intelligence he had the ball could he live to touch down with it god for a drink he put his ear back to the hot base of the glass there was silence when it came the voice of hendriks was cautious indecisive he obviously wanted to say i passwith the corollary until ive talked to my zentrale isnt it he said mister s is difficult pizzness yes my superiors are not disliking the profitable involvements but as you will be knowing they are most liking the pizzness that has the political objective it was on these conditions that they instructed me to ally myself with your group the money that is not the problem but how am i to explain the political objective of opening casinos in jamaica this i am wondering itll almost certainly lead to trouble the localsll want to playtheyre terrific gamblers here therell be incidents the natives will be turned away from the doors for one reason or another then the opposition partyll get hold of that and raise hell about colour bars and so on with all the money flying about the unionsll push wages through the roof it can all add up to a fine stink the atmospheres too damn peaceful around here thisll be a cheap way of raising plenty of hell thats what your people want isnt it give the islands the hot foot one after another there was another brief silence mr hendriks obviously didnt like the idea he said so but obliquely what you are saying mister s is very interesting but is it not that these troubles you envisage will endanger our monies however i will report your inquiry and inform you at once it is possible that my superiors will be sympathetic who can be telling now there is this question of a new number seven are you having anyone in mind i think we want a good man from south america we need a guy to oversee our operations in british guiana we oughta get smartened up in venezuela how come we never got further with that great scheme for blocking the maracaibo strait like robbing a blind man given a suitable block ship just the threat of it would make the oil companies shell outthats a joke by the wayand go on shelling by way of protection then if this narcotics spiel is going to be important we cant do without mexico how about mr arosio of mexico city i am not knowing this gentleman rosy oh hes a great guy runs the green light transportation system drugs and girls into la never been caught yet reliable operator got no affiliates your peoplell know about him why not check with them and then well put it up to the others theyll go along with our sayso is good and now mister s have you anything to report about your own employer on his recent visit to moscow i understand that he expressed satisfaction with your efforts in this area it is a matter for gratification that there should be such close cooperation between his subversive efforts and our own both our chiefs are expecting much in the future from our union with the mafia myself i am doubting mr gengerella is undoubtedly a valuable link but it is my impression that these people are only being activated by money what is it that you are thinking youve said it mr hendriks in the opinion of my chief the mafias first and only consideration is the mafia it has always been so and it always will be so my mister c is not expecting great results in the states even the mafia cant buck the anticuban feeling there but he thinks we can achieve plenty in the caribbean by giving them odd jobs to do they can be very effective it would certainly oil the wheels if your people would use the mafia as a pipeline for this narcotics business theyll turn your milliondollar investment into ten theyll grab the nine out of it of course but thats not peanuts and itll tie them in to you think you could arrange that itll give leroy g some good news to report when he gets home as for mister c he seems to be going along all right flora was a bodyblow but largely thanks to the americans leaning on cuba the way they do hes kept the country together if the americans once let up on their propaganda and needling and so forth perhaps even make a friendly gesture or two all the steamll go out of the little man i dont often see him he leaves me alone likes to keep his nose clean i guess but i get all the cooperation i need from the dss okay well lets go see if the folks are ready to move its eleventhirty and the belle of bloody bay is due to be on her way at twelve guess its going to be quite a fun day pity our chiefs arent going to be along to see the limey eye get his chips ha said mr hendriks noncommittally james bond moved away from the door he heard scaramangas passkey in the lock he looked up and yawned scaramanga and mr hendriks looked down at him their expressions were vaguely interested and reflective it was as if he were a bit of steak and they were wondering whether to have it done rare or medium rare hear the train blow at twelve oclock they all assembled in the lobby scaramanga had added a broadbrimmed white stetson to his immaculate tropical attire he looked like the smartest plantation owner in the south mr hendriks wore his usual stuffy suit now topped with a grey homburg bond thought that he should have grey suede gloves and an umbrella the four hoods were wearing calypso shirts outside their slacks bond was pleased if they were carrying guns in their waistbands the shirts would hinder the draw cars were drawn up outside with scaramangas thunderbird in the lead scaramanga walked up to the desk nick nicholson was standing washing his hands in invisible soap and looking helpful all set everything loaded on the train green island been told okay then wheres that sidekick of yours that man travis havent seen him around today nick nicholson looked serious he got an abscess ia his tooth sir real bad had to send him in to sav la mar to have it out hell be okay by this afternoon too bad dock him half a days pay no room for sleepers on this outfit were shorthanded as it is should have had his choppers attended to before he took the job on okay very good mr scaramanga ill tell him scaramanga turned to the waiting group okay fellows heres the picture we drive a mile down the road to the station we get aboard this little train quite an outfit that fellow by the name of lucius beebe had it copied for the thunderbird company from the engine and rolling stock on the little old denver south park and pacific line okay so we steam along this old canefield line about twenty miles to green island harbour plenty birds bush rats crocs in the rivers maybe we get a little hunting have some fun with the hardware all you guys got your guns with you fine fine champagne lunch at green island and the girls and the musicll be there to keep us happy after lunch we get aboard the thunder bird big chriscraft and take a cruise along to lucea thats a little township up the coast and see if we can catch our dinner those that dont want to fish can play stud right then back here for drinks okay everyone satisfied any suggestions then lets go bond was told to get in the back of the car they set off once again that offered neck crazy not to take him now but it was open country with no cover and there were five guns riding behind the odds simply werent good enough what was the plan for his removal during the hunting presumably james bond smiled grimly to himself he was feeling happy he wouldnt have been able to explain the emotion it was a feeling of being keyed up wound taut it was the moment after twenty passes when you got a hand you could bet onnot necessarily win but bet on he had been after this man for over six weeks today this morning perhaps was to come the payoff he had been ordered to bring about it was win or lose the odds foreknowledge was playing for him he was more heavily forearmed than the enemy knew but the enemy had the big battalions on their side there were more of them and taking only scaramanga perhaps more talent weapons again leaving out the others scaramanga had the advantage the longbarrelled colt would be a fraction slower on the draw but its length of barrel would give it more accuracy than the walther automatic rate of fire the walther should have the edgeand the first empty chamber of scaramangas gun if it hadnt been discovered would be an additional bonus the steady hand the cool brain the sharpness of the lust to kill how did they weigh up probably nothing to choose on the first two bond might be a shade triggerhappyof necessity that he must watch he must damp down the fire in his belly get icecold in the lust to kill perhaps he was the strongest of course he was fighting for his life the other man was just amusing himselfproviding sport for his friends displaying his potency showing off that was good that might be decisive bond said to himself that he must increase the other mans unawareness his casual certitude his lack of caution he must be the p g wodehouse englishman the limey of the cartoons he must play easy to take the adrenalin coursed into james bonds bloodstream his pulse rate began to run a fraction high he felt it on his wrist he breathed deeply and slowly to bring it down he found that he was sitting forward tensed he sat back and tried to relax all of his body relaxed except his right hand this was in the control of someone else resting on his right thigh it still twitched slightly from time to time like the paw of a sleeping dog chasing rabbits he put it into his coat pocket and watched a turkey buzzard a thousand feet up circling he put himself into the mind of the john crow watching out for a squashed toad or a dead bush rat the circling buzzard had found its offal it came lower and lower bond wished it bon appetit the predator in him wished the scavenger a good meal he smiled at the comparison between them they were both following a scent the main difference was that the john crow was a protected bird no one would shoot back at it when it made its final dive amused by his thoughts bonds right hand came out of his pocket and lit a cigarette for him quietly and obediently it had stopped going off chasing rabbits on its own the station was a brilliant mockup from the colorado narrowgauge eraa low building in faded clapboard ornamented with gingerbread along its eaves its name thunderbird halt was in oldstyle ornamental type heavily seriffed advertisements proclaimed chew roseleaf fine cut warranted finest virginia leaf trains stop for all meals no checks accepted the engine gleaming in black and yellow varnish and polished brass was a gem it stood panting quietly in the sunshine a wisp of black smoke curling up from the tall stack behind the big brass headlight the engines name the belle was on a proud brass plate on the gleaming black barrel and its number no on a similar plate below the headlight there was one carriage an open affair with padded foamrubber seats and a surrey roof of daffodilyellow fringed canvas to keep off the sun and then the brake van also in black and yellow with a resplendent giltarmed chair behind the conventional wheel of the brake it was a wonderful toy even down to the oldfashioned whistle which now gave a sharp admonitory blast scaramanga was in ebullient form hear the train blow folks all aboard there was an anticlimax to bonds dismay he took out his golden pistol pointed it at the sky and pressed the trigger he hesitated only momentarily and fired again the deep boom echoed back from the wall of the station and the stationmaster resplendent in oldfashioned uniform looked nervous he pocketed the big silver turnip watch he had been holding and stood back obsequiously the green flag now drooping at his side scaramanga checked his gun he looked thoughtfully at bond and said all right my friend now then you get up front with the driver bond smiled happily thanks ive always wanted to do that since i was a child what fun you said it said scaramanga he turned to the others and you mr hendriks in the first seat behind the coaltender please then sam and leroy then hal and louie ill be up back in the brake van good place to watch out for game okay everybody took their seats the stationmaster had recovered his nerve and went through his ploy with the watch and the flag the engine gave a triumphant hoot and with a series of diminishing puffs got under way and they bowled off along the threefoot gauge line that disappeared as straight as an arrow into a dancing shimmer of silver bond read the speed gauge it said twenty for the first tune he paid attention to the driver he was a villainouslooking rastafari in dirty khaki overalls with a sweat rag round his forehead a cigarette drooped from between the thin moustache and the straggling beard he smelled quite horrible bond said my names mark hazard whats yours rass man ah doan talk wid buckra the expression rass is jamaican for shove it buckra is a tough colloquialism for white man bond said equably i thought part of your religion was to love thy neighbour the rasta gave the whistle lanyard a long pull when the shriek had died away he simply said sheeit kicked the furnace door open and began shovelling coal bond looked surreptitiously round the cabin yes there it was the long jamaican cutlass this one filed to an inch blade with a deadly point it was on a rack by the mans hand was this the way he was supposed to go bond doubted it scaramanga would do the deed in a suitably dramatic fashion and one that could give him an alibi second executioner would be hendriks bond looked back over the low coaltender hendriks eyes bland and indifferent met his bond shouted above the iron clang of the engine great fun what hendriks eyes looked away and back again bond stooped so that he could see under the surrey roof all the other four men were sitting motionless their eyes also fixed on bond bond waved a cheerful hand there was no response so they had been told bond was a spy in their midst and this was his last ride in mobese he was going to be hit it was an uncomfortable feeling having those ten enemy eyes watching him like ten gun barrels bond straightened himself now the top half of his body like the iron man in a pistol range was above the roof of the surrey and he was looking straight down the flat yellow surface to where scaramanga sat on his solitary throne perhaps twenty feet away with all his body in full view he also was looking down the little train at bondthe last mourner in the funeral cortege behind the cadaver that was james bond bond waved a cheery hand and turned back he opened his coat and got a moments reassurance from the cool butt of his gun he felt in his trouser pocket three spare magazines ah well hed take as many of them as he could with him he flipped down the codrivers seat and sat on it no point in offering a target until he had to the rasta flicked his cigarette over the side and lit another the engine was driving herself he leant against the cabin wall and looked at nothing bond had done his homework on the overseas survey map that mary had provided and he knew exactly the route the little cane line took first there would be five miles of the cane fields between whose high green walls they were now travelling then came middle river followed by the vast expanse of swamplands now being slowly reclaimed but still shown on the map as the great morass then would come orange river leading into orange bay and then more sugar and mixed forest and agricultural smallholdings until they came to the little hamlet of green island at the head of the excellent anchorage of green island harbour a hundred yards ahead a turkey buzzard rose from beside the line and after a few heavy flaps caught the inshore breeze and soared up and away there came the boom of scaramangas gun a feather drifted down from the great righthand wing of the big bird the turkey buzzard swerved and soared higher a second shot rang out the bird gave a jerk and began to tumble untidily down out of the sky it jerked again as a third bullet hit it before it crashed into the cane there was applause from under the yellow roof bond leant out and called to scaramanga thatll cost you five pounds unless youve squared the rasta thats the fine for killing a john crow a shot whistled past bonds head scarmanga laughed sorry thought i saw a rat and then come on mr hazard lets see some gun play from you theres some cattle grazing by the line up there see if you can hit a cow at ten paces the hoods guffawed bond put his head out again scaramangas gun was on his lap out of the corner of his eye he saw that mr hendriks perhaps ten feet behind him had his right hand in his coat pocket bond called i never shoot game that i dont eat if youll eat the whole cow ill shoot it for you the gun flashed and boomed as bond jerked his head under cover of the coaltender scaramanga laughed harshly watch your lip limey or youll end up without it the hoods hawhawed beside bond the rasta gave a curse he pulled hard on the whistle lanyard bond looked down the line far ahead across the rails something pink showed without releasing the whistler the driver pulled on a lever steam belched from the trains exhaust and the engine began to slow two shots rang out and the bullets clanged against the iron roof over his head scaramanga shouted angrily keep steam up damn you to hell the rasta quickly pushed up the lever and the speed of the train gathered back to twenty miles an hour he shrugged he glanced at bond he licked his lips wetly deres white trash across de line guess mebbe its some frien of de boss bond strained his eyes yes it was a naked pink body with golden blonde hair a girls body scaramangas voice boomed against the wind folks just a little surprise for you all something from the good old western movies theres a girl on the line ahead tied across it take a look and you know what its the girl friend of a certain man weve been hearing of called james bond would you believe it and her names goodnight mary goodnight it sure is good night for her if only that fellow bond was aboard now i guess wed be hearing him holler for mercy the great morass james bond leaped for the accelerator lever and tore it downwards the engine lost a head of steam but there was only a hundred yards to go now the only thing that could save the girl were the brakes under scaramangas control in the brake van the rasta already had his cutlass in his hand the flames from the furnace glinted on the blade he stood back like a cornered animal his eyes red with ganja and fear of the gun in bonds hand nothing could save the girl now bond knowing that scaramanga would expect him from the right side of the tender leaped to the left hendriks had his gun out before it could swivel bond put a bullet between the mans cold eyes the head jerked back for an instant steelcapped back teeth showed in the gaping mouth then the grey homburg fell off and the dead head slumped the golden gun boomed twice a bullet whanged round the cabin the rasta screamed and fell to the ground clutching at his throat his hand was still clenched round the whistle lanyard and the little train kept up its mournful howl of warning fifty yards to go the golden hair hung forlornly forward obscuring the face the ropes on the wrists and ankles showed clearly the breasts offered themselves to the screaming engine bond ground his teeth and shut his mind to the dreadful impact that would come any minute now he leaped to the left again and got off three shots he thought two of them had hit but then something slammed a great blow into the muscle of his left shoulder and he spun across the cab and crashed to the iron floor his face over the edge of the footplate and it was from there only inches away that he saw the front wheels scrunch through the body on the line saw the blonde head severed from the body saw the chinablue eyes give him a last blank stare saw the fragments of the showroom dummy disintegrate with a sharp crackling of plastic and the pink splinters shower down the embankment james bond choked back the sickness that rose from his stomach into the back of his throat he staggered to his feet keeping low he reached up for the accelerator lever and pushed it upwards a pitched battle with the train at a standstill would put the odds even more against him he hardly felt the pain in his shoulder he edged round the rightband side of the tender four guns boomed he flung his head back under cover now the hoods were shooting but wildly because of the interference of the surrey top but bond had had time to see one glorious sight in the brake van scaramanga had slid from his throne and was down on his knees his head moving to and fro like a wounded animal where in hell had bond hit him and now what how was he going to deal with the four hoods just as badly obscured from him as he was from them then a voice from the back of the trainit could only be from the brake vanfelix leiters voicecalled out above the shriek of the engines whistle okay you four guys toss your guns over the side now quick there came the crack of a shot i said quick theres mr gengerella gone to meet his maker okay then and now hands behind your heads thats better right okay james the battles over are you okay if so show yourself theres still the final curtain and weve got to move quick bond rose carefully he could hardly believe it leiter must have been riding on the buffers behind the brake van he wouldnt have been able to show himself earlier for fear of bonds gunfire yes there he was his fair hair tousled by the wind a longbarrelled pistol using his upraised steel hook as a rest standing astride the now supine body of scaramanga beside the brake wheel bonds shoulder had begun to hurt like hell he shouted with the anger of tremendous relief goddamn you leiter why in hell didnt you show up before i might have got hurt leiter laughed thatll be the day now listen shamus get ready to jump the longer you wait the farther youve got to walk home im going to stay with these guys for a while and hand them over to the law in green island he shook his head to show this was a lie now get goin its the morass the landingll be soft stinks a bit but well give you an eaudecologne spray when you get home right the train ran over a small culvert and the song of the wheels changed to a deep boom bond looked ahead in the distance was the spidery ironwork of the orange river bridge the still shrieking tram was losing steam the gauge said nineteen miles per hour bond looked down at the dead rasta in death his face was as horrible as it had been in me the bad teeth sharpened from eating sugar cane from childhood were bared in a frozen snarl bond took a quick glance under the surrey roof hendriks slumped body lolled with the movement of the tram the sweat of the day still shone on the doughy cheeks even as a corpse he didnt ask for sympathy in the seat behind him leiters bullet had torn through the back of gengerellas head and removed most of his face the three gangsters now gazed up at james bond with whipped eyes they hadnt expected all this this was to have been a holiday the calypso shirts said so scaramanga the undefeated the undefeatable had said so until minutes before his golden gun had backed up his word now suddenly everything was different as the arabs say when a great sheikh has gone has removed his protection now there is no more shade they were covered with guns from the front and the rear the train stretched out its iron stride towards nowhere they had ever heard of before the whistle moaned the sun beat down the dreadful stink of the great morass assailed their nostrils this was abroad this was bad news really bad the tour director had left them to fend for themselves two of them had been killed even their guns were gone the tough faces as white moons gazed in supplication up at bond louie paradises voice was cracked and dry with terror a million bucks mister if you get us out of this swear on my mother a million the faces of sam binion and hal garfinkel lit up here was hope and a million and another on my baby sons head the voice of felix leiter bellowed angrily there was a note of panic in it jump damn you james jump james bond stood up in the cabin not listening to the voices supplicating from under the yellow surrey roof these men had wanted to watch him being murdered they had been prepared to murder him themselves how many dead men had each one of them got on his tally sheet bond got down on the step of the cabin chose his moment and threw himself clear of the clinker track and into the soft embraces of a stinking mangrove pool his explosion into the mud released the stench of hell great bubbles of marsh gas wobbled up to the surface and burst glutinously a bird screeched and clattered off through the foliage james bond waded out onto the edge of the embankment now his shoulder was really hurting he knelt down and was as sick as a cat when he raised his head it was to see leiter hurl himself off the brake van now a good two hundred yards away he seemed to land clumsily he didnt get up and now within yards of the long iron bridge over the sluggish river another figure leaped from the train into a clump o mangrove it was a tall chocolateclad figure there was no doubt about it it was scaramanga bond cursed feebly why in hell hadnt leiter put a finishing bullet through the mans head now there was unfinished business the cards had only been reshuffled the end game had still to be played the screaming progress of the driverless train changed to a roar as the track took to the trestles of the long bridge bond watched it vaguely wondering when it would run out of steam what would tie three gangsters do now take to the hills get the train under control and go on to green harbour and try and take the thunder bird across to cuba immediately the answer came halfway across the bridge the engine suddenly reared up like a bucking stallion at the same time there came a crash of thunder and a vast sheet of flame and the bridge buckled downwards in the centre like a bent leg chunks of torn iron sprayed upwards and sideways and there was a splintering crash as the main stanchions gave and slowly bowed down towards the water through the jagged gap the beautiful belle a smashed toy folded upon itself and with a giant splintering of iron and woodwork and a volcano of spray and steam thundered into the river a deafening silence fell somewhere behind bond a wakened tree frog tinkled uncertainly four white egrets flew down and over the wreck their necks outstretched inquisitively in the distance black dots materialized high up in the sky and circled lazily closer the sixth sense of the turkey buzzards had told them that the distant explosion was disastersomething that might yield a meal the sun hammered down on the silver rails and a few yards away from where bond lay a group of yellow butterflies danced in the shimmer bond got slowly to his feet and parting the butterflies began walking slowly but purposefully up the line towards the bridge first felix leiter and then after the big one that had got away leiter lay in the stinking mud his left leg was at a hideous angle bond went down to him his finger to his lips he knelt beside him and said softly nothing much i can do for now pal ill give you a bullet to bite on and get you into some shade therell be people coming before long got to get on after that bastard hes somewhere up there by the bridge what made you think he was dead leiter groaned more in anger with himself than from the pain there was blood all over the place the voice was a halting whisper between clenched teeth his shirt was soaked in it eyes closed thought if he wasnt cold hed go with the others on the bridge he smiled faintly how did you dig the river kwai stunt go off all right bond raised a thumb fourth of july the crocsll be sitting down to table right now but that damned dummy gave me a nasty turn did you put her there sure sorry boy mr s told me to made an excuse to spike the bridge this morning no idea your girl friend was a blonde or that youd fall for the spiel bloody silly of me i suppose thought hed got hold of her last night anyway come on heres your bullet bite the lead the storybooks say it helps this is going to hurt but i must haul you under cover and out of the sun bond got his hands under leiters armpits and as gently as he could dragged him to a dry patch under a big mangrove bush above swamp level the sweat of pain poured down leiters face bond propped him up against the roots leiter gave a groan and his head fell back bond looked thoughtfully down at him a faint was probably the best thing that could have happened he took leiters gun out of his waistband and put it beside his left and only hand bond still might get into much trouble if he did scaramanga would come after felix bond crept off along the line of mangroves towards the bridge for the time being he would have to keep more or less in the open he prayed that nearer the river the swamp would yield to drier land so that he could work down towards the sea and then cut back towards the river and hope to pick up the mans tracks it was one oclock and the sun was high james bond was tired and very thirsty and his shoulder wound throbbed with his pulse the wound was beginning to give him a fever one dreams all day as well as all night and now as he stalked his prey he found quizzically that much of his mind was taken up with visualizing the champagne buffet waiting for them all the living and the dead at green island for the moment he indulged himself the buffet would be laid out under the trees as he saw it adjoining the terminal station which would probably be on the same lines as thunderbird halt there would be long trestle tables spotless tablecloths rows of glasses and plates and cutlery and great dishes of cold lobster salad cold meat cuts and mounds of fruitpineapple and such to make the decor look jamaican and exotic there might be a hot dish he thought something like roast stuffed suckingpig with rice and peastoo hot for the day decided bond but a feast for most of green island when the rich tourists had departed and there would be drink champagne in frosted silver coolers rum punches tom collinses whisky sours and of course great beakers of iced water that would only have been poured when the train whistled its approach to the gay little station bond could see it all every detail of it under the shade of the great ficus trees the whitegloved uniformed coloured waiters enticing him to take more and more beyond the dancing waters of the harbour in the background the hypnotic throb of the calypso band the soft enticing eyes of the girls and ruling ordering all the tall fine figure of the gracious host a thin cigar between his teeth the wide white stetson tilted low over his brow offering bond just one more goblet of iced champagne james bond stumbled over a mangrove root threw out his right hand for support from the bush missed tripped again and fell heavily he lay for a moment measuring the noise he must have made it wouldnt have been much the inshore wind from the sea was feathering the swamp a hundred yards away the river added its undertone of sluggish turbulence there were cricket and bird noises bond got to his knees and then to his feet what in hell had he been thinking of come on you bloody fool theres work to be done he shook his head to clear it gracious host goddamn it he was on his way to kill the gracious host goblets of iced champagne thatd be the day he shook his head angrily he took several very deep slow breaths he knew the symptoms this was nothing worse than acute nervous exhaustion withhe gave himself that amount of gracea small fever added all he had to do was to keep his mind and his eyes in focus for gods sake no more daydreaming with a new sharpened resolve he kicked the mirages out of his mind and looked to his geography there were perhaps a hundred yards to go to the bridge on bonds left the mangroves were sparser and the black mud was dry and cracked but there were still soft patches bond put up the collar of his coat to hide the white shirt he covered another twenty yards beside the rail and then struck off left into the mangroves he found that if he kept close to the roots of the mangroves the going wasnt too bad at least there were no dry twigs or leaves to crack and rustle he tried to keep as nearly as possible parallel with the river but thick patches of bushes made him make small detours and he had to estimate his direction by the dryness of the mud and the slight rise of the land towards the riverbank his ears weie pricked like an animals for the smallest sound his eyes strained into the greenery ahead now the mud was pitted with burrows of land crabs and there were occasional remnants of their shells victims of big birds or mongoose for the first time mosquitoes and sandflies began to attack him fearing the noise he dared only to dab at them softly with his handkerchief that was soon soaked with the blood they had sucked from him and wringing with the white mans sweat that attracted them bond estimated that he had penetrated two hundred yards into the swamp when he heard the single controlled cough crabmeat the cough sounded about twenty yards away towards the river bond dropped to one knee his senses questing like the antennae of an insect he waited five minutes when the cough was not repeated he crept forwards on hands and knees his gun gripped between his teeth in a small clearing of dried cracked black mud he saw the man he stopped in his tracks trying to calm his breathing scaramanga was lying stretched out his back supported by a clump of sprawling mangrove roots his hat and his high stock had gone and the whole of the righthand side of his suit was black with blood upon which insects crawled and feasted but the eyes in the controlled face were still very much alive they swept the clearing at regular intervals questing scaramangas hands rested on the roots beside him there was no sign of a gun scaramangas face suddenly pointed like a retrievers and the roving scrutiny held steady bond could not see what had caught his attention but then a patch of the dappled shadow at the edge of the clearing moved and a large snake beautifully diamonded in dark and pale brown zigzagged purposefully across the black mud towards the man bond watched fascinated he guessed it was a boa of the epicrates family attracted by the smell of blood it was perhaps five feet long and quite harmless to man bond wondered if scaramanga would know this he was immediately put out of his doubt scaramangas expression had not changed but his right hand crept softly down his trouser leg gently pulled up the cuff and removed a thin stilettostyle knife from the side of his short texan boot then he waited the knife held ready across his stomach not clenched in his fist but pointed in the flickknife fashion the snake paused for a moment a few yards from the man and raised its head high to give him a final inspection the forked tongue licked out inquisitively again and again then still with its head held above the ground it moved slowly forward not a muscle moved in scaramangas face only the eyes were deadsteady watchful slits the snake came into the shadow of his trouser leg and moved slowly up towards the glistening shirt suddenly the tongue of steel that lay across scaramangas stomach came to life and leaped it transfixed the head of the snake exactly in the centre of the brain and pierced through it pinning it to the ground and holding it there while the powerful body thrashed wildly seeking a grip on the mangrove roots on scaramangas arm but immediately when it had a grip its convulsions released its coils which flailed off in another direction the death struggles diminished and finally ceased altogether the snake lay motionless scaramanga was careful he ran his hand down the full length of the snake only the tip of the tail lashed briefly scaramanga extracted the knife from the head of the snake cut off its head with a single hard stroke and threw it after reflection accurately towards a crab hole he waited watching to see if a crab would come out and take it none did the thud of the arrival of the snakes head would have kept any crab underground for many minutes however enticing the scent of what had made the thud james bond kneeling in the bush watched all this every nuance of it with the most careful attention each one of scaramangas actions every fleeting expression on his face had been an index of the mans awareness of his aliveness the whole episode of the snake was as revealing as a temperature chart or a lie detector in bonds judgment scaramanga for all his bloodletting and internal injuries was still very much alive he was still a most formidable and dangerous man scaramanga his task satisfactorily completed minutely shifted his position and once again made his penetrating examination of the surrounding bush as scaramangas gaze swept by him without a flicker bond blessed the darkness of his suita black patch of shadow among so many others in the sharp blacks and whites from the midday sun bond was well camouflaged satisfied scaramanga picked up the limp body of the snake laid it across his stomach and carefully slit it down its underside as far as the anal vent then he scoured it and carefully etched the skin away from the redveined flesh with the precise flicks and cuts of a surgeon every scrap of unwanted reptile he threw towards crab holes and with each throw a flicker of annoyance crossed the granite face that no one would come and pick up the crumbs from the rich mans table when the meal was ready he once again scanned the bush and then very carefully coughed and spat into his hand he examined the results and flung his hand sideways on the black ground the sputum made a bright pink scrawl the cough didnt seem to hurt him or cause him much effort bond guessed that his bullet had hit scaramanga in the right chest and had missed a lung by a fraction there was haemorrhage and scaramanga was a hospital case but the bloodsoaked shirt was not telling the whole truth satisfied with his inspection of his surroundings scaramanga bit into the body of the snake and was at once like a dog with its meal absorbed by his hunger and thirst for the blood and juices of the snake bond had the impression that if he now came forward from his hiding place scaramanga like a dog would bare his teeth in a furious snarl he got quietly up from his knees took out his gun and his eyes watching scaramangas hands strolled out into the centre of the little clearing bond was mistaken scaramanga did not snarl he barely looked up from the cutoff length of snake in his two hands and his mouth full of meat said youve been a long while coming care to share my meal no thanks i prefer my snake grilled with hot butter sauce just keep on eating i like to see both hands occupied scaramanga sneered he gestured at his bloodstained shirt frightened of a dying man you limeys come pretty soft the dying man handled that snake quite efficiently got any more weapons on you scaramanga moved to undo his coat steady no quick movements just show your belt armpits pat the thighs inside and out id do it myself only i dont want what the snake got and while youre about it just toss the knife into the trees toss no throwing if you dont mind my trigger fingers been getting a bit edgy today seems to want to go about its business on its own wouldnt like it to take over yet that is scaramanga with a flick of his wrist tossed the knife into the air the sliver of steel spun like a wheel in the sunshine bond had to step aside the knife pierced the mud where bond had been standing and stood upright scaramanga gave a harsh laugh the laugh turned into a cough the gaunt face contorted painfully too painfully scaramanga spat red but not all that red there could be only slight haemorrhage perhaps a broken rib or two scaramanga could be out of hospital in a couple of weeks scaramanga put down his piece of snake and did exactly as bond had told him all the while watching bonds face with his usual cold arrogant stare he finished and picked up the piece of snake and began gnawing it he looked up satisfied sufficiently bond squatted down on his heels he held his gun loosely aiming somewhere halfway between the two of them now then lets talk afraid you havent got too much time scaramanga this is the end of the road youve killed too many of my friends i have the licence to kill you and i am going to kill you but ill make it quick not like margesson remember him you put a shot through both of his knees and both of his elbows then you made him crawl and kiss your boots you were foolish enough to boast about it to your friends in cuba it got back to us as a matter of interest how many men have you killed in your life with you itll make the round fifty scaramanga had gnawed the last segment of backbone clean he tossed it towards bond eat that scum and get on

your back in the sacksewing department and by the same token how dyou know about rotkopf your bug was bugged seems youre a bit accidentprone these days scaramanga you hired the wrong security men both your managers were from the cia the tapell be on the way to washington by now thats got the murder of ross on it too see what i mean youve got it coming from every which way tape isnt evidence in an american court but i see what you mean shamus mistakes seem to have got made so okay scaramanga made an expansive gesture of the right handtake a million bucks and call it quits i was offered three million on the train ill double that no sorry bond got to his feet the left hand behind his back was clenched with the horror of what he was about to do he forced himself to think of what the broken body of margesson must have looked like of the others that this man had killed of the ones he would kill afresh if bond weakened this man was probably the most efficient oneman deathdealer in the world james bond had him he had been instructed to take him he must take him lying down wounded or in any other position bond assumed casualness tried to make himself the enemys cold equal any messages for anyone scaramanga any instructions anyone you want looking after ill take care of it if its personal ill keep it to myself scaramanga laughed his harsh laugh but carefully this tune the laugh didnt turn into the red cough quite the little english gentleman just like i spelled it out spose you wouldnt like to hand me your gun and leave me to myself for five minutes like in the books well youre right boyo id crawl after you and blast the back of your head off the eyes still bored into bonds with the arrogant superiority the cold superman quality that had made him the greatest pro gunman in the worldno drinks no drugsthe impersonal trigger man who killed for money and by the way he sometimes did it for the kicks bond examined him carefully how could scaramanga fail to break when he was going to die in minutes was there some last trick the man was going to spring some hidden weapon but the man just lay there apparently relaxed propped up against the mangrove roots his chest heaving rhythmicallv the granite of his face not crumbling even minutely in defeat on his forehead there was not as much sweat as there was on bonds scaramanga lay in dappled black shadow for ten minutes james bond had stood in the middle of the clearing in blazing sunshine suddenly he felt the vitality oozing out through his feet into the black mud and his resolve was going with it he said and he heard his voice ring out harshly all right scaramanga this is it he lifted his gun and held it in the twohanded grip of the target man im going to make it as quick as i can scaramanga held up a hand for the first time his face showed emotion okay fella the voice amazingly supplicated im a catholic see just let me say my last prayer okay wont take long then you can blaze away every mans got to die sometime youre a fine guy as guys go its the luck of the game if my bullet had been an inch maybe two inches to the right itd be you thats dead in place of me right can i say my prayer mister james bond lowered his gun he would give the man a few minutes he knew he couldnt give him more pain and heat and exhaustion and thirst it wouldnt be long before he lay down himself right there on the hard cracked mud just to rest if someone wanted to kill him they could he said and the words came out slowly tiredly go ahead scaramanga one minute only thanks pal scaramangas hands went up to his face and covered his eyes there came a drone of lathi which went on and on bond stood there in the sunshine his gun lowered watching scaramanga but at the same tune not watching him the edge of his focus dulled by the pain and the heat and the hypnotic litany that came from behind the shuttered face and the horror of what bond was going to have to doin one minute perhaps two the fingers of scaramangas right hand crawled imperceptibly sideways across his face inch by inch centimetre by centimetre they got to his ear and stopped the drone of the lathi prayer never altered its slow lulling tempo and then the hand leaped behind the head and the tiny golden derringer roared and james bond spun round as if he had taken a right to the jaw and crashed to the ground at once scaramanga was on his feet and moving forward like a swift cat he snatched up the discarded knife and held it forward like a tongue of silver flame but james bond twisted like a dying animal on the ground and the iron in his hand cracked viciously again and againfive timesand then fell out of his hand onto the black earth as his gun hand went to the right side of his belly and stayed there clutching at the terrible pain the big man stood for a moment and looked up at the deep blue sky his fingers opened in a spasm and let go the knife his pierced heart stuttered and limped and stopped he crashed flat back and lay his arms flung wide as if someone had thrown him away after a while the land crabs came out of their holes and began nosing at the scraps of the snake the bigger offal could wait until the night the wrapup the extremely smart policeman from the wrecking squad on the railway came down the riverbank at the normal dignified gait of a jamaican constable on his beat no jamaican policeman ever breaks into a run he has been taught that this lacks authority felix leiter now put under with morphine by the doctor had said that a good man was after a bad man in the swamp and that there might be shooting felix leiter wasnt more explicit than that but when he said he was from the fbia legitimate euphemismin washington the policeman tried to get some of the wrecking squad to come with him and when he failed sauntered cautiously off on his own his baton swinging with assumed jauntiness the boom of the guns and the explosion of screeching marsh birds gave him an approximate fix he had been born not far away at negril and as a boy he had often used his gins and his slingshot in these marshes they held no fears for him when he came to the approximate point on the riverbank he turned left into the mangrove and conscious that his blackandblue uniform was desperately conspicuous stalked cautiously from clump to clump into the morass he was protected by nothing but his nightstick and the knowledge that to kill a policeman was a capital offence without the option he only hoped that the good man and the bad man knew this too with all the birds gone there was dead silence the constable noticed that the tracks of bush rats and other small animals were running past him on a course that converged with his target area then he heard the rattling scuttle of the crabs and in a moment from behind a thick mangrove clump he saw the glint of scaramangas shirt he watched and listened there was no movement and no sound he strolled with dignity into the middle of the clearing looked at the two bodies and the guns and took out his nickel police whistle and blew three long blasts then he sat down in the shade of a bush took out his report pad licked his pencil and began writing in a laborious hand a week later james bond regained consciousness he was in a greenshaded room he was under water the slowly revolving fan in the ceiling was the screw of a ship that was about to run him down he swam for his life but it was no good he was tied down anchored to the bottom of the sea he screamed at the top of his lungs to the nurse at the end of the bed it was the whisper of a moan at once she was beside him she put a cool hand on his forehead while she took his pulse james bond looked up at her with unfocused eyes so this was what a mermaid looked like he muttered youre pretty and gratefully swam back down into her arms the nurse wrote ninetyfive on his sheet and telephoned down to the ward sister she looked in the dim mirror and tidied her hair in preparation for the rmo in charge of this apparently very important patient the resident medical officer a young jamaican graduate from edinburgh arrived with the matron a kindly dragon on loan from king edward viis he heard the nurses report he went over to the bed and gently lifted bonds eyelids he slipped a thermometer under bonds armpit and held bonds pulse in one hand and a pocket chronometer in the other and there was silence in the little room outside the traffic tore up and down a kingston road the doctor released bonds pulse and slipped the chronometer back into the trouser pocket under the white smock he wrote figures on the chart the nurse held the door open and the three people went out into the corridor the doctor talked to the matron the nurse was allowed to listen hes going to be all right temperature well down pulse a little fast but that may have been the result of his waking reduce the antibiotics ill talk to the floor sister about that later keep on with the intravenous feeding dr macdonald will be up later to attend to the dressings hell be waking again if he asks for something to drink give him fruit juice he should be on soft foods soon miracle really missed the abdominal viscera didnt even shave a kidney muscle only that bullet was dipped in enough poison to kill a horse thank god that man at sav la mar recognized the symptoms of snake venom and gave him those massive antisnakebite injections remind me to write to him matron he saved the mans life now then no visitors of course for at least another week you can tell the police and the high commissioners office that hes on the mend i dont know who he is but apparently london keeps on worrying us about him something to do with the ministry of defence from now on put them and all other inquiries through to the high commissioners office they seem to think theyre in charge of him he paused by the way hows his friend getting on in number twelve the one the american ambassador and washington have been on about hes not on my list but he keeps on asking to see this mr bond compound fracture of the tibia said the matron no complications she smiled except that hes a bit fresh with the nurses he should be walking with a stick in ten days hes already seen the police i suppose its all to do with that story in the gleaner about those american tourists being killed when the orange river bridge collapsed but the commissioners handling it all personally the story in the gleaners very vague the doctor smiled nobody tells me anything just as well i havent got the tune to listen to them well thank you matron i must get along multiple crash at halfway tree the ambulancesll be here any minute he hurried away the matron went about her business the nurse excited by all this highlevel talk went softly back into the greenshaded room tidied the sheet over the naked right shoulder of her patient where the doctor had pulled it down and went back to her chair at the end of the bed and her copy of ebony ten days later the little room was crowded james bond propped up among extra pillows was amused by the galaxy of officialdom that had been assembled on his left was the commissioner of police resplendent in his black uniform with silver insignia on his right was a justice of the supreme court in full regalia accompanied by a deferential clerk a massive figure to whom felix leiter on crutches was fairly respectful had been introduced as colonel bannister from washington head of station c a quiet civil servant called alec hill who had been flown out from london stood near the door and kept his appraising eyes unwaveringly on bond mary goodnight who was to take notes of the proceedings but also on the matrons strict instructions watch for any sign of fatigue in james bond and have absolute authority to close the meeting if he showed strain sat demurely beside the bed with a shorthand pad on her knees but james bond felt no strain he was delighted to see all these people and know that at last he was back in the great world again the only matters that worried him were that he had not been allowed to see felix leiter before the meeting to agree their stories and that he had been rather curtly advised by the high commissioners office that legal representation would not be necessary the police commissioner cleared his throat he said commander bond our meeting here today is largely a formality but it is held on the prime ministers instructions and with your doctors approval there are many rumours running around the island and abroad and sir alexander bustamante is most anxious to have them dispelled for the sake of justice and of the islands good name so this meeting is in the nature of a judicial inquiry having prime ministerial status we very much hope that if the conclusions of the meeting are satisfactory there need be no more legal proceedings whatever you understand yes said bondwho didnt now the commissioner spoke weightily the facts as ascertained are as follows recently there took place at the thunderbird hotel in the parish of westmoreland a meeting of what can only be described as foreign gangsters of outstanding notoriety including representatives of the soviet secret service the mafia and the cuban secret police the objects of this meeting were inter alia sabotage of jamaican installations in the cane industry stimulation of illicit ganjagrowing in the island and purchase of the crop for export the bribery of a high jamaican official with the object of installing gangsterrun gambling in the island and sundry other malfeasances deleterious to law and order in jamaica and to her international standing am i correct commander yes said bond this tune with a clear conscience now the commissioner spoke with even greater emphasis the intentions of this subversive group became known to the criminal investigation department of the jamaican police and the facts of the proposed assembly were placed before the prime minister in person by myself naturally the greatest secrecy was observed a decision then had to be reached as to how this meeting was to be kept under surveillance and penetrated so that its intentions might be learned since friendly nations including britain and the united states were involved secret conversations took place with the representatives of the ministry of defence in britain and of the central intelligence agency in the united states as a result expert personnel in the shape of yourself mr nicholson and mr leiter were generously made available at no cost to the jamaican government to assist in unveiling these secret machinations against jamaica held on jamaican soil the commissioner paused and looked round the room to see if he had stated the position correctly bond noticed that felix leiter nodded his head vigorously with the others but in his case in bonds direction bond smiled he had at last got the message he also nodded his agreement accordingly continued the commissioner and working throughout under the closest liaison and direction of the jamaican cid messrs bond nicholson and leiter carried out their duties in exemplary fashion the true intentions of the gangsters were unveiled but alas in the process the identity of at least one of the jamaicacontrolled agents was discovered and a battle royal took place during the course of this thanks to the superior gunfire of commander bond the following enemy agents here there will be a listwere killed immediately after thanks to mr letters ingenious use of explosive on the orange river bridge the followinganother listlost their lives unfortunately two of the jamaicacontrolled agents received severe wounds from which they are now recovering in the memorial hospital it remains to mention the names of constable percival sampson of the negril constabulary who was first on the scene of the final battlefield and dr lister smith of savannah la mar who rendered vital first aid to commander bond and mr leiter on the instructions of the prune minister sir alexander bustamante a judicial inquiry was held this day at the bedside of commander bond and in the presence of mr felix leiter to confirm the above facts these in the presence of justice morris cargill of the supreme court are now and hereby confirmed the commissioner was obviously delighted with his rendering of all this rigmarole he beamed at bond it only remains he handed bond a sealed packet a similar one to felix leiter and one to colonel bannisterto confer on commander bond of great britain mr felix leiter of the united states and in absentia mr nicholas nicholson of the united states the immediate award of the jamaican police medal for gallant and meritorious services to the independent state of jamaica there was muted applause mary goodnight went on clapping after the others had stopped she suddenly realized the fact blushed furiously and stopped james bond and felix leiter made stammered acknowledgments justice cargill rose to his feet and in solemn tones asked bond and leiter in turn is this a true and correct account of what occurred between the given dates yes indeed said bond ill say it is your honour said felix leiter fervently the judge bowed all except bond rose and bowed bond just bowed in that case i declare this inquiry closed the bewigged figure turned to miss goodnight if you will be land enough to obtain all the signatures duly witnessed and send them round to my chambers thank you so much he paused and smiled and the carbon if you dont mind certainly my lord mary goodnight glanced at bond and now if you will forgive me i think the patient needs a rest matron was most insistent goodbyes were said bond called leiter back mary goodnight smelled private secrets she admonished now only a minute and went out and closed the door leiter leant over the end of the bed he wore his most quizzical smile he said well ill be goddamned james that was the neatest wrapup job ive ever lied my head off at everything clean as a whistle and weve even collected a piece of lettuce talking starts with the stomach muscles bonds wounds were beginning to ache he smiled not showing the pain leiter was due to leave that afternoon bond didnt want to say goodbye to him bond treasured his men friends and felix leiter was a great slice of his past he said scaramanga was quite a guy he should have been taken alive maybe tiffy really did put the hex on him with mother edna they dont come like that often leiter was unsympathetic thats the way you limeys talk about rommel and donitz and guderian let alone napoleon once youve beaten them you make heroes out of them dont make sense to me in my book an enemys an enemy care to have scaramanga back now in this room with his famous golden gun on youthe long one or the short one standing where i am one bets you a thousand you wouldnt dont be a jerk james you did a good job pest control its got to be done by someone going back to it when youre off the orange juice felix leiter jeered at him of course you are lamebrain its what you were put into the world for pest control like i said all you got to figure is how to control it better the pestsll always be there god made dogs he also made their fleas dont let it worry your tiny mind right leiter had seen the sweat on james bonds forehead he limped towards the door and opened it he raised a hand briefly the two men had never shaken hands in their lives leiter looked into the corridor he said okay miss goodnight tell matron to take him off the danger list and tell him to keep away from me for a week or two every time i see him a piece of me gets broken off i dont fancy myself as the vanishing man again he raised his only hand in bonds direction and limped out bond shouted wait you bastard but by the time leiter had limped back into the room bond no effort left in him to fire off the volley of fourletter words that were to be his only answer to his friend had lapsed into unconsciousness mary goodnight shooed the remorseful leiter out of the room and ran off down the corridor to the floor sister endit a week later james bond was sitting up in a chair a towel round his waist reading allen dulles the craft of intelligence and cursing his fate the hospital had worked miracles on him the nurses were sweet particularly the one he called the mermaid but he wanted to be off and away he glanced at his watch four oclock visiting tune mary goodnight would soon be here and he would be able to let off his pentup steam on her unjust perhaps but he had already tonguelashed everyone in range in the hospital and if she got into the field of fire that was just too bad mary goodnight came through the door despite the jamaican heat she was looking fresh as a rose damn her she was carrying what looked like a typewriter bond recognized it as the triplex decyphering machine now what bond grunted surly answers to her inquiries after his health he said what in hells that for its an eyes only personal from m she said excitedly about thirty groups thirty groups doesnt the old bastard know ive only got one arm thats working come on mary you get cracking if it sounds really hot ill take over mary goodnight looked shocked eyes only was a topsacred prefix but bonds jaw was jutting out dangerously today was not a day for argument she sat on the edge of the bed opened the machine and took a cable form out of her bag she laid her shorthand book beside the machine scratched the back of her head with her pencil to help work out the setting for the daya complicated sum involving the date and the hour of dispatch of the cableadjusted the setting on the central cylinder and began crankhag the handle after each completed word had appeared in the little oblong window at the base of the machine she recorded it in her book james bond watched her expression she was pleased after a few minutes she read out m personal for ohohseven eyes only stop your report and ditto from top friends received stop you have done well and executed aye difficult and hazardous operation to my entire repeat entire satisfaction stop trust your health unimpaired stop when will you be reporting for further duty query mary goodnight smiled delightedly ive never seen him be so complimentary have you james that repeat of entire its tremendous she looked hopefully for a lifting of the black clouds from bonds face in fact bond was secretly delighted he knew what mary couldnt knowthat m was telling him that he had won his spurs back but he certainly wasnt going to show his pleasure to mary goodnight today she was one of the wardresses confining him tying him down he said grudgingly not bad for the old man but all he wants is to get me back to that bloody desk anyway its a lot of jazz so far what comes next he turned the pages of his book pretending as the little machine whirred and clicked not to be interested oh james mary goodnight exploded with excitement wait im almost finished its tremendous i know commented bond sourly free luncheon vouchers every second friday key to ms personal lavatory new suit to replace the one thats somehow got full of holes but he kept his eyes fixed on the flitting fingers infected by mary goodnights excitement what in hell was she getting so steamed up about and all on his behalf he examined her with approval perched there immaculate in her white tussore shirt and tight beige skirt one neat foot curled round the other in concentration the golden face under the shortish fair hair incandescent with pleasure she was thought bond a girl to have around always as a secretary as what mary goodnight turned her eyes shining and the question went as it had gone for weeks without an answer now just listen to this james she shook the notebook at him and for heavens sake stop looking so curmudgeonly bond smiled at the word all right mary go ahead empty the christmas stocking on the floor hope its not going to bust any stitches he put his book down on his lap mary goodnights face became portentous she said seriously just listen to this she read very carefully in view of the outstanding nature of the services referred to above and their assistance to the allied cause comma which is perhaps more significant than you imagine comma the prime minister proposes to recommend to her majesty queen elizabeth the immediate grant of a knighthood stop this to take the form of the addition of a katie as prefix to your charlie michael george james bond uttered a defensive embarrassed laugh good old cypherines they wouldnt think of

james bond again hid himself behind the throwaway line why in hell does he always have to sign himself mailedfist for m theres a perfectly good english word em its a measure used by printers but of course its not dashing enough for the chief hes a romantic at heart like all the silly bastards who get mixed up with the service mary goodnight lowered her eyelashes she knew that bonds reflex concealed his pleasurea pleasure he wouldnt for the life of him have displayed who wouldnt be pleased proud she put on a businesslike expression well would you like me to draft something for you to send i can be back with it at six and i know theyll let me in i can check up the right sort of formula with the high commissioners staff i know it begins with i present my humble duty to her majesty ive had to help with the jamaica honours at new year and her birthday everyone seems to want to know the form james bond wiped his forehead with his handkerchief of course he was pleased but above all pleased with ms commendation the rest he knew was not in his stars he had never been a public figure and he did not wish to become one he had no prejudice against letters after ones name or before it but there was one thing above all he treasured his privacy his anonymity to become a public person a person in the snobbish world of england of any country who would be called upon to open things lay foundation stones make afterdinner speeches brought the sweat to his armpits james bond no middle name no hyphen a quiet dull anonymous name certainly he was a commander in the special branch of the rnvr but he rarely used the rank his cmg likewise he wore it perhaps once a year together with his two rows of lettuce because there was a dinner for the old boysthe fraternity of exsecret service men that went under the name of the twin snakes club a grisly reunion held in the banqueting hall at blades it gave enormous pleasure to a lot of people who had been brave and resourceful in their day but now had old mens and old womens diseases and talked about dusty triumphs and tragedies tales which since they would never be recorded in the history books must be told again that night over the cockburn when the queen had been drunk to some nextdoor neighbour such as james bond who was only interested in what was going to happen tomorrow that was when he wore his lettuce and the cmg below his black tieto give pleasure and reassurance to the old children at their annual party for the rest of the year until may polished them up for the occasion the medals gathered dust in some secret repository where may kept them so now james bond said to mary goodnight avoiding her eyes mary this is an order take down what follows and send it tonight right begins quote mailedfist eyes only stop

bracket letter confirming follows immediately endit ohohseven mary goodnight closed her book with a snap she shook her head the golden hair danced angrily well really james are you sure you dont want to sleep on it i knew you were in a bad mood today you may have changed your mind by tomorrow dont you want to go to buckingham palace and see the queen and the duke of edinburgh and kneel and have your shoulder touched with a sword and the queen to say arise sir knight or whatever it is she does say bond smiled id like all those things the romantic streak of the sisand of the scot for the matter of that i just refuse to call myself sir james bond id laugh at myself every time i looked in the mirror to shave its just not my line mary the thought makes me positively shudder i know mll understand he thinks much the same way about these things as i do trouble was he had to more or less inherit his k with the job anyway there it is and i shant change my mind so you can buzz that off and ill write m a letter of confirmation this evening any other business well there is one thing james mary goodnight looked down her pretty nose matron says you can leave at the end of the week but that theres got to be another three weeks convalescence had you got any plans where to go you have to be in reach of the hospital no ideas what do you suggest well er ive got this little villa up by mona dam james her voice hurried its got quite a nice spare room looking out over kingston harbour and its cool up there and if you dont mind sharing a bathroom she blushed im afraid theres no chaperone but you know in jamaica people dont mind that sort of thing what sort of thing said bond teasing her dont be silly james you know unmarried couples sharing the same house and so on oh that sort of thing sounds pretty dashing to me by the way is your bedroom decorated in pink with white jalousies and do you sleep under a mosquito net she looked surprised yes how did you know when he didnt answer she hurried on and james its not far from the liguanea club and you can go there and play bridge and golf when you get better therell be plenty of people for you to talk to and then of course i can cook and sew buttons on for you and so on of all the doomfraught graffiti a woman can write on the wall those are the most insidious the most deadly james bond in the full possession of his senses with his eyes wide open his feet flat on the linoleum floor stuck his head blithely between the minklined jaws of the trap he said and meant it goodnight youre an angel at the same time he knew deep down that love from mary goodnight or from any other woman was not enough for him it would be like taking a room with a view for james bond the same view would always pall the end
