debt of bones by terry goodkind what do you got in the sack dearie abby was watching a distant flock of whistling swans graceful white specks against the dark soaring walls of the keep as they made their interminable journey past ramparts bastions towers and bridges lit by the low sun the sinister spectre of the keep had seemed to be staring back the whole of the day as abby had waited she turned to the hunched old woman in front of her im sorry did you ask me something i asked what you got in your sack as the woman peered up she licked the tip of her tongue through the slot where a tooth was missing something precious abby clutched the burlap sack to herself as she shrank a little from the grinning woman just some of my things thats all an officer trailed by a troop of assistants aides and guards marched out from under the massive portcullis that loomed nearby abby and the rest of the supplicants waiting at the head of the stone bridge moved tighter to the side even though the soldiers had ample room to pass the officer his grim gaze unseeing as he swept by didnt return the salute as the bridge guards clapped fists to the armour over their hearts all day soldiers from different lands as well as the home guard from the vast city of aydindril below had been coming and going from the keep some had looked travelsore some wore uniforms still filthy with dirt soot and blood from recent battles abby had even seen two officers from her homeland of pendisan reach they had looked to her to be little more than boys but boys with the thin veneer of youth shedding too soon like a snake casting off its skin before its time leaving the emerging maturity scarred abby had also seen such an array of important people as she could scarcely believe sorceresses councillors and even a confessor come up from the confessors palace down in the city on her way up to the keep there was rarely a turn in the winding road that hadnt offered abby a view of the sprawling splendour in white stone that was the confessors palace the alliance of the midlands headed by the mother confessor herself held council in the palace and there too lived the confessors in her whole life abby had seen a confessor only once before the woman had come to see abbys mother and abby not ten years at the time had been unable to keep from staring at the confessors long hair other than her mother no woman in abbys small town of coney crossing was sufficiently important to have hair long enough to touch the shoulders abbys own fine dark brown hair covered her ears but no more coming through the city on the way to the keep it had been hard for her not to gape at noble women with hair to their shoulders and even a little beyond but the confessor going up to the keep dressed in the simple satiny black dress of a confessor had hair that reached halfway down her back she wished she could have had a better look at the rare sight of such long luxuriant hair and the woman important enough to possess it but abby had gone to a knee with the rest of the company at the bridge and like the rest of them feared to raise her bowed head to look up lest she meet the gaze of the other it was said that to meet the gaze of a confessor could cost you your mind if you were lucky and your soul if you werent even though abbys mother had said it was untrue that only the deliberate touch of such a woman could effect such a deed abby feared this day of all days to test the stories the old woman in front of her clothed in layered skirts topped with one dyed of henna and mantled with a dark draping shawl watched the soldiers pass and then leaned closer do better to bring a bone dearie i hear that there be those in the city who will sell a bone such as you need for the right price wizards dont take no salt pork for a need they got salt pork she glanced past abby to the others to see them occupied with their own interests better to sell your things and hope you have enough to buy a bone wizards dont want what some country girl brung em favours from wizards dont come easyвђ she glanced to the backs of the soldiers as they reached the far side of the bridge not even for those doing their bidding it would seem i just want to talk to them thats all salt pork wont get you a talk neither as i hear tell she eyed abbys hand trying to cover the smooth round shape beneath the burlap or a jug you made that what it is dearie her brown eyes set in a wrinkled leathery mask turned up peering with sudden humourless intent a jug yes abby said a jug i made the woman smiled her skepticism and fingered a lick of short grey hair back under her wool headwrap her gnarled fingers closed around the smocking on the forearm of abbys crimson dress pulling the arm up a bit to have a look maybe you could get the price of a proper bone for your braceletвђ abby glanced down at the bracelet made of two wires twisted together in interlocking circles my mother gave me this it has no value but to me a slow smile came to the womans weathercracked lips the spirits believe that there is no stronger power than a mothers want to protect her child abby gently pulled her arm away the spirits know the truth of that uncomfortable under the scrutiny of the suddenly talkative woman abby searched for a safe place to settle her gaze it made her dizzy to look down into the yawning chasm beneath the bridge and she was weary of watching the wizards keep so she pretended that her attention had been caught as an excuse to turn back towards the collection of people mostly men waiting with her at the head of the bridge she busied herself with nibbling on the last crust of bread from the loaf she had bought down in the market before coming up to the keep abby felt awkward talking to strangers in her whole life she had never seen so many people much less people she didnt know she knew every person in coney crossing the city made her apprehensive but not as apprehensive as the keep towering on the mountain above it and that not as much as her reason for being there she just wanted to go home but there would be no home at least nothing to go home to if she didnt do this all eyes turned up at the rattle of hooves coming out under the portcullis huge horses all dusky brown or black and bigger than any abby had ever seen came thundering towards them men bedecked with polished breastplates chainmail and leather and most carrying lances or poles topped with long flags of high office and rank urged their mounts onward they raised dust and gravel as they gathered speed crossing the bridge a wild rush of colour and sparkles of light from metal flashing past sanderian lancers from the descriptions abby had heard she had trouble imagining the enemy with the nerve to go up against men such as these her stomach roiled she realized she had no need to imagine and no reason to put her hope in brave men such as those lancers her only hope was the wizard and that hope was slipping away as she stood waiting there was nothing for it but to wait abby turned back to the keep just in time to see a statuesque woman in simple robes stride out through the opening in the massive stone wall her fair skin stood out all the more against straight dark hair parted in the middle and readily reaching her shoulders some of the men had been whispering about the sight of the sanderian officers but at the sight of the woman everyone fell to silence the four soldiers at the head of the stone bridge made way for the woman as she approached the supplicants sorceressвђ the old woman whispered to abby abby hardly needed the old womans counsel to know it was a sorceress abby recognized the simple flaxen robes decorated at the neck with yellow and red beads sewn in the ancient symbols of the profession some of her earliest memories were of being held in her mothers arms and touching beads like those she saw now the sorceress bowed her head to the people and then offered a smile please forgive us for keeping you waiting out here the whole of the day it is not from lack of respect nor something we customarily do but with the war on our hands such precautions are regrettably unavoidable we hope none took offence at the delay the crowd mumbled that they didnt abby doubted there was one among them bold enough to claim otherwise how goes the war a man behind asked the sorceresss even gaze turned to him with the blessings of the good spirits it will end soonвђ may the spirits will that dhara is crushed beseeched the man without response the sorceress appraised the faces watching her waiting to see if anyone else would speak or ask a question none did please come with me then the council meeting has ended and a couple of the wizards will take the time to see you all as the sorceress turned back to the keep and started out three men strode up among the supplicants and put themselves at the head of the line right in front of the old woman the woman snatched a velvet sleeve who do you think you are she snapped taking a place before me when ive been here the whole of the day the oldest of the three dressed in rich robes of dark purple with contrasting red sewn inside the length of the slits up the sleeves looked to be a noble with his two advisors or perhaps guards he turned a glare on the woman you dont mind do you it didnt sound at all to abby like a question the old woman took her hand back and fell mute the man the ends of his grey hair coiled on his shoulders glanced at abby his hooded eyes gleamed with challenge she swallowed and remained silent she didnt have any objection either at least none she was willing to voice for all she knew the noble was important enough to see to it that she was denied an audience she couldnt afford to take that chance now that she was this close abby was distracted by a tingling sensation from the bracelet blindly her ringers glided over the wrist of the hand holding the sack the wire bracelet felt warm it hadnt done that since her mother had died in the presence of so much magic as was at a place such as this it didnt really surprise her the crowd moved out to follow the sorceress mean they are the woman whispered over her shoulder mean as a winter night and just as cold those men abby whispered back noвђ the woman tilted her head sorceresses wizards too thats who all those born with the gift of magic you better have something important in that sack or the wizards might turn you to dust for no other reason than that theyd enjoy it abby pulled her sack tight in her arms the meanest thing her mother had done in the whole of her life was to die before she could see her granddaughter abby swallowed back the urge to cry and prayed to the dear spirits that the old woman was wrong about wizards and that they were as understanding as sorceresses she prayed fervently that this wizard would help her she prayed for forgiveness too that the good spirits would understand abby worked at holding a calm countenance even though her insides were in turmoil she pressed a fist to her stomach she prayed for strength even in this she prayed for strength the sorceress the three men the old woman abby and then the rest of the supplicants passed under the huge iron portcullis and on to the keep grounds inside the massive outer wall abby was surprised to discover the air warm outside it had been a chill autumn day but inside the air was springfresh and warm the road up the mountain the stone bridge over the chasm and then the opening under the portcullis appeared to be the only way into the keep unless you were a bird soaring walls of dark stone with high windows surrounded the gravel courtyard inside there were a number of doors around the courtyard and ahead a roadway tunnelled deeper into the keep despite the warm air abby was chilled to the bone by the place she wasnt sure that the old woman wasnt right about wizards life in coney crossing was far removed from matters of wizards abby had never seen a wizard before nor did she know anyone who had except for her mother and her mother never spoke of them except to caution that where wizards were concerned you couldnt trust even what you saw with your own eyes the sorceress led them up four granite steps worn smooth over the ages by countless footsteps through a doorway set back under a lintel of pinkflecked black granite and into the keep proper the sorceress lifted an arm into the darkness sweeping it to the side lamps along the wall sprang to flame it had been simple magic not a very impressive display of the gift but several of the people behind fell to worried whispering as they passed on through the wide hall it occurred to abby that if this little bit of conjuring would frighten them then they had no business going to see wizards they wended their way across the sunken floor of an imposing anteroom the likes of which abby could never even have imagined red marble columns all around supported arches below balconies in the centre of the room a fountain sprayed water high overhead the water fell back to cascade down through a succession of ever larger scalloped bowls officers sorceresses and a variety of others sat about on white marble benches or huddled in small groups all engaged in seemingly earnest conversation masked by the sound of the water in a much smaller room beyond the sorceress gestured for them to be seated at a line of carved oak benches along one wall abby was boneweary and relieved to sit at last light from windows above the benches lit three tapestries hanging on the high far wall the three together covered nearly the entire wall and made up one scene of a grand procession through a city abby had never seen anything like it but with the way her dreads careened through her thoughts she could summon little pleasure in seeing even such a majestic tableau in the centre of the creamcoloured marble floor inset in brass lines was a circle with a square inside it its corners touching the circle inside the square sat another circle just large enough to touch the insides of the square the centre circle held an eightpointed star lines radiated out from the points of the star piercing all the way through both circles every other line bisecting a corner of the square the design called a grace was often drawn by those with the gift the outer circle represented the beginnings of the infinity of the spirit world out beyond the square represented the boundary separating the spirit world the underworld the world of the dead from the inner circle which represented the limits of the world of life in the centre of it all was the star representing the light the creator it was a depiction of the continuum of the gift from the creator through life and at death crossing the boundary to eternity with the spirits in the keepers realm of the underworld but it represented a hope too a hope to remain in the creators light from birth through life and beyond in the underworld it was said that only the spirits of those who did great wickedness in life would be denied the creators light in the underworld abby knew she would be condemned to an eternity with the keeper of darkness in the underworld she had no choice the sorceress folded her hands an aide will come to get you each in turn a wizard will see each of you the war burns hot please keep your petition brief she gazed down the line of people it is out of a sincere obligation to those we serve that the wizards see supplicants but please try to understand that individual desires are often detrimental to the greater good by pausing to help one then many are denied help thus denial of a request is not a denial of your need but acceptance of greater need in times of peace it is rare for wizards to grant the narrow wants of supplicants at a time like this a time of a great war it is almost unheardof please understand that it has not to do with what we would wish but is a matter of necessity she watched the line of supplicants but saw none willing to abandon their purpose abby certainly would not very well then we have two wizards able to take supplicants at this time we will bring you each to one of them the sorceress turned to leave abby rose to her feet please mistress a word if i may the sorceress turned an unsettling gaze on abby speak abby stepped forward i must see the first wizard himself wizard zorander one eyebrow arched the first wizard is a very busy man abby reached into her sack and pulled out the neck band from her mothers robes she stepped into the centre of the grace and kissed the red and yellow beads on the neck band t am abigail born of helsa on the grace and my mothers soul i must see wizard zorander please it is no trivial journey i have made lives are at stake the sorceress watched the beaded band being returned to the sack abigail born of helsa her gaze rose to meet abbys i will take your words to the first wizard mistress abby turned to see the old woman on her feet i would be well pleased to see the first wizard too the three men rose up the oldest the one apparently in charge of the three gave the sorceress a look so barren of timidity that it bordered on contempt his long grey hair fell forward over his velvet robes as he glanced down the line of seated people seeming to dare them to stand when none did he returned his attention to the sorceress i will see wizard zorander the sorceress appraised those on their feet and then looked down the line of supplicants on the bench the first wizard has earned a name the wind of death he is feared no less by many of us than by our enemies anyone else who would bait fate none of those on the bench had the courage to gaze into her fierce stare to the last they all silently shook their heads please waitвђ she said to those seated someone will shortly be out to take you to a wizardвђ she looked once more to the five people standing are you all very very sure of this abby nodded the old woman nodded the noble glared very well then come with meвђ the noble and his two men stepped in front of abby the old woman seemed content to take a station at the end of the line they were led deeper into the keep through narrow halls and wide corridors some dark and austere and some of astounding grandeur everywhere there were soldiers of the home guard their breastplates or chainmail covered with red tunics banded around their edges in black all were heavily armed with swords or battleaxes all had knives and many additionally carried pikes tipped with winged and barbed steel at the top of a broad white marble stairway the stone railings spiralled at the ends to open wide on to a room of warm oak panelling several of the raised panels held lamps with polished silver reflectors atop a threelegged table sat a doublebowl cutglass lamp with twin chimneys their flames adding to the mellow light from the reflector lamps a thick carpet of ornate blue patterns covered nearly the entire wood floor to each side of a double door stood one of the meticulously dressed home guard both men were equally huge they looked to be men more than able to handle any trouble that might come up the stairs the sorceress nodded towards the dozen thickly tufted leather chairs set in four groups abby waited until the others had seated themselves in two of the groupings and then sat by herself in another she placed the sack in her lap and rested her hands over its contents the sorceress stiffened her back i will tell the first wizard that he has supplicants who wish to see himвђ a guard opened one of the double doors for her as she was swallowed into the great room beyond abby was able to snatch a quick glimpse she could see that it was well lighted by glassed skylights there were other doors in the grey stone of the walls before the door closed abby was also able to see a number of people men and women both all rushing hither and yon abby sat turned away from the old woman and the three men as with one hand she idly stroked the sack in her lap she had little fear that the men would talk to her but she didnt want to talk to the woman it was a distraction she passed the time going over in her mind what she planned to say to wizard zorander at least she tried to go over it in her mind mostly all she could think about was what the sorceress had said that the first wizard was called the wind of death not oniy by the dharans but also by his own people of the midlands abby knew it was no tale to scare off supplicants from a busy man abby herself had heard people whisper of their great wizard the wind of death those whispered words were uttered in dread the lands of dhara had sound reason to fear this man as their enemy he had laid waste to countless of their army from what abby had heard of course if they hadnt invaded the midlands bent on conquest they would not have felt the hot wind of death had they not invaded abby wouldnt be sitting there in the wizards keep she would be at home and everyone she loved would be safe abby marked again the odd tingling sensation from the bracelet she ran her fingers over it testing its unusual warmth this close to a person of such power it didnt surprise her that the bracelet was warming her mother had told her to wear it always and that someday it would be of value abby didnt know how and her mother had died without ever explaining sorceresses were known for the way they kept secrets even from their own daughters perhaps if abby had been born gifted she sneaked a peek over her shoulder at the others the old woman was leaning back in her chair staring at the doors the nobles attendants sat with their hands folded as they casually eyed the room the noble was doing the oddest thing he had a lock of sandycoloured hair wound around a finger he stroked his thumb over the lock of hair as he glared at the doors abby wanted the wizard to hurry up and see her but time stubbornly dragged by in a way she wished he would refuse no she told herself that was unacceptable no matter her fear no matter her revulsion she must do this abruptly the door opened the sorceress strode out towards abby the noble surged to his feet i will see him first his voice was cold threat that is not a request it is our right to see him first abby said without forethought when the sorceress folded her hands abby decided she had best go on ive waited since dawn this woman was the only one waiting before me these men came at the last of the day abby started when the old womans gnarled fingers gripped her forearm why dont we let these men go first dearie it matters not who arrived first but who has the most important business abby wanted to scream that her business was important but she realized that the old woman might be saving her from serious trouble in accomplishing her business reluctantly she gave the sorceress a nod as the sorceress led the three men through the door abby could feel the old womans eyes on her back abby hugged the sack against the burning anxiety in her abdomen and told herself that it wouldnt be long and then she would see him as they waited the old woman remained silent and abby was glad for that occasionally she glanced at the door imploring the good spirits to help her but she realized it was futile the good spirits wouldnt be disposed to help her in this a roar came from the room beyond the doors it was like the sound of an arrow zipping through the air or a long switch whipping but much louder intensifying rapidly it ended with a shrill crack accompanied by a flash of light coming under the doors and around their edges the doors shuddered on their hinges sudden silence rang in abbys ears she found herself gripping the arms of the chair both doors opened the nobles two attendants marched out followed by the sorceress the three stopped in the waiting room abby sucked a breath one of the two men was cradling the nobles head in the crook of an arm the wan features of the face were frozen in a mute scream thick strings of blood dripped on to the carpet show them out the sorceress hissed through gritted teeth to one of the two guards at the door the guard dipped his pike towards the stairs ordering them ahead and then followed the two men down crimson drops splattered on to the white marble of the steps as they descended abby sat in stiff wideeyed shock the sorceress wheeled back to abby and the old woman the woman rose to her feet i believe that i would rather not bother the first wizard today i will return another day if need be she hunched lower towards abby i am called mariska her brow drew down may the good spirits grant that you succeed she shuffled to the stairs rested a hand on the marble railing and started down the sorceress snapped her fingers and gestured the remaining guard rushed to accompany the woman as the sorceress turned back to abby the first wizard will see you now abby gulped air trying to get her breath as she staggered to her feet what happened why did the first wizard do that the man was sent on behalf of another to ask a question of the first wizard the first wizard gave his answer abby clutched her sack to herself for dear life as she gaped at the blood on the floor might that be the answer to my question if i ask it i dont know the question you would ask for the first time the sorceresss expression softened just a bit would you like me to see you out you could see another wizard or perhaps after youve given more thought to your petition return another day if you still wish it abby fought back tears of desperation there was no choice she shook her head i must see him the sorceress let out a deep breath very well she put a hand under abbys arm as if to keep her on her feet the first wizard will see you now abby hugged the contents of her sack as she was led into the chamber where waited the first wizard torches in iron sconces were not yet burning the late afternoon light from the glassed roof windows was still strong enough to illuminate the room it smelled of pitch lamp oil roasted meat wet stone and stale sweat inside confusion and commotion reigned there were people everywhere and they all seemed to be talking at once stout tables set about the room in no discernible pattern were covered with books scrolls maps chalk unlit oil lamps burning candles partially eaten meals sealing wax pens and a clutter of every sort of odd object from balls of knotted string to halfspilled sacks of sand people stood about the tables engaged in conversations or arguments as others tapped passages in books pored over scrolls or moved little painted weights about on maps others rolled slices of roasted meat plucked from platters and nibbled as they watched or offered opinions between swallows the sorceress still holding abby under her arm leaned closer as they proceeded you will have the first wizards divided attention there will be other people talking to him at the same time dont be distracted he will be listening to you as he also listens to or talks to others just ignore the others who are speaking and ask what you have come to ask he will hear you abby was dumbfounded while hes talking to other people yes abby felt the hand squeeze her arm ever so slightly try to be calm and not to judge by what has come before you the killing that was what she meant that a man had come to speak to the first wizard and he had been killed for it she was simply supposed to put that from her thoughts when she glanced down she saw that she was walking through a trail of blood she didnt see the headless body anywhere her bracelet tingled so that she looked down at it the hand under her arm halted her when abby looked up she saw a confusing knot of people before her some rushed in from the sides as others rushed away some flailed their arms as they spoke with great conviction so many were talking that abby could scarcely understand a word of it at the same time others were leaning in nearly whispering she felt as if she were confronting a human beehive abbys attention was snagged by a form in white to the side the instant she saw the long fall of hair and the violet eyes looking right at her abby went rigid a small cry escaped her throat as she fell to her knees and bowed over until her back protested she trembled and shuddered fearing the worst in the instant before she dropped to her knees she had seen that the elegant satiny white dress was cut square at the neck the same as the black dresses had been the long flag of hair was unmistakable abby had never seen the woman before but without doubt knew who she was there could be no mistaking this woman only one of them wore the white dress it was the mother confessor herself she heard muttering above her but feared to listen lest it was death being summoned rise my child came a clear voice abby recognized it as the formal response of the mother confessor to one of her people it took a moment for abby to realize it represented no threat but simple acknowledgement she stared at a smear of blood on the floor as she debated what to do next her mother had never instructed her as to how to conduct herself should she ever meet the mother confessor as far as she knew no one from coney crossing had ever seen the mother confessor much less met her then again none of them had ever seen a wizard either overhead the sorceress whispered a growl rise abby scurried to her feet but kept her eyes to the floor even though the smear of blood was making her sick she could smell it like a fresh butchering of one of their animals from the long trail it looked as if the body had been dragged away to one of the doors in the back of the room the sorceress spoke calmly into the chaos wizard zorander this is abigail born of helsa she wishes a word with you abigail this is first wizard zeddicus zul zorander abby dared to cautiously lift her gaze hazel eyes gazed back to each side before her were knots of people bigr forbidding officers some of them looked as if they might be generals several old men in robes some simple and some ornate several middleaged men some in robes and some in livery three women sorceresses all a variety of other men and women and the mother confessor the man at the centre of the turmoil the man with the hazel eyes was not what abby had been expecting she had expected some grizzled gruff old man this man was young perhaps as young as she lean but sinewy he wore the simplest of robes hardly better made than abbys burlap sack the mark of his high office abby had not anticipated this sort of man in such an office as that of first wizard she remembered what her mother had told her not to trust what your eyes told you where wizards were concerned all about people spoke to him argued at him a few even shouted but the wizard was silent as he looked into her eyes his face was pleasing enough to look upon gentle in appearance even though his wavy brown hair looked ungovernable but his eyes abby had never seen the likes of those eyes they seemed to see all to know all to understand all at the same time they were bloodshot and wearylooking as if sleep eluded him they had too the slightest glaze of distress even so he was calm at the centre of the storm for that moment that his attention was on her it was as if no one else were in the room the lock of hair abby had seen around the nobles finger was now held wrapped around the first wizards finger he brushed it to his lips before lowering his arm i am told you are the daughter of a sorceress his voice was placid water flowing through the tumult raging all about are you gifted child no sir even as she answered he was turning to another who had just finished speaking i told you if you do we chance losing them send word that i want him to cut south the tall officer to whom the wizard spoke threw his hands up but he said theyve reliable scouting information that the dharans went east on him thats not the point the wizard said i want that pass to the south sealed thats where their main force went they have gifted among them they are the ones we must kill the tall officer was saluting with a fist to his heart as the wizard turned to an old sorceress yes thats right three invocations before attempting the transposition i found the reference last night the old sorceress departed to be replaced by a man jabbering in a foreign tongue as he opened a scroll and held it up for the wizard to see the wizard squinted towards it reading a moment before waving the man away while giving orders in the same foreign language the wizard turned to abby youre a skip abby felt her face heat and her ears burn yes wizard zorander nothing to be ashamed of child he said while the mother confessor herself was whispering confidentially in his ear but it was something to be ashamed of the gift hadnt passed on to her from her mother it had skipped her the people of coney crossing had depended on abbys mother she helped with those who were ill or hurt she advised people on matters of community and those of family for some she arranged marriages for some she meted out discipline for some she bestowed favours available only through magic she was a sorceress she protected the people of coney crossing she was revered openly by some she was feared and loathed privately she was revered for the good she did for the people of coney crossing by some she had been feared and loathed because she had the gift because she wielded magic others wanted nothing so much as to live their lives without any magic about abby had no magic and couldnt help with illness or injury or shapeless fears she dearly wished she could but she couldnt when abby had asked her mother why she would abide all the thankless resentment her mother told her that helping was its own reward and you should not expect gratitude for it she said that if you went through life expecting gratitude for the help you provided you might end up leading a miserable life when her mother was alive abby had been shunned in subtle ways after her mother died the shunning became more overt it had been expected by the people of coney crossing that she would serve as her mother had served people didnt understand about the gift how it often wasnt passed on to an offspring instead they thought abby selfish the wizard was explaining something to a sorceress about the casting of a spell when he finished his gaze swept past abby on its way to someone else she needed his help now what is it you wanted to ask me abigail abbys fingers tightened on the sack its about my home of coney crossing she paused while the wizard pointed in a book being held out to him he rolled his hand at her gesturing for her to go on as a man was explaining an intricacy to do with inverting a duplex spell theres terrible trouble there abby said dharan troops came through the crossing the first wizard turned to an older man with a long white beard by his simple robes abby guessed him as a wizard too im telling you thomas it can be doneвђ wizard zorander insisted im not saying i agree with the council im just telling you what i found and their unanimous decision that it be done im not claiming to understand the details of just how it works but ive studied it it can be done as i told the council i can activate it i have yet to decide if i agree with them that i should the man thomas wiped a hand across his face you mean what i heard is true then that you really do think its possible are you out of your mind zorander i found it in a book in the first wizards private enclave a book from before the war with the old world ive seen it with my own eyes ive cast a whole series of verification webs to test it he turned his attention to abby yes that would be anargos legion coney crossing is in pendisan reach thats right abby said and so then this dharan army swept through there and pendisan reach refused to join with the rest of the midlands under central command to resist the invasion from dhara standing by their sovereignty they chose to fight the enemy in their own way they have to live with the consequences of their actions the old man was tugging on his beard still do you know if its real all proven out i mean that book would have to be thousands of years old it might have been conjecture verification webs dont always confirm the entire structure of such a thing i know that as well as you thomas but im telling you its real wizard zorander said his voice lowered to a whisper the spirits preserve us its genuine abbys heart was pounding she wanted to tell him her story but she couldnt seem to get a word in he had to help her it was the only way an army officer rushed in from one of the back doors he pushed his way into the crowd around the first wizard wizard zorander ive just got word when we unleashed the horns you sent they worked urdlands force turned tail several voices fell silent others didnt at least three thousand years old the first wizard said to the man with the beard he put a hand on the newlyarrived officers shoulder and leaned close tell general brainard to hold short at the kern river dont burn the bridges but hold them tell him to split his men leave half to keep urdlands force from changing their mind hopefully they wont be able to replace their field wizard have brainard take the rest of his men north to help cut anargos escape route thats where our concern lies but we may still need the bridges to go after urdland one of the other officers an older man looking possibly to be a general himself went red in the face halt at the river when the horns have done their job and we have them on the run but why we can take them down before they have a chance to regroup and join up with another force to come back at us hazel eyes turned towards the man and do you know what waits over the border how many men will die if panis rahl has something waiting that the horns cant turn away how many innocent lives has it already cost us how many of our men will die to bleed them on their own land land we dont know as they do and how many of our people will die if we dont eliminate their ability to come back at us another day we must pursue them panis rahl will never rest hell be working to conjure up something else to gut us all in our sleep we must hunt them down and kill every last one im working on thatвђ the first wizard said cryptically the old man twisted his beard and made a sarcastic face yes he thinks he can unleash the underworld itself on them several officers two of the sorceresses and a couple of the men in robes paused to stare in open disbelief the sorceress who had brought abby to the audience leaned close you wanted to talk to the first wizard talk if you have lost your nerve then i will see you out abby wet her lips she didnt know how she could talk into the middle of such a roundabout conversation but she knew she must so she just started back in sir i dont know anything about what my homeland of pendisan reach has done i know little of the king i dont know anything about the council or the war or any of it im from a small place and i only know that the people there are in grave trouble our defenders were overrun by the enemy there is an army of midlands men who drive towards the dharans she felt foolish talking to a man who was carrying on a halfdozen conversations all at once mostly though she felt anger and frustration those people were going to die if she couldnt convince him to help how many dharans the wizard asked abby opened her mouth but an officer spoke in her place were not sure how many are left in anargos legion they may be wounded but theyre an enraged wounded bull now theyre in sight of their homeland they can only come back at us or escape us weve got sanderson sweeping down from the north and mardale cutting up from the southwest anargo made a mistake going into the crossing in there he must fight us or run for home we have to finish them this may be our only chance the first wizard drew a finger and thumb down his smooth jaw still we arent sure of their numbers the scouts were dependable but they never returned we can only assume theyre dead and why would anargo do such a thing well the officer said its the shortest escape route back to dhara the first wizard turned to a sorceress to answer a question she had just finished i cant see how we can afford it tell them i said no ill not cast that kind of web for them and ill not give them the means to it for no more offered than a maybe the sorceress nodded before rushing off abby knew that a web was the spell cast by a sorceress apparently the spell cast by a wizard was called the same well if such a thing is possible the bearded man was saying then id like to see your exegesis of the text a threethousandyearold book is a lot of risk weve no clue as to how the wizards of that time could do most of what they did the first wizard for the first time cast a hot glare towards the man thomas do you want to see exactly what im talking about the spellform some of the people had fallen silent at the tone in his voice the first wizard threw open his arms urging everyone back out of his way the mother confessor stayed close behind his left shoulder the sorceress beside abby pulled her back a step the first wizard motioned a man snatched a small sack off the table and handed it to him abby noticed that some of the sand on the tables wasnt simply spilled but had been used to draw symbols abbys mother had occasionally drawn spells with sand but mostly used a variety of other things from ground bone to dried herbs abbys mother had used sand for practice spells real spells had to be drawn in proper order and without error the first wizard squatted down and took a handful of sand from the sack he drew on the floor by letting the sand drizzle from the side of his fist wizard zoranders hand moved with practised precision his arm swept around drawing a circle he returned for a handful of sand and drew an inner circle it appeared he was drawing a grace abbys mother had always drawn the square second everything in order inward and then the rays back out wizard zorander drew the eightpointed star inside the smaller circle he drew the lines radiating outward through both circles but left one absent he had yet to draw the square representing the boundary between worlds he was the first wizard so abby guessed that it wasnt improper to do it in a different order than a sorceress in a little place like coney crossing but several of the men abby took as wizards and the two sorceresses behind him were turning grave glances to one another wizard zorander laid down the lines of sand for two sides of the square he scooped up more sand from the sack and began the last two sides instead of a straight line he drew an arc that dipped well into the edge of the inner circle the one representing the world of life the arc instead of ending at the outer circle crossed it he drew the last side likewise arced so that it too crossed into the inner circle he brought the line to meet the other where the ray from the light was missing unlike the other three points of the square this last point ended outside the larger circle in the world of the dead people gasped a hush fell over the room for a moment before worried whispers spread among those gifted wizard zorander rose satisfied thomas thomass face had gone as white as his beard the creator preserve us his eyes turned to wizard zorander the council doesnt truly understand this it would be madness to unleash it wizard zorander ignored him and turned towards abby how many dharans did you see three years past the locust swarms came the hills of the crossing were brown with them i think saw more dharans than i saw locusts wizard zorander grunted his discontent he looked down at the grace he had drawn panis rahl wont give up how long thomas how long until he finds something new to conjure and sends anargo back on us his gaze swept among the people around him how many years have we thought we would be annihilated by the invading horde from dhara how many of our people have been killed by rahls magic how many thousands have died of the fevers he sent how many thousands have blistered and bled to death from the touch of the shadow people he conjured how many villages towns and cities has he wiped from existence when no one spoke wizard zorander went on it has taken us years to come back from the brink the war has finally turned the enemy is running we now have three choices the first choice is to let him run for home and hope he never comes back to again visit us with his brutality i think it would only be a matter of time until he tried again that leaves two realistic options we can either pursue him into his lair and kill him for good at the cost of tens perhaps hundreds of thousands of our men or i can end it those gifted among the crowd cast uneasy glances to the grace drawn on the floor we still have other magic another wizard said we can use it to the same effect without unleashing such a cataclysm wizard zorander is rightвђ another said and so is the council the enemy has earned this fate we must set it upon themвђ the room fell again to arguing as it did wizard zorander looked into abbys eyes it was a clear instruction to finish her supplication my people the people in coney crossing have been taken by the dharans they have others too who theyve captured they have a sorceress holding the captives with a spell please wizard zorander you must help me when i was hiding i heard the sorceress talking to their officers the dharans plan to use the captives as shields they will use the captives to blunt the deadly magic you send against them or to blunt the spears and arrows the midlands army sends against them if they decide to turn and attack they plan to drive the captives ahead they called it dulling the enemies weapons on their own women and children no one looked at her they were all once again engaged in their mass talking and arguing it was as if the lives of all those people were beneath their consideration tears stung at abbys eyes either way all those innocent people will die please wizard zorander we must have your help otherwise theyll all die he looked her way briefly there is nothing we can do for them abby panted trying to hold back the tears my father was captured along with others of my kin my husband is among the captives my daughter is among them she is not yet five if you send magic they will be killed if you attack they will be killed you must rescue them or hold the attack he looked genuinely saddened im sorry i cant help them may the good spirits watch over them and take their souls to the light he began turning away no abby screamed some of the people fell silent others only glanced her way as they went on my child you cant she thrust a hand into the sack i have a bone doesnt everyone he grumbled cutting her off i cant help you but you must we would have to abandon our cause we must take the dharan force down one way or another innocent though those people are they are in the way i cant allow the dharans to succeed in such a scheme or it would encourage its widespread use and then even more innocents would die the enemy must be shown that it will not deter us from our course no abby wailed shes only a child youre condemning my baby to death there are other children what kind of monster are you no one but the wizard was even listening to her any more as they all went on with their talking the first wizards voice cut through the din and fell on her ears as clearly as the knell of death i am a man who must make choices such as this one i must deny your petition abby screamed with the agony of failure she wasnt even to be allowed to show him but its a debt she cried a solemn debt and it cannot be paid now abby screamed hysterically the sorceress began pulling her away abby broke from the woman and ran out of the room she staggered down the stone steps unable to see through the tears at the bottom of the steps she buckled to the floor in helpless sobbing he wouldnt help her he wouldnt help a helpless child her daughter was going to die abby convulsing in sobs felt a hand on her shoulder gentle arms pulled her closer tender ringers brushed back her hair as she wept into a womans lap another persons hand touched her back and she felt the warm comfort of magic seeping into her hes killing my daughter she cried i hate him its all right abigail the voice above said its all right to weep for such a pain as this abby wiped at her eyes but couldnt stop the tears the sorceress was there beside her at the bottom of the steps abby looked up at the woman in whose arms she lay it was the mother confessor herself she could do her worst for all abby cared what did it matter what did any of it matter now hes a monster she sobbed he is truly named he is the ill wind of death this time its my baby hes killing not the enemy i understand why you feel that way abigailвђ the mother confessor said but it is not true how can you say that my daughter has not yet had a chance to live and he will kill her my husband will die my father too but he has had a chance to live a life my baby hasnt she fell to hysterical wailing again and the mother confessor once again drew her into comforting arms comfort was not what abby wanted you have just the one child the sorceress asked abby nodded as she sucked a breath i had another a boy but he died at birth the midwife said i will have no more my little jana is all i will ever have the wild agony of it ripped through her and he will kill her just as he killed that man before me wizard zorander is a monster may the good spirits strike him dead with a poignant expression the sorceress smoothed abbys hair back from her forehead you dont understand you see only a part of it you dont mean what you say but she did if you had delora understands the mother confessor said gesturing towards the sorceress she has a daughter of ten years and a son too abby peered up at the sorceress she gave abby a sympathetic smile and a nod to confirm the truth of it t too have a daughter the mother confessor said she is twelve delora and i both understand your pain so does the first wizard abbys fists tightened he couldnt hes hardly more than a boy himself and he wants to kill my baby he is the wind of death and thats all he cares about killing people the mother confessor patted the stone step beside her abigail sit up here beside me let me tell you about the man in there still weeping abby pushed herself up and slid on to the step the mother confessor was older by maybe twelve or fourteen years and pleasantlooking with those violet eyes her mass of long hair reached her waist she had a warm smile it had never occurred to abby to think of a confessor as a woman but that was what she saw now she didnt fear this woman as she had before nothing she did could be worse than what already had been done i sometimes minded zeddicus when he was but a toddler and was still coming into womanhood the mother confessor gazed off with a wistful smile i swatted his bottom when he misbehaved and later twisted his ear to make him sit at a lesson he was mischief on two legs driven not by guile but by curiosity he grew into a fine man for a long time when the war with dhara started wizard zorander wouldnt help us he didnt want to fight to hurt people but in the end when pants rahl the leader of dhara started using magic to slaughter our people zedd knew that the only hope to save more lives in the end was to fight zeddicus zul zorander may look young to you as he did to many of us but he is a special wizard born of a wizard and a sorceress zedd was a prodigy even those other wizards in there some of them his teachers dont always understand how he is able to unravel some of the enigmas in the books or how he uses his gift to bring so much power to bear but we do understand that he has heart he uses his heart as well as his head he was named first wizard for all these things and more yes abby said he is very talented at being the wind of death the mother confessor smiled a small smile she tapped her chest among ourselves those of us who really know him call him the trickster the trickster is the name he has truly earned we named him the wind of death for others to hear so as to strike terror into the hearts of the enemy some people on our side take that name to heart perhaps since your mother was gifted you can understand how people sometimes unreasonably fear those with magic and sometimes abby argued those with magic really are monsters who care nothing for the life they destroy the mother confessor appraised abbys eyes a moment and then held up a cautionary finger in confidence am going to tell you about zeddicus zul zorander if you ever repeat this story i will never forgive you for betraying my confidence i wont but i dont see just listen after abby remained silent the mother confessor began zedd married erilyn she was a wonderful woman we all loved her very much but not as much as did he they had a daughter abbys curiosity got the best of her how old is she about the age of your daughter delora said abby swallowed i see when zedd became first wizard things were grim panis rahl had conjured the shadow people im from coney crossing ive never heard of such a thing well the war had been bad enough but then panis rahl taught his wizards to conjure shadow people the mother confessor sighed at the anguish of retelling the story they are so called because they are like shadows in the air they have no precise shape or form they are not living but created out of magic weapons have no more effect on them than they would have on smoke you cant hide from the shadow people they drift towards you across fields or through the woods they find you when they touch someone the persons whole body blisters and swells until their flesh splits open they die in screaming agony not even the gift can heal one touched by a shadow person as the enemy attacked their wizards would send the shadow people out ahead in the beginning whole battalions of our brave young soldiers were found killed to a man we saw no hope it was our darkest hour and wizard zorander was able to stop them abby asked the mother confessor nodded he studied the problem and then conjured battle horns their magic swept the shadow people away like smoke in the wind the magic coming from the horns also traced its way back through the spell to seek out the one who cast it and kill them the horns arent foolproof though and zedd must constantly alter their magic to keep up with the way the enemy changes their conjuring panis rahl summoned other magic too fevers and sickness wasting illnesses fogs that caused blindness all sorts of horrors zedd worked day and night and managed to counter them all while panis ranis magic was being checked our troops were once again able to fight on even terms because of wizard zorander the tide of battle turned well that much of it is good but the mother confessor again lifted her finger commanding silence abby held her tongue as the woman lowered her hand and went on panis rahl was enraged at what zedd had done he tried and failed to kill him so he instead sent a quad to kill erilyn a quad whats a quad a quad the sorceress answered is a unit of four special assassins sent with the protection of a spell from the one who sent them panis rahl it is not only their assignment to kill the victim but to make it unimaginably torturous and brutal abby swallowed and did they murder his wife the mother confessor leaned closer worse they left her her legs and arms all broken to be found still alive alive abby whispered why would they leave her alive if it was their mission to kill her so that zedd would find her all broken and bleeding and in inconceivable agony she was able only to whisper his name in love the mother confessor leaned even closer abby could feel the breath of the womans whispered words against her own face when he used his gift to try to heal her it activated the worm spell abby had to force herself to blink worm spell no wizard would have been able to detect it the mother confessor clawed her fingers and in front of abbys stomach spread her hands outward in a tearing gesture the spell ripped her insides apart because he had used his loving touch of magic she died in screaming pain as he knelt helpless beside her wincing abby touched her own stomach almost feeling the wound thats terrible the mother confessors violet eyes held an iron look the quad also took their daughter their daughter who had seen everything those men had done to her mother abby felt tears burning her eyes again they did that to his daughter too no the mother confessor said they hold her captive then she still lives there is still hope the mother confessors satiny white dress rustled softly as she leaned back against the white marble balustrade and nested her hands in her lap zedd went after the quad he found them but his daughter had been given to others and they passed her on to yet others and so on so they had no idea who had her or where she might be abby looked to the sorceress and back to the mother confessor what did wizard zorander do to the quad no less than i myself would have done the mother confessor stared back through a mask of cold rage he made them regret ever being born for a very long time he made them regret it abby shrank back i see as the mother confessor drew a calming breath the sorceress took up the story as we speak wizard zorander uses a spell that none of us understands it holds panis rahl at his palace in dhara it helps blunt the magic rahl is able to conjure against us and enables our men to drive his troops back whence they came but panis rahl is consumed with wrath for the man who has thwarted his conquest of the midlands hardly a week passes that an attempt is not made on wizard zoranders life rahl sends dangerous and vile people of all sorts even the mordsith abbys breath caught that was a word she had heard what are mordsith the sorceress smoothed back her glossy black hair as she glared with a venomous expression mordsith are women who along with their red leather uniform wear a single long braid as the mark of their profession they are trained in the torture and killing of those with the gift if a gifted person tries to use their magic against a mordsith she is able to capture their magic and use it against them there is no escaping a mordsith but surely a person as strong in the gift as wizard zorander even he would be lost if he tried to use magic against a mordsith the mother confessor said a mordsith can be defeated with common weapons but not with magic only the magic of a confessor works against them i have killed two in part because of the brutal nature of the training of mordsith they have been outlawed for as long as anyone knows but in dhara the ghastly tradition of taking young women to be indoctrinated as mordsith continues to this day dhara is a distant and secretive land we dont know much about it except what we have learned through unfortunate experience mordsith have captured several of our wizards and sorceresses once captured they cannot kill themselves nor can they escape before they die they give over everything they know panis rahl knows of our plans we too have managed to get our hands on several highranking dharans and through the touch of confessors we know the extent of how we have been compromised time works against us abby wiped the palms of her hands on her thighs and that man who was killed just before i went in to see the first wizard he couldnt have been an assassin the two with him were allowed to leave no he was not an assassin the mother confessor folded her hands i believe panis rahl knows of the spell wizard zorander discovered that it has the potential to obliterate all of dhara panis rahl is desperate to rid himself of wizard zorander the mother confessors violet eyes seemed to glisten with a keen intellect abby looked away and picked at a stray thread on her sack but i dont see what this has to do with denying me help to save my daughter he has a daughter wouldnt he do anything to get her back wouldnt he do whatever he must to have his daughter back and safe the mother confessors head lowered and she stroked her fingers over her brow as if trying to rub at a grievous ache the man who came before you was a messenger his message had been passed through many hands so that it could not be traced back to its source abby felt cold goose bumps running up her arms what was the message the lock of hair he brought was from zedds daughter panis rah offered the life of zedds daughter if zedd would surrender himself to panis rahl to be executed abby clutched at her sack but wouldnt a father who loved his daughter do even this to save her life at what cost the mother confessor whispered at the cost of the lives of all those who will die without his help he couldnt do such a selfish thing even to save the life of one he loves more than any other before he denied your daughter help he had just refused the offer thus sentencing his own innocent daughter to death abby felt her hopes again tumbling into blackness the thought of janas terror of her being hurt made abby dizzy and sick tears began running down her cheeks again but im not asking him to sacrifice everyone else to save her the sorceress gently touched abbys shoulder he believes that sparing those people harm would mean letting the dharans escape to kill more people in the end abby snatched desperately for a solution but i have a bone the sorceress sighed abigail half the people who come to see a wizard bring a bone hucksters convince supplicants that they are true bones desperate people just like you buy them most of them come seeking a wizard to somehow give them a life free of magic the mother confessor said most people fear magic but im afraid that with the way its been used by dhara they now want nothing so much as to never again see magic an ironic reason to buy a bone and doubly ironic that they buy sham bones thinking they have magic in order to petition to be free of magic abby blinked but i bought no bone this is a debt true on my mothers deathbed she told me of it she said it was wizard zorander himself bound in it the sorceress squinted her scepticism abigail true debts of this nature are exceedingly rare perhaps it was a bone she had and you only thought abby held her sack open for the sorceress to see the sorceress glanced in and fell silent the mother confessor looked in the sack for herself t know what my mother told me abby insisted she also told me that if there was any doubt he had but to test it then he would know it true for the debt was passed down to him from his father the sorceress stroked the beads at her throat he could test it if it is true he would know still solemn debt though it may be that doesnt mean that the debt must be paid now abby leaned boldly towards the sorceress my mother said it is a debt true and that it had to be paid please delora you know the nature of such things i was so confused when i met with him with all those people shouting i foolishly failed to press my case by asking that he test it she turned and clutched the mother confessors arm please help me tell him what i have and ask that he test it the mother confessor considered behind a blank expression at last she spoke this involves a debt bound in magic such a thing must be considered seriously i will speak to wizard zorander on your behalf and request that you be given a private audience abby squeezed her eyes shut as tears sprang anew thank you she put her face in both hands and began to weep with relief at the flame of hope rekindled the mother confessor gripped abbys shoulders i said i will try he may deny my request the sorceress snorted a humourless laugh not likely i will twist his ear too but abigail that does not mean that we can convince him to help you bone or no bone abby wiped her cheek t understand thank you both thank you both for understanding with a thumb the sorceress wiped a tear from abbys chin tt is said that the daughter of a sorceress is a daughter to all sorceresses the mother confessor stood and smoothed her white dress delora perhaps you could take abigail to a rooming house for women travellers she should get some rest do you have money child yes mother confessor good delora will take you to a room for the night return to the keep just before sunrise we will meet you and let you know if we were able to convince zedd to test your bone i will pray to the good spirits that wizard zorander will see me and help my daughter abby felt sudden shame at her own words and i will pray too for his daughter the mother confessor cupped abbys cheek tray for all of us child pray that wizard zorander unleashes the magic against dhara before it is too late for all the children of the midlands old and young alikeвђ on their walk down to the city delora kept the conversation from abbys worries and hopes and what magic might contribute to either in some ways talking with the sorceress was reminiscent of talking with her mother sorceresses evaded talk of magic with one not gifted daughter or not abby got the feeling that it was as uncomfortable for them as it was for abby when jana asked how a mother came to have a child in her tummy even though it was late the streets were teeming with people worried gossip of the war floated to abbys ears from every direction at one corner a knot of women murmured tearfully of menfolk gone for months with no word of their late delora took abby down a market street and had her buy a small loaf of bread with meats and olives baked right inside abby wasnt really hungry the sorceress made her promise that she would eat not wanting to do anything to cause disfavour abby promised the rooming house was up a sidestreet among tightly packed buildings the racket of the market carried up the narrow street and flittered around buildings and through liny courtyards with the ease of a chickadee through a dense wood abby wondered how people could stand to live so close together and with nothing to see but other houses and people she wondered too how she was going to be able to sleep with all the strange sounds and noise but then sleep had rarely come since she had left home despite the deadquiet nights in the countryside the sorceress bid abby a good night putting her in the hands of a sullenlooking woman of few words who led her to a room at the end of a long hall and left her to her nights rest after collecting a silver coin abby sat on the edge of the bed and by the light of a single lamp sitting on a shelf by the bed eyed the small room as she nibbled at the loaf of bread the meat inside was tough and stringy but had an agreeable flavour spiced with salt and garlic without a window the room wasnt as noisy as abby had feared it might be the door had no bolt but the woman who kept the house had said in a mumble for her not to fret that no men were allowed in the establishment abby set the bread aside and at a basin atop a simple stand two strides across the room washed her face she was surprised at how dirty it left the water she twisted the lever stem on the lamp lowering the wick as far as it would go without snuffing the flame she didnt like sleeping in the dark in a strange place lying in bed staring up at the waterstained ceiling she prayed earnestly to the good spirits despite knowing that they would ignore a request such as she made she closed her eyes and prayed for wizard zoranders daughter too her prayers were fragmented by intruding fears that felt as if they clawed her insides raw she didnt know how long she had lain in the bed wishing for sleep to take her wishing for morning to come when the door slowly squeaked open a shadow climbed the far wall abby froze eyes wide breath held tight as she watched a crouched figure move towards the bed it wasnt the woman of the house she would be taller abbys fingers tightened on the scratchy blanket thinking that maybe she could throw it over the intruder and then run for the door dont be alarmed dearie ive just come to see if you had success up at the keep abby gulped air and sat up in the bed mariska it was the old woman who had waited with her in the line all day you frightened the wits out of me the small flame from the lamp reflected in a sharp shimmer in the womans eye as she surveyed abbys face worse things to fear than your own safety what do you mean mariska smiled it was not a reassuring smile did you get what you wanted i saw the first wizard if thats what you mean and what did he say dearie abby swung her feet down off the bed thats my business the sly smile widened oh no dearie its our business what do you mean by that answer the question youve not much time left your family has not much time left abby shot to her feet how do you the old woman seized abbys wrist and twisted until abby was forced to sit what say the first wizard he said he couldnt help me please that hurts let me go oh dearie thats too bad it is too bad for your little jana how how do you know about her i never so wizard zorander denied your petition such sad news she clicked her tongue poor unfortunate little jana you were warned you knew the price of failure she released abbys wrist and turned away abbys mind raced in hot panic as the woman shuffled towards the door no please im to see him again tomorrow at sunrise mariska peered back over her shoulder why why would he agree to see you again after he has denied you lying will buy your daughter no more time it will buy her nothing its true i swear it on my mothers soul i talked to the sorceress the one who took us in i talked to her and the mother confessor after wizard zorander denied my petition they agreed to convince him to give me a private audience her brow bunched why would they do this abby pointed to her sack sitting on the end of the bed i showed them what i broughtвђ with one gnarled finger mariska lifted open the sack she looked for a moment and then glided closer to abby you have yet to show this to wizard zorander thats right they will get me an audience with him im sure of it tomorrow he will see me from her bulky waistband mariska drew a knife she waved it slowly back and forth before abbys face we grow weary of waiting for you abby licked her lips but i in the morning i leave for coney crossing i leave to see your frightened little jana her hand slid behind abbys neck fingers like oak roots gripped abbys hair holding her head fast if you bring him right behind me she will go free as you were promised abby couldnt nod will i swear ill convince him he is bound by a debt mariska put the point of the knife so close to abbys eye that it brushed her eyelashes abby feared to blink arrive late and i will stab my knife in little janas eye stab it through will leave her the other so that she can watch as i cut out her fathers heart just so that she will know how much it will hurt when i do her do you understand dearie abby could only whine that she did as tears streamed down her cheeks theres a good girl mariska whispered from so close that abby was forced to breathe the spicy stink of the womans sausage dinner if we even suspect any tricks they will all die no tricks ill hurry ill bring him mariska kissed abbys forehead youre a good mother she released abbys hair jana loves you she cries for you day and night after mariska closed the door abby curled into a trembling ball in the bed and wept against her knuckles delora leaned closer as they marched across the broad rampart are you sure youre all right abigail wind snatched at her hair flicking it across her face brushing it from her eyes abby looked out at the sprawl of the city below beginning to coalesce out of the gloom she had been saying a silent prayer to her mothers spirit yes i just had a bad night i couldnt sleep the mother confessors shoulder pressed against abbys from the other side we understand at least he agreed to see you take heart in that hes a good man he really is thank you abby whispered in shame thank you both for helping me the people waiting along the rampart wizards sorceresses officers and others all momentarily fell silent and bowed towards the mother confessor as the three women passed among several people she recognized from the day before abby saw the wizard thomas grumbling to himself and looking hugely impatient and vexed as he shuffled through a handful of papers covered in what abby recognized as magical symbols at the end of the rampart they came to the stone face of a round turret a steep roof overhead protruded down low above a roundtopped door the sorceress rapped on the door and opened it without waiting for a reply she caught the twitch of abbys brow he rarely hears the knock she explained in a hushed tone the stone room was small but had a cosy feel to it a round window to the right overlooked the city below and another on the opposite side looked up on soaring walls of the keep the distant highest ones glowing pink in the first faint rays of dawn an elaborate iron candelabrum held a small army of candles that provided a warm glow to the room wizard zorander his unruly wavy brown hair hanging down around his face as he leaned on his hands was absorbed in studying a book lying open on the table the three women came to a halt wizard zorander the sorceress announced we bring abigail born of helsa bags woman the wizard grouched without looking up i heard your knock as i always do dont you curse at me zeddicus zul zorander delora grumbled back he ignored the sorceress rubbing his smooth chin as he considered the book before him welcome abigail abbys fingers fumbled at the sack but then she remembered herself and curtsied thank you for seeing me wizard zorander it is of vital importance that i have your help as ive already told you the lives of innocent children are at stake wizard zorander finally peered up after appraising her a long moment he straightened where does the line lie abby glanced to the sorceress on one side of her and then the mother confessor on the other side neither looked back excuse me wizard zorander the line the wizards brow drew down you imply a higher value to a life because of a young age the line my dear child across which the value of life becomes petty where is the line but a child he held up a cautionary finger do not think to play on my emotions by plying me with the value of the life of a child as if a higher value can be placed on life because of age when is life worth less where is the line at what age who decides all life is of value dead is dead no matter the age dont think to produce a suspension of my reason with a callous calculated twisting of emotion like some slippery officeholder stirring the passions of a mindless mob abby was struck speechless by such an admonition the wizard turned his attention to the mother confessor speaking of bureaucrats what did the council have to say for themselves the mother confessor clasped her hands and sighed i told them your words simply put they didnt care they want it done he grunted his discontent do they now his hazel eyes turned to abby seems the council doesnt care about the lives of even children when the children are dharan he wiped a hand across his tiredlooking eyes i cant say i dont comprehend their reasoning or that i disagree with them but dear spirits they are not the ones to do it it is not by their hand it will be by mine i understand zedd the mother confessor murmured once again he seemed to notice abby standing before him he considered her as if pondering some profound notion it made her fidget he held out his hand and waggled his fingers let me see it then abby stepped closer to the table as she reached in her sack if you cannot be persuaded to help innocent people then maybe this will mean something more to you she drew her mothers skull from the sack and placed it in the wizards upturned palm it is a debt of bones i declare it due one eyebrow lifted it is customary to bring only a tiny fragment of bone child abby felt her face flush i didnt know she stammered i wanted to be sure there was enough to test to be sure you would believe me he smoothed a gentle hand over the top of the skull a piece smaller than a grain of sand is enough he watched abbys eyes didnt your mother tell you abby shook her head she said only that it was a debt passed to you from your father she said the debt must be paid if it was called due indeed it must he whispered even as he spoke his hand was gliding back and forth over the skull the bone was dull and stained by the dirt from which abby had pulled it not at all the pristine white she had fancied it would be it had horrified her to have to uncover her mothers bones but the alternative horrified her more beneath the wizards fingers the hone of the skull began to glow with soft amber light abbys breathing nearly stilled when the air hummed as if the spirits themselves whispered to the wizard the sorceress fussed with the beads at her neck the mother confessor chewed her lower lip abby prayed wizard zorander set the skull on the table and turned his back on them the amber glow faded away when he said nothing abby spoke into the thick silence well are you satisfied did your test prove it a debt true oh yes he said quietly without turning towards them it is a debt of bones true bound by the magic invoked until the debt is paid abbys fingers worried at the frayed edge of her sack t told you my mother wouldnt have lied to me she told me that if not paid while she was alive it became a debt of bones upon her death the wizard slowly rounded to face her and did she tell you anything of the engendering of the debt no abby cast a furtive sidelong glance at delora before going on sorceresses hold secrets close and reveal only that which serves their purposes with a slight fleeting smile he grunted his concurrence she said only that it was your father and she who were bound in it and that until paid it would continue to pass on to the descendants of each your mother spoke the truth but that does not mean that it must be paid now it is a solemn debt of bones abbys frustration and fear erupted with om i declare it due you will yield to the obligation both the sorceress and the mother confessor gazed off at the walls uneasy at a woman an ungifted woman raising her voice to the first wizard himself abby suddenly wondered if she might be struck dead for such insolence but if he didnt help her it wouldnt matter the mother confessor diverted the possible results of abbys outburst with a question zedd did your reading tell you of the nature of the engendering of the debt indeed it did he said my father too told me of a debt my test has proven to me that this is the one of which he spoke and that the woman standing before me carries the other half of the link so what was the engendering the sorceress asked he turned his palms up it seems to have slipped my mind im sorry i find myself to be more forgetful than usual of late delora sniffed and you dare to call sorceresses taciturn wizard zorander silently considered her a moment and then turned a squint on the mother confessor the council wants it done do they he smiled a sly smile then it shall be done the mother confessor cocked her head zedd are you sure about this about what abby asked are you going to honour the debt or not the wizard shrugged you have declared the debt due he plucked a small book from the table and slipped it into a pocket in his robe who am i to argue dear spirits the mother confessor whispered to herself zedd just because the council i am just a wizard he said cutting her off serving the wants and wishes of the people but if you travel to this place you would be exposing yourself to needless danger i must be near the border or it will claim parts of the midlands too coney crossing is as good a place as any other to ignite the conflagration beside herself with relief abby was hardly hearing anything else he said thank you wizard zorander thank you he strode around the table and gripped her shoulder with sticklike fingers of surprising strength we are bound you and i in a debt of bones our life paths have intersected his smile looked at once sad and sincere his powerful ringers closed around her wrist around her bracelet and he put her mothers skull in her hands please abby call me zedd near tears she nodded thank you zedd outside in the early light they were accosted by the waiting crowd wizard thomas waving his papers shoved his way through zorander ive been studying these elements youve provided i have to talk to you talk thenвђ the first wizard said as he marched by the crowd followed in his wake this is madness t never said it wasnt wizard thomas shook the papers as if for proof you cant do this zorander the council has decided that it is to be done the war must be ended while we have the upper hand and before panis rahl comes up with something we wont be able to counter no i mean ive studied this thing and you wont be able to do it we dont understand the power those wizards wielded ive looked over the elements youve shown me even trying to invoke such a thing will create intense heat zedd halted and put his face close to thomas he lifted his eyebrows in mock surprise really thomas do you think igniting a light spell that will rip the fabric of the world of life might cause an instability in the elements of the web field thomas charged after as zedd stormed off zorander you wont be able to control it if you were able to invoke it and im not saying i believe you can you would breach the grace the invocation uses heat the breach feeds it you wont be able to control the cascade no one can do such a thing i can do itвђ the first wizard muttered thomas shook the fists of papers in a fury zorander your arrogance will be the end of us all once parted the veil will be rent and all life will be consumed i demand to see the book in which you found this spell i demand to see it myself the whole thing not just parts of it the first wizard paused and lifted a finger thomas if you were meant to see the book then you would be first wizard and have access to the first wizards private enclave but you are not and you dont thomass face glowed scarlet above his white beard this is a foolhardy act of desperation wizard zorander flicked the finger the papers flew from the old wizards hand and swirled up into a whirlwind there to ignite flaring into ashes that lifted away on the wind sometimes thomas all that is left to you is an act of desperation i am first wizard and i will do as i must that is the end of it i will hear no more he turned and snatched the sleeve of an officer alert the lancers gather all the cavalry available we ride for pendisan reach at once the man thumped a quick salute to his chest before dashing off another officer older and looking to be of much higher rank cleared his throat wizard zorander may i know of your plan it is anargo the first wizard said who is the right hand of panis rahl and in conjunction with rahl conjures death to stalk us quite simply put i intend to send death back at them by leading the lancers into pendisan reach yes anargo holds at coney crossing we have general brainard driving north towards pendisan reach general sanderson sweeping south to join with him and mardale charging up from the southwest we will go in there with the lancers and whoever of the rest of them is able to join with us anargo is no fool we dont know how many other wizards and gifted he has with him but we know what theyre capable of theyve bled us time and time again at last we have dealt them a blow the officer chose his words carefully why do you think they wait why wouldnt they simply slip back into dhara zedd rested a hand on the crenellated wall and gazed out on the dawn out on the city below anargo relishes the game he performs it with high drama he wants us to think them wounded pendisan reach is the only terrain in all those mountains that an army can get through with any speed coney crossing provides a wide field for battle but not wide enough to let us manoeuvre easily or flank them he is trying to bait us in the officer didnt seem surprised but why zedd looked back over his shoulder at the officer obviously he believes that in such terrain he can defeat us i believe otherwise he knows that we cant allow the menace to remain there and he knows our plans he thinks to draw me in kill me and end the threat i alone hold over them so the officer reasoned aloud you are saying that for anargo it is worth the risk zedd stared out once more at the city below the wizards keep if anargo is right he could win it all at coney crossing when he has finished me he will turn his gifted loose slaughter the bulk of our forces all in one place and then virtually unopposed cut out the heart of the midlands aydindril anargo plans that before the snow flies he will have killed me annihilated our joint forces have the people of the midlands in chains and be able to hand the whip to panis rahl the officer stared dumbfounded and you plan to do as anargo is hoping and go in there to face him zedd shrugged what choice have i and do you at least know how anargo plans to kill you so that we might take precautions take countermeasures im afraid not vexed he waved his hand dismissing the matter he turned to abby the lancers have swift horses we will ride hard we will be to your home soon we will be there in time and then well see to our business abby only nodded she couldnt put into words the relief of her petition granted nor could she express the shame she felt to have her prayer answered but most of all she couldnt utter a word of her horror at what she was doing for she knew the dharans plan flies swarmed around dried scraps of viscera all that was left of abbys prized bearded pigs apparently even the breeding stock which abbys parents had given her as a wedding gift had been slaughtered and taken abbys parents too had chosen abbys husband abby had never met him before he came from the town of lynford where her mother and father bought the pigs abby had been beside herself with anxiety over who her parents would choose for her husband she had hoped for a man who would be of good cheer a man to bring a smile to the difficulties of life when she first saw philip she thought he must be the most serious man in all the world his young face looked to her as if it had never once smiled that first night after meeting him she had cried herself to sleep over thoughts of sharing her life with so solemn a man she thought her life caught up on the sharp tines of grim fate abby came to find that philip was a hardworking man who looked out at life through a great grin that first day she had seen him she only later learned he had been putting on his most sober face so that his new family would not think him a slacker unworthy of their daughter in a short time abby had come to know that philip was a man upon whom she could depend by the time jana had been born she had come to love him now philip and so many others depended upon her abby brushed her hands clean after putting her mothers bones to rest once more the fences jana had watched philip so often mend she saw were all broken down coming back around the house she noticed that barn doors were missing anything an animal or human could eat was gone abby could not recall having ever seen her home looking so barren it didnt matter she told herself it didnt matter if only jana would be returned to her fences could be mended pigs could be replaced somehow someday jana could never be replaced abby zedd asked as he peered around at the ruins of her home how is it that you werent taken when your husband and daughter and everyone else were abby stepped through the broken doorway thinking that her home had never looked so small before she had gone to aydindril to the wizards keep her home had seemed as big as anything she could imagine here philip had laughed and filled the simple room with his comfort and conversation with charcoal he had drawn animals on the stone hearth for jana abby pointed under that door is the root cellar thats where i was when i heard the things i told you about zedd ran the toe of his boot across the knothole used as a fingerhold to lift the hatch they were taking your husband and your daughter and you stayed down there while your daughter was screaming for you you didnt run up to help her abby summoned her voice knew that if i came up they would have me too i knew that the only chance my family had was if i waited and then went for help my mother always told me that even a sorceress was no more than a fool if she acted like one she always toid me to think things through first wise advice zedd set down a ladle that had been bent and holed he rested a gentle hand on her shoulder it would have been hard to leave your daughter crying for you and do the wise thing abby could only manage a whisper you speak the spirits own truth she pointed through the window on the side wall that way across the coney river lies town they took jana and philip with them as they went on to take all the people from town they had others too that they had already captured the army set up camp in the hills beyond zedd stood at the window gazing out at the distant hills soon i hope this war will be ended dear spirits let it end remembering the mother confessors admonition not to repeat the story she told abby never asked about the wizards daughter or murdered wife when on their swift journey back to coney crossing she spoke of her love for jana it must have broken his heart to think of his own daughter in the brutal hands of the enemy knowing that he had left her to death lest many more die zedd pushed open the bedroom door and back here he asked as he put his head into the room beyond abby looked up from her thoughts the bedroom in the rear is a door back to the garden and the barn though he never once mentioned his dead wife or missing daughter abbys knowledge of them ate away at her like a swelling spring river ate at a hole in the ice zedd stepped back in from the bedroom as delora came silently slipping in through the front doorway as abigail said the town across the river has been sacked the sorceress reported from the looks of it the people were all taken zedd brushed back his wavy hair how close is the river abby gestured out the window night was falling just there a walk of five minutes in the valley on its way to join the kern the coney river slowed and spread wide so that it became shallow enough to cross easily there was no bridge the road simply led to the rivers edge and took up again on the other side though the river was near to a quartermile across in most of the valley it was in no place much more than kneedeep only in the spring melt was it occasionally treacherous to cross the town of coney crossing was two miles beyond up on the rise of hills safe from spring floods as was the knoll where abbys farmyard stood zedd took delora by the elbow ride back and tell everyone to hold station if anything goes wrong well if anything goes wrong then they must attack anargos legion must be stopped even if they have to go into dhara after them delora did not look pleased before we left the mother confessor made me promise that i would be sure that you were not left alone she told me to see to it that gifted were always near if you needed them abby too had heard the mother confessor issue the orders looking back at the keep as they had crossed the stone bridge abby had seen the mother confessor up on a high rampart watching them leave the mother confessor had helped when abby had feared all was lost she wondered what would become of the woman then she remembered she didnt have to wonder she knew the wizard ignored what the sorceress had said as soon as i help abby ill send her back too i dont want anyone near when i unleash the spell delora gripped his collar and pulled him close she looked as if she might be about to give him a heated scolding instead she drew him into an embrace please zedd she whispered dont leave us without you as first wizard zedd smoothed back her dark hair and abandon you all to thomas he smirked never the dust from deloras horse drifted away into the gathering darkness as zedd and abby descended the slope towards the river abby led him along the path through the tall grasses and rushes explaining that the path would offer them better concealment than the road abby was thankful that he didnt argue for the road her eyes darted from the deep shadows on one side to the shadows on the other as they were swallowed into the brush her pulse raced she flinched whenever a twig snapped underfoot it happened as she feared it would as she knew it would a figure enfolded in a long hooded cloak darted out of nowhere knocking abby aside she saw the flash of a blade as zedd flipped the attacker into the brush he squatted putting a hand back on abbys shoulder as she lay in the grass panting stay down he whispered urgently light gathered at his fingers he was conjuring magic that was what they wanted him to do tears welled burning her eyes she snatched his sleeve zedd dont use magic she could hardly speak past the tightening pain in her chest dont the figure sprang again from the gloom of the bushes zedd threw up a hand the night lit with a flash of hot light that struck the cloaked figure rather than the assailant going down it was zedd who cried out and crumpled to the ground whatever he had thought to do to the attacker it had been turned back on him and he was in the grip of the most terrible anguish preventing him from rising or speaking that was why they had wanted him to conjure magic so they could capture him the figure standing over the wizard glowered at abby your part here is finished go abby scuttled into the grass the woman pushed the hood back and cast off her cloak in the near darkness abby could see the womans long braid and red leather uniform it was one of the women abby had been told about the women used to capture those with magic the mordsith the mordsith watched with satisfaction as the wizard at her feet writhed in choking pain well well looks like the first wizard himself has just made a very big mistake the belts and straps of her red leather uniform creaked as she leaned down towards him grinning at his agony i have been given the whole night to make you regret ever having lifted a finger to resist us in the morning im to allow you to watch as our forces annihilate your people afterwards i am to take you to lord rahl himself the man who ordered the death of your wife so you can beg him to order me to kill you too she kicked him so you can beg lord rahl for your death as you watch your daughter die before your eyes zedd could only scream in horror and pain on her hands and knees abby crabbed her way farther back into the weeds and rushes she wiped at her eyes trying to see she was horrified to witness what was being done to the man who had agreed to help her for no more reason than a debt to her mother by contrast these people had coerced her service by holding hostage the life of her child as she backed away abby saw the knife the mordsith had dropped when zedd had thrown her into the weeds the knife was a pretext used to provoke him to act it was magic that was the true weapon the mordsith had used his own magic against him used it to cripple and capture him and now used it to hurt him it was the price demanded abby had complied she had no choice but what toll was she imposing on others how could she save her daughters life at the cost of so many others would jana grow up to be a slave to people who would do this with a mother who would allow it jana would grow up to learn to bow to panis rahl and his minions to submit to evil or worse grow up to become a willing party to the scourge never tasting liberty or knowing the value of honour with dreadful finality everything seemed to fall to ruin in abbys mind she snatched up the knife zedd was wailing in pain as the mordsith bent doing some foul thing to him before she had time to lose her resolve abby was moving towards the womans back abby had butchered animals she told herself that this was no different these were not people but animals she lifted the knife a hand clamped over her mouth another seized her wrist abby moaned against the hand against her failure to stop this madness when she had had the chance a mouth close to her ear urged her to hush struggling against the figure in a hooded cloak that held her abby turned her head as much as she could and in the last of the daylight saw violet eyes looking back for a moment she couldnt make sense of it couldnt make sense of how the woman could be there when abby had seen her remain behind but it truly was her abby stilled the mother confessor released her and with a quick hand signal urged her back abby didnt question she scurried back into the rushes as the mother confessor reached out towards the woman in red leather the mordsith was bent over intent on her grisly business with the screaming wizard in the distance bugs chirped and clicked frogs called with insistent croaks not far away the river sloshed and burbled as it always did a familiar comforting sound of home and then there came a sudden violent concussion to the air thunder without sound it drove the wind from abbys lungs the wallop nearly knocked her senseless making every joint in her body burn in sharp pain there was no flash of light just that pure and flawless jolt to the air the world seemed to stop in its terrible splendour grass flattened as if in a wind radiating out in a ring from the mordsith and the mother confessor abbys senses returned as the pain in her joints thankfully melted away abby had never seen it done before and had never expected to see it in the whole of her life but she knew without doubt that she had just witnessed a confessor unleashing her power from what abbys mother had told her it was the destruction of a persons mind so complete that it left only numb devotion to the confessor she had but to ask and they would confess any truth no matter the crime they had previously attempted to conceal or deny mistress the mordsith moaned in piteous lamentation abby first staggered by the shock of the soundless thunder of the mother confessors power and now stunned by the abject anguish of the woman crumpled on the ground felt a hand grip her arm it was the wizard with the back of his other hand he wiped blood from his mouth he laboured to get his breath leave her to it zedd i im so sorry i tried to tell you not to use magic but i didnt call loud enough for you to hear he managed to smile through obvious pain i heard you but why then did you use your gift i thought that in the end you would not be the kind of person to do such a terrible thing and that you would show your true heart he pulled her away from the cries we used you we wanted them to think they had succeeded you knew what i was going to do you knew i was to bring you to them so that they could capture you i had a good idea from the first there seemed more to you than you presented you are not very talented at being a spy and a traitor since we arrived here youve been watching the shadows and jumping at the chirp of every bug the mother confessor rushed up zedd are you all right he put a hand on her shoulder ill be fine his eyes still held the glaze of terror thank you for not being late for a moment i feared i know the mother confessor offered a quick smile let us hope your trick was worth it you have until dawn she said they expect her to torture you all night before bringing you to them in the morning their scouts alerted anargo to our troops arrival back in the rushes the mordsith was screaming as though she were being flayed alive shivers ran through abbys shoulders theyll hear her and know whats happened even if they could hear at this distance they will think it is zedd being tortured by her the mother confessor took the knife from abbys hand i am glad that you rewarded my faith and in the end chose not to join with them abby wiped her palms on her skirts shamed by all she had done by what she had intended to do she was beginning to shake are you going to kill her the mother confessor despite looking boneweary after having touched the mordsith still had iron resolve in her eyes a mordsith is different from anyone else she does not recover from the touch of a confessor she would suffer in profound agony until she dies sometime before morning she glanced back towards the cries she has told us what we need to know and zedd must have his power back it is the merciful thing to do it also buys me time to do what i must do zedds fingers turned abbys face towards him away from the shrieks and time to get jana back you will have until morning i will have until morning what do you mean til explain but we must hurry if you are to have enough time now take off your clothes abby was running out of time she moved through the dharan camp holding herself stiff and tall trying not to look frantic even though that was how she felt all night long she had been doing as the wizard had instructed acting haughty to anyone who noticed her she directed disdain to anyone who looked her way thinking to speak to her she growled not that many though so much as dared to catch the attention of what appeared to be a redleatherclad mordsith zedd had told her too to keep the mordsiths weapon in her fist it looked like nothing more than a small red leather rod how it worked abby had no idea the wizard had said only that it involved magic and she wouldnt be able to call it to her aid but it did have an effect on those who saw it in her hand it made them melt back into the darkness away from the light of the campfires away from abby those who were awake anyway although most people in the camp were sleeping there was no shortage of alert guards zedd had cut the long braid from the mordsith who had attacked him and tied it into abbys hair in the dark the mismatch of colour wasnt obvious when the guards looked at abby they saw a mordsith and quickly turned their attention elsewhere by the apprehension on peoples faces when they saw her coming abby knew she must look fearsome they didnt know how her heart pounded she was thankful for the mantle of night so that the dharans couldnt see her knees trembling she had seen only two real mordsith both sleeping and she had kept far away from them as zedd had warned her real mordsith were not likely to be fooled so easily zedd had given her until dawn time was running out he had told her that if she wasnt back in time she would die abby was thankful she knew the lay of the land or long since she would have become lost among the confusion of tents campfires wagons horses and mules everywhere pikes and lances were stacked upright in circles with their points leaning together men farriers fletchers blacksmiths and craftsmen of all sorts worked through the night the air was thick with woodsmoke and rang with the sound of metal being shaped and sharpened and wood being worked for everything from bows to wagons abby didnt know how people could sleep through the noise but sleep they did shortly the immense camp would wake to a new day a day of battle a day the soldiers went to work doing what they did best they were getting a good nights sleep so they would be rested for the killing of the midlands army from what she had heard dharan soldiers were very good at their job abby had searched relentlessly but she had been unable to find her father her husband or her daughter she had no intention of giving up she had resigned herself to the knowledge that if she didnt find them she would die with them she had found captives tied together and staked to trees or the ground to keep them from running many more were chained some she recognized but many more she didnt most were kept in groups and under guard abby never once saw a guard asleep at his post when they looked her way she acted as if she were looking for someone and she wasnt going to go easy on them when she found them zedd had told her that her safety and the safety of her family depended on her playing the part convincingly abby thought about these people hurting her daughter and it wasnt hard to act angry but she was running out of time she couldnt find them and she knew that zedd would not wait too much was at stake she understood that now she was coming to appreciate that the wizard and the mother confessor were trying to stop a war that they were people resolved to the dreadful task of weighing the lives of a few against the lives of many abby lifted another tentflap and saw soldiers sleeping she squatted and looked at the faces of prisoners tied to wagons they stared back with hollow expressions she bent to gaze at the faces of children pressed together in nightmares she couldnt find jana the huge camp sprawled across the hilly countryside there were a thousand places she could be as she marched along a crooked line of tents she scratched at her wrist only when she went farther did she notice that it was the bracelet warming that made her wrist itch it warmed yet more as she proceeded but then the warmth began fading her brow twitched out of curiosity she turned and went back the way she had come where a pathway between tents turned off her bracelet tingled again with warmth abby paused a moment looking off into the darkness the sky was just beginning to colour with light she took the path between the tents following until the bracelet cooled then backtracked to where it warmed again and took a new direction where it warmed yet more abbys mother had given her the bracelet telling her to wear it always and that someday it would be of value abby wondered if somehow the bracelet had magic that would help her find her daughter with dawn nearing this seemed the only chance she had left she hurried onward wending where the warmth from the bracelet directed the bracelet led her to an expanse of snoring soldiers there were no prisoners in sight guards patrolled the men in bedrolls and blankets there was one tent set among the big men for an officer she guessed not knowing what else to do abby strode among the sleeping men near the tent the bracelet sent tingling heat up her arm abby saw that sentries hung around the small tent like flies around meat the canvas sides glowed softly probably from a candle inside off to the side she noticed a sleeping form different from the men as she got closer she saw that it was a woman mariska the old woman breathed with a little raspy whistle as she slept abby stood paralysed guards looked up at her needing to do something before they asked any questions abby scowled at them and marched towards the tent she tried not to make any noise the guards might think she was a mordsith but mariska would not long be fooled a glare from abby turned the guards eyes to the dark countryside her heart pounding nearly out of control abby gripped the tentflap she knew jana would be inside she told herself that she must not cry out when she saw her daughter she reminded herself that she must put a hand over janas mouth before she could cry out with joy lest they be caught before they had a chance to escape the bracelet was so hot it felt as if it would blister her skin abby ducked into the low tent a trembling little girl huddled in a tattered wool cloak sat in blankets on the ground she stared up with big eyes that blinked with the terror of what might come next abby felt a stab of anguish it was not jana they stared at each other this little girl and abby the childs face was lit clearly by the candle set to the side as abbys must be in those big grey eyes that looked to have beheld unimaginable terrors the little girl seemed to reach a judgement her arms stretched up in supplication instinctively abby fell to her knees and scooped up the little girl hugging her small trembling body the girls spindly arms came out from the tattered cloak and wrapped around abbys neck holding on for dear life help me please the child whimpered in abbys ear before she had picked her up she had seen the face in the candlelight there was no doubt in abbys mind it was zedds daughter ive come to help you abby comforted zedd sent me the child moaned expectantly abby held the girl out at arms length ill take you to your father but you mustnt let these people know im rescuing you can you play along with me can you pretend that youre my prisoner so that i can get you away near tears the girl nodded she had the same wavy hair as zedd and the same eyes although they were an arresting grey not hazel good abby whispered cupping a chilly cheek almost lost in those grey eyes trust me then and i will get you away i trust youвђ came the small voice abby snatched up a rope lying nearby and looped it around the girls neck ill try not to hurt you but i must make them think you are my prisoner the girl cast a worried look at the rope as if she knew the rope well and then nodded that she would go along abby stood once outside the tent and by the rope pulled the child out after her the guards looked her way abby started out one of them scowled as he stepped close whats going on abby stomped to a halt and lifted the red leather rod pointing it at the guards nose she has been summoned and who are you to question get out of my way or ill have you gutted and cleaned for my breakfast the man paled and hurriedly stepped aside before he had time to reconsider abby charged off the girl in tow at the end of the rope dragging her heels making it look real no one followed abby wanted to run but she couldnt she wanted to carry the girl but she couldnt it had to look as if a mordsith was taking a prisoner away rather than take the shortest route back to zedd abby followed the hills upriver to a place where the trees offered concealment almost to the waters edge zedd had told her where to cross and warned her not to return by a different way he had set traps of magic to prevent the dharans from charging down from the hills to stop whatever it was he was going to do closer to the river she saw downstream a way a bank of fog hanging close to the ground zedd had emphatically warned her not to go near any fog she suspected it a poison cloud of some sort that he had conjured the sound of the water told her she was close to the river the pink sky provided enough light to finally see it when she reached the edge of the trees although she could see the massive camp on the hills in the distance behind her she saw no one following abby took the rope from the childs neck the girl watched her with those big round eyes abby lifted her and held her tight hold on and keep quiet pressing the girls head to her shoulder abby ran for the river there was light but it was not the dawn they had crossed the frigid water and made the other side when she first noticed it even as she ran along the bank of the river before she could see the source of the light abby knew that magic was being called there that was unlike any magic she had ever seen before a sound low and thin whined up the river towards her a smell as if the air itself had been burned hung along the riverbank the little girl clung to abby tears running down her face afraid to speak afraid it seemed to hope that she had at last been rescued as if asking a question might somehow make it all vanish like a dream upon waking abby felt tears coursing down her own cheeks when she rounded a bend in the river she spotted the wizard he stood in the centre of the river on a rock that abby had never before seen the rock was just large enough to clear the surface of the water by a few inches making it almost appear as if the wizard stood on the surface of the water before him as he faced towards distant d hara shapes dark and wavering floated in the air they curled around as if confiding in him conversing warning tempting him with floating arms and reaching fingers that wreathed like smoke animate light twisted up around the wizard colours both dark and wondrous glimmered about him cavorting with the shadowy forms undulating through the air it was at once the most enchanting and the most frightening thing abby had ever seen no magic her mother conjured had ever seemed aware but the most frightening thing by far was what hovered in the air before the wizard it appeared to be a molten sphere so hot it glowed from within its surface a crackling of fluid dross an arm of water from the river magically turned skyward in a fountain spray and poured down over the rotating silvery mass the water hissed and steamed as it hit the sphere leaving behind clouds of white vapour to drift away in the gentle dawn wind the molten form blackened at the touch of the water cascading over it and yet the intense inner heat melted the glassy surface again as fast as the water cooled it making the whole thing bubble and boil in midair a pulsing sinister menace transfixed abby let the child slip to the silty ground the little girls arms stretched out papa he was too far away to hear her but he heard zedd turned at once larger than life in the midst of magic abby could see but not begin to fathom yet at the same time small with the frailty of human need tears filled his eyes as he gazed at his daughter standing beside abby this man who seemed to be consulting with spirits looked as if for the first time he were seeing a true apparition zedd leaped off the rock and charged through the water when he reached her and took her up in the safety of his arms she began to wail at last with the contained terror released there there dear one zedd comforted papa is here now oh papa she cried against his neck they hurt mama they were wicked they hurt her so he hushed her tenderly i know dear one i know for the first time abby saw the sorceress and the mother confessor standing off to the side watching they too shed tears at what they were seeing though abby was glad for the wizard and his daughter the sight only intensified the pain in her chest at what she had lost she was choked with tears there there dear one zedd was cooing youre safe now papa wont let anything happen to you youre safe now zedd turned to abby by the time he had smiled his tearful appreciation the child was asleep a little spell he explained when abbys brow twitched with surprise she needs to rest i need to finish what i am doing he put his daughter in abbys arms abby would you take her up to your house where she can sleep until im finished here please put her in bed and cover her up to keep her warm she will sleep for now thinking about her own daughter in the hands of the brutes across the river abby could only nod before turning to the task she was happy for zedd and even felt pride at having rescued his little girl but as she ran for her home she was near to dying with grief over her failure to recover her own family abby settled the dead weight of the sleeping child into her bed she drew the curtain across the small window in her bedroom and unable to resist smoothed back silky hair and pressed a kiss to the soft brow before leaving the girl to her blessed rest with the child safe at last and asleep abby raced back down the knoll to the river she thought to ask zedd to give her just a little more time so she could return to look for her own daughter fear for jana had her heart pounding wildly he owed her a debt and had not yet seen it through wringing her hands abby came to a panting halt at the waters edge she watched the wizard up on his rock in the river light and shadow coursing up around him she had been around magic enough to have the sense to fear approaching him she could hear his chanted words though they were words she had never heard before she recognized the idiosyncratic cadence of words spoken in a spell words calling together frightful forces on the ground beside her was the strange grace she had seen him draw before the one that breached the worlds of life and death the grace was drawn with a sparkling pure white sand that stood out in stark relief against the dark silt abby shuddered even to look upon it much less contemplate its meaning around the grace carefully drawn with the same sparkling white sand were geometric forms of magical invocations abby lowered her fists about to call out to the wizard when delora leaned close abby flinched in surprise not now abigail the sorceress murmured dont disturb him in the middle of this part reluctantly abby heeded the sorceresss words the mother confessor was there too abby chewed her bottom lip as she watched the wizard throw up his arms sparkles of coloured light curled up along twisting shafts of shadows but i must i havent been able to find my family he must help me he must save them its a debt of bones that must be satisfied the other two women shared a look abby the mother confessor said he gave you a chance gave you time he tried he did his best but he has everyone else to think of now the mother confessor took up abbys hand and the sorceress put an arm around abbys shoulders as she stood weeping on the riverbank it wasnt supposed to end this way not after all she had been through not after all she had done despair crushed her the wizard his arms raised called forth more light more shadows more magic the river roiled around him the hissing thing in the air grew as it slowly slumped closer to the water shafts of light shot from the hot rotating bloom of power the sun was rising over the hills behind the dharans this part of the river wasnt as wide as elsewhere and abby could see the activity in the trees beyond men moved about but the fog hanging on the far bank kept them wary kept them in the trees also across the river at the edge of the treecovered hills another wizard had appeared to conjure magic he too stood atop a rock as his arms launched sparkling light up into the air abby thought that the strong morning sun might outshine the conjured illuminations but it didnt abby could stand it no longer zedd she called out across the river zedd please you promised i found your daughter what about mine please dont do this until she is safe zedd turned and looked at her as if from a great distance as if from another world arms of dark forms caressed him fingers of dark smoke dragged along his jaw urging his attention back to them but he gazed instead at abby im so sorry despite the distance abby could clearly hear his whispered words i gave you time to try to find them i can spare no more or countless other mothers will weep for their children mothers still living and mothers in the spirit world abby cried out in an anguished wail as he turned back to the ensorcellment the two women tried to comfort her but abby was not to be comforted in her grief thunder rolled through the hills a clacking clamour from the spell around zedd rose to echo up and down the valley shafts of intense light shot upward it was a disorienting sight light shining up into sunlight across the river the counter to zedds magic seemed to spring forth arms of light twisted like smoke lowering to tangle with the light radiating up around zedd the fog along the riverbank diffused suddenly in answer zedd spread his arms wide the glowing tumbling furnace of molten light thundered the water sluicing over it roared as it boiled and steamed the air wailed as if in protest behind the wizard across the river the dharan soldiers were pouring out of the trees driving their prisoners before them people cried out in terror they quailed at the wizards magic only to be driven onward by the spears and swords at their backs abby saw several who refused to move fall to the blades at the mortal cries the rest rushed onward like sheep before wolves if whatever zedd was doing failed the army of the midlands would then charge into this valley to confront the enemy the prisoners would be caught in the middle a figure worked its way up along the opposite bank dragging a child behind abbys flesh flashed icy cold with sudden frigid sweat it was mariska abby shot a quick glance back over her shoulder it was impossible she squinted across the river nooo zedd called out it was zedds little girl that mariska had by the hair somehow mariska had followed and found the child sleeping in abbys home with no one there to watch over her as she slept mariska had stolen the child back mariska held the child out before herself for zedd to see cease and surrender zorander or she dies abby tore away from the arms holding her and charged into the water she struggled to run against the current to reach the wizard part way there he turned to stare into her eyes abby froze im sorry her own voice sounded to her like a plea before death i thought she was safe zedd nodded in resignation it was out of his hands he turned back to the enemy his arms lifted to his sides his fingers spread as if commanding all to stop magic and men alike let the prisoners go zedd called across the water to the enemy wizard let them go anargo and ill give you all your lives anargos laugh rang out over the water surrenderвђ mariska hissed or she dies the old woman pulled out the knife she kept in the wrap around her waist she pressed the blade to the childs throat the girl was screaming in terror her arms reaching to her father her little fingers clawing the air abby struggled ahead into the water she called out begging mariska to let zedds daughter go free the woman paid no more heed to abby than to zedd last chance mariska called you heard her anargo growled out across the water surrender now or she will die you know i cant put myself above my people zedd called back this is between us anargo let them all go anargos laugh echoed up and down the river you are a fool zorander you had your chance his expression twisted to rage kill her he screamed to mariska fists at his side zedd shrieked the sound seemed to split the morning with its fury mariska lifted the squealing child by her hair abby gasped in disbelief as the woman sliced the little girls throat the child flailed blood spurted across mariskas gnarly fingers as she viciously sawed the blade back and forth she gave a final mighty yank of the knife the bloodsoaked body dropped in a limp heap abby felt vomit welling up in the back of her throat the silty dirt of the riverbank turned a wet red mariska held the severed head high with a howl of victory strings of flesh and blood swung beneath it the mouth hung in a slack silent cryabby threw her arms around zedds legs dear spirits im sorry oh zedd forgive me she wailed in anguish unable to gather her senses at witnessing a sight so grisly and now childвђ zedd asked in a hoarse voice from above what would you have me do would you have me let them win to save your daughter from what they have done to mine tell me child what should i do abby couldnt beg for the life of her family at a cost of such people rampaging unchecked across the land her sickened heart wouldnt allow it how could she sacrifice the lives and peace of everyone else just so her loved ones would live she would be no better than mariska killing innocent children kill them all abby screamed up at the wizard she threw her arm out pointing at mariska and the hateful wizard anargo kill the bastards kill them all zedds arms flung upward the morning cracked with a peal of thunder as if he had loosed it the molten mass before him plunged into the water the ground shook with a jolt a huge geyser of water exploded forth the air itself quaked all around the most dreadful rumbling whipped the water into froth abby squatted down with the water to her waist felt numb not only from the cold but also from the cold knowledge that shed been forsaken by the good spirits she had always thought would watch over her zedd turned and snatched her arm dragging her up on the rock with him it was another world the shapes around them called to her too they reached out bridging the distance between life and death searing pain frightful joy profound peace spread through her at their touch light moved up through her body filling her like air filled her lungs and exploded in showers of sparks in her minds eye the thick howl of the magic was deafening green light ripped through the water across the river anargo had been thrown to the ground the rock atop which he had stood had shattered into needlelike shards the soldiers called out in fright as the air all about danced with swirling smoke and sparks of light run mariska screamed while you have the chance run for your lives already she was racing towards the hills leave the prisoners to die save yourselves run the mood across the river suddenly galvanized with a single determination the dharans dropped their weapons they cast aside the ropes and chains holding the prisoners they kicked up dirt as they turned and ran in a single instant the whole of an army that had a moment before stood grimly facing them were all as if of a single fright running for their lives from the corner of her eye abby saw the mother confessor and the sorceress struggling to run into the water although the water was hardly above their knees it bogged them down in their rush nearly as much as would mud abby watched it all as if in a dream she floated in the light surrounding her pain and rapture were one within her light and dark sound and silence joy and sorrow all were one everything and nothing together in a cauldron of raging magic across the river the dharan army had vanished into the woods dust rose above the trees marking their horses wagons and footfalls racing away while at the riverbank the mother confessor and the sorceress were shoving people into the water screaming at them though abby didnt hear the words so absorbed was she by the strange harmonious trills twisting her thoughts into visions of dancing colour overlaying what her eyes were trying to tell her she thought briefly that surely she was dying she thought briefly that it didnt matter and then her mind was swimming again in the cold colour and hot light the drumming music of magic and worlds meshing the wizards embrace made her feel as if she were being held in her mothers arms again maybe she was abby was aware of the people reaching the midlands side of the river and running ahead of the mother confessor and sorceress they vanished into the rushes and then abby saw them far away beyond the tall grass running uphill away from the sublime sorcery erupting from the river the world thundered around her a subterranean thump brought sharp pain deep in her chest a whine like steel being shredded tore through the morning air all around the water danced and quaked hot steam felt as if it would scald abbys legs the air went white with it the noise hurt her ears so much that she squeezed her eyes shut she saw the same thing with her eyes closed as she saw with them open shadowy shapes swirling through the green air everything was going crazy in her mind making no sense green fury tore at her body and soul abby felt pain as if something inside her tore asunder she gasped and opened her eyes a horrific wall of green fire was receding away from them towards the far side of the river founts of water lashed upward like a thunderstorm in reverse lightning laced together above the surface of the river as the conflagration reached the far bank the ground beneath it rent apart shafts of violet light shot up from the ripping wounds in the earth like the blood of another realm worse though than any of it were the howls howls of the dead abby was sure it felt as if her own soul moaned in sympathy with the agony of cries filling the air from the receding green wall of glimmering fire the shapes twisted and turned calling begging trying to escape the world of the dead she understood now that that was what the wall of green fire was death come to life the wizard had breached the boundary between worlds abby had no idea how much time passed in the grip of the strange light in which she swam there seemed to be no time any more than there was anything solid there was nothing familiar about any of the sensations upon which to hang understanding it seemed to abby that the wall of green fire had halted its advance in the trees on the far hillside the trees over which it had passed and those she could see embraced by the shimmering curtain had blackened and shrivelled at the profound touch of death itself even the grass over which the grim presence had passed looked to have been baked black and crisp by a high summer sun as abby watched the wall it dulled as she stared it seemed to waver in and out of her vision sometimes a glimmering green gloss like molten glass and sometimes no more than a pale hint like a fog just now passed from the air to each side it was spreading a wall of death raging across the world of life abby realized she heard the river again the comfortable common sloshing lapping burbling sounds that she lived her life hearing but most of the time didnt notice zedd hopped down from the rock he took her hand and helped her down abby gripped his hand tightly to brace against the dizzying sensations swimming through her head zedd snapped his fingers and the rock upon which they had just stood leaped into the air causing her to gasp in fright in an instant so brief that she doubted she had seen it zedd caught the rock it had become a small stone smaller than an egg he winked at her as he slipped it into a pocket she thought the wink the oddest thing she could imagine odder even than the boulder now a stone in his pocket on the bank the mother confessor and the sorceress waited they took her arms helping her out of the water the sorceress looked grim zedd why isnt it moving it sounded to abby more like an accusation than a question either way zedd ignored it zedd abby mumbled im so sorry its my fault i shouldnt have left her alone i should have stayed im so sorry the wizard hardly hearing her words was looking off to the wall of death on the other side of the river he brought his clawed fingers up past his chest calling something forth from within himself with a sudden thump to the air fire erupted between his hands he held it out as he would hold an offering abby threw an arm up in front of her face at the heat zedd lifted the roiling ball of liquid fire it grew between his hands tumbling and turning roaring and hissing with rage the three women backed away abby had heard of such fire she had once heard her mother name it in a hushed tone wizards fire even then not seeing or knowing its like those whispered words forming a picture in abbys mind as her mother recounted it had sent a chill through abby wizards fire was the bane of life called forth to scourge an enemy this could be nothing else for killing my love my erilyn the mother of our daughter and all the other innocent loved ones of innocent people zedd whisperedi send you panis rahl the gift of death the wizard opened his arms outward the liquid blue and yellow fire bidden by its master tumbled forward gathering speed roaring away towards dhara as it crossed the river it grew like angry lightning blooming forth wailing with wrathful fury reflecting in glimmering points from the water in thousands of bright sparkles the wizards fire shot across the growing wall of green just catching the upper edge at the contact green flame flared forth some of it tearing away caught up behind the wizards fire trailing after like smoke behind flame the deadly mix howled towards the horizon everyone stood transfixed watching until all trace of it had vanished in the distance when zedd pale and drawn turned back to them abby clutched his robes zedd im so sorry i shouldnt he put his fingers to her lips to silence her there is someone waiting for you he tilted his head she turned back by the rushes philip stood holding janas hand abby gasped with a jolt of giddy joy philip grinned his familiar grin at his other side her father smiled and nodded his approval to her arms reaching abby ran to them janas face wrinkled she backed against philip abby fell to her knees before her its mamaвђ philip said to jana she just has herself some new clothes abby realized jana was frightened by the red leather outfit she was wearing abby grinned through her tears mamajana cried at seeing the smile abby threw her arms around her daughter she laughed and hugged jana so hard the child squeaked in protest abby felt philips hand on her shoulder in loving greeting abby stood and threw an arm around him tears choking her voice her father put a comforting hand to her back while she squeezed janas hand zedd delora and the mother confessor gathered them and herded them up the hill towards the people waiting at the top soldiers mostly officers some that abby recognized a few other people from aydindril and the wizard thomas waited with the freed prisoners among the people liberated were those of coney crossing people who held abby the daughter of a sorceress in no favour but they were her people the people from her home the people she had wanted saved zedd rested a hand on abbys shoulder abby was shocked to see that his wavy brown hair was now partly snowwhite she knew without a lookingglass that hers had undergone the same transformation in the place beyond the world of life where for a time they had been this is abigail born of helsa the wizard called out to the people gathered she is the one who went to aydindril to seek my help though she does not have magic it is because of her that you people are all free she cared enough to beg for your lives abby with philips arm around her waist and janas hand in hers looked from the wizard to the sorceress and then to the mother confessor the mother confessor smiled abby thought it a coldhearted thing to do in view of the fact that zedds daughter had been murdered before their eyes not long before she whispered as much the mother confessors smile widened dont you remember she asked as she leaned close dont you remember what told you we call him abby confused by everything that had happened couldnt imagine what the mother confessor was talking about when she admitted she didnt the mother confessor and the sorceress shepherded her onward past the grave where abby had reburied her mothers skull upon her return and into the house with a hand the mother confessor eased back the door to abbys bedroom there on the bed where abby had placed her was zedds daughter still sleeping abby stared in disbelief the tricksterвђ the mother confessor said i told you that was our name for him and not a very flattering one zedd grumbled as he stepped up behind them but how abby pressed her fingers to her temples i dont understand zedd gestured abby saw for the first time the body tying just beyond the door out the back it was mariska when you showed me the room when we first came here zedd told her i laid a few traps for those intent on harm that woman was killed by those traps because she came here intent on taking my daughter from where she slept you mean it was all an illusion abby was dumbfounded why would you do such a cruel thing how could you i am the object of vengeance the wizard explained i didnt want my daughter to pay the price her mother has already paid since my spell killed the woman as she tried to harm my daughter i was able to use a vision of her to accomplish the deception the enemy knew the woman and that she acted for anargo i used what they expected to see to convince them and to frighten them into running and leaving the prisoners i cast the death spell so that everyone would think they saw my daughter being killed this way the enemy thinks my daughter dead and will have no reason to hunt her or ever again try to harm her i did it to protect her from the unforeseen the sorceress scowled at him if it were any but you zeddicus and for any reason but the reason you had id see you brought up on charges for casting such a web as a death spell she broke into a grin well done first wizard outside the officers all wanted to know what was happening no battle todayвђ zedd told them ive just ended the war they cheered with genuine joy had zedd not been the first wizard abby suspected they would have hoisted him on their shoulders it seemed that there was no one more glad for peace than those whose job it was to fight for it wizard thomas looking more humble than abby had ever seen him cleared his throat zorander i i i simply cant believe what my own eyes have seen his face finally took on its familiar scowl but we have people already in near revolt over magic when news of this spreads it is only going to make it worse the demands for relief from magic grow every day and you have fed the fury with this were liable to have revolt on our hands i still want to know why it isnt movingвђ delora growled from behind i want to know why its just sitting there all green and still zedd ignored her and directed his attention to the old wizard thomas i have a job for you he motioned several officers and officials from aydindril forward and passed a finger before all their faces his own turning grim and determined i have a job for all of you the people have reason to fear magic today we have seen magic deadly and dangerous i can understand those fears in appreciation of these fears i shall grant their wish what thomas scoffed you cant end magic zorander not even you can accomplish such a paradox not end itвђ zedd said but give them a place without it i want you to organize an official delegation large enough to travel all the midlands with the offer all those who would quit a world with magic are to move to the lands to the west there they shall set up new lives free of any magic i shall ensure that magic cannot intrude on their peaceвђ thomas threw up his hands how can you make such a promise zedds arm lifted to point off behind him to the wall of green fire growing towards the sky shall call up a second wall of death through which none can pass on the other side it shall be a place free of magic there people will be free to live their lives without magic i want you all to see that the word is passed through the land people have until spring to emigrate to the lands west thomas you will warrant that none with magic make the journey we have books we can use to ensure that we purge a place of any with a trace of magic we can assure that there will be no magic there in the spring when all who wish have gone to their new homeland i will seal them off from magic in one fell swoop will satisfy the large majority of the petitions that come to us they will have lives without magic may the good spirits watch over them and may they not come to fegret their wish granted thomas pointed heatedly at the thing zedd had brought into the world but what about that thing what if people go wandering into it in the dark they will be walking into death not only in the dark zedd said once it has stabilized it will be hard to see at all we will have to set up guards to keep people away we will have to set aside land near the boundary and have men guard the area to keep people out men abby asked you mean you will have to start a corps of boundary wardens yes zedd said his eyebrows lifting thats a good name for them boundary wardens silence settled over those leaning in to hear the wizards words the mood had changed and was now serious with the grim matter at hand abby couldnt imagine a place without magic but she knew how vehemently some wished it thomas finally nodded zedd this time i think youve got it right sometimes we must serve the people by not serving them the others mumbled their agreement though like abby it seemed to them a bleak solution zedd straightened then it is decided he turned and announced to the crowd the end of the war and the division to come in which those who had petitioned for years would finally have their petition granted for those who wished it a land outside the midlands without magic would be created while everyone was chattering about such a mysterious and exotic thing as a land without magic or cheering and celebrating the end of the war abby whispered to jana to wait with her father a moment she kissed her daughter and then took the opportunity to pull zedd aside zedd may speak with you have a question zedd smiled and took her by the elbow urging abby into her small home id like to check on my daughter come along abby cast caution to the winds and took the mother confessors hand in one of hers deloras in the other and pulled them in with her they had a right to hear this too zedd abby asked once they were away from the crowd in her yard may i please know the debt your father owed my mother zedd lifted an eyebrow my father owed your mother no debt abby frowned but it was a debt of bones passed down from your father to you and from my mother to me oh it was a debt all right but not owed to your mother but by your mother what abby asked in stunned confusion what do you mean zedd smiled when your mother was giving birth to you she was in trouble you both were dying in the labour my father used magic to save her helsa begged him to save you too in order to keep you in the world of the living and out of the keepers grasp without thought to his own safety he worked far beyond the endurance anyone would expect of a wizard your mother was a sorceress and understood the extent of what was involved in saving your life in appreciation of what my father had done she swore a debt to him when she died the debt passed to you abby eyes wide tried to reconcile the whole thing in her mind her mother had never told her the nature of the debt but but you mean that it is i who owe the debt to you you mean that the debt of bones is my burden zedd pushed open the door to the room where his daughter slept smiling as he looked in the debt is paid abby the bracelet your mother gave you had magic linking you to the debt thank you for my daughters life abby glanced to the mother confessor trickster indeed but why would you help me if it was really not a debt of bones you owed me if it was really a debt i owed you zedd shrugged we reap a reward merely in the act of helping others we never know how or if that reward will come back to us helping is the reward none other is needed nor better abby watched the beautiful little girl sleeping in the room beyond i am thankful to the good spirits that i could help keep such a life in this world i may not have the gift but i can foresee that she will go on to be a person of import not only for you but for others zedd smiled idly as he watched his daughter sleeping i think you may have the gift of prophecy my dear for she is already a person who has played a part in bringing a war to an end and in so doing saved the lives of countless people the sorceress pointed out the window still want to know why that thing isnt moving it was supposed to pass over dhara and purge it of all life to kill them all for what they have done her scowl deepened why is it just sitting there zedd folded his hands it ended the war that is enough the wall is a part of the underworld itself the world of the dead their army will not be able to cross it and make war on us for as long as such a boundary stands and how long will that be zedd shrugged nothing remains for ever for now there will be peace the killing is ended the sorceress did not look to be satisfied but they were trying to kill us all well now they cant delora there are those in dhara who are innocent too just because panis rahl wished to conquer and subjugate us that does not mean that all the dharan people are evil many good people in dhara have suffered under harsh rule how could i kill everyone there including all the people who have caused no harm and themselves wish only to live their lives in peace delora wiped a hand across her face zeddicus sometimes i dont know about you sometimes you make a lousy wind of death the mother confessor stood staring out the window towards dhara her violet eyes turned back to the wizard there will be those over there who will be your foes for life because of this zedd you have made bitter enemies with this you have left them alive enemies the wizard said are the price of honour
