priestkings of gor volume three of the chronicles of counterearth by john norman chapter one the fair of enkara i tarl cabot formerly of earth am one who is known to the priestkings of gor it came about late in the month of enkara in the year from the founding of the city of ar that i came to the hall of priestkings in the sardar mountains on the planet gor our counterearth i had arrived four days before on tarnback at the black palisade that encircles the dreaded sardar those dark mountains crowned with ice consecrated to the priestkings forbidden to me to mortals to all creatures of flesh and blood the tarn my gigantic hawklike mount had been unsaddled and freed for it could not accompany me into the sardar once it had tried to carry me over the palisade into the mountains but never again would i have essayed that flight it had been caught in the shield of the priestkings invisible not to be evaded undoubtedly a field of some sort which had so acted on the bird perhaps affecting the mechanism of the inner ear that the creature had become incapable of controlling itself and had fallen disoriented and confused to the earth below none of the animals of gor as far as i knew could enter the sardar only men could enter and they did not return i regretted freeing the tarn for it was a fine bird powerful intelligent fierce courageous loyal and strangely i think it cared for me at least i cared for it and only with harsh words could i drive it away and when it disappeared in the distance puzzled perhaps hurt i wept it was not far to the fair of enkara one of the four great fairs held in the shadow of the sardar during the gorean year and i soon walked slowly down the long central avenue between the tents the booths and stalls the pavilions and stockades of the fair toward the high brassbound timber gate formed of black logs beyond which lies the sardar itself the sanctuary of this worlds gods known to the men below the mountains the mortals only as priestkings i would stop briefly at the fair for i must purchase food for the journey into the sardar and i must entrust a leatherbound package to some member of the caste of scribes a package which contained an account of what had occurred at the city of tharna in the past months a short history of events which i thought should be recorded i wished that i had had longer to visit the fair for on another occasion at another time i should have sought eagerly to examine its wares drink at its taverns talk with its merchants and attend its contests for these fairs are free ground for the many competitive hostile gorean cities and provide almost the sole opportunity for the citizens of various cities to meet peaceably with one another it is little wonder that the cities of gor support and welcome the fairs sometimes they provide a common ground on which territorial and commercial dispute may be amicably resolved without loss of honour plenipotentiaries of warring cities having apparently met by accident among the silken pavilions further members of castes such as the physicians and builders use the fairs for the dissemination of information and techniques among caste brothers as is prescribed in their codes in spite of the fact that their respective cities may be hostile and as might be expected members of the caste of scribes gather here to enter into dispute and examine and trade manuscripts my small friend torm of koroba of the caste of scribes had been to the fairs four times in his life he informed me that in this time he had refuted seven hundred and eight scribes from fiftyseven cities but i will not vouch for the accuracy of this report as i sometimes suspect that torm like most members of his caste and mine tends to be a bit too sanguine in recounting his numerous victories moreover i have never been too clear as to the grounds on which the disputes of scribes are to be adjudicated and it is not too infrequently that both disputants leave the field each fully convinced that he has the best of the contest in differences among member of my own caste that of the warriors it is easier to tell who has carried the day for the defeated one often lies wounded or slain at the victors feet in the contests of scribes on the other hand the blood that is spilled is invisible and the valiant foemen retire in good order reviling their enemies and recouping their forces for the next days campaign i do not hold this against the contests of scribes rather i commend it to the members of my own caste i missed torm and wondered if i would ever see him again bounding about excoriating the authors of dusty scrolls knocking the inkwell from his desk with an imperial sweep of his blue robe leaping on the table in birdlike fury denouncing one scribe or another for independently rediscovering an idea that had already appeared in a centuryold manuscript known to torm of course but not to the luckless scribe in question rubbing his nose shivering leaping down to thrust his feet against the everpresentm overloaded charcoal brazier that invariably burned under his table amid the litter of his scraps and parchments regardless of whatever the outside temperature might be i supposed torm might be anywhere for those of koroba had been scattered by the priestkings i would not search the fair for him nor if he were here would i make my presence known for by the will of the priestkings no two men of koroba might stand together and i had no wish to jeopardise the little scribe gor would be the poorer were it not for his furious eccentricities the counterearth would simply not be the same without belligerent exasperated little torm i smiled to myself if i should meet him i knew he would thrust himself upon me and insist upon being taken into the sardar though he would known it would mean his death and i would have to bundle him in his blue robes hurl him into a rain barrel and make my escape perhaps it would be safer to drop him into a well torm had stumbled into more than one well in his life and no one who knew him would think it strange to find him sputtering about at the bottom of one the fairs incidentally are governed by merchant law and supported by booth rents and taxes levied on the items exchanged the commercial facilities of these fairs from money changing to general banking are the finest i know of on gor save those in ars street of coins and letters of credit are accepted and loans negotiated though often at usurious rates with what seems reckless indifference yet perhaps this is not so puzzling for the gorean cities will within their own walls enforce the merchant law when pertinent even against their own citizens if they did not of course the fairs would be closed to the citizens of that city the contests i mentioned which take place at the fairs are as would be expected peaceable or i should say at least do not involve contests of arms indeed it is considered a crime against the priestkings to bloody ones weapons at the fairs the priestkings i might note seem to be more tolerant of bloodshed in other localities contests of arms fought to the death whereas they may not take place at the fairs are not unknown on gor and are popular in some cities contests of this sort most often involving criminals and impoverished soldiers of fortune offer prizes of amnesty or gold and are customarily sponsored by rich men to win the approval of the populace of their cities sometimes these men are merchants who wish thereby to secure goodwill for their products sometimes they are practitioners of law who hope to sway the votes of jury men sometimes they are ubars or high initiates who find it in their interests to keep the crowds amused such contests in which life is lost used to be popular at ar for example being sponsored in that city by the caste of initiates who regard themselves as being the intermediaries between priestkings and men though i suspect that at least on the whole they know as little about the priestkings as do other men these contests it might be mentioned were banned in ar when kazrak of port kar became administrator of that city it was not an action which was popular with the powerful caste of initiates the contests at the fairs however i am pleased to say offer nothing more dangerous than wrestling with no holds to the death permitted most of the contests involve such things as racing feats of strength and skill with bow and spear other contests of interest pit choruses and poets and players of various cities against one another in the several theatres of the fair i had a friend once andreas of the desert city of tor of the caste of poets who had once sung at the fair and won a cap filled with gold and perhaps it is hardly necessary to add that the streets of the fair abound with jugglers puppeteers musicians and acrobats who far from the theatres compete in their ancient fashions for the copper tarn disks of the broiling turbulent crowds many are the objects for sale at the fair i passed among wines and textiles and raw wool silks and brocades copperware and glazed pottery carpets and tapestries lumber furs hides salt arms and arrows saddles and harness rings and bracelets and necklaces belts and sandals lamps and oils medicines and meats and grains animals such as the fierce tarns gors winged mounts and tharlarions her domesticated lizards and long chains of miserable slaves both male and female although no one may be enslaved at the fair slaves may be bought and sold within its precincts and slavers do a thriving business exceeded perhaps only by that of ars street of brands the reason for this is not simply that here is a fine market for such wares since men from various cities pass freely to and fro at the fair but that each gorean whether male or female is expected to see the sardar mountains in honour of the priestkings at least once in his life prior to his twentyfifth year accordingly the pirates and outlaws who beset the trade routes to ambush and attack the caravans on the way to the fair if successful often have more than inanimate metals and cloths to reward their vicious labours this pilgrimage to the sardar enjoyed by the priestkings according to the caste of the initiates undoubtedly plays its role in the distribution of beauty among the hostile cities of gor whereas the males who accompany a caravan are often killed in its defence or driven off this fate fortunate or not is seldom that of the caravans women it will be their sad lot to be stripped and fitted with the collars and chains of slave girls and forced to follow the wagons on foot to the fair or if the caravans tharlarions have been killed or driven off they will carry its goods on their backs thus one practical effect of the edict of the priestkings is that each gorean girl must at least once in her life leave her walls and take the very serious risk of becoming a slave girl perhaps the prize of a pirate or outlaw the expeditions sent out from the cities are of course extremely well guarded but pirates and outlaws too can band together in large numbers and sometimes even more dangerously one citys warriors in force will prey upon another citys caravans this incidentally is one of the more frequent causes of war among these cities the fact that warriors of one city sometimes wear the insignia of cities hostile to their own when they make these attacks further compounds the suspicions and internecine strife which afflicts the gorean cities this chain of reflections was occasioned in my mind by sight of some men of port kar a savage coastal city on the tamber gulf who were displaying a sullen chain of twenty freshly branded girls many of them beautiful they were from the island city of cos and had undoubtedly been captured at sea their vessel burned and sunk their considerable charms were fully revealed to the eye of appraising buyers who passed down the line the girls were chained throat to throat their wrists locked behind the small of their backs with slave bracelets and the knelt in the customary position of pleasure slaves when a possible buyer would stop in front of one one of the bearded scoundrels from port kar would poke her with a slave whip and she would lift her head and numbly repeat the ritual phrase of the inspected slave girl buy me master they had thought to come to the sardar as free women discharging their obligation to the priestkings they would leave as slave girls i turned away my business was with the priestkings of gor indeed i had come to the sardar to encounter the fabled priestkings whose incomparable power so inextricably influences the destinies of the cities and men of the counterearth it is said that the priestkings know whatever transpires on their world and that the mere lifting of their hand can summon all the powers of the universe i myself had seen the power of priestkings and knew that such beings existed i myself had traveled in a ship of the priestkings which had twice carried me to this world i had seen their power so subtly exercised as to alter the movements of a compass needle so grossly demonstrated as to destroy a city leaving behind not even the stones of what had once been a dwelling place of men it is said that neither the physical intricacies of the cosmos nor the emotions of human beings are beyond the scope of their power that the feelings of men and the motions of atoms and stars are as one to them that they can control the very forces of gravity and invisibly sway the hearts of human beings but of this latter claim i wonder for once on a road to koroba my city i met one who had been a messenger of priestkings one who had been capable of disobeying them one from the shards of whose burnt and blasted skull i had removed a handful of golden wire he had been destroyed by priestkings as casually as one might jerk loose the thong of a sandal he had disobeyed and he had been destroyed immediately and with grotesque dispatch but the important thing was i told myself that he had disobeyed that he could disobey that he had been able to disobey and choose the ignominious death he knew must follow he had won his freedom though it had as the goreans say led him to the cities of dust where i think not even priestkings care to follow he had as a man lifted his fist against the might of priestkings and so he had died defiantly though horribly with great nobility i am of the caste of warriors and it is in our codes that the only death fit for a man is that in battle but i can no longer believe that this is true for the man i met once on the road to koroba died well and taught me that all wisdom and truth does not lie in my own codes my business with the priestkings is simple as are most matters of honour and blood for some reason unbeknown to me they have destroyed my city koroba and scattered its peoples i have been unable to learn the fate of my father my friends my warrior companions and my beloved talena she who was the daughter of marlenus who had once been ubar of ar my sweet fierce wild gentle savage beautiful love she who is my free companion my talena forever the ubara of my heart she who burns forever in the sweet lonely darkness of my dreams yes i have business with the priestkings chapter two in the sardar i looked down the long broad avenue to the huge timber gate at its end and beyond the gate to the black crags of the inhospitable sardar range it took not much time to purchase a small bundle of supplies to take into the sardar nor was it difficult to find a scribe to whom i might entrust the history of the events at tharna i did not ask his name nor he mine i knew his caste and he knew mine and it was enough he could not read the manuscript as it was written in english a language as foreign to him as gorean would be to most of you but yet he would treasure the manuscript and guard it as though it were a most precious possession for he was a scribe and it is the way of scribes to love the written word and keep it from harm and if he could not read the manuscript what did it matter perhaps someone could someday and then the words which had kept their secret for so long would at last enkindle the mystery of communication and what had been written would be heard and understood at last i stood before the towering gate of black logs bound with its wide bands of brass the fair lay behind me and the sardar before my garments and my shield bore no insignia for my city had been destroyed i wore my helmet none would know who entered the sardar at the gate i was met by one of the caste of initiates a dour thinlipped drawn man woth deep sunken eyes clad in the pure white robes of his caste do you wish to speak to priestkings he asked yes i said do you know what you do yes i said the initiate and i gazed evenly at one another and then he stepped aside as he must have done many times i would not be the first of course to enter the sardar many men and sometimes women had entered these mountains but it is not known what they found sometimes these individuals are young idealists rebels and champions of lost causes who wish to protest to priestkings sometimes they are individuals who are old or diseased and are tired of life and wish to die sometimes they are piteous or cunning or frightened wretches who think to find the secret of immortality in those barren crags and sometimes they are outlaws fleeing from gors harsh justice hoping to find at least brief sanctuary in the cruel mysterious domain of priestkings a country into which they may be assured no mortal magistrate or vengeful band of human warriors will penetrate i suppose the initiate might account me noe of the latter for my habiliments bore no insignia he turned away from me and went to a small pedestal at one side on the pedestal there was a silver bowl filled with water a vial of oil and a towel he dipped his fingers in the bowl poured a bit of oil on his hands dipped his fingers again and then wiped his hands dry on each side of the huge gate there stood a great windlass and chain and to each windlass a gang of blinded slaves was manacled the initiate folded the towel carefully and replaced it on the pedestal let the gate be opened he said the slaves obediently pressed their weight against the timber spokes of the two windlasses and they creaked and the chains tightened their naked feet slipped in the dirt and they pressed ever more tightly against the heavy obdurate bars now their bodies humped with pain clenching themselves against the spokes their blind eyes were fixed on nothing the blood vessels in their necks and legs and arms began to distend until i feared they might burst open through the tortured flesh the agonised miscles of their straining knotted bodies like swollen leather seemed to fill with pain as if pain were a fluid their flesh seemed to fuse with the wood of the bars the backs of their garments discoloured with a scarlet sweat men had broken their own bones on the timber spokes of the sardar windlasses at last there was a great creak and the vast portal parted a hands breadth and then the width of a shoulder and the width of a mans body it is enough i said i entered immediately as i entered i heard the mournful tolling of the huge hollow metal bar which stands some way from the gate i had heard the tolling before and knew that it signified that yet another mortal had entered the sardar it was a depressing sound and not made less so by my realisation that in this case it was i who had entered the mountains as i listened it occurred to me that the purpose of the bar might not be simply to inform the men of the fair that the sardar had been entered but to inform the priestkings as well i looked behind myself in time to see the great gate close it shut without a sound the journey to the hall of priestkings was not as difficult as i had anticipated at places there were wellworn paths at others even stairs had been cut in the sides of mountains stairs worn smooth in the millenia by the passage of countless feet here and there bones littered the path human bones whether these were the remains of men who had starved or frozen in the barren sardar or had been destroyed by priestkings i did not know upon occasion some message would be found scratched in the cliffs along the path some of these were obscene cursing the priestkings others were paeans in their praise some were cheerful if in a rather pessimistic way one i remember was eat drink and be happy the rest is nothing others were rather simple and sometimes sad such as no food im cold im afraid one such read the mountains are empty rena i love you i wondered who had written it and when the inscription was worn it had been scratched out in the old gorean script it had weathered for perhaps better than a thousand years but i knew that the mountains were not empty for i had evidence of priestkings i continued my journey i encountered no animals nor any growing thing nothing save the endless black rocks the black cliffs and the path cut before me in the dark stone gradually the air grew more chill and wisps of snow blew about me frost began to appear on the steps and i trudged past crevices filled with ice deposits which had perhaps lain as they were without melting for hundreds of years i wrapped my cloak more firmly about myself and using my spear as a staff i forced my way upward some four days into the mountains i heard for the first time in my journey the sound of a thing other than the wind the sighing of snow and the groaning of ice it was the sound of a living thing the sound of a mountain larl the larl is a predator clawed and fanged quite large often standing seven feet at the shoulder i think it would be fair to say that it is substantially feline at any rate its grace and sinuous power remind me of the smaller but similarly fearsome jungle cats of my old world the resemblance is i suppose due to the mechanics of convergent evolution both animals having been shaped by the exigencies of the chase the stealth of the approach and the sudden charge and by the requirement of the swift and devastating kill if there is an optimum configuration for a land predator i suppose on my old world the palm must go to the bengal tiger but on gor the prize belongs indisputably to the mountain larl and i cannot but believe that the structural similarities between the two animals though of different worlds are more than a matter of accident the larls head is broad sometimes more than two feet across and shaped roughly like a triangle giving its skull something of the cast of a vipers save that of course it is furred and the pupils of the eyes like the cats and unlike the vipers can range from knifelike slits in the broad daylight to dark inquisitive moons in the night the pelt of the larl is normally a tawny red or a sable black the black larl which is predominantly nocturnal is maned both male and female the red larl which hunts whenever hungry regardless of the hour and is the more common variety possesses no mane females of both varieties tend generally to be slightly smaller than the males but are quite as aggressive and sometimes even more dangerous particularly in the late fall and winter of the year when they are likely to be hunting for their cubs i had once killed a male red larl in the voltai range within pasangs of the city of ar now hearing the growl of such a beast i threw back my cloak lifted my shield and held my spear ready i was puzzled that i might encounter a larl in the sardar how could it have entered the mountains perhaps it was native but on what could it live among these barren crags for i had seen nothing on which it might prey unless one might count the men who had entered the mountains but their bones scattered white and frozen were unsplintered and unfurrowed they showed no evidence of having suffered the molestation of a larls gnawing jaws i then understood that the larl i had heard must be a larl of priestkings for no animal and no man enters or exists in the sardar without the consent of priestkings and if it was fed it must be at the hand of priestkings or their servants in spite of my hatred of priestkings i could not help but admire them none of the men below the mountains the mortals had ever succeeded in taming a larl even larl cubs when found and raised by men would on reaching their majority on some night in a sudden burst of atavistic fury slay their masters and under the three hurtling moons of gor lope from the dwellings of men driven by what instincts i know not to seek the mountains where they were born a case is known of a larl who traveled more then twentyfive hundred pasangs to seek a certain shallow crevice in the voltai in which he had been whelped he was slain at its mouth hunters had followed him one among them an old man who had originally been one of the party that had captured the animal identified the place i advanced my spear ready for its cast my shield ready to be thrown over my body to protect it from the death throes of the thrashing beast should the cast be successful my life was in my own hands and i was content that this should be so i would have it no other way i smiled to myself i was first spear for there were no others in the voltai range bands of hunters usually from ar stalk the larl with the mighty gorean spear normally they so this in single file and he who leads the file is called first spear for his will be the first spear cast as soon as he casts his weapon he throws himself to the ground and covers his body with his shield as does each man successively behind him this allows each man to have a clean cast at the beast and provides some protection once the spear is thrown the most significant reason however becomes clear when the role of the last man on the file who is spoken of as last spear is understood once last spear casts his weapon he may not throw himself to the ground if he should and any of his comrades survive they will slay him but this seldom occurs for the gorean hunters fear cowardice more than the clwas and fangs of larls last spear must remain standing and if the beast still lives receive its charge with only his drawn sword he does not hurl himself to the ground in order that he will remain conspicuously in the larls field of vision and thus be the object of its wounded maddened onslaught it is thus that should the spears miss their mark he sacrifices his life for his companions who will while the larl attacks him make good their escape this may seem cruel but in the long run it tends to be conservative of human life it is better as the goreans say fro one man to die than many first spear is normally the best of the spearmen because if the larl is not slain or seriously wounded with the first strike the lives of all and not simply that of last spear stand in considerable jeopardy paradoxically perhaps last spear is normally the weakest of the spearmen the least skilled whether this is because gorean hunting tradition favours the weak protecting him with the stronger spears or tradition scorns the weak regarding him as the most expendable member of the party i do not know the origin of this hunting practice is lost in antiquity being as old perhaps as men and weapons and larls i once asked a gorean hunter whom i met in ar why the larl was hunted at all i have never forgotten his reply because it is beautiful he said and dangerous and because we are goreans i had not yet seen the beast whose growl i had heard the path on which i trod turned a few yards ahead it was about a yard wide and hugged the side of a cliff and to my left there was a sheer precipice the drop to its base must have been at least a full pasang i remembered that the boulders below were huge but from my present height they looked like grains of black sand i wished the cliff were on my left rather than my right in order to have a freer cast of my spear the path was steep but its ascent here and there was lightened by high steps i have never cared to have an enemy above me nor did i now but i told myself that my spear might more easily find a vulnerable spot if the larl leapt downwards toward me than if i were above and had only the base of its neck as my best target from above i would try to sever the vertebrae the larls skull is an even more difficult cast for its head is almost continually in motion moreover it possesses an unobtrusive bony ridge which runs from its four nasal slits to the beginnings of the backbone this ridge can be penetrated by the spear but anything less than a perfect cast will result in the weapons being deflected through the cheek of the animal inflicting a cruel but unimportant wound on the other hand if i were under the larl i would have a brief but clean strike at the great pounding eightvalved heart that lies in the centre of its breast my heart sank for i heard another growl that of a second beast i had but one spear i might kill one larl but then i should almost certainly die under the jaws of its mate for some reason i did not fear death but felt only anger that these beasts might prevent me from keeping my rendezvous with the priestkings of gor i wondered how many men might have turned back at this point and i remembered the innumerable white frozen bones on the cliff below it occurred to me that i might retreat and return when the beasts had gone it seemed possible that they might not yet have discovered me i smiled as i thought of the foolishness of this for these beasts before me must be the larls of priestkings guardians of the stronghold of gors gods i loosened my sword in its sheath and continued upwards at last i came to the bend in the path and braced myself for the sudden bolt about that corner in which i must cry aloud to startle them and in the same instant cast my spear at the nearest larl and set upon the other with my drawn sword i hesitated for a moment and then the fierce war cry of koroba burst from my lips in the clear chill air of the sardar and i threw myself into the open my spear arm back my shield high chapter three parp there was a sudden startled rattle of chains and i saw two huge white larls frozen in the momentary paralysis of registering my presence and then with but an instants fleeting passage both beasts turned upon me and hurled themselves enraged to the lengths of their chains my spear had not left my hand both animals were jerked up short as mighty chains fastened to steel and bejeweled collars terminated their vicious charge one was thrown on its back so violent was its rush and the other stood wildly for a moment towering over me like a rearing giant stallion its huge claws slashing the air fighting the collar that held it from me then at the length of their chains they crouched snarling regarding me balefully occasionally lashing out with a clawed paw as if to sweep me into range of their fearsome jaws i was struck with wonder though i was careful to keep beyond the range of their chains for i had never seen white larls before they were gigantic beasts superb specimens perhaps eight feet at the shoulder their upper canine fangs like daggers mounted in their jaws must have been at least a foot in length and extended well below their jaws in the manner of ancient sabretoothed tigers the four nostril slits of each animal were flared and their great chests lifted and fell with the intensity of their excitement their tails long and tufted at the end lashed back and forth the larger of them unaccountably seemed to lose interest in me he rose to his feet and sniffed the air turning his side to me and seemed ready to abandon any intentions of doing me harm only an instant later did i understand what was happening for suddenly turning he threw himself on his side and his head facing in the other direction hurled his hind legs at me i lifted the shield for to my horror in reversing his position on the chain he had suddenly added some twenty feet to the fearful perimeter of the space alotted to him by that hated impediment two great clawed paws smote my shield and hurled me twenty feet against the cliff i rolled and scrambled back further for the stroke of the larl had dashed me into the radius of its mate my cloak and garments were torn from my back by the stroke of the second larls claws i struggled to my feet well done i said to the larl i had barely escaped with my life now the two beasts were filled with a rage which dwarfed their previous fury for they sensed that i would not again approach closely enough to permit them a repetition of their primitive stratagem i admired the larls for they seemed to me intelligent beasts yes i said to myself it was well done i examined my shield and saw ten wide furrows torn across its brassbound hide surface my back felt wet with the blood from the second larls claws it should have felt warm but it felt cold i knew it was freezing on my back there was no choice now but to go on somehow if i could without the small homely necessities of a needle and thread i should probably freeze there was no wood in the sardar with which to build a fire yes i repeated grimly to myself glaring at the larls though smiling it was well done too well done then i heard the movement of chains and i saw that the two chains which fastened the larls were not hooked to rings in the stone but vanished within circular apertures now the chains were being slowly drawn in much to the obvious frustration of the beasts the place in which i found myself was considerably wider than the path on which i had trod for the path had given suddenly onto a fairly large circular area in which i had found the chained larls one side of this area was formed by the sheer cliff which had been on my right and now curved about making a sort of cup of stone the other side on my left lay partly open to the frightful drop below but was partly enclosed by another cliff the side of a second mountain which impinged on the one i had been climbing the circular apertures into which the larls chains were being drawn were located in these two cliffs as the chains were drawn back the protesting larls were dragged to different sides thus a passage of sorts was cleared between them but the passage led only as far as i could see to a blank wall of stone yet i supposed this seemingly impervious wall must house the portal of the hall of priestkings as the beasts had felt the tug of the chains they had slunk snarling back against the cliffs and now they crouched down their chains little more than massive leashes i thought the snowy whiteness of their pelts was beautiful throaty growls menaced me and an occasional paw the claws extended was lifted but the beasts made no effort now to pull against the grim jewelset collars which bound them i had not long to wait for only a few moments later perhaps no more than ten gorean ihn a section of stone rolled silently back and upward revealing a rock passage beyond of perhaps some eight feet square i hesitated for how did i know but that the chains of the larls might be loosed once i was between them how did i know what might lie before me in that dark quiet passage as i hesitated that moment i became aware of a motion inside the passage which gradually became a whiteclad rather short rotund figure to my amazement a man stepped from the passage blinking in the sun he was clad in a white robe somewhat resembling those of the initiates he wore sandals his cheeks were red and his head bald he had long whiskery sideburns which flared merrily from his muffinlike face small bright eyes twinkled under heavy white eyebrows most was i surprised to find him holding a tiny round pipe from which curled a bright wisp of smoke tobacco is unknown on gor though there are certain vices or habits to take its place in particular the stimulation afforded by chewing on the leaves of the kanda plant the roots of which oddly enough when ground and dried constitute an extremely deadly poison i carefully regarded the small rotund gentleman who stood framed so incongruously in the massive stone portal i found it impossible to believe that he could be dangerous that he could in any way be associated with the dreaded priestkings of gor he was simply too cheerful too open and ingenious too frank and only too obviously pleased to see and welcome me it was impossible not to be drawn to him i found that i liked him though i had just met him and that i wanted him to like me and that i felt he did and that this pleased me if i had seen this man in my own world this small rotund merry gentleman with his florid colouring and cheerful manner i would have thought him necessarily english and of a sort one seldom encounters nowadays if one had encountered him in the eighteenth century one might take him for a jolly snuffsniffing roisterous country squire knowing himself the salt of the earth not above twitting the parson nor pinching the serving girls in the nineteenth century he would have owned an old book shop and worked at a high desk quite outdated kept his money in a sock distributed it indiscriminately to all who asked him for it and publicly read chaucer and darwin to scandalise lady customers and the local clergy in my own time such a man could only be a college professor for there are few other refuges save wealth left in my world for men such as he one could imagine him ensconced in a university chair perhaps affluent enough for gout reposing in his tenure puffing on his pipe a connoisseur of ales and castles a gusty afficionado of bawdy elizabethan drinking songs which he would feel it his duty to bequeath piously as a portion of their rich literary heritage to generations of recent proper graduates of eton and harrow the small eyes regarded me twinkling with a start i noticed that the pupils of his eyes were red when i started a momentary flicker of annoyance crossed his features but in an instant he was again his chuckling affable bubbling self come come he said come along cabot we have been waiting for you he knew my name who was waiting but of course he would know my name and those who would be waiting would be the priestkings of gor i forgot about his eyes for it did not seem important at the time for some reason i suppose that i thought that i had been mistaken i had not been he now stepped back into the shadows of the passage you are coming arent you he asked yes i said my name is parp he said standing back in the passage he puffed once on his pipe parp he repeated puffing once again he had not extended his hand i looked at him without speaking it seemed a strange name for a priestking i do not know what i expected he seemed to sense my puzzlement yes said the man parp he shrugged its not much of a name for a priestking but then im not much of a priestking he chuckled are you a priestking i asked again a momentary flicker of annoyance crossed his features of course he said it seemed that my heart stopped beating at that moment one of the larls gave a sudden roar i shivered but to my surprise the man who called himself parp clutched his pipe in his white hand and seemed to give a start of terror in a moment he was quite recovered i found it strange that a priestking should fear a larl without waiting to see if i would follow him he turned suddenly and went back down the passage i gathered my weapons and followed him only the rumbling growl of the now sullen mountain larls as i passed between them convinced me that i could not be dreaming that i had come at last to the hall of priestkings chapter four the hall of priestkings as i followed the man who called himself parp down the stone passage the portal behind me closed i remember one last glimpse of the sardar range the path i had climbed the cold blue sky and two snowy larls one chained on either side of the entrance my host did not speak but led the way with a merry stride an almost constant curl of smoke from his little round pipe encircling his bald pate and muttonchop whiskers and drifting back down the passage the passage was lit with energy bulbs of the sort which i had encountered in the tunnel of marlenus which led beneath the walls of ar there was nothing in the lighting of the passage or its construction to suggest that the priestkings caste of builders if they had one was any more advanced than that of the men below the mountains too the passage was devoid of ornament lacking the mosaics and tapestries with which the beautyloving goreans below the mountains are wont to glorify the places of their own habitation the priestkings as far as i could tell had no art perhaps they would regard it as a useless excrescence detracting from the more sobre values of life such as i supposed study meditation and the manipulation of the lives of men i noted that the passage which i trod was well worn it had been polished by the sandals of countless men and women who had walked before where i now walked perhaps thousands of years ago perhaps yesterday perhaps this morning then we came to a large hall it was plain but in its sheer size it possessed a severe lofty grandeur at the entrance to this room or chamber i stopped overcome with a certain sense of awe i found myself on the brink of entering what appeared to be a great and perfect dome having a diameter i am sure of at least a thousand yards i was pleased to see that its top was a sparkling curvature of some transparent substance perhaps a special glass or plastic for no glass or plastic with which i was familiar would be likely to withstand the stresses generated by such a structure beyond the dome i could see the welcome blue sky come come cabot remonstrated parp i followed him in this great dome there was nothing save that at its very centre there was a high dais and on this dais there was a large throne carved from a single block of stone it seemed to take us a long time to reach the dais our footsteps echoed hollowly across the great stone floor at last we arrived wait here said parp who pointed to an area outside a tiled ring which surrounded the dais i did not stand precisely where he asked but several feet away but i did remain outside the tiled ring parp puffed his way up the nine steps of the dais and climbed onto the stone throne he was a strange contrast to the sever regality of the majestic seat on which he perched his sandaled feet did not reach the floor and he made a slight grimace as he settled himself on the throne frankly said parp i think we made a mistake in sacrificing certain creature comforts in the sardar he tried to find some position that would satisfy him for example a cushion would not be out of place on such a throne do you think cabot on such a throne it would be out of place i said ah yes sighed parp i suppose so then smartly parp cracked his pipe a few times against the side of the throne scattering ashes and unsmoked tobacco about on the floor of the dais i regarded him without moving then he bagan to fumble with the wallet which was slung from his belt and removed a plastic envelope i watched him closely following every move a frown crossed my face as i saw him take a pinch of tobacco from the bag and refill his pipe then he fumbled about a bit more and emerged with a narrow cylindrical silverish obect for an instant it seemed to point at me i lifted my shield please cabot said parp with something of impatience and used the silverish object to light his pipe i felt foolish parp began to puff away contentedly on a new supply of tobacco he had to turn slightly on the throne to look at me as i had not chosen to stand directly where he had suggested i do wish you would be more cooperative he said tapping the floor with the butt of my spear i finally stood where he had directed parp chuckled and puffed away i did not speak and he smoked one pipe then he cleaned it as before knocking it against the side of the throne and refilled it he lit it again with the small silverish object and leaned back against the throne he gazed up at the dome so hihh above and watched the smoke curl slowly upward did you have a good trip to the sardar asked parp where is my father i asked what of the city of koroba my voice choked what of the girl talena who was my free companion i hope you had a good trip said parp then i began to feel rage creeping like hot red vines through my blood parp did not seem concerned not everyone has a good trip said parp my hand clenched on the spear i began to feel the hatred of all the years i had nursed against the priestkings now uncontrollably slowly violently growing in my body wild fierce those foliating scarlet vines of my fury that now seemed to encircle me to enfold me to engulf me swelling steaming now writhing aflame about my body and before my eyes in the turbulent burned air that separated me from the creature parp and i cried tell me what i want to know the primary difficulty besetting the traveler in the sardar continued parp is probably the general harshness of the environment for example the inclemencies of the weather particularly in the winter i lifted the spear and my eyes which must have been terrible in the apertures of my helmet were fixed on the heart of the man who sat upon the throne tell me i cried the larls also parp went on are a not unformidable obstacle i cried with rage and strode forward to loose my spear but i wept and retained the weapon i could not do murder parp puffed away smiling that was wise of you he said i looked at him sullenly my rage abated i felt helpless you could not have injured me you know said parp i looked at him with wonder no he said go ahead if you wish cast your spear i took the weapon and tossed it toward the foot of the dais there was a sudden splintering burst of heat and i fell back staggering i shook my head to drive out the scarlet stars that seemed to race before my eyes at the foot of the dais there was a bit of soot and some droplets of melted bronze you see said parp it would not have reached me i now understood the purpose of the tiled circle which surrounded the throne i removed my helmet and threw my shield to the floor i am your prisoner i said nonsense said parp you are my guest i shall keep my sword i said if you want it you must take it from me parp laughed merrily his small round frame shaking on the heavy throne i assure you he said i have no use for it he looked at me chuckling nor have you he added where are the others i asked what others asked he the other priestkings i said i am afraid said parp that i am the priestkings all of them but you said before we are waiting i protested did i asked parp yes i said then it was merely a manner of speaking i see i said parp seemed troubled he seemed distracted he glanced up at the dome it was getting late he seemed a bit nervous his hands fumbled more with the pipe a bit of tobacco spilled will you speak to me of my father of my city and of my love i asked perhaps said parp but now you are undoubtedly tired from your journey it was true that i was tired and hungry no i said i would speak now for some reason parp now seemed visibly uneasy the sky above the dome was now grey and darkening the gorean night above often black and beautiful with stars now seemed to be approaching with swift stealth in the far distance perhaps from some passage leading away from the hall of priestkings i heard the roar of a larl parp seemed to shiver on the throne is a priestking frightened of a larl i asked parp chuckled but not quite so merrily as usual i could not understand his perturbation do not be afraid he said they are well secured i am not afraid i said looking at him evenly myself he said im forced to admit ive never quite gotten used to that awful racket they make you are a priestking i said why do you not simply lift your hand and destroy it of what use is a dead larl asked parp i did not reply i wondered why i had been allowed to reach the sardar to find the hall of priestkings to stand before this throne suddenly there was the sound of a distant reverberating gong a dull but penetrating sound which carried from somewhere even into the hall of priestkings abruptly parp stood up his face white this interview he said is at an end he glanced about himself with illconcealed terror but what of me i asked your prisoner my guest insisted parp irritably nearly dropping his pipe he pounded it once sharply against the throne and thrust it into the wallet he wore at his side your guest i asked yes snapped parp darting his eyes from right to left at least until it is time for you to be destroyed i stood without speaking yes he repeated looking down at me until it is time for you to be destroyed then it seemed in the impending darkness in the hall of priestkings as he looked down on me that the pupils of his eyes for an instant glowed briefly fiercely like two tiny fiery disks of molten copper i knew then that i had not been mistaken before his eyes were unlike mine or those of a human being i knew then that parp whatever he might be was not a man then again came the sound of that great unseen gong that distant sound dull penetrating reverberating even in the vastness of the great hall in which we stood with a cry of terror parp cast one last wild glance about the hall of priestkings and stumbled behind the great throne wait i cried but he had gone wary of the tiled circle i traced its perimeter until i stood behind the throne there was no sign of parp i walked the full ambit of the circle until i stood once more before the throne i picked up my helmet and tossed it toward the dais it clattered noisily against the first step i followed it across the tiled circle which seemed harmless now that parp had left once more the distant and unseen gong rang out and once more the hall of priestkings seemed filled with its ominous vibrations it was the third stroke i wondered why parp had seemed to fear the coming of night the sound of the gong i examined the throne and found no trace of a door behind it but i knew that one must exist parp was i was sure though i had not touched him as palpable as you or i he could not simply have vanished it was now night outside through the dome i could see the three moons of gor and the bright stars above them they were very beautiful then seized by an impulse i sat myself down on the great throne in the hall of priestkings drew my sword and placed it across my knees i recalled parps words until it is time for you to be destroyed for some reason i laughed and my laugh was the laugh of a warrior of gor full and mighty unafraid and it roared in the dark and lonely hall of priestkings chapter five vika i awakened to the soothing touch of a small sponge that bathed my forehead i grasped the hand that held the sponge and found that i held a girls wrist who are you i asked i lay on my back on a large stone platform some twelve feet square beneath me twisted and tangled lay heavy sleeping pelts thick robes of fur numerous sheets of scarlet silk a cushion or two of yellow silk lay randomly on the platform the room in which i lay was large perhaps forty feet square and the sleeping platform lay at one end of the room but not touching the wall the walls were of plain dark stone with energy bulbs fixed in them the furnishings seemed to consist mostly of two or three large chests against one wall there were now windows the entire aspect was one of severity there was no doo on the room but there was a great portal perhaps twelve feet wide and eighteen feet high i could see a large passageway beyond please said the girl i released her wrist she was comely to look on her hair was very light the colour of summer straw it was straight and bound simply behind the back of her neck with a small fillet of white wool her eyes were blue and sullen her full red lips which could have torn the heart of a man seemed to pout they were sensuous unobtrusively rebellious perhaps subtly contemptuous she knelt beside the platform beside her on the floor rested a laver of polished bronze filled with water a towel and a straightbladed gorean shaving knife i rubbed my chin she had shaved me as i slept i shivered thinking of the blade and my throat your touch is light i said she bowed her head she wore a long simple sleeveless white robe which fell gracefully about her in dignified classic folds about her throat she had gracefully wrapped a scarf of white silk i am vika she responded your slave i sat upright crosslegged in the gorean fashion on the stone platform i shook my head to clear it of sleep the girl rose and carried the bronze laver to a drain in one corner of the room and emptied it she walked well she then moved her hand past a glass disk in the wall and water emerged from a concealed aperture and curved into the shallow bowl she rinsed the bowl and refilled it and then took another towel of soft linen from a carved chest against the wall she then again approached the stone platform and knwlt before me lifting the bowl i took it and first drank from it and then set it on the stone platform before me and washed i wiped my face with the towel she then gathered up the shaving knife the towels i had used and the bowl and went again to one side of the room she was very graceful very lovely she rinsed the bowl again and set it against the wall to drain dry she then rinsed and dried the shaving knife and put it into one of the chests then with a motion of her hand which did not touch the wall she opened a small circular panel into which she dropped the two towels which i had used when they had disappeared the circular panel closed she then returned into the vicinity of the stone platform and knelt again before me though some feet away we studied one another neither spoke her back was very straight and kneeling she rested back on her heels in her eyes there seemed to burn an irritable fury of helpless rage i smiled at her but she did not smile back but looked away angrily when she looked again my eyes fixed on hers and we looked into one anothers eyes for a long time until her lip trembled and her eyes fell before mine when she raised her head again i curtly gestured her nearer a look of angry defiance flashed in her eyes but she rose to her feet and slowly approached me and knelt beside the stone platform i still remaining crosslegged on the platform reached forward and took her head in my hands drawing it to mine she knelt now but no longer on her heels and her face was brought forward and lifted to mine the sensuous lips parted slightly and i became acutely conscious of her breathing which seemed to deepen and quicken i removed my hands from her head but she left it where i had placed it i slowly unwrapped the white silken scarf from her throat her eyes seemed to cloud with angry tears as i had expected about her white throat there was fastened graceful and gleaming the slender closefitting collar of a gorean slave girl it was a collar like most others of steel secured with a small heavy lock which closed behind the girls neck you see said the girl i did not lie to you your demeanour i said does not suggest that of a slave girl she rose to her feet and backed away her hands at the shoulders of her robe nonetheless she said i am a slave girl she turned away do you wish to see my brand she asked contemptuously no i said so she was a slave girl but on her collar there was not written the name of her owner and his city as i would have expected instead i had read there only the gorean numeral which would correspond to you may do with me what you please said the girl turning to face me as long as you are in this room i belong to you i dont understand i said i am a chamber slave she said i dont understand i said it means she said irritably that i am confined to this room and that i am the slave of whoever enters the room but surely you can leave i protested i gestured to the massive portal which empty of a door or gate led only too clearly into the corridor beyond no she said bitterly i cannot leave i arose and walked through the portal and found myself in a long stone passageway beyond it which stretched as far as i could see in either direction it was lit with energy bulbs in this passageway placed regularly but staggered from one another about fifty yards apart were numerous portals like the one i had just passed through from within any given room one could not look into any other none of these portals were hung with doors or gates nor as far as i could see had they ever been hinged standing in the passageway outside the room i extended my hand to the girl come i said there is no danger she ran to the far wall and crouched against it no she cried i laughed and leaped into the room she crawled and stumbled away for some reason terrified until she found herself in the stone corner of the chamber she shrieked and clawed at the stone i gathered her in my arms and she fought like a shelarl screaming i wanted to convince her that there was no danger that her fears were groundless her fingernails clawed across my face i was angered and i swept her from her feet so that she was helpless in my arms i began to carry her toward the portal please she whispered her voice hoarse with terror please master no no master she sounded so piteous that i abandoned my plan and released her though i was irritated by her fear she collapsed at my feet shaking and whimpering and put her head to my knee please no master she begged very well i said look she said pointing to the great threshold i looked but i saw nothing other than the stone sides of the portal and on each side three rounded red domes of perhaps four inches width apiece they are harmless i said for i had passed them with safety to demonstrate this i again left the chamber outside the chamber carved over the portal i saw something i had not noted before in gorean notation the numeral was carved above the door i now understood the meaning of the numeral on the girls collar i reentered the chamber you see i said they are harmless for you she said not for me why not i asked she turned away tell me i said she shook her head tell me i repeated more sternly she looked at me am i commanded she asked i did not wish to command her no i said then said she i shall not tell you very well i said then you are commanded she looked at me through her tears and fear with sudden defiance speak slave i said she bit her lip with anger obey i said perhaps she said angrily i strode to her and seized her by the arms she looked up into my eyes and shivered she saw that she must speak she lowered her head in submission i obey she said master i released her again she turned away going to the far wall long ago she said when i first came to the sardar and found the hall of priestkings i was a young and foolish girl i thought that the priestkings possessed great wealth and that i with my beauty she turned and looked at me and threw back her head for i am beautiful am i not i looked at her and though her face was stained with the tears of her recent terror and her hair and robes were disarranged she was beautiful perhaps the more so because of her distress which had at least shattered the icy aloofness with which she had originally regarded me i knew that she now feared me but for what reason i was uncertain it had something to do with the door with her fear that i might force her from the room yes i said to her you are beautiful she laughed bitterly yes she continued i armed with my beauty would come to the sardar and wrest the riches and power of the priestkings from them for men had always sought to serve me to give me what i wanted and were the priestkings not men people had strange reasons for entering the sardar but the reason of the girl who called herself vika seemed to me one of the most incredible it was a plot which could have occurred only to a wild spoiled ambitious arrogant girl and perhaps as she had said to one who was also young and foolish i would be ubara of all gor she laughed with priestkings at my beck and call at my command all their riches and their untold powers i said nothing but when i came to the sardar she shuddered her lips moved but she seemed unable to speak i went to her and placed my arms about her shoulders and she did not resist there she said pointing to the small rounded domes set in the sides of the portal i dont understand i said she moved from my arms and approached the portal when she was within perhaps a yard of the exit the small red domes began to glow here in the sardar she said turning to face me trembling they took me into the tunnels and locked over my head a hideous metal globe with lights and wires and when they freed me they showed me a metal plate and told me that the patterns of my brain of my oldest and most primitive memories were recorded on that plate i listened intently knowing that the girl could even if of high caste understand little of what had happened to her those of the high castes of gor are permitted by the priestkings only the second knowledge and those of the lower castes are premitted only the more rudimentary first knowledge i had speculated that there would be a third knowledge that reserved for priestkings and the girls account seemed to justify this conjecture i myself would not understand the intricate processes involved in the machine of which she spoke but the purpose of the machine and the theoretical principles that facilitated its purpose were reasonably clear the machine she spoke of would be a brainscanner of some sort which would record threedimensionally the microstates of her brain in particular those of the deeper less alterable layers if well done the resulting plate would be more individual than her fingerprints it would be as unique and personal as her own history indeed in a sense it would be a physical model of that same history an isomorphic analogue of her past as she had experienced it that plate she said is kept in the tunnels of the priestkings but these and she shivered and indicated the rounded domes which were undoubtedly sensors of some type are its eyes there is a connection of some sort though perhaps only a beam of some type between the plate and these cells i said going to them and examining them you speak strangely she said what would happen if you were to pass between them i asked they showed me she said her eyes filled with horror by sending a girl between them who had not done her duty as they thought she should suddenly i started they i asked the priestkings she replied simply but there is only one priestking i said who calls himself parp she smiled but did not respond to me she shook her head sadly ah yes parp she said i supposed at another time there might have been more priestkings perhaps parp was the last of the priestkings surely it seemed likely that such massive structures as the hall of priestkings must have been the product of more than one being what happened to the girl i asked vika flinched it was like knives and fire she said i now understood why she so feared to leave the room have you tried shielding yourself i asked looking at the bronze laver which was drying against the wall yes she said but the eye knows she smiled ruefully it can see through metal i looked puzzled she went to the side of the room and picked up the bronze laver holding it before her as though to shield her face she approached the portal once more the rounded domes began to glow you see she said it knows it can see through metal i see i said i silently congratulated the priestkings on the efficacy of their devices apparently the rays which must emanate from the sensors rays not within that portion of the spectrum visible to the human eye must possess the power to penetrate at least common molecular structures something like an xray pierces flesh vika glared at me sullenly i have been a prisoner in this room for nine years she said i am sorry i said i came to the sardar she laughed to conquer the priestkings and rob them of their riches and power she ran to the far wall suddenly breaking into tears facing it she pounded on it weeping she spun to face me and instead she cried i have only these walls of stone and the steel collar of a slave girl she helplessly enraged tried to tear the slender graceful obdurate band from her white throat her fingers tore at it in fenzy in fury and she wept with frustration and at last she desisted of course she still wore the badge of her servitude the steel of a gorean slave collar is not made to be removed at a girls pleasure she was quiet now she looked at me curiously at one time she said men sought to please me but now it is i who must please them i said nothing her eyes regarded me rather boldly i thought as though inviting me to exercise my authority over her to address to her any command i might see fit a command which she of course would have no choice but to obey there was a long silence i did not feel i should break vikas life in its way had been hard and i wished her no harm her lips curled slightly in scorn i was well aware of the taunt of her flesh the obvious challenge of her eyes and carriage she seemed to say to me you cannot master me i wondered how many men had failed with a shrug she went to the side of the sleeping platform and picked up the white silken scarf i had removed from her throat she wrapped it again about her throat concealing the collar do not wear the scarf i said gently her eyes sparkled with anger you wish to see the collar she hissed you may wear the scarf if you wish i said her eyes clouded with bewilderment but i do not think you should i said why she asked because i think that you are more beautiful without it i said but more importantly to hide a collar is not to remove it rebellious fire flared in her eyes and then she smiled no she said i suppose not she turned away bitterly when i am alone she said i pretend that i am free that i am a great lady the ubara of a great city even of ar but when a man enters my chamber then again i am only a slave she slowly pulled the scarf from her throat and dropped it to the floor and turned to face me she lifted her head arrogantly and i saw that the collar was very beautiful on her throat with me i said gently you are free she looked at me scornfully there have been a hundred men in this chamber before you she said and they have taught me and taught me well that i wear a collar nonetheless i said with me you are free and there will be a hundred after you she said i supposed she spoke the truth i smiled in the meantime i said i grant you freedom she laughed to hide a collar she said in a mocking tone is not to remove it i laughed she had had the best of the exchange very well i conceded you are a slave girl when i said this though i spoke in jest she stiffened as though i might have lashed her mouth with the back of my hand her old insolence had returned then use me she said bitterly teach me the meaning of the collar i marveled vika in spite of her nine years of captivity her confinement in this chamber was still a headstrong spoiled arrogant girl and one fully aware of her yet unconquered flesh and the sinuous power which her beauty might exercise over men its capacity to torture them and drive them wild to bend them in the search for its smallest favours compliantly to her will there stood before me insolently the beautiful predatory girl who had come so long ago to the sardar to exploit priestkings later i said she choked with fury i bore her no ill will but i found her as irritating as she was beautiful i could understand that she a proud intelligent girl could not but resent the indignities of her position being forced to serve with the full offices of the slave girl whomsoever the priestkings might see fit to send to her chamber but yet i found in these grievances great though they might be no excuse for the deep hostility towards myself which seemed to suffuse her graceful being after all i too was a prisoner of priestkings and i had not chosen to come to her chamber how did i come to this chamber i asked they brought you she said priestkings i asked yes she said parp i asked for answer she only laughed how long did i sleep i asked long she said how long i asked fifteen ahn she said i whistled to myself the gorean day is divided into twenty ahn i had nearly slept around the clock well vika i said i think i am now ready to make use of you very well master said the girl and the expression by which she had addressed me seemed dipped in irony her hand loosened the clasp by which her garment was secured over her left shoulder can you cook i asked she looked at me yes she snapped she fumbled irritably with the clasp of her robe but her fingers were clumsy with rage she was unable to fasten the clasp i fastened it for her she looked up at me her eyes blazing i will prepare food she said be quick slave girl i said her shoulders shook with rage i see i said that i must teach you the meaning of your collar i took a step toward her and she turned stumbling with a cry and ran to the corner of the room my laugh was loud almost instantly reddening vika regained her composure and straightened herself tossing her head and brushing back a melody of blond hair which had fallen across her forehead the wool fillet she had worn to bind her hair had loosened she fixed on me a look of the most lofty disdain and standing against the wall lifting her arms behind the back of her neck she prepared to replace the fillet no i said i had decided i liked her better with her hair loose deliberately testing me she continued to tie the fillet my eyes met hers angrily she pulled the fillet from her hair and threw it to the floor and turned away to busy herself with the preparation of my meal her hair was very beautiful chapter six when priestkings walk vika could cook well and i enjoyed the meal she prepared stores of food were kept in concealed cabinets at one side of the room which were opened in the same fashion as the other apertures i had observed earlier at my command vika demonstrated for me the manner of opening and closing the storage and disposal areas in her unusual kitchen the temperature of the water which sprang from the wall tap i learned was regulated by the direction in which the shadow of a hand fell across a lightsensitive cell above the tap the amount of water was correlated with the speed with which the hand passed before the sensor i was interested to note that one received cold water by a shadow passing from right to left and hot water by a shadow passing from left to right this reminded me of faucets on earth in which the hot water tap is on the left and the cold on the right undoubtedly there is a common reason underlying these similar arrangements on gor and earth more cold water is used than hot and most individuals using the water are righthanded the food which vika withdrew from the storage apertures was not refrigerated but was protected by something resembling a foil of blue plastic it was fresh and appetising first she boiled and simmered a kettle of sullage a common gorean soup consisting of three standard ingredients and as it is said whatever else may be found saving only the rocks of the field the principal ingredients of sullage are the golden sul the starchy goldenbrown vineborne fruit of the goldenleaved sul plant the curled red ovate leaves of the turpah a tree parasite cultivated in host orchards of tur trees and the salty blue secondary roots of the kes shrub a small deeply rooted plant which grows best in sandy soil the meat was a steak cut from the loin of a bosk a huge shaggy longhorned illtempered bovine which shambles in large slowmoving herds across the prairies of gor vika seared this meat as thick as the forearm of a warrior on a small iron grill over a kindling of charcoal cylinders so that the thin margin of the outside was black crisp and flaky and sealed within by the touch of the fire was the bloodrich flesh hot and fat with juice beyond the sullage and the bosk steak there was the inevitable flat rounded loaf of the yellow satarna bread the meal was completed by a handful of grapes and a draught of water from the wall tap the grapes were purple and i suppose ta grapes from the lower vineyards of the terraced island of cos some four hundred pasangs from port kar i had tasted some only once before having been introduced to them in a feast given in my honour by lara who was tatrix of the city of tharna if they were indeed ta grapes i supposed they must have come by galley from cos to port kar and from port kar to the fair of enkara port kar and cos are hereditary enemies but such traditions would not be likely to preclude some profitable smuggling but perhaps they were not ta grapes for cos was far distant and even if carried by tarns the grapes would probably not seem so fresh i dismissed the matter from my mind i wondered why there was only water to drink and none of the fermented beverages of gor such as paga kalana wine or kalda i was sure that if these were available vika would have set them before me i looked at her she had not prepared herself a portion but after i had been served had knelt silently to one side back on her heels in the position of a tower slave a slave to whome largely domestic duties would be allotted in the gorean apartment cylinders on gor incidentally chairs have special significance and do not often occur in private dwellings they tend to be reserved for significant personages such as administrators and judges moerover although you may find this hard to understand they are not thought to be comfortable indeed when i had returned to earth from my first trip to gor i had found that one of the minor inconveniences of my return was reaccustoming myself to the simple business of sitting on chairs i felt for some months rather awkward rather unsteady perched on a little wooden platform supported by four narrow sticks perhaps if you can imagine yourself suddenly being forced to sit on rather high end tables you can sense the feeling the gorean male at ease usually sits crosslegged and the female kneels resting back on her heels the position of the tower slave in which vika knelt differs from that of a free woman only in the position of the wrists which are held before her and when not occupied crossed as though for binding a free womans wrists are never so placed the older tarl who had been my mentor in arms years ago in koroba had once told me the story of a free woman desperately in love with a warrior who in the presence of her family was entertaining him and whose wrists unconsciously had assumed the position of a slave it was only with difficulty that she had been restrained from hurling herself in mortification from one of the high bridges the older tarl had guffawed in recounting this anecdote and was scarcely less pleased by its sequel it seems she thereafter because of her embarrassment would never see the warrior and he at last impatient and desiring her carried her off as a slave girl and returned to the city months later with her as his free companion at the time that i had been in koroba the couple had still been living in the city i wondered what had become of them the position of the pleasure slave incidentally differs from the position of both the free woman and the tower slave the hands of a pleasure slave normally rest on her thighs but in some cities for example thentis i believe they are crossed behind her more significantly for the free womans hands may also rest on her thighs there is a difference in the placing of the knees in all these kneeling positions incidentally even that of the pleasure slave the gorean woman carries herself well her back is straight and her chin is high she tends to be vital and beautiful to look upon why is there nothing but water to drink i asked vika she shrugged i suppose she said because the chamber slave is alone much of the time i looked at her not fully understanding she gazed at me frankly it would be too easy then she said i felt like a fool of course the chamber slaves would not be permitted the escape of intoxication for if they were so allowed tolighten their bondage undoubtedly in time their beauty their utility to the priestkings would be diminished they would become unreliable lost in dreams and wines i see i said only twice a year is the food brought she said and it is brought by priestkings i asked i suppose she said but you do not know no said she i awaken on some morning and there is food i suppose parp brings it i said she looked at me with a trace of amusement parp the priestking i said did he tell you that she asked yes i said i see she said the girl was apparently unwilling to speak more of this matter and so i did not press her i had almost finished the meal you have done well i congratulated her the meal is excellent please she said i am hungry i looked at he dumbfounded she had not prepared herself a portion and so i had assumed that she had eaten or was not hungry or would prepare her own meal later make yourself something i said i cannot she said simply i can eat only what you give me i cursed myself for a fool had i now become so much the gorean warrior that i could disregard the feelings of a fellow creature in particular those of a girl who must be protected and cared for could it be that i ihad as the codes of my caste recommended not even considered her but merely regarded her as a rightless animal no more than a subject beast an abject instrument to my interests and pleasures a slave i am sorry i said was it not your intention to discipline me she asked no i said then my master is a fool she said reaching for the meat that i had left on my plate i caught her wrist it is now my intention to discipline you i said her eyes briefly clouded with tears very well she said withdrawing her hand vika would go hungry that night although it was late according to the chamber chronometer fixed in the lid of one of the chests i prepared to leave the room unfortunately there was no natural light in the room and so one could not judge the time by the sun or the stars and moons of gor i missed them since i had awakened the energy bulbs had continued to burn at a constant and undiminished rate i had washed as well as i could squatting in the stream of water which emerged from the wall in one of the chests against the wall i had found among the garments of various other castes a warriors tunic i donned this as my own had been torn by the larls claws vika had unrolled a straw mat which she placed on the floor at the foot of the great stone couch in the chamber on this wrapped in a light blanket her chin on her knees she sat watching me a heavy slave ring was set in the bottom of the couch to which i might have had i pleased chained her i buckled on my sword you are not going to leave the chamber are you asked vika the first words she had said to me since the meal yes i said but you may not she said why i asked alert it is forbidden she said i see i said i started for the door when the priestkings wish you they will come for you she said until then you must wait i do not care to wait i said but you must she insisted standing i went to her and placed my hands on her shoulders do not fear the priestkings so i said she saw that my resolve was not altered if you go she said return at least before the second gong why i asked for yourself she said looking down i am not afraid i said then for me she said not raising her eyes but why i asked she seemed confused i am afraid to be alone she said but you have been alone many nights i pointed out she looked up at me and i could not read the expression in her troubled eyes one does not cease to be afraid she said i must go i said suddenly in the distance i heard the rumble of the gong which i had heard before in the hall of priestkings vika smiled up at me you see she said in relief it is too late now you must remain why i asked she looked away avoiding my eyes because the energy bulbs will soon be dimmed she said and it will be the hours allotted for sleep she seemed unwilling to speak further why must i remain i asked i held her shoulders more firmly and shook her to force her to speak why i insisted fear crep into her eyes why i demanded then came the second rumbling stroke of the distant gong and vika seemed to tremble in my arms her eyes were wide with fear i shook her again savagely why i cried she could hardly speak her voice was scarcely a whisper because after the gong she said yes i demanded they walk she said who i demanded the priestkings she cried and turned from me i am not afraid of parp i said she turned and looked at me he is not a priestking she said quietly and then came the third and final stroke of that distant gong and at the same instant the energy bulbs in the room dimmed and i understood that now somewhere in the long corridors of that vast edifice there walked the priestkings of gor chapter seven i hunt for priestkings in spite of vikas protests it was with a light heart that i strode into the passageway beyond her chamber i would seek the priestkings of gor she followed me almost to the portal and i can remember how the sensors set in that great threshold in the dimmed light of the energy bulbs began to glow and pulse as she neared them i could see her white garment and sense the pale beauty of her skin as she stood back from the portal in the semidarkened chamber please do not go she called to me i must i said come back she cried i did not answer her but began to prowl down the hallway im afraid i heard her call i assumed she would be safe as she had been on countless nights and so i went on i thought i heard her weep and supposed that she did so for herself because she was frightened i continued down the passageway my business was not to console her not to tell her not to be afraid not to give her the comfort of another human presence my business was with the dread denizens of these dim passageways which had so inspired her terror my business was not that of the comforter or friend but that of the warrior as i went down the passageway i looked into the various chambers identical with my own which lined it each like mine lacked a gate or door and had for its entrance only that massive portal perhaps some twelve feet wide and eighteen feet high i would not have enjoyed sleeping in such a room for there was no way to protect oneself from the hall and of course eventually one would need sleep almost all of the chambers i passed and i passed many seemd to be empty two however housed chamber slaves girls like vika clad and collared identically i suppose the only difference in the attire of the three girls would have been the numerals engraved on their collars vika of course had worn a scarf and these girls did not but now vika no longer wore her scarf now her collar steel and gleaming locked encircling her fair throat was as evident and beautiful as theirs proclaiming her to the eyes of all like them only a slave girl the first girl was a short sturdy wench with thick ankles and wide exciting shoulders probably of peasant stock her hair had been braided and looped over her right shoulder it was hard in the light to determine its colour she had risen from her mat at the foot of the couch unbelievingly blinking and rubbing her heavylidded ovoid eyes as far as i could tell she was alone in the chamber when she approached the portal its sensors began to glow and pulse as had vikas who are you asked the girl her accent suggesting the satarna fields above ar and toward the tamber gulf have you seen priestkings i asked not this night she said i am cabot of koroba i said and went on the second girl was tall fragile and willowy with slender ankles and large hurt eyes she had dark curling hair that fell about her shoulders and stood out against the white of her garment she may have been of high caste without speaking to her it would be hard to tell even then it might be difficult to be sure for the accents of some of the higher artisan castes approximate pure high caste gorean she stood with her back against the far wall the palms of her hands against it her eyes fastened on me frightened scarcely breathing as far as i could tell she too was alone have you seen priestkings i asked she shook her head vigorously no still wondering if she were of high caste and smiling to myself i continued down the passageway both of the girls had in their way been beautiful but i found vika superior to both my chamber slaves accent had been pure high caste gorean though i could not place the city probably her caste had been that of the builders or physicians for had her people been scribes i would have expected a greater subtlety of inflections the use of less common grammatical cases and had her people been of the warriors i would have expected a blunter speech rather belligerently simple expressed in great reliance on the indicative mood and habitually a rather arrogant refusal to venture beyond the most straightforward of sentence structures on the other hand these generalisations are imperfect for gorean speech is no less complex than that of any of the great natural language communities of the earth nor are its speakers any the less diverse it is incidentally a beautiful language it can be as subtle as greek as direct as latin as expressive as russian as rich as english as forceful as german to the goreans it is always simply the language as though there were no others and those who do not speak it are regarded immediately as barbarians this sweet fierce liquid speech is the common bond that tends to hold together the gorean world it is the common property of the administrator of ar a herdsman beside the vosk a peasant from tor a scribe from thentis a metalworker from tharna a physician from cos a pirate from port kar a warrior from koroba i found it difficult to remove from my mind the image of the two chamber slaves and that of vika perhaps because the plight of these girls touched my heart perhaps because each though differently was beautiful i found myself congratulating myself that i had been taken to the chamber of vika for i had thought her the most beautiful then i wondered if my having been brought to her chamber and not to that of one of the others had been simply my good fortune it occurred to me that vika in some ways resembled lara who was tatrix of tharna for whom i had cared she was shorter than lara and more fully bodied but they would have been considered of the same general physical type vikas eyes were a sullen smouldering taunting blue the blue of laras eyes had been brighter as clear and when not impassioned as soft as the summer sky over koroba when impassioned they had burned as fiercely as beautifully as helplessly as the walls of a raped city laras lips had been rich and fine sensitive and curious tender eager hungry the lips of vika were maddening i recalled those lips full and red pouting defiant scornful scarlet with a slave girls challenge to my blood i wondered if vika might be a bred slave a passion slave one of those girls bred for beauty and passion over generations by the zealous owners of the great slave houses of ar for lips such as vikas were a feature often bred into passion slaves they were lips formed for the kiss of a master and as i pondered these things i sensed that it had not been accident that i had been carried to vikas chamber but that this had been part of a plan by the priestkings i had sensed that vika had defeated and broken many men and i sensed that the priestkings might be curious to see how i might fare with her i wondered if vika herself had been instructed by priestkings to subdue me i gathered that she had not it was not the way of priestkings vika would be all unconscious of their machinations she would simply be herself which is what the priestkings would desire she would simply be vika insolent aloof contemptuous provocative untamed though collared determined to be the master though she were the slave i wondered how many men had fallen at her feet how many men she had forced to sleep at the foot of the great stone couch in the shadow of the slave ring while she herself reclined on the pelts and silks of the master after some hours i found myself again in the hall of priestkings i was gladdened to see once more the moons and stars of gor hurtling in the sky above the dome my footsteps rang hollowly on the stones of the floor the great chamber reposed in vastness and stillness the empty throne loomed silent and awesome i am here i cried i am tarl cabot i am a warrior of koroba and i issue the challenge of a warrior to the priestkings of gor let us do battle let us make war my voice echoed for a long time in the vast chamber but i received no response to my challenge i called out again and again there was no response i decided to return to vikas chamber on another night i might explore further for there were other passageways other portals visible from where i stood it might take days to pursue them all i set out on my way back to vikas chamber i had walked perhaps an ahn and was deep inside one of the long dimly lit passageways which led in the direction of her chamber when i seemed somehow to sense a presence behind me i spun quickly about drawing my sword in the same motion the corridor behind me was empty i slammed the blade back in the sheath and continued on i had not walked far when i again became uneasy this time i did not turn but walked slowly ahead listening behind me with every fibre i could bend to the effort when i came to a bend in the passageway i rounded it and then pressed myself against the wall and waited slowly very slowly i drew the sword taking care that it made no sound as it left its sheath i waited but nothing occurred i have the patience of a warrior and i waited for a long time when men stalk one another with weapons it is well to have patience great patience it of course occurred to me a hundred times that i was follish for actually i was conscious of having heard nothing yet my awareness or sense that something followed me in the corridor might well have been occasioned by some tiny sound which my conscious mind had not even registered but yet which had impinged on my senses leaving as its only conscious trace a vague wind of suspicion at last i decided to force the game my decision was motivated in part by the fact that the hall allowed few concealments for ambush and i would presumably see my pursuer almost as soon as he saw me if he were not carrying a missile weapon it would make little difference and if he had been carrying a missile weapon why had he not slain me before i smiled grimly if it were a matter of waiting i acknowledged that the priestking if such it were who followed me had had the best of things for all i knew a priestking could wait like a stone or tree nerveless until necessary i had waited perhaps better than an ahn and i was covered with sweat my muscles ached for motion it occurred to me that whatever followed might have heard the cessation of my footsteps that it knew that i was waiting how acute would be the senses of priestkings perhaps they would be relatively feeble gaving grown accustomed to reliance on instrumentation perhaps they would be other than the senses of men sharper if only from a differing genetic heritage capable of discriminating and interpreting sensory cues that would not even be available to the primitive five senses of men never before had i been so aware of the thin margin of reality admitted into the human nervous system little more than a razors width of apprehension given the multiple and complex physical processes which formed our environment the safest thing for me would be to continue on as i had been doing a pattern of action which would give me the benefit of the shield formed by the turn in the passage but i had no wish to continue on i tensed myself for the leap and cry that would fling me into the open the sudden interruption in the stillness of the passageway that might be sufficient to impair the steadiness of a spear arm the calm setting of a crossbows iron quarrel on its guide and so i uttered the war cry of koroba and leaped sword ready to face what might follow me a howl of bitter rage escaped my lips as i saw that the passageway was empty maddened beyond understanding i began to race down the passageway retracing my steps to confront what might be in the passage i had run for perhaps half a pasang when i stopped panting and furious with myself come out i cried come out the stillness of the passageway taunted me i remembered vikas words when the priestkings wish you they will come for you angrily i stood alone in the passageway in the dimmed light of its energy bulbs my unused sword grasped futilely in my hand then i sensed something my nostrils flared slightly and then as carefully as one might examine an object by eye i smelled the air of the passageway i had never much relied on this sense surely i had enjoyed the scent of flowers and women of hot fresh bread roasted meat paga and wines harness leather the oil with which i protected the blade of my sword from rust of green fields and storm winds but seldom had i considered the sense of smell in the way one would consider that of vision or touch and yet it too had its often neglected store of information ready for the man who was ready to make use of it and so i smelled the passageway and to my nostrils vague but undeniable there came an odour that i had never before encountered it was as far as i could tell at that time a simple odour though later i would learn that it was the complex product of odours yet more simple than itself i find it impossible to describe this odour much as one miught find it difficult to describe the taste of a citrus fruit to one who had never tasted it or anything much akin to it it was however slightly acrid irritating to my nostrils it reminded me vaguely of the odour of an expended cartridge although there was nothing now with me in the passage it had left its trace i knew now that i had not been alone i had caught the scent of a priestking i resheathed my sword and returned to vikas chamber i hummed a warriors tune for somehow i was happy chapter eight vika leaves the chamber wake up wench i cried striding into vikas chamber clapping my hands sharply twice the startled girl cried out and leaped to her feet she had been lying on the straw mat at the foot of the stone couch so suddenly had she arisen that she had struck her knee against the couch and this had not much pleased her i had meant to scare her half to death and i was pleased to see that i had she looked at me angrily i was not asleep she said i strode to her and held her head in my hands looking at her eyes she had spoken the truth you see she said i laughed she lowered her head and then looked up shyly i am happy she said that you have returned i looked at her and sensed that she was i suppose i said that in my absence you have been in the pantry no she said i have not adding as an acrimonious afterthought master i had offended her pride vika i said i think it is time that some changes were made around here nothing ever changes here she said i looked around the room the sensors in the room interested me i examined them again i was elated then methodically i began to search the room although the sensors and the mode of their application were fiendish and beyonf my immediate competence to fully understand they suggested nothing ultimately mysterious nothing which might not eventually be explained there was nothing about them to encourage me to believe that the priestkings or king as it might be were ultimately unfathomable or incomprehensible beings moreover in the corridor beyond i had sensed the traces tangible traces of a priestking i laughed yes i had smelled a priestking or its effects the thought amused me more fully than ever i now understood how much the forces of superstition have depressed and injured men no wonder the priestkings hid behind their palisade in the sardar and let the myths of the initiates build a wall of human terror about them no wonder they let their nature and ends be secret no wonder they took such pains to conceal and obscure their plans and purposes their devices their instrumentation their limitations i laughed aloud vika watched me puzzled surely convinced that i must have lost my mind i cracked my fist into my open palm where is it i cried what whispered vika the priestkings see and the priestkings hear i cried but how by their power said vika moving back to the wall i had examined the entire room as well as i could it might be possible of course to use some type of penetrating beam which if subtly enough adjusted might permit the reception of signals through walls and then relay these to a distant screen but i doubted that such a device though perhaps within the capacities of the priestkings would be used in the relatively trivial domestic surveillance of these chambers then my eye saw directly in the centre of the ceiling another energy bulb like those in the walls only the bulb was not lit that was a mistake on the priestkings part but of course the device could be in any of the bulbs perhaps one of the almost inexhaustible energy bulbs which can burn for years had as a simple matter of fact at last burned out i leaped to the centre of the stone platform i cried to the girl bring me the laver she was convinced i was mad quickly i shouted and she fairly leapt to fetch the bronze bowl i seized the bowl from her hand and hurled it underhanded up against the bulb which though it had apparently burned out shattered with a great flash and hiss of smoke and sparks vika screamed and crouched behind the stone platform down from the cavity where the energy bulb had been there hung blasted and smoking a tangle of wire a ruptured metal diaphragm and a conical receptacle which might once have held a lens come here i said to vika but the poor girl cringed beside the platform impatient i seized her by the arm and yanked her to the platform and held her there in my arms look up i said but she kept her face resolutely down i thrust my fist in her hair and she cried out and looked up see i cried what is it she whimpered it was an eye i said an eye she whimpered yes i said something like the eye in the door i wanted her to understand whose eye she asked the eye of priestkings i laughed but it is now shut vika trembled against me and in my joy with my fist still in her hair i bent my face to hers and kissed her full on those magnificent lips and she cried out helpless in my arms and wept but did not resist it was the first kiss i had taken from the lips of my slave girl and it had been a kiss of mad joy one that astonished her that she could not understand i leaped from the couch and went to the portal she remained standing on the stone platform bewildered her fingers at her lips her eyes regarded me strangely vika i cried would you like to leave this room of course she said her voice trembled very well i said you shall do so she shrank back i laughed and went to the portal once again i examined the six red domed sensors three on a side which were fixed there it would be in a way a shame to destroy them for they were rather beautiful i drew my sword stop cried vika in terror she leaped from the stone couch and ran to me seizing my sword arm but with my left hand i flung her back and she fell stumbling back against the side of the stone couch dont she cried kneeling there her hands outstretched six times the hilt of my sword struck against the sensors and six times there was a hissing pop like the explosion of hot glass and a bright shower of scarlet sparks the sensors had been shattered their lenses broken and the wired apertures behind them a tangle of black fused wire i resheathed my sword and wiped my face with the back of my forearm i could taste a little blood and knew that some of the fragments from the sensors had cut my face vika knelt beside the couch numbly i smiled at her you may now leave the room i said should you wish to do so slowly she rose to her feet her eyes looked to the portal and its shattered sensors then she looked at me something of wonder and fear in her eyes she shook herself my master is hurt she said i am tarl cabot of koroba i said to her telling her my name and city for the first time my city is treve she said for the first time telling me the name of her city i smiled as i watched her go to fetch a towel from one of the chests against the wall so vika was from treve that explained much treve was a warlike city somewhere in the trackless magnificence of the voltai range i had never been there but i knew her reputation her warriors were said to be fierce and brave her women proud and beautiful her tarnsmen were ranked with those of thentis famed for its tarn flocks and koroba even great ar itself vika returned with the towel and began dabbing at my face it was seldom a girl from treve ascended the auction block i suppose vika would have been costly had i purchased her in ar or koroba even when not beautiful because of their rarity they are prized by collectors treve was alleged to lie above ar some seven hundred pasangs distant and toward the sardar i had never seen the city located on a map but i had seen the territory she claimed so marked the precise location of treve was not known to me and was perhaps known to few save its citizens trade routes did not lead to the city and those who entered its territory did not often return there was said to be no access to treve save on tarnback and this would suggest that it must be as much a mountain stronghold as a city she was said to have no agriculture and this may be true each year in the fall legions of tarnsmen from treve were said to emerge from the voltai like locusts and fall on the fields of one city or another different cities in different years harvesting what they needed and burning the rest in order that a long relatiatory winter campaign could not be launched against them a century ago the tarnsmen of treve had even managed to stand off the tarnsmen of ar in a fierce battle fought in the stormy sky over the crags of the voltai i had heard poets sing of it since that time her depredations had gone unchecked although perhaps it should be added that never again did the men of treve despoil the fields of ar does it hurt asked vika no i said of course it hurts she sniffed i wondered if many of treves women were as beautiful as vika if they were it was surprising that tarnsmen from all the cities of gor would not have descended on the place as the saying goes to try chain luck are all the women of treve as beautiful as you i asked of course not she said irritably are you the most beautiful i asked i dont know she said simply and then she smiled and added perhaps with a graceful movement she rose and went back again to the chests against the wall she returned with a small tube of ointment they are deeper than i thought she said with the tip of her finger she began to work the ointment into the cuts it burned quite a bit does it hurt she asked no i said she laughed and it pleased me to hear her laugh i hope you know what you are doing i said my father she said was of the caste of physicians so i thought to myself i had placed her accent rather well either builders or physicians and had i thought carefully enough about it i might have recognised her accent as being a bit too refined for the builders i chuckled to myself in effect i had probably merely scored a lucky hit i didnt know they had physicians in treve i said we have all the high castes in treve she said angrily the only two cities other than ar which i knew that treve did not periodically attack were mountainous thentis famed for its tarn flocks and koroba my own city if the issue was grain of course there would be little point in going to thentis for she imports her own but her primary wealth her tarn flocks is not negligible and she also possesses silver though her mines are not as rich as those of tharna perhaps treve has never attacked thentis because she too is a mountain city lying in the mountains of thentis or more likely because the men of treve respect her tarnsmen almost as much as they do their own the cessation of attacks on koroba began during the time my father matthew cabot was ubar of that city he organised a system of farflung beacons set in fortified towers which would give the alarm when unwelcome forces entered the territory of koroba at the sight of raiders one tower would set its beacons aflame glittering by night or dampen it with green branches by day to produce a white smoke and this signal would be relayed from tower to tower thus when the tarnsmen of treve came to the grain fields of koroba which lie for the most part some pasangs from the city toward the vosk and tamber gulf they would find her tarnsmen arrayed against them having come for grain and not war the men of treve would then turn back and seek out the fields of a less welldefended city there was also a system of signals whereby the towers could communicate with one another and the city thus if one tower failed to report when expected the alarm bars of koroba would soon ring and her tarnsmen would saddle and be aflight cities of course would pursue the raiders from treve and carry the pursuit vigorously as far as the foothills of the voltai but there they would surrender the chase turning back not caring to risk their tarnsmen in the rugged formidable territory of their rival whose legendary ferocity among her own crags once gave pause long ago even to the mighty forces of ar treves other needs seemd to be satisfied much in the same way as her agricultural ones for her raiders were known from the borders of the fair of enkara in the very shadow of the sardar to the delta of the vosk and the islands beyond such as tyros and cos the results of these raids might be returned to treve or sold perhaps even at the fair of enkara or another of the four great sardar fairs or if not they could always be disposed of easily without question in distant crowded malignant port kar how do the people of treve live i asked vika we raise the verr she said i smiled the verr was a mountain goat indigenous to the voltai it was a wild agile illtempered beast longhaired and spiralhorned among the voltai crags it would be worth ones life to come within twenty yards of one then you are a simple domestic folk i said yes said vika mountain herdsmen i said yes said vika and then we laughed together neither of us able to restrain ourselves yes i knew the reputation of treve it was a city rich in plunder probably as lofty inaccessible and impregnable as a tarns nest indeed treve was known as the tarn of the voltai it was an arrogant neverconquered citadel a stronghold of men whose way of life was banditry whose women lived on the spoils of a hundred cities and it was the city from which vika had come i believed it but yet tonight she had been gentle and i had been kind to her tonight we had been friends she went to the chest against the wall to replace the tube of ointment the ointment will soon be absorbed she said in a few minutes there will be no trace of it nor of the cuts i whistled the physicians of treve i said have marvellous medicines it is an ointment of priestkings she said i was pleased to hear this for it suggested vulnerability then priestkings can be injured i asked their slaves can said vika i see i said let us not speak of priestkings said the girl i looked at her standing across the room lovely facing me in the dim light vika i asked was your father truly of the caste of physicians yes she said why do you ask it does not matter i said but why she insisted because i said i thought you might have been a bred pleasure slave it was a foolish thing to say and i regretted it immediately she stiffened you flatter me she said and turned away i had hurt her i made a move to approach her but without turning she said please do not touch me and then she seemed to straighten and turned to face me once again the old and scornful vika challenging hostile but of course you may touch me she said for you are my master forgive me i said she laughed bitterly scornfully it was truly a woman of treve who stood before me now i saw her as i had never seen her before vika was a bandit princess accustomed to be clad in silk and jewels from a thousand looted caravans to sleep on the richest furs and sup on the most delicate viands all purloined from galleys beached and burnt from the ravished storerooms of outlying smoking cylinders from the tables and treasure chests of homes whose men were slain whose daughters wore the chains of slave girls only now she herself vika this bandit princess proud vika a woman of lofty opulent treve had fallen spoils herself in the harsh games of gor and felt on her own throat the same encircling band of steel with which the men of her city had so often graced the throats of their fair weeping captives vika was now property my property her eyes regarded me with fury insolently she approached me slowly gracefully as silken in her menace as the shelarl and then to my astonishment when she stood before me she knelt her hands on her thighs her knees in the position of the pleasure slave and dropped her head in scornful submission she raised her head and her taunting blue eyes regarded me boldly here master she said is your pleasure slave rise i said she rose gracefully and put her arms about my neck and moved her lips close to mine you kissed me before she said now i shall kiss you i looked into those blue eyes and they looked into mine and i wondered how many men had been burned and had died in that smouldering sullen fire those magnificent lips brushed mine here she said softly imperiously is the kiss of your pleasure slave i disengaged her arms from my neck she looked at me in bewilderment i walked from the room into the dimly lit hall in the passageway i extended my hand to her that she might come and take it do i not please you she asked vika i said come here and take the hand of a fool when she saw what i intended she shook head slowly numbly no she said i cannot leave the chamber please i said she shook with fear come i said take my hand slowly trembling moving as though in a dream the girl approached the portal and this time the sensors could not glow she looked at me please i said she looked again at the sensors which stared out of the wall like black gutted metal eyes they were burned and still shattered and even the wall in their vicinity showed the seared scarlet stain of their abrupt termination they can hurt you no longer i said vika took another step and then it seemed her legs would fail her and she might swoon she put out her hand to me her eyes were wide with fear the women of treve i said are brave as well as beautiful and proud she stepped through the portal and fell fainting in my arms i lifted her and carried her to the stone couch i regarded the ruined sensors in the portal and the wreckage of the surveillance device which had been concealed in the energy bulb perhaps now i would not have so long to wait for the priestkings of gor vika had said that when they wished me they would come for me i chuckled perhaps now they would be encouraged to hasten their appointment i gently placed vika on the great stone couch chapter nine the priestking i would allow vika to share the great stone couch its sleeping pelts and silken sheets this was unusual however for normally the gorean slave girl sleeps at the foot of her masters couch often on a straw mat with only a thin cottonlike blanket woven from the soft fibres of the rep plant to protect her from the cold if she has not pleased her master of late she may be of course as a disciplinary measure simply chained nude to the slave ring at in the bottom of the couch sans both blanket and mat the stones of the floor are hard and the gorean nights are cold and it is a rare girl who when unchained in the morning does not seek more dutifully to serve her master this harsh treatment incidentally when she is thought to deserve it may even be inflicted on a free companion in spite of the fact that she is free and usually much loved according to the gorean way of looking at things a taste of the slave ring is thought to be occasionally beneficial to all women even the exalted free companions thus when she has been irritable or otherwise troublesome even a free companion may find herself at the foot of the couch looking forward to a pleasant night on the stones stripped with neither mat nor blanket chained to a slave ring precisely as though she were a lowly slave girl it is the gorean way of reminding her should she need to be reminded that she too is a woman and thus to be dominated to be subject to men should she be tempted to forget this basic fact of gorean life the slave ring set in the bottom of each gorean couch is there to refresh her memory gor is a mans world and yet on this world i have seen great numbers of women who were both beautiful and splendid the gorean woman for reasons that are not altogether clear to me considering the culture rejoices in being a woman she is often an exciting magnificent glorious creature outspoken talkative vital active spirited on the whole i find her more joyful than many of her earthinhabiting sisters who theoretically at least enjoy a more lofty status although it is surely true that on my old world i have met several women with something of the gorean zest for acknowledging the radiant truth of their sex the gifts of joy grace and beauty tenderness and fathoms of love that we poor men i suspect may sometimes and tragically fail to understand to comprehend yet with all due respect and regard for the most astounding and marvellous sex i suspect that perhaps partly because of my gorean training it is true that a touch of the slave ring is occasionally beneficial of custom a slave girl may not even ascend the couch to serve her masters pleasure the point of this restriction i suppose is to draw a clearer distinction between her status and that of a free companion at any rate the dignities of the couch are by custom reserved for the free companion when a master wishes to make use of a slave girl he tells her to light the lamp of love which she obediently does placing it in the window of his chamber that they may not be disturbed then with his own hand he throws upon the stone floor of his chamber luxurious love furs perhaps from the larl itself and commands her to them i had placed vika gently on the great stone couch i kissed her gently on the forehead her eyes opened did i leave the chamber she asked yes i said she regarded me for a long time how can i conquer you she asked i love you tarl cabot you are only grateful i said no she said i love you you must not i said i do she said i wondered how i should speak to her for i must disabuse her of the illusion that there could be love between us in the house of priestkings there could be no love nor could she know her own mind in these matters and there was always talena whose image would never be eradicated from my heart but you are a woman of treve i said smiling you thought i was a passion slave she chided i shrugged she looked away from me toward the wall you were right in a way tarl cabot how is that i asked she looked at me directly my mother she said bitterly was a passion slave bred in the pens of ar she must have been very beautiful i said vika looked at me strangely yes she said i suppose she was do you not remember her i asked no she said for she died when i was very young im sorry i said it doesnt matter said vika for she was only an animal bred in the pens of ar do you despise her so i asked she was a bred slave said vika i said nothing but my father said vika whose slave she was and who was of the caste of physicians of treve loved her very much and asked her to be his free companion vika laughed softly for three years she refused him she said why i asked because she loved him said vika and did not wish him to take for his free companion only a lowly passion slave she was a very deep and noble woman i said vika made a gesture of disgust she was a fool she said how often would a bred slave have a chance of freedom seldom indeed i admitted but in the end said vika fearing he would slay himself she consented to become his free companion vikar regarded me closely her eyes met mine very directly i was born free she said you must understand that i am not a bred slave i understand i said perhaps i suggested your mother was not only beautiful but proud and brave and fine how could that be laughed vika scornfully i have told you she was only a bred slave an animal from the pens of ar but you never knew her i said i know what she was said vika what of your father i asked in a way she said he is dead too what do you mean in a way i asked nothing she said i looked about the room at the chests against the wall dim in the reduced light of the energy bulbs at the walls at the shattered device in the ceiling at the broken sensors at the great empty portal that led into the passageway beyond he must have loved you very much after your mother died i said yes said vika i suppose so but he was a fool why do you say that i asked he followed me into the sardar to try and save me she said he must have been a very brave man i said she rolled away from me and stared at the wall after a time she spoke her words cruel with contempt he was a pompous little fool she said and afraid even of the cry of a larl she sniffed suddenly she rolled back to face me how she asked could my mother have loved him he was only a fat pompous little fool perhaps he was kind to her i suggested when others were not why would anyone be kind to a passion slave asked vika i shrugged for the passion slave she said it is the belled ankle perfume the whip and the furs of love perhaps he was kind to her i suggested again when others were not i dont understand said vika perhaps i said he cared for her and spoke to her and was gentle and loved her perhaps said vika but would that be enough perhaps i said i wonder said vika i have often wondered about that what became of him i asked when he entered the sardar vika would not speak do you know i asked yes she said then what i asked she shook her head bitterly do not ask me she said i would not press her further on the matter how is it i asked that he allowed you to come to the sardar he did not said vika he tried to prevent me but i sought out the initiates of treve proposing myself as an offering to the priestkings i did not of course tell them my true reason for desiring to come to the sardar she paused i wonder if they knew she mused it is not improbable i said my father would not hear of it of course she said she laughed he locked me in my chambers but the high initiate of the city came with warriors and they broke into our compartments and beat my father until he could not move and i went gladly with them she laughed again oh how pleased i was when they beat him and he cried out for he was not a true man and even though of the caste of physicians could not stand pain he could not even bear to hear the cry of a larl i knew that gorean caste lines though largely following birth were not inflexible and that a man who did not care for his caste might be allowed to change caste if approved by the high council of his city an approval usually contingent on his qualifications for the work of another caste and the willingness of the members of the new caste to accept him as a caste brother perhaps i suggested it was because he could not stand pain that he remained a member of the caste of physicians perhaps said vika he always wanted to stop suffering even that of an animal or slave i smiled you see she said he was weak i see i said vika lay back in the silks and furs you are the first of the men in this chamber she said who have spoken to me of these things i did not reply i love you tarl cabot she said i think not i said gently i do she insisted someday i said you will love but i do not think it will be a warrior of koroba do you think i cannot love she challenged i think someday you will love i said and i think you will love greatly can you love she challenged i dont know i said i smiled once long ago i thought i loved who was she asked vika not too pleasantly a slender darkhaired girl i said whose name was talena was she beautiful asked vika yes i said as beautiful as i asked vika you are both very beautiful i said was she a slave asked vika no i said she was the daughter of a ubar rage transfigured vikas features and she leaped from the couch and strode to the side of the room her fingers angrily inside her collar as though they might pull it from her throat i see she said and i vika am only a slave girl do not be angry i said where is she demanded vika i dont know i admitted how long has it been since you have seen her demanded vika it has been more than seven years i said vika laughed cruelly then she gloated she is in the cities of dust perhaps i admitted i vika she said am here i know i said i turned away i heard her voice over my shoulder i will make you forget her she said her voice had borne the cruel icy confident passionate menace of a woman from treve accustomed to have what she wanted who would not be denied i turned to face vika once more and i no longer saw the girl to whom i had been speaking but a woman of high caste from the bandit kingdom of treve insolent and imperious though collared casually vika reached to the clasp on the left shoulder of her garment and loosened it and the garment fell to her ankles she was branded you though i was a passion slave she said i regarded the woman who stood before me the sullen eyes the pouting lips the collar the brand am i not beautiful enough she asked to be the daughter of a ubar yes i said you are that beautiful she looked at me mockingly do you know what a passion slave is she asked yes i said it is a female of the human kind she said but bred like a beast for its beauty and its passion i know i said it is an animal she said bred for the pleasure of men bred for the pleasure of a master i said nothing in my veins she said flows the blood of such an animal in my veins flows the blood of a passion slave she laughed and you tarl cabot she said are its master you tarl cabot are my master no i said amused tauntingly she approached me i will serve you as a passion slave she said no i said yes she said for you i will be an obedient passion slave she lifted her lips to mine my hands on her arms held her from me taste me she said no i said she laughed you cannot reject me she said why not i asked i shall not allow you to do so she said you see tarl cabot i have decided that you shall be my slave i thrust her from me very well she cried her eyes flashing very well cabot she said then i shall conquer you and she seized my head in her hands and pressed her lips to mine in that moment i sensed once more that slightly acrid scent which i had experienced in the corridors beyond the chamber and i pressed my mouth hard into vikas until her lips were cut by my teeth and i had pressed her back until only my arm kept her from falling to the stones of the floor and i heard her cry of surprise and pain and then i hurled her angrily from me to the straw slave mat which lay at the foot of the stone couch now it seemed to me that i understood but they had come too soon she had not had a chance to do her work it might go hard with her but i was not concerned still i did not turn to that giant portal the scent was now strong vika crouched terrified on the slave mat at the foot of the couch in the very shadow of the slave ring what is the matter she asked what is wrong so you were to conquer me for them were you i demanded i dont understand she stammered you are a poor tool for priestkings i said no she said no how many men have you conquered for priestkings i asked i seized her by the hair and twisted her head to face me how many i cried please she wept i found myself tempted to break her head against the foot of the stone couch for she was worthless treacherous seductive cruel vicious worthy only of the collar irons and the whip she shook her head numbly as though denying charges i had not yet voiced you dont understand she said i love you with loathing i cast her from me yet still did i not turn to face that portal vika lay at my feet a streak of blood at the corner of those lips that bore still the marks of my fierce kiss she looked up at me tears welling in her eyes please she said the scent was strong i knew that it was near how was it that the girl was not aware of it how was it that she did not know was it not part of her plan please she said looking up at me lifting her hand to me her face was tearstained her voice was a broken sob i love you she said silence slave girl i said she lowered her head to the stones and wept i knew now that it was here the scent was now overpowering unmistakable i watched vika and suddenly she seemed too to know and her head lifted and her eyes widened with horror and she crept to her knees her hands before her face as though to shield herself and she shuddered and suddenly uttered a wild long terrible scream of abject fear i drew my sword and turned it stood framed in the doorway in its way it was very beautiful golden and tall looming over me framed in that massive portal it was not more than a yard wide but its head nearly touched the top of the portal and so i would judged that standing as it did it must have been nearly eighteen feet high it had six legs and a great head like a globe of gold with eyes like vast luminous disks its two forelegs poised and alert were lifted delicately in front of its body its jaws opened and closed once they moved laterally from its head there extended two fragile jointed appendages long and covered with short quivering strands of golden hair these two appendages like eyes swept the room once and then seemed to focus on me they curved toward me like delicate golden pincers and each of the countless golden strands on those appendages straightened and pointed toward me like a quivering golden needle i could not conjecture the nature of the creatures experience but i knew that i stood within the centre of its sensory field about its neck there hung a small circular device a translator of some sort similar to but more compact than those i had hitherto seen i sensed a new set of odours secreted by what stood before me almost simultaneously a mechanically reproduced voice began to emanate from the translator it spoke in gorean i knew what it would say lo sardar it said i am a priestking i am tarl cabot of koroba i said a moment after i spoke i sensed another set of odours which emanated perhaps from the device which hung about the neck of what stood before me the two sensory appendages of the creature seemed to register this information a new scent came to my nostrils follow me said the mechanically reproduced voice and the creature turned from the portal i went to the portal it was stalking in long delicate steps down the passageway i looked once more at vika who lifted her hand to me dont go she said i turned scornfully from her and followed the creature behind me i heard her weep let her weep i said to myself for she has failed her masters the priestkings and undoubtedly her punishment will not be light had i the time had i not more urgent business i might have punished her myself teaching her without mercy what could be the meaning of her collar using her as objectively and ruthlessly as she deserved brutally administering the discipline of a gorean master to a treacherous slave girl we would see then who would conquer i shook these thoughts from my head and continued down the passageway i must forget the treacherous vicious wench there were more important matters to attend to the slave girl was nothing i hated vika i followed a priestking chapter ten misk the priestking the priestkings have little or no scent of their own which is detectable by the human nostrils though one gathers there is a nest odour by which they may identify one another and that the variations in this nest odour permit identifications of individuals what in the passageways i had taken to be the scent of priestkings had actually been the residue of odoursignals which priestkings like certain social insects of our world use in communicating with one another the slightly acrid odour i had noticed tends to be a common property of all such signals much as there is a common property to the sound of a human voice whether it be that of an englishman a bushman a chinese or a gorean which sets it apart from say the growling of animals the hiss of snakes the cry of birds the priestkings have eyes which are compound and manyfaceted but they do not much rely on these organs they are for them something like our ears and nose used as secondary sensors to be relied upon when the most pertinent information in the environment is not relayed by vision or in the case of the priestkings by scent accordingly the two goldenhaired jointed appendages protruding from their globelike heads above the rounded disklike eyes are their primary sensory organs i gather that these appendages are sensitive not only to odours but due to modification of some of the sensory hairs may also transform sound vibrations into something meaningful in their experience thus if one wishes one may speak of them not only as smelling but hearing through these appendages apparently hearing is not of great importance however to them considering the small number of hairs modified for this purpose oddly enough few of the priestkings whom i questioned on this matter seemed to draw the distinction clearly between hearing and smelling i find this incredible but i have no reason to believe they deceived me they recognise that we have different sensory arrangements than they and i suspect that they are as unclear as to the nature of our experience as we are of theirs in fact though i speak of hearing and smelling i am not sure that these expressions are altogether meaningful when applied to priestkings i speak of them smelling and hearing through the sensory appendages but what the quality of their experience may be i am uncertain for example does a priestking have the same qualitative experience that i do when we are confronted by the same scent i am inclined to doubt it for their music which consists of rhapsodies of odours produced by instruments constructed for this purpose and often played by priestkings some of whom i am told are far more skillful than others is intolerable to my ear or i should say nose communication by odoursignals can in certain circumstances be extremely efficient though it can be disadvantageous in others for example an odour can carry to the sensory appendages of a priestking much further than the shout or cry of a man to another man moreover if not too much time is allowed to elapse a priestking may leave a message in his chamber or in a corridor for another priestking and the other may arrive later and interpret it a disdavantage of this mode of communication of course is that the message may be understood by strangers or others for whom it is not intended one must be careful of what one says in the tunnels of priestkings for ones words may linger after one until they sufficiently dissipate to be little more than a meaningless blur of scent for longer periods of time there are various devices for recording a message without relying on complex mechanical devices the simplest and one of the most fascinating is a chemically treated rope of clothlike material which the priestking beginning at an end bearing a certain scent saturates with the odours of his message this coiled messagerope then retains the odours indefinitely and when another priestking wishes to read the message he unrolls it slowly scanning it serially with the jointed sensory appendages i am told that the phonemes of the language of priestkings or better what in their language would correspond to phonemes in ours since their phonemes have to do with scent and not sound number seventythree their number is of course potentially infinite as would be the number of possible phonemes in english but just as we take a subset of sounds to be english sounds and form our utterances from them so they take a subset of odours as similarly basic to their speech the number of english phonemes incidentally is in the neighbourhood of fifty the morphemes of the language of priestkings those smallest intelligible information bits in particular roots and affixes are of course like the morphemes of english extremely numerous the normal morpheme in their language as in ours consists of a sequence of phonemes for example in english bit is one morpheme but three phonemes as will appear clear if given some reflection similarly in the language of the priestkings the seventythree phonemes or basic scents are used to form the meaning units of the language and a single morpheme of priestkings may consist of a complex set of odours i do not know whether there are more morphemes in the language of priestkings or in english but both are apparently rich languages and of course the strict morpheme count is not necessarily a reliable index to the complexity of the lexicon because of combinations of morphemes wo form new words german for example tends to rely somewhat more on morpheme combination than does english or french i was told incidentally that the language of the priestkings does possess more morphemes than english but i do not know if the report is truthful or not for priestkings tend to be somewhat touchy on the matter of any comparisons particularly those to their disadvantage or putative disadvantage with organisms of what they regard as the lower orders on the other hand it may well be the case that as a matter of fact the morpheme set of the language of priestkings is indeed larger than that of english i simply do not know the translator tapes incidentally are approximately the same size but this is no help since the tapes represent pairings of approximate equivelants and there are several english morphemes not translatable into the language of priestkings and as i learned morphemes in their language for which no english equivelants exist one english expression for which no natural word in their language exists is oddly enough friendship and certain of its cognates there is an expression in their language which translates into english as nest trust however and seems to play something of the same role in their thinking the notion of friendship it seems to me has to do with a reliance and affection between two or more individuals the notion of nest trust as clearly as i can understand it is more of a communal notion a sense of relying on the practices and traditions of an institution accepting them and living in terms of them i followed the priestking for a long time through the passages for all its size it moved with a delicate predatory grace it was perhaps very light for its bulk or very strong perhaps both it moved with a certain deliberate stalking movement its tread was regal and yet it seemed almost dainty almost fastidious it was almost as if the creature did not care to soil itself by contact with the floor of the passage it walked on four extremely long slender fourjointed stalks that were its supporting legs and carried its far more muscular fourjointed grasping legs or appendages extremely high almost level with its jaw and in front of its body each of these grasping appendages terminated in four much smaller delicate hooklike prehensile appendages the tips of which normally touched one another i would learn later that in the ball at the end of its forelegs from which the smaller prehensile appendages extended there was a curved bladed hornlike structure that could spring forward this happens spontaneously when the legs tip is inverted a motion which at once exposes the hornlike blade and withdraws the four prehensile appendages into the protected area beneath it the priestking halted before what appeared to be a blind wall he lifted one foreleg high over his head and touched something high in the wall which i could not see a panel slid back and the priestking stepped into what seemed to be a closed room i followed him and the panel closed the floor seemed to drop beneath me and my hand grasped my sword the priestking looked down at me and the antennae quivered as though in curiosity i resheathed my sword i was in an elevator after perhaps four or five minutes the elevator stopped and the priestking and i emerged the priestking rested back on the two posterior supporting appendages and with a small cleaning hook behind the third joint of one of his forelegs began to comb his antennae these are the tunnels of priestkings it said i looked about meand found myself on a high railed platform overlooking a vast circular artificial canyon lined with bridges and terraces in the depths of this canyon and on the terraces that mounted its sides were innumerable structrues largely geometrical solids cones cylinders lofty cubes domes spheres and such of various sizes colours and illuminations many of which were windowed and possessed of numerous floors some of which even towered to the level of the platform where i stood some of which soared even higher into the lofty reaches of the vast dome that arched over the canyon like a stone sky i stood on the platform my hands clenched on the railing staggered by what i saw the light of energy bulbs set in the walls and in the dome like stars shed a brilliant light on the entire canyon this said the priestking still grooming the golden hairs of his antennae is the vestibule of our dominion from my position on the platform i could see numerous tunnels at many levels leading out of the canyon perhaps to other such monstrous cavities filled with more structures i wondered what would be the function of the structures probably barracks factories storehouses notice the energy bulbs said the priestking they are for the benefit of certain species such as yourself priestkings do not need them then there are creatures other than priestkings who live here i said of course it replied at that moment to my horror a large perhaps eight feet long and a yard high multilegged segmented arthropod scuttled near its eyes weaving on stalks its harmless said the priestking the arthropod stopped and the eyes leaned toward us and then its pincers clicked twice i reached for my sword without turning it scuttled backwards away its body plates rustling like plastic armour see what you have done said the priestking you have frightened it my hand left the sword hilt and i wiped the sweat from my palm on my tunic they are timid creatures said the priestking and i am afraid they have never been able to accustom themselves to the sight of your kind the priestkings antennae shuddered a bit as they regarded me your kind is terribly ugly it said i laughed not so much because i supposed what it said was absurd but because i supposed that from the viewpoint of a priestking what it said might well be true it is interesting said the priestking what you have just said does not translate it was a laugh i said what is a laugh asked the priestking it is something men sometimes do when they are amused i said the creature seemed puzzled i wondered to myself perhaps men did not much laugh in the tunnels of the priestkings and it was not accustomed to this human practice or perhaps a priestking simply could not understand the notion of amusement it being perhaps genetically removed from his comprehension yet i said to myself the priestkings are intelligent and i found it difficult to believe there could exist an intelligent race without humour i think i understand said the priestking it is like shaking and curling your antennae perhaps i said now more puzzled than the priestking how stupid i am said the priestking and then to my amazement the creature resting back on its posterior appendages began to shake beginning at its abdomen and continuing upward through its trunk to its thorax and head and at last its antennae began to tremble and curling they wrapped about one another then the priestking ceased to rock and its antennae uncurled almost reluctantly i thought and it once again rested quietly back on its posterior appendages and regarded me once again it addressed itself to the patient meticulous combing of its antennae hairs somehow i imagined it was thinking suddenly it stopped grooming its antennae and the antennae looked down at me thank you it said for not attacking me in the elevator i was dumbfounded youre welcome i said i did not think anaesthesia would be necessary it said it would have been foolish to attack you i said irrational yes agreed the priestking but the lower orders are often irrational now it said i may still look forward someday to the pleasures of the golden beetle i said nothing sarm thought the anaesthesia would be necessary it said is sarm a priestking i asked yes i said then a priestking may be mistaken i said this seemed to me significant far more significant than the mere fact that a priestking might not understand a human laugh of course said the creature could i have slain you i asked possibly said the creature i looked over the rail at the marvellous complexity which confronted me but it would not have mattered said the priestking no i asked no it said only the nest matters my eyes still did not leave the dominion which lay below me its diameter might have been ten pasangs in width this is the nest i asked it is the beginning of the nest said the priestking what is your name i asked misk it said chapter eleven sarm the priestking i turned from the railing to observe the great ramp which for pasangs in a great spiral approached the platform on which i stood another priestking mounted on a low oval disk which seemed to slide up the ramp was approaching the new priestking looked a great deal like misk save that he was larger i wondered if men of my species would have difficulty telling priestkings apart i would later learn to do so easily but at first i was often confused the priestkings themselves distinguish one another by scent but i of course would do so by eye the oval disk glided to within some forty feet of us and the golden creature which had ridden it stepped delicately to the ramp it approached me its antennae scrutinising me carefully then it backed away perhaps some twenty feet it seemed to me much like misk except in size like misk it wore no clothing and carried no weapons and its only accoutrement was a translator which dangled from its neck i would learn later that in scent it wore its rank caste and station as clearly on its body as an officer in one of the armies of earth might wear his distinguishing braid and metal bars why has it not been anaesthetised asked the new creature training its antennae on misk i did not think it would be necessary said misk it was my recommendation that it be anaesthetised said the newcomer i know said misk this will be recorded said the newcomer misk seemed to shrug his head turned his laterally opening jaws opened and closed slowly his shoulders rustled and the two antennae twitched once as though in irritation and then idly they began to examine the roof of the dome the nest was not jeopardised came from misks translator the newcomers antennae were now trembling perhaps with anger it turned a knob on its own translator and in a moment the air was filled with the sharp odours of what i take might have been a reprimand i heard nothing for the creature had snapped off his translator when misk replied he too turned off his translator i observed their antennae and the general posturing and carriage of their long graceful bodies they stalked about one another and some of their motions were almost whiplike upon occasion undoubtedly as a sign of irritation the tips of the forelegs were inverted and i caught my first glimpse of the bladed hornlike structures therein concealed i would learn to interpret the emotions and states of priestkings by such signs many of these signs would be far less obvious than the ones now displayed in the throes of anger impatience for example is often indicated by a trembling in the tactile hair on the supporting appendages as though the creature could not wait to be off a wandering of attention can be shown by the unconscious movement of the cleaning hooks from behind the third joints of the forelegs suggesting perhaps the creature is thinking of grooming an occupation in which priestkings to my mind spend an inordinate amount of time i might note however in deference to them that they consider humans a particularly unclean animal and in the tunnels normally confine them for sanitary purposes to carefully restricted areas the subtlety of these signs might well be illuminated if the indications for a wandering of attention mentioned above are contrasted with the superficially similar signs which give evidence that a priestking is well or favourably disposed toward another priestking or other creature of any type in this case there is again the unconscious movement of the cleaning hooks but there is in addition an incipient but restrained extension of the forelegs in the direction of the object toward which the priestking is well disposed this suggests to me that the priestking is willing to put its cleaning hooks at the disposal of the other that he is willing to groom it this may become more comprehensible when it is mentioned that priestkings with their cleaning hooks their jaws and their tongues often groom one another as well as themselves hunger incidentally is indicated by an acidic exudate which forms at the edges of the jaws giving them a certain moist appearance thirst interestingly enough is indicated by a certain stiffness in the appendages evident in their movements and by a certain brownish tarnish that seems to infect the gold of the thorax and abdomen the most sensitive indicators of mood and attention of course as you would probably gather are the motions and tensility of the antennae the translator incidentally supposing it to be turned on would provide only the translation of what was said and the words unless the volume control was manipulated during the message would always occur at the same sound level an analogue to listening to a translator would be to imagine words as pictures which in the same type face and size flash serially on a screen there would be no clue in the individual pictures per se of the rhythm of the language or the mood of the speaker the translator can tell you that the speaker is angry but it cannot show you that he is angry after a minute or two the priestkings stopped circling one another and turned to face me as one creature they turned on their translators you are tarl cabot of the city of koroba said the larger yes i said i am sarm it said beloved of the mother and first born are you the leader of the priestkings i asked yes said sarm no said misk sarms antennae darted in misks direction greatest in the nest is the mother said misk sarms antennae relaxed true said sarm i have much to speak of with priestkings i said if the one whom you call the mother is chief among you i wish to see her sarm rested back on his posterior appendages his antennae touched one another in a slightly curling movement none may see the mother save her caste attendants and the high priestkings said sarm the first second third fourth and fifth born except on the three great holidays said misk sarms antennae twitched angrily what are the three great holidays i asked the nest feast cycle said misk tola tolam and tolama what are these feasts i asked they are the anniversary of the nuptial flight said misk the feast of the deposition of the first egg and the celebration of the hatching of the first egg are these holidays near i asked yes said misk but said sarm even on such feasts none of the lower orders may view the mother only priestkings true said misk anger suffused my countenance sarm seemed not to notice this change but misks antennae perked up immediately perhaps it had had experience with human anger do not think badly of us tarl cabot said misk for on the holidays those of the lower orders who labour for us be it even in the pastures or fungus trays are given surcease from their labours the priestkings are generous i said do the men below the mountains do as much for their animals asked misk no i said but men are not animals are men priestkings asked sarm no i said then they are animals said sarm i drew my sword and faced sarm the motion was extremely rapid and must have startled him at any rate sarm leaped backward on his jointed stalklike legs with almost incredible speed he now stood almost forty feet from me if i cannot speak to the one you call the mother i said perhaps i can speak to you i took a step towards sarm sarm pranced angrily backward his antennae twitching with agitation we faced one another i noticed the tips of his forelegs were inverted unsheathing the two curved hornlike blades which reposed there we watched one another carefully from behind me i heard the mechanical voice of misks translator but she is the mother it said and we of the nest are all her children i smiled sarm saw that i did not intend to advance further and his agitation decreased although his general attitude of awareness was not relaxed it was at this time that i first saw how priestkings breathed probably because sarms respiratory movements were now more pronounced than they had been hitherto muscular contractions in the abdomen take place with the result that air is sucked into the system through four small holes on each side of the abdomen the same holes serving also as exhalation vents usually the breathing cycle unless one is quite close and listens carefully cannot be heard but in the present case i could hear quite clearly from a distance of several feet the quick intake of air through the eight tiny tubular mouths in sarms abdomen and its almost immediate expellation through the same apertures now the muscular contractions in sarms abdomen became almost unnoticeable and i could no longer hear the evidence of his respiratory cycle the tips of his forelegs were no longer inverted with the result that the bladed structures had disappeared and the small fourjointed hooklike prehensile appendages were again fully visible their tips delicately touched one another sarms antennae were calm he regarded me he did not move i would never find myself fully able to adjust to the incredible stillness with which a priestking can stand he reminded me vaguely of the blade of a golden knife suddenly sarms antennae pointed at misk you should have anaesthetised it he said perhaps said misk for some reason this hurt me i felt that i had betrayed misks trust in me that i had behaved as a not fully rational creature that i had behaved as sarm had expected me to im sorry i said to sarm resheathing my sword you see said misk its dangerous said sarm i laughed what is that asked sarm lifting his antennae it is shaking and curling its antennae said misk on the receipt of this information sarm did not shake nor did his antennae curl rather the bladelike structures snapped out and back and his antennae twitched in irritation i gathered one did not shake and curl ones antennae at priestkings mount the disk tarl cabot of koroba said misk gesturing with his foreleg to the flat oval disk which had brought sarm to our level i hesitated he is afraid said sarm he has much to fear said misk i am not afraid i said then mount the disk said misk i did so and the two priestkings stepped delicately onto the disk to join me in such a way that one stood on each side and slightly behind me scarcely had they placed their weight on the disk when it began to smoothly and silently accelerate down the long ramp which led toward the bottom of the canyon the disk moved with great swiftness and it was with some difficulty that i managed to stand on my feet leaning into the blast of air which rushed past me to my annoyance both of the priestkings seemed immobile leaning alertly forward into the wind their forelegs lifted high their antennae lying flat streaming backwards chapter twelve the two muls on a marble circle of some half pasang in width in the bottom of that vast brilliantly lit manycoloured artificial canyon the oval disk diminished its speed and drew to a stop i found myself in some sort of plaza surrounded by the fantastic architecture of the nest of priestkings the plaza was crowded not only with priestkings but even more with various creatures of other forms and natures among them i saw men and women barefoot with shaven heads clad in short purple tunics that reflected the various lights of the plaza as though they might have been formed of some reflective plastic i stepped aside as a flat sluglike creature clinging with several legs to a small transportation disk swept by we must hurry said sarm i see human beings here i said to misk are they slaves yes said misk they wear no collars i pointed out it is not necessary to mark a distinction between slave and free within the nest said misk for in the nest all humans are slaves why are they shaven and clad as they are i asked it is more sanitary said misk let us leave the plaza said sarm i would learn later that his agitation was principally due to his fear of contracting filth in this public place humans walked here why do the slaves wear purple i asked misk that is the colour of the robes of a ubar because it is a great honour to be the slave of priestkings said misk is it your intention i asked that i should be so shaved and clad my hand was on my sword hilt perhaps not said sarm it may be that you are to be destroyed immediately i must check the scenttapes he is not to be destroyed immediately said misk nor is he to be shaved and clad as a slave why not asked sarm it is the wish of the mother said misk what has she to do with it asked sarm much said misk sarm seemed puzzled he stopped his antennae twitched nervously was he brought to the tunnels for some purpose i came of my own accord i avowed dont be foolish said misk to me for what purpose was he brought to the tunnels asked sarm the purpose is known to the mother said misk i am the first born said sarm she is the mother said misk very well said sarm and turned away i sensed he was not much pleased at that moment a human girl walked near and wideeyed circled us looking at me although her head was shaved she was pretty and the brief plastic sheath she wore did not conceal her charms a shudder of repulsion seemed to course through sarm hurry he said and we followed him as he scurried from the plaza your sword said misk extending one foreleg down to me never i said backing away please said misk for some reason i unbuckled the sword belt and reluctantly handed the weapon to misk sarm who stood in the long room on an oval dais seemed satisfied with this transaction he turned to the walls behind him which were covered with thousands of tiny illuminated knobs he pulled certain of these out from the wall and they seemed to be attached to slender cords which he passed between his antennae he spent perhaps an ahn in this activity and then exasperated turned to face me i had been pacing back and forth in the long room nervous without the feel of the sword steel at my thigh misk during all this time had not moved but had remained standing in that incredible fixity perhaps unique to priestkings the scenttapes are silent said sarm of course said misk what is to be the disposition of this creature asked sarm for the time said misk it is the wish of the mother that it be permitted to live as a matok what is that i asked you speak much for one of the lower orders said sarm what is a matok i asked a creature that is in the nest but is not of the nest said misk like the arthropod i asked precisely said misk if i had my wish said sarm he would be sent to the vivarium or the dissection chambers but that is not the wish of the mother said misk i see said sarm thus said misk it is not the wish of the nest of course said sarm for the wish of the mother is the wish of the nest the mother is the nest and the nest is the mother said misk yes said sarm and the two priestkings approached one another bowed and gently locked their antennae when they disengaged themselves sarm turned to face me nonetheless he said i shall speak to the mother about this matter of course said misk i should have been consulted said sarm for i am first born perhaps said misk sarm looked down at me i think he had not forgiven me the start i had given him on the platform high above the canyon near the elevator it is dangerous he said it should be destroyed perhaps said misk and it curled its antennae at me said sarm misk was silent yes said sarm it should be destroyed sarm then turned from me and with his left forward supporting appendage depressed a recessed button in the dais on which he stood hardly had his delicate foot touched the button than a panel slid aside and two handsome men of the most symmetrical form and features with shaven heads and clad in the purple plastic tunics of slaves entered the room and prostrated themselves before the dais at a signal from sarm they leaped to their feet and stood alertly beside the dais their feet spread their heads high their arms folded behold these two said sarm neither of the two men who had entered the room had seemed to notice me i now approached them i am tarl cabot of koroba i said to them extending my hand if they saw my hand they made no effort to accept it i assumed they must be identical twins they had wide fine heads strong broad bodies and a carriage that suggested calmness and strength both were a bit shorter than i but were somewhat more squarely built you may speak said sarm i am mulalka said one honoured slave of the glorious priestkings i am mulbata said the other honoured slave of the glorious priestkings in the nest said misk the expression mul is used to designate a human slave i nodded the rest of it i did not need to be told the expressions alka and bata are the two first letters of the gorean alphabet in effect these men had no names but were simply known as slave a and slave b i turned to sarm i assume i said you have more than twentyeight human slaves there were twentyeight characters in the gorean alphabet i had intended my remark to be rather vicious but sarm took no offense others are numbered he said when one dies or is destroyed his number is assigned to another some of the low numbers volunteered misk have been assigned as many as a thousand times why do these slaves not have numbers i asked they are special said misk i regarded them closely they seemed splendid specimens of mankind perhaps misk had meant merely that they were unusually excellent representatives of the human type can you guess asked sarm which one has been synthesised i must have given quite a start sarms antennae giggled yes said sarm one was synthesised beginning with the synthesis of the protein molecules and was formed molecule by molecule it is artificially constructed human being it is not of much scientific interest but it has considerable curiosity value it was built over a period of two centuries by kusk the priestking as a way of escaping in his leisure hours from the burdens of his serious biological investigations i shuddered what of the other i asked it too said sarm is not without interest and is also bestowed upon us by the avocational whims of kusk one of the greatest of our nest is the other also synthesised i asked no said sarm it is the product of genetic manipulation artificial control and alteration of the hereditary coils in gametes i was sweating not the least interesting aspect of this matter said sarm is the match to be sure i could not tell the two men if they were men apart that is the evidence of real skill said sarm kusk said misk is one of the greatest of the nest which of these slaves i asked is the one who was synthesised cant you tell asked sarm no i said sarms antennae shivered and wrapped themselves about one another he was shaking with the signs i knew now to be associated with amusement i will not tell you he said it is growing late said misk and the matok if he is to remain in the nest must be processed yes said sarm but he seemed in no hurry to conclude his gloating he pointed one long jointed foreleg at the muls gaze upon them with awe matok said he for they are the product of priestkings and the most perfect specimens of your race ever to exist i wondered about what misk meant by processing but sarms words irritated me as did the two grave handsome fellows who had so spontaneously groveled before his dais how is that i asked is it not obvious asked sarm no i said they are symmetrically formed said sarm moreover they are intelligent strong and in good health sarm seemed to wait for my reply but there was none and said sarm they live on fungus and water and wash themselves twelve times a day i laughed by the priestkings i roared the rather blasphemous gorean oath slipping out somehow incongruously considering my present location and predicament neither priestking however seemed in the least disturbed by this oath which might have brought tears to the eyes of a member of the caste of initiates why do you curl your antennae asked sarm you call these perfect human beings i asked waving my arms toward the two slaves of course said sarm of course said misk perfect slaves i said the most perfect human being is of course the most perfect slave said sarm the most perfect human being i said is free a look of puzzlement seemed to appear in the eyes of the two slaves they have no wish to be set free said misk he then addressed the slaves what is your greatest joy muls he asked to be slaves of priestkings they said you see asked misk yes i said i see now that they are not men sarms antennae twitched angrily why do you not i challenged have your kusk or whoever he is synthesise a priestking sarm seemed to shiver with rage the bladed hornlike projections snapped into view on his forelegs misk had not moved it would be immoral he said sarm turned to misk would the mother object if the matoks arms and legs were broken yes said misk would the mother object if its organs were damaged asked sarm undoubtedly said misk but surely said sarm it can be punished yes said misk undoubtedly it will have to be disciplined sometime very well said sarm and directed his antennae at the two shavenheaded plasticclad slaves punish the matok said sarm but do not break its bones nor injure its organs no sooner had these words been emitted from sarms translator than the two slaves leaped toward me to seize me in that same instant i leaped toward them taking them by surprise and compounding the momentum of my blow i thrust one aside with my left arm and crushed my fist into the face of the second his head snapped to the side and his knees buckled he crumpled to the floor before the other could regain his balance i had leaped to him and seized him in my hands and lifted him high over my head and hurled him on his back to the stone flooring of the long chamber had it been combat to the death in that brief instant i would have finished him leaping over him and gouging my heels into his stomach rupturing the diaphragm but i had no wish to kill him nor a matter of fact to injure him severely he managed to roll over on his stomach i could have snapped his neck then with my heel the thought occurred to me that these slaves had not been well trained to administer discipline they seemed to know almost nothing now the man was on his knees gasping supporting himself on the palm of his right hand if he was righthanded that seemed foolish also he made no effort to cover his throat i looked up at sarm and misk who observing stood in that slightly inclined infuriatingly still posture do not injure them further said misk i will not i said perhaps the matok is right said misk to sarm perhaps they are not perfect human beings perhaps admitted sarm now the slave who was conscious lifted his hand piteously to the priestkings his eyes were filled with tears please he begged let us go to the dissection chambers i was dumbfounded now the other had regained consciousness and on his knees joined his fellow please he cried let us go to the dissection chambers my astonishment could not be concealed they feel that they have failed the priestkings and wish to die said misk sarm regarded the two slaves i am kind he said and it is near the feast of tola he lifted his foreleg with a gentle permissive gesture almost a benediction you may go to the dissection chambers to my amazement gratitude transfigured the features of the two slaves and helping one another they prepared to leave the room stop i cried the two slaves stopped and looked at me my eyes were fixed however on sarm and misk you cant send them to their deaths i said sarm seemed puzzled misks antennae shrugged frantically i groped for a plausible objection kusk would surely be displeased if his creatures were to be destroyed i said i hoped it would do sarm and misk touched antennae the matok is right said misk true said sarm i breathed a sigh of relief sarm then turned to the two slaves you may not go to the dissection chambers he said once more the two slaves this time apparently without emotion folded their arms and stood legs apart beside the dais nothing might have happened in the last few moments save that one was breathing heavily and the others face was splattered with his own blood neither of them showed any gratitude at being reprieved nor did either evince any resentment at my having interfered with their executions i was as you might suppose puzzled the responses and behaviour of the two slaves seemed to be incomprehensible you must understand tarl cabot of koroba said misk apparently sensing my puzzlement that it is the greatest joy of muls to love and serve priestkings if it is the wish of a priestking that they die they do so with great joy if it is the wish of a priestking that they live they are similarly delighted i noted that neither of the two slaves looked particularly delighted you see continued misk these muls have been formed to love and serve priestkings they have been made that way i said precisely said misk and yet you say they are human i said of course said sarm and then to my surprise one of the slaves though which one i could not have told looked at me and spoke we are human it said very simply i approached him and held out my hand i hope i did not hurt you i said it took my hand and awkwardly held it not knowing how to shake hands apparently i too am human said the other looking at me rather directly he held his hand out with the back of his hand up i took the hand and turned it and shook it i have feelings said the first man i too have feelings said the second man we all do i said of course said the first man for we are human i looked at him very carefully which of you i asked has been synthesised we do not know said the first man no said the second man we have never been told the two priestkings had watched this small concourse with some interest but now the voice of sarms translator was heard it is growing late it said let the matok be processed follow me said the first man and turned and i followed him leaving the room the second man falling into stride beside me chapter thirteen the slime worm i followed mulalka and mulbata through several rooms and down a long corridor this is the hall of processing said one of them we passed several high steel portals in the hallway and on each of these about twenty feet high at the antennae level of a priestking were certain dots which i was later to learn were scent dots if the scentdots were themselves not scented one might be tempted to think of them as graphemes in the language of the priestkings but since they themselves are scented they are best construed as analogous to uttered phonemes or phoneme combinations direct expressions of the oral syllabary of the priestkings when surrounded by scentdots one might suppose the priestking to be subjected to a cacophony of stimulation much as we might be if environed by dozens of blaring radios and television sets but this is apparently not the case the better analogy would seem to be our experience of walking down a quiet city street surrounded by printed signs which we might notice but to which we do not pay much attention in our sense there is no distinction between a spoken and written language for the priestkings though there is an analogous distinction between linguistic patterns that are actually sensed and those which are potentially to be sensed an example of the latter being the scents of a yet uncoiled scenttape you will not much care for the processing said one of my guides but it will be good for you said the other why must i be processed i asked to protect the nest from contamination said the first scents of course will fade in time but the specially prepared synthetic products or the priestkings can last for thousands of years and in the long run will surely outlast the fading print of human books the disintegrating celluloid of our films perhaps even the carved weathering stones so imperishably attesting the incomparable glories of our numerous kings conquerors and potentates scentdots incidentally are arranged in rows constituting a geometrical square and are read beginning with the top row from left to right then right to left and then left to right and so on again gorean i might note is somewhat similar and though i speak gorean fluently i find it very difficult to write largely because of the evennumbered lines which from my point of view must be written backwards torm my friend of the caste of scribes never forgave me this and to this day if he lives he undoubtedly considers me partly illiterate as he said i would never make a scribe it is simple he said you just write it forward but in the other direction the syllabary of the priestkings not to be confused with their set of seventythree phonemes consists of what seems to me to be a somewhat unwieldy four hundred and eleven characters each of which stands of course for a phoneme or phoneme combination normally a combination certain juxtapositions of these phonemes and phoneme combinations naturally form words i would have supposed a simpler syllabary or even an experimentation with a nonscented perhaps alphabetic graphic script would have been desirable linguistic ventures for the priestkings but as far as i know they were never made with respect to the rather complex syllabary i originally supposed that it had never been simplified because the priestking with his intelligence would absorb the four hundred and eleven characters of his syllabary more rapidly than would a human child his alphabet of less than thirty letters and thus that the difference to him between more than four hundred signs and less than thirty would be negligible as far as it goes this was not bad guesswork on my part but deeper reasons underlay the matter first i did not know then how priestkings learned they do not learn as we do second they tend in many matters to have a penchant for complexity regarding it as more elegant than simplicity one practical result of this seems to be that they have never been tempted to oversimplify physical reality biological processes or the operations of a functioning mind it would never occur to them that nature is ultimately simple and if they found it so they would be rather disappointed they view nature as a set of interrelated continua rather than as a visually oriented organism is tempted to do as a network of discrete objects which must be somehow mysteriously related to one another their basic mathematics incidentally begins with ordinal and not cardinal numbers and the mathematics of cardinal numbers is regarded as a limiting case imposed on more intuitively accepted ordinalities most significantly however i suspect that the syllabary of priestkings remains complex and that experiments with unscented graphemes were never conducted because except for lexical additions they wish to keep their language much as it was in the ancient past the priestking for all his intelligence tends to be fond of established patterns at least in basic cultural matters such as nest mores and language subscribing to them however not because of genetic necessity but rather a certain undoubtedly genetically based preference for that which is comfortable and familiar the priestking somewhat like men can change its ways but seldom cares to do so and yet there is probably more to these matters than the above considerations would suggest i once asked misk why the syllabary of priestkings was not simplified and he responded if this were done we would have to give up certain signs and we could not bear to do so for they are all very beautiful beneath the scentdots on each high portal which mulalka and mulbata and i passed there was perhaps for the benefit of humans or others a stylised outline picture of a form of creature on none of the doors that we had passed thus far was the stylised outline picture of a human down the hall running towards us not frantically but rather deliberately at a steady pace came a young human female of perhaps eighteen years of age with shaved head and clad in the brief plastic tunic of a mul do not obstruct her said one of my guides i stepped aside scarcely noticing us and clutching two scenttapes in her hands the girl passed she had brown eyes and i thought in spite of her shaved head was attractive neither of my companions showed or seemed to show the least interest in her for some reason this annoyed me i watched her continue on down the passageway listened to the slap of her bare feet on the floor who is she i asked a mul said one of the slaves of course she is a mul i said then why do you ask he asked i found myself nastily hoping that he was the one who had been synthesised she is a messenger said the other who carries scenttapes between portals in the hall of processing oh said the first slave he is interested in things like that he is new in the tunnels said the second slave i was curious i looked directly at the first slave she had good legs didnt she i said he seemed puzzled yes he said very strong she was attractive i said to the second attractive he asked yes i said yes he said she is healthy perhaps she is someones mate i asked no said the first slave how do you know i asked she is not in the breeding cases said the man somehow these laconic responses and the unquestioning acceptance of the apparent barbarities of the rule of priestkings infuriated me i wonder how she would feel in ones arms i said the two men looked at me and at one another one must not wonder about that said one why not i asked it is forbidden said the other but surely i said you must have wondered about that one of the men smiled at me yes he said i have sometimes wondered about that so have i said the other then all three of us turned to watch the girl who was now no more than a bluish speck under the energy bulbs far down the hall why is she running i asked the journeys between portals are timed said the first slave and if she dallies she will be given a recordscar yes said the other five recordscars and she will be destroyed a recordscar i said is some sort of mark on your records yes said the first slave it is entered on your scenttape and also in odour inscribed on your tunic the tunic said the other is inscribed with much information and it is by means of the tunic that priestkings can recognise us yes said the first slave otherwise i am afraid we would appear much alike to them i stored this information away hoping that someday it might prove useful well i said still looking down the hall i would have supposed that the mighty priestkings could have devised a quicker way of transporting scenttapes of course said the first slave but there is no better way for muls are extremely inexepnsive and are easily replaced speed in such matters said one is of little interest to priestkings yes said the other they are very patient why have they not given her a transportation device i asked she is only a mul said the first slave all three of us stared down the hall after the girl but she had now disappeared in the distance but she is a healthy mul said one yes said the other and she has strong legs i laughed and clapped both of the slaves on the shoulders and the three of us arm in arm walked down the hall we had not walked far when we passed a long wormlike animal eyeless with a small red mouth that inched its way along the corridor hugging the angle between the wall and floor neither of my guides paid the animal any attention indeed even i myself after my experience with the arthropod on the platform and the flat sluglike beast on its transportation disk in the plaza was growing accustomed to finding strange creatures in the nest of the priestkings what is that i asked a matok said one of the slaves yes said the other it is in the nest but not of the nest but i thought i was a matok i said you are said one of the slaves we continued on what do you call it i asked oh said one of the slaves it is a slime worm what does it do i asked long ago it functioned in the nest said one of the slaves as a sewerage device but it has not served that function in many thousands of years but yet it remains in the nest of course said one of the slaves the priestkings are tolerant yes said the other and they are fond of it and are themselves creatures of great reverence for tradition the slime worm has earned its place in the nest said the other how does it live i asked it scavenges on the kills of the golden beetle said the first slave what does the golden beetle kill i asked priestkings said the second slave i would surely have pressed forward this inquiry but at that very moment we arrived at a tall steel portal in the hallway looking up i saw beneath the square of scentdots fixed high on the steel door the stylised outline picture of what was unmistakably a human being this is the place said one of my companions it is here that you will be processed we will wait for you said the other chapter fourteen the secret chamber of misk the arms of the metal device seized me and i found myself held helplessly by the arms suspended some feet above the floor behind me the panel had slid shut the room was rather large blean and coated with plastic it seemed to be bare except that at one end there were several metal disks in the wall and high in the wall there was a transparent shield viewing me antiseptically through this shield was the face of a priestking may you bathe in the dung of slime worms i called to him cheerfully i hoped he had a translator two circular metal plates in the wall beneath the shield had slid upward and suddenly long metal arms had telescoped outwards and reached for me for an instant i had considered scarmbling out of their reach but then i had sensed that there would be no escape in the smooth closed carefully prepared room in which i found myself the metal arms had locked on me and lifted me from the floor the priestking behind the shield did not seem to notice my remark i supposed he did not have a translator as i dangled there to my irritation further devices manipulated by the priestking emerged from the wall and extended towards me one of these with maddening delicacy snipped the clothing from my body even cutting the thongs of my sandals another deftly forced a large ugly pellet down my throat considering the size of a priestking and the comparatively small scale of these operations i gathered that the reduction gearing on the mechanical appendages must be considerable moreover the accuracy with which the operations were performed suggested a magnification of some sort i would learn later that practically the entire wall which faced me was such a device being in effect a very large scentreinforcer but at the time i was in no mood to admire the engineering talents of my captors may you antennae be soaked in grease i called to my tormentor his antennae stiffened and then curled a bit at the tips i was pleased apparently he did have a translator i was considering my next insult when the two arms which held me swung me over a metal cage with a double floor the higher consisting of narrow bars set in a wide mesh and the lower consisting simply of a white plastic tray the metal appendages which held me suddenly sprang open and i was dropped into the cage i sprang to my feet but the top of the cage had clicked shut i wanted to try the bars but already i felt sick and i sank to the bottom of the cage i was no longer interested in insulting priestkings i remember looking up and seeing its antennae curling it took only two or three minutes for the pellet to do its work and it is not with pleasure that i recall those minutes finally the plastic tray neatly slid out from beneath the cage and swiftly disappeared through a low wide panel in the left wall i gratefully noted its departure then the entire cage on a track of some sort began to move through an opening which appeared in the right wall in the following journey the cage was successively submerged in various solutions of various temperatures and densities some of which perhaps because i was still ill i found exceedingly noxious had i been less ill i would undoubtedly have been more offended at last after i sputtering and choking had been duly cleansed and rinsed several times and then it seemed several times again the cage began to move slowly mercifully between vents from which blasts of hot air issued and eventually it passed slowly between an assortment of humming projection points for widebeam rays some of which were visible to my eye being yellow red and a refulgent green i would later learn that these rays which passed through my body as easily and harmlessly as sunlight through glass were indexed to the metabolic physiology of various organisms which can infect priestkings i would also learn that the last known free instance of such an organism had occurred more than four thousand years before in the next frew weeks in the nest i would occasionally come upon diseased muls the organisms which afflict them are apparently harnless to priestkings and thus allowed to survive indeed they are regarded as matoks in the nest but not of the nest and are thus to be tolerated with equanimity i was still quite ill when clad in a red plasic tunic i rejoined the two slaves in the hall outside the door you look much better said one of them they left the threadlike growths on your head said the other hair i said leaning against the portal strange said one of the slaves the only fibrous body growths permitted muls are the lashes of the eyes this i supposed would have to do with protecting the eyes from particles idly not feeling well i wondered if there were any particles but he is a matok said one that is true said the other i was glad that the tunic i wore was not of the ubars purple which would proclaim me as a slave of priestkings perhaps if you are very zealous said one you can become a mul yes said the other then you would be not only in the nest but of the nest i did not respond that is best said one yes said the other i leaned back against the portal of the hall of processing my eyes closed and took several slow deep breaths you have been assigned quarters said one of the two slaves a case in the chamber of misk i opened my eyes we will take you there said the other i looked at them blankly a case i asked he is not well said one of the slaves it is quite comfortable said the other with fungus and water i closed my eyes again and shook my head i could feel them gently take my arms and i accompanied them slowly down the hall you will feel much better said one of them when you have had a bit of fungus yes said the other it is not hard to get used to mulfungus for it has almost no taste being an extremely bland pale whitish fibrous vegetablelike matter i know of no one who is moved much in one direction or the other by its taste even the muls many of whom have been bred in the nest do not particularly like it nor despise it it is eaten with much the same lack of attention that we normally breathe air muls feed four times a day in the first meal mulfungus is ground and mixed with water forming a porridge of sorts for the second meal it is chopped into rough twoinch cubes for the third meal it is minced with mulpellets and served as a sort of cold hash the mulpellets are undoubtedly some type of dietary supplement at the final meal mulfungus is pressed into a large flat cake and sprinkled with a few grains of salt misk told me and i believe him that muls had occasionally slain one another for a handful of salt the mulfungus as far as i can tell is not much different from the fungus raised under ideal conditions from specially selected spores which graces the feed troughs of the priestkings themselves a tiny sample of which was once given me by misk it was perhaps a bit less coarse than mulfungus misk was much annoyed that i could not detect the difference i was much annoyed when i found out later that the major difference between highquality fungus and the lowergrade mulfungus was simply the smell i was in the nest incidentally for more than five weeks before i could even vaguely detect the odour difference which seemed so significant to misk and then it did not strike me as being better or worse than that of the lowgrade mulfungus the longer i stayed in the nest the more acute became my sense of smell and it was an embarrassing revelation to me to discover how unaware i had become of these varied rich sensory cues so abundantly available in my environment i was given a translator by misk and i would utter gorean expressions into it and then wait for the translation into the language of the priestkings and in this way after a timw i became capable of recognising numerous meaningful odours the first odour i came to recognise was misks name and it was delightful to discover as i became more practiced and sensitive that the odour was the same as his own one of the things i did was run the translator over the red plastic tunic i had been issued and listen to the information which had been recorded on it there was not much save my name and city that i was a matok under the supervision of misk that i had no recordscars and that i might be dangerous i smiled at the latter caution i did not even have a sword and i was sure that in any battle with priestkings i would constitute but a moments work for their fierce mandibles and the bladed hornlike projections on their forelegs the case which i was to occupy in misks chamber was not as bad as i had anticipated indeed it seemed to me far more luxurious than the appointments in misks own chamber which seemed utterly bare except for the feed trough and numerous compartments dials switches and plugs mounted in one wall the priestkings eat and sleep standing and never lie down except perhaps it be to die the bareness of misks chambers was however as it turned out only an apparent bareness to a visually oriented organism such as myself actually the walls ceilings and floor were covered with what to a priestking were excruciatingly beautiful scentpatterns indeed misk informed me that the patterns in his chamber had been laid down by some of the greatest artists in the nest my case was a transparent plastic cube of perhaps eight feet square with ventilation holes and a sliding plastic door there was no lock on the door and thus i could come and go as i pleased inside the cube there were canisters of mulfungus a bowl a ladle a woodenbladed fungusknife a woodenheaded fungusmallet a convenient tube of mulpellets which discharged its contents one at a time following my depressing a lever in the bottom of the tube and a large inverted jar of water by means of which an attached somewhat shallow watering pan was kept filled in one corner of the case there was a large circular padding a few inches deep of soft roughcut reddish moss which was not uncomfortable and was changed daily adjoining the cube reached from the cube by sliding plastic panels were a lavatory facility and a washingbooth the washingbooth was remarkably like the showers with which we are familiar except that one may not regulate the flow of fluid one turns on the fluid by stepping into the booth and its amount and temperature are controlled automatically i had naturally supposed the fluid to be simply water which it closely resembled in appearance and once had tried to fill my bowl for the morning meal there rather than ladling the water out of the water pan choking my mouth burning i spat it out in the booth it is fortunate said misk that you did not swallow it for the washing fluid contains a cleansing additive that is highly toxic to human physiology misk and i got on rather well together after a few small initial frictions particularly having to do with the salt ration and the number of times a day the washingbooth was to be used if i had been a mul i would have received a recordscar for each day on which i had not washed completely twelve times washingbooths incidentally are found in all mulcases and often for convenience along the tunnels and in public places such as plazas shavingparlours pelletdispensaries and fungus commissaries since i was a matok i insisted that i should be exempted from the duty of the twelve joys as it is known in the beginning i held out for one shower a day as quite sufficient but poor misk seemed so upset that i agreed to up my proposal to two he would still hear nothing of this and seemed firm that i should not fall below ten at last feeling that i perhaps owed something to misks acceptance of me in his chamber i suggested a compromise at five and for an extra salt packet six on alternate days at last misk threw in two extra salt packets a day and i agreed to six washings he himself of course did not use a washingbooth but groomed and cleaned himself in the ageold fashion of priestkings with his cleaning hooks and mouth occasionally after we got to know one another better he would even allow me to groom him and the first time he allowed me with the small grooming fork used by favoured muls to comb his antennae i knew that he trusted me and liked me though for what reason i could not tell i myself grew rather fond of misk did you know said misk once to me that humans are among the most intelligent of the lower orders im glad to hear it i said misk was quiet and his antennae waved nostalgically i once had a pet mul he said i looked at my case no said misk when a pet mul dies the case is always destroyed lest there be contamination what happened to him i asked it was a small female said misk it was slain by sarm i felt a tension in the foreleg of misk which i was grooming as though it were involuntarily prepared to invert bringing out the bladelike projection why i asked misk said nothing for a long time and then he dejectedly lowered his head delicately extending his antennae to me for grooming after i had combed them for a bit i sensed he was ready to speak it was my fault said misk she wanted to let the threadlike growths on her head emerge for she was not bred in the nest misks voice came from the translator as consecutively and mechanically as ever but his whole body trembled i removed the grooming fork from his antennae in order that the sensory hairs not be injured i was indulgent said misk straightening up so that his long body now loomed over me inclined forward slightly from the vertical in the characteristic stance of priestkings so that it was actually i who killed her i think not i said you tried to be kind and it occurred on the day on which she saved my life said misk tell me about it i said i was on an errand for sarm said misk which took me to unfrequented tunnels and for company i took the girl with me we came upon a golden beetle though none had ever been seen in that place and i wanted to go to the beetle and i put my head down and approached it but the girl seized my antennae and dragged me away thus saving my life misk lowered his head again and extended his antennae for grooming the pain was excruciating said misk and i could not but follow her in spite of the fact that i wanted to go to the golden beetle in an ahn of course i no longer wanted to go to the beetle and i knew then she had saved my life it was the same day that sarm ordered her given five recordscars for the growths on her head and had her destroyed is it always five recordscars for such an offense i asked no said misk i do not know why sarm acted as he did it seems to me i said that you should not blame yourself for the girls death but sarm no said misk i was too indulgent is it not possible i asked that sarm wished you to die by the golden beetle of course said misk it was undoubtedly his intention i puzzled to myself why sarm might want misk to be killed undoubtedly there was some type of rivalry or political division between them to my human mind used to the cruelties with which selfish men can implement their schemes i saw nothing incomprehensible in the fact that sarm would have attempted to engineer misks death i would learn later however that this simple fact was indeed almost incomprehensible to priestkings and that misk though he readily accepted it as a fact in his mind could not bring himself so to speak in the furthest reaches of his heart to acknowledge it as true for were not both he and sarm of the nest and would not such an action be a violation of nest trust sarm is the first born said misk whereas i am the fifth born the first five born of the mother are the high council of the nest the second third and fourth born in the long ages have one by one succumbed to the pleasures of the golden beetle only sarm and i are left of the five then i suggested he wants you to die so that he will be the only remaining member of the council and thus have absolute power the mother is greater than he said misk still i suggested his power would be considerably augmented misk looked at me and his antennae had a certain lack of resilience and the golden hairs had seemed to lose some of their sheen you are sad i said misk bent down until his long body was horizontal and then inclined downward yet more towards me he laid his antennae gently on my shoulders almost as though a man might have put his hands on them youmust not understand these things said misk in terms of what you know of men it is different it seems no different to me i said these things said misk are deeper and greater than you know than you can now understand they seem simple enough to me i remarked no said misk you do not understand misks antennae pressed a bit on my shoulders but you will understand he said the priestking then straightened and stalked to my case with his two forelegs he gently lifted it and moved it aside the ease with which he did this astonished me for i am sure its weight must have been several pounds beneath the case i saw a flat stone with a recessed ring misk bent down and lifted this ring i dug this chamber myself he said and day by day over the lifetimes of many muls i took a bit of rock dust away and scattered it here and there unobserved in the tunnels i looked down into the cavern which was now revealed i requisitioned as little as possible you see said misk even the portal must be moved by mechanical force he then went to a compartment in the wall and withdrew a slender black rod he broke the end of the rod off and it began to burn with a bluish flame this is a multorch said misk used by muls who raise fungus in darkened chambers you will need it to see i knew that the priestking had no need of the torch please said misk gesturing toward the opening chapter fifteen in the secret chamber holding the slender multorch over my head i peered into the cavern now revealed in the floor of misks chamber from a ring on the underside of the floor the ceiling of the chamber there dangled a knotted rope there seemed to be very little heat from the bluish flame of the multorch but considering the size of the flame a surprising amount of light the workers of the fungustrays said misk break off both ends of the torch and climb about on the trays with the torch in their teeth i had no mind to do this but i did grasp the torch in my teeth with one end lit and hand over hand lower myself down the knotted rope one side of my face began to sweat i closed my right eye a circle of eerie blue descending light flickered on the walls of the passage down which i lowered myself the walls a few feet below the level of misks compartment became damp the temperature fell several degrees i could see the discolourations of slime molds probably white but seeming blue in the light on the walls i sensed a film of moisture forming on the plastic of my tunic here and there a trickle of water traced its dark pattern downward to the floor where it crept along the wall and continuing its journey disappeared into one crevice or another when i arrived at the bottom of the rope some forty feet below i held the torch over my head and found myself in a bare simple chamber looking up i saw misk disdaining the rope bend himself backwards through the aperture in the ceiling and step by dainty step walk across the ceiling upside down and then back himself nimbly down the side of the wall in a moment he stood beside me you must never speak of what i am going to show you said misk i said nothing misk hesitated let there be nest trust between us i said but you are not of the nest said misk nonetheless i said let there be nest trust between us very well said misk and he bent forward extending his antennae towards me i wondered for a moment what was to be done but then it seemed i sensed what he wanted i thrust the torch i carried into a crevice in the wall and standing before misk i raised my arms over my head extending them towards him with extreme gentleness almost tenderness the priestking touched the palms of my hands with his antennae let there be nest trust between us it was the nearest i could come to locking antennae briskly misk straightened up somewhere here he said but unscented and toward the floor where a priestking would not be likely to find it is a small knob which will look much like a pebble find this knob and twist it it was but a moments work to locate the knob of which he spoke though i gathered from what he said that it might have been well concealed from the typical sensory awareness of a priestking i turned the knob and a portion of the wall swung back enter said misk and i did so scarcely were we inside when misk touched a button i could not see several feet over my head and the door swung smoothly closed the only light in the chamber was from my bluish torch i gazed about myself with wonder the room was apparently large for portions of it were lost in the shadows from the torch what i could see suggested paneling and instrumentation banks of scentneedles and guages numerous tiered decks of wiring and copper plating there were on one side of the room racks of scenttapes some of which were spinning slowly unwinding their tapes through slowly rotating translucent glowing spheres these spheres in turn were connected by slender woven cables of wire to a large heavy boxlike assembly made of steel and rather squarish which was set on wheels in front of this assembly one by one thin metal disks would snap into place a light would flash as some energy transaction occurred and then the disk would snap aside immediately to be replaced by another eight wires led from this box into the body of a priestking which lay on its back inert in the centre of the room on a mosssoftened stone table i held the torch high and looked at the priestking who was rather small for a priestking being only about twelve feet long what most astonished me was that he had wings long slender beautiful golden translucent wings folded against his back he was not strapped down he seemed to be completely unconscious i bent my ears to the air tubes in his abdomen and i could hear the slight whispers of respiration i had to design this equipment myself said misk and for that reason it is inexcusably primitive but there was no possibility to apply for standard instrumentation in this case i didnt understand no said misk and observe i had to make my own mnemonic disks devising a transducer to read the scenttapes which fortunately are easily available and record their signals on blank receptorplating from there to be transformed into impulses for generating and regulating the appropriate neural alignments i dont understand i said of course said misk for you are a human i looked at the long golden wings of the creature is it a mutation i asked of course not said misk then what is it i asked a male said misk he paused for a long time and the antennae regarded the inert figure on the stone table it is the first male born in the nest in eight thousand years arent you a male i asked no said misk nor are the others then you are a female i said no said misk in the nest only the mother is female but surely i said there must be other females occasionally said misk an egg occurred which was female but these were ordered destroyed by sarm i myself know of no female egg in the nest and i know of only one which has occurred in the last six thousand years how long i asked does a priestking live long ago said misk priestkings discovered the secrets of cell replacement without pattern deterioration and accordingly unless we meet with injury or accident we will live until we are found by the golden beetle how old are you i asked i myself was hatched said misk before we brought our world into your solar system he looked down at me that was more than two million years ago he said then i said the nest will never die it is dying now said misk one by one we succumb to the pleasures of the golden beetle we grow old and there is little left for us at one time we were rich and filled with life and in that time our great patterns were formed and in another time our arts flourished and then for a very long time our only passion was scientific curiosity but now even that lessens even that lessens why do you not slay the golden beetles i asked it would be wrong said misk but they kill you i said it is well for us to die said misk for otherwise the nest would be eternal and the nest must not be eternal for how could we love it if it were so i could not follow all of what misk was saying and i found it hard to take my eyes from the inert figure of the young male priestking which lay on the stone table there must be a new nest said misk and there must be a new mother and there must be the new first born i myself am willing to die but the race of priestkings must not die would sarm have this male killed if he knew he were here i asked yes said misk why i asked he does not wish to pass said misk simply i puzzled on the machine in the room the wiring that seemed to feed into the young priestkings body at eight points what are you doing to him i asked i am teaching him said misk i dont understand i said what you know even a creature such as yourself said misk depends on the charges and microstates of your neural tissue and customarily you obtain these charges and microstates in the process of registering and assimilating sensory stimuli from your environment as for example when you directly experience something or perhaps as when you are given information by others or you peruse a scenttape this device you see then is merely a contrivance for producing these charges and microstates without the necessity for the timeconsuming external stimulation my torch lifted i regarded with awe the inert body of the young priestking on the stone table i watched the tiny flashes of light the rapid efficient placement of disks and their almost immediate withdrawal the instrumentation and the paneling of the room seemed to loom about me i considered the impulses that must be transmitted by those eight wires into the body of the creature that lay before us then you are literally altering his brain i whispered he is a priestking said misk and has eight brains modifications of the ganglionic net whereas a creature such as yourself limited by vertebrae is likely to develop only one brain it is very strange to me i said of course said misk for the lower orders instruct their young differently accomplishing only an infinitesimal fraction of this in a lifetime of study who decides what he learns i asked customarily said misk the mnemonic plates are standardised by the keepers of the tradition chief of whom is sarm misk straightened and his antennae curled a bit as you might suppose i could not obtain a set of standardised plates and so i have inscribed my own using my own judgement i dont like the idea of altering its brain i said brains said misk i dont like it i said do not be foolish said misk his antennae curled all creatures who instruct their young alter their brains how else could learning take place this device is merely a comparatively considerate swift and efficient means to an end that is universally regarded as desirable by rational creatures i am uneasy i said i see said misk you fear he is becoming a kind of machine yes i said you must remember said misk that he is a priestking and thus a rational creature and that we could not turn him into a machine without neutralising certain critical and perceptive areas without which he would no longer be a priestking but he would be a selfgoverning machine i said we are all such machines said misk with fewer or a greater number of random elements his antennae touched me we do what we must he said ane the ultimate control is never in the mnemonic disk i do not know if these things are true i said nor do i said misk it is a difficult and obscure matter and what do you do in the meantime i asked once said misk we rejoiced and lived but now though we remain young in body we are old in mind and one wonders more often from time to time on the pleasures of the golden beetle do priestkings believe in life after death i asked of course said misk for after one dies the nest continues no i said i mean individual life consciousness said misk seems to be a function of the ganglionic net i see i said and yet you say you are willing to as you said pass of course said misk i have lived now there must be others i looked again at the young priestking lying on the stone table will he remember learning these things i asked no said misk for his external sensors are now being bypassed but he will understand that he has learned things in this fashion for a mnemonic disk has been inscribed to that effect what is he being taught i asked basic information as you might expect pertains to language mathematics and the sciences but he is also being taught the history and literature of priestkings nest mores social customs mechanical agricultural and husbanding procedures and other types of information but will he continue to learn later of course said misk but he will build on a rather complete knowledge of what his ancestors have learned in the past no time is wasted in consciously absorbing old information and ones time is thus released for the discovery of new information when new information is discovered it is also included on mnemonic disks but what if the mnemonic disks contain some false information i asked undoubtedly they do said misk but the disks are continually in the process of revision and are kept as current as possible chapter sixteen the plot of misk i took my eyes from the young priestking and looked up at misk i could see the disklike eyes in that golden head above me and see the flicker of the blue torch on their myriad surfaces i must tell you misk i said slowly that i came to the sardar to slay priestkings to take vengeance for the destruction of my city and its people i thought it only fair to let misk know that i was no ally of his that he should learn of my hatred for priestkings and my determination to punish them to the extent that it lay within my abilities for the evil which they had done no said misk you have come to the sardar to save the race of priestkings i looked at him dumbfounded it is for that purpose that you were brought here said misk i came of my own free will i cried because my city was destroyed that is why your city was destroyed said misk that you would come to the sardar i turned away tears burned in my eyes and my body trembled i turned in rage on the tall gentle creature who stood unmoving behind that strange table and that still form of the young priestking if i had my sword i said pointing to the young priest king i would kill it no you would not said misk and that is why you and not another were chosen to come to the sardar i rushed to the figure on the table the torch held as though to strike it but i could not you will not hurt it because it is innocent said misk i know that how can you know that because you are of the cabots and we know them for more than four hundred years we have known them and since your birth we have watched you you killed my father i cried no said misk he is alive and so are others of your city but they are scattered to the ends of gor and talena as far as we know she is still alive said misk but we cannot scan her or for others of koroba without raising suspicion that we are solicitous for you or are bargaining with you why not simply bring me here i challenged why destroy a city to conceal our motivation from sarm said misk i dont understand i said occasionally on gor we destroy a city selecting it by means of a random selection device this teaches the lower orders the might of priestkings and encourages them to keep our laws but what if the city has done no wrong i asked so much the better said misk for the men below the mountains are then confused and fear us even more but the members of the caste of initiates we have found will produce an explanation of why the city was destroyed they invent one and if it seems plausible they soon believe it for example we allowed them to suppose that it was through some fault of yours disresepct for priestkings as i recall that your city was destroyed why when first i came to gor more than seven years ago did you not do this i asked it was necessary to test you and the siege of ar i asked and the empire of marlenus they provided a suitable test said misk from sarms point of view of course your utilisation there was simply to curtail the spread of the empire of ar for we prefer humans to dwell in isolated communities it is better for observing their variations from the scientific point of view and it is safer for us if they remain disunited for being rational they might develop a science and being subrational it might be dangerous for us and for themselves if they did so that is the reason then for your limitations of their weaponry and technology of course said misk but we have allowed them to develop in many areas in medicine for example where something approximating the stabilisation serums has been independently developed what is that i asked you have surely not failed to notice said misk that though you came to the counterearth more than seven years ago you have undergone no significant physical alteration in that time i have noticed i said and i wondered on this of course said misk their serums are not as effective as ours and sometimes do not function and sometimes the effect wears off after only a few hundred years this was kind of you i said perhaps said misk there is dispute on the matter he peered intently down at me on the whole he said we priestkings do not interfere with the affairs of men we leave them free to love and slay one another which seems to be what they enjoy doing most but the voyages of acquisition i said we keep in touch with the earth said misk for it might in time become a threat to us and then we would have to limit it or destroy it or leave the solar system which will you do i asked none i suspect said misk according to our calculations which may of course be mistaken life as you know it on the earth will destroy itself within the next thousand years i shook my head sadly as i said went on misk man is subrational consider what would happen if we allowed him free technological development on our world i nodded i could see that from the priestkings pint of view it would be more dangerous than handing out automatic weapons to chimpanzees and gorillas man had not proved himself worthy of a superior technology to the priestkings i mused that man had not proved himself worthy of such a technology even to himself indeed said misk it was partly because of this tendency that we brought man to the counterearth for he is an interesting species and it would be sad to us if he disappeared from the universe i suppose we are to be grateful i said no said misk we have similarly brought various species to the counterearth from other locations i have seen few of these other species i said misk shrugged his antennae i do remember i said a spider in the swamp forests of ar the spider people are a gentle race said misk except the female at the time of mating his name was nar i said and he would rather have died than injure a rational creature the spider people are soft said misk they are not priestkings i see i said the voyages of acquisition said misk take place normally when we need fresh material from earth for our purposes i was the object of one such voyage i said obviously said misk it is said below the mountains that priestkings know all that occurs on gor nonsense said misk but perhaps i shall show you the scanning room someday we have four hundred priestkings who operate the scanners and we are accordingly well informed for example if there is a violation of our weapons laws we usually sooner or later discover it and after determining the coordinates put into effect the flame death mechanism i had once seen a man die the flame death the high initiate of ar on the roof of ars cylinder of justice i shivered involuntarily yes i said simply sometime i would like to see the scanning room but much of our knowledge comes from our implants said misk we implant humans with a control web and transmitting device the lenses of their eyes are altered in such a way that what they see is registered by means of transducers on scentscreens in the scanning room we can also speak and act by means of them when the control web is activated in the sardar the eyes look different i asked sometimes not said misk sometimes yes was the creature parp so implanted i asked remembering his eyes yes said misk as was the man from ar whom you met on the road long ago near koroba but he threw off the control web i said and spoke as he wished perhaps the webbing was faulty said misk but if it was not i asked then he was most remarkable said misk most remarkable you spoke of knowing the cabots for four hundred years i said yes said misk and your father who is a brave and noble man has served us upon occasion though he dealt only unknowingly with implanted ones he first came to gor more than six hundred years ago impossible i cried not with the stabilisation serums remarked misk i was shaken by this information i was sweating the torch seemed to tremble in my hand i have been working against sarm and the others for millenia said misk and at last more than three hundred years ago i managed to obtain the egg from which this male emerged misk looked down at the young priestking on the stone table i then by means of an implanted agent unconscious of the message being read through him instructed your father to write the letter which you found in the mountains of your native world my head was spinning but i was not even born then i exclaimed your father was instructed to call you tarl and lest he might speak to you of the counterearth or attempt to dissuade you from our purpose he was returned to gor before you were of an age to understand i thought he deserted my mother i said she knew said misk for though she was a woman of earth she had been to gor never did she speak to me of these things i said matthew cabot on gor said misk was a hostage for her silence my mother i said died when i was very young yes said misk because of a petty bacillus in your contaminated atmosphere a victim to the inadequacies of your infantile bacteriology i was silent my eyes smarted i suppose from some heat or fume of the multorch it was difficult to foresee said misk i am truly sorry yes i said i shook my head and wiped my eyes i still held the memory of the lonely beautiful woman whom i had known so briefly in my childhood who in those short years had so loved me inwardly i cursed the multorch that had brought tears to the eyes of a warrior of koroba why did she not remain on gor i asked it frightened her said misk and your father asked that she be allowed to return to earth for loving her he wished her to be happy and also perhaps he wanted you to know something of his old world but i found the letter in the mountains where i had made camp by accident i said when it was clear where you would camp the letter was placed there said misk then it did not lie there for more than three hundred years of course not said misk the risk of discovery would have been too great the letter itself was destroyed and nearly took me with it i said you were warned to discard the letter said misk it was saturated with flame lock and its combustion index was set for twenty ehn following opening when i opened the letter it was like switching on a bomb i said you were warned to discard the letter said misk and the compass needle i asked remembering its erratic behavious which had so unnerved me it is a simple matter said misk to disrupt a magnetic field but i returned to the same place i had fled from i said the frightened human when fleeing and disoriented tends to circle said misk but it would not have mattere i could have picked you up had you not returned i think that you may have sensed there was no escape and thus perhaps as an act of pride returned to the scene of the letter i was simply frightened i said no one is ever simply frightened said misk when i entered the ship i fell unconscious i said you were anaesthetised said misk was the ship operated from the sardar i asked it could have been said misk but i could not risk that then it was manned i said yes said misk i looked at him yes said misk it was i who manned it he looked down at me now it is late past the sleeping time you are tired i shook my head there is little i said which was left to chance chance does nbot exist said misk ignorance exists you cannot know that i said no said misk i cannot know it the tips of misks antennae gently dipped towards me you must rest now he said no i said was the fact that i was placed in the chamber of the girl vika of treve considered sarm suspects said misk and it was he who arranged your quarters in order that you might succumb to her charms that she might enthrall you that she might bend you helplessly pliantly to her will and whim as she had a hundred men before you turning them brave proud warriors all into the slaves of a slave into the slaves of a mere girl herself only a slave can this be true i asked a hundred men said misk allowed themselves to be chained to the foot of her couch where she would upon occasion that they might not die cast them scraps of food as though they might have been pet sleen my old hatred of vika now began once again to enfuse my blood and my hands ached to grip her and shake her until her bones might break and then throw her to my feet what became of them i asked they were used as muls said misk my fists clenched i am glad that such a creature said misk is not of my species i am sorry i said that she is of mine when you broke the surveillance device in the chamber said misk i felt i had to act quickly i laughed then i said you actually thought you were saving me i did said misk i wonder i said at any rate said misk it was not a risk we cared to take you speak of we yes said misk and who is the other i asked the greatest in the nest said misk the mother of course misk touched me lightly on the shoulder with his antennae come now he said let us return to the chamber above why i asked was i returned to earth after the siege of ar to fill you with hatred for priestkings said misk thus you would be more willing to come to the sardar to find us but why seven years i asked they had been long cruel lonely years we were waiting said misk but for what i demanded for there to be a female egg said misk is there now such an egg yes said misk but i do not know where it is then who knows i asked the mother said misk but what have i to do with all this i demanded you are not of the nest said misk and thus you can do what is necessary what is necessary i asked sarm must die said misk i have no wish to kill sarm i said very well said misk i puzzled on the many things which misk had told me and then i looked up at him lifting my torch that i might better see that great head with its rich disklike luminous eyes why is this one egg so important i asked you have the stabilisation serums surely there will be many eggs and others will be female it is the last egg said misk why is that i demanded the mother was hatched and flew her nuptial flight long before the discovery of the stabilisation serums said misk we have managed to retard her aging considerably but eon by eon it has been apparent that our efforts have been less and less successful and now there are no more eggs i dont understand i said the mother is dying said misk i was silent and misk did not speak and the only noise in that paneled metallic laboratory that was the cradle of a priestking was the soft crackle of the blue torch i held yes said misk it is the end of the nest i shook my head this is no business of mine i said that is true said misk we faced one another well i said are you not going to threaten me no said misk are you not going to hunt down my father or my free companion and kill them if i do not serve you no said misk no why not i demanded are you not a priestking because i am a priestking said misk i was thunderstruck all priestkings are not as sarm said misk he looked down at me come he said it is late and you will be tired let us retire to the chamber above misk left the room and i bearing the torch followed him
