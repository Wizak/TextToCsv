after dark my sweet by jim thompson copyright i rode a streetcar to the edge of the city limits then i started to walk swinging the old thumb whenever i saw a car coming i was dressed pretty good white shirt brown slacks and sport shoes id had a shower at the railroad station and a hairtrim in a barber college so all in all i looked okay but no one would stop for me thered been a lot of hitchhike robberies in that section and people just werent taking chances around four in the afternoon after id walked about ten miles i came to this roadhouse i went on past it a little ways walking slower and slower arguing with myself i lost the argument the part of me that was onthebeam lost it and i went back the bartender slopped a beer down in front of me he scooped up the change id laid on the counter sat down on his stool again and picked up a newspaper i said something about it was sure a hot day he grunted without looking up i said it was a nice pleasant little place he had there and that he certainly knew how to keep his beer cold he grunted again i looked down at my beer feeling the short hairs rising on the back of my neck i guessed i knew that i should never have come in here i should never go in any place where people might not be nice and polite to me thats all they have to do you know just be as nice to me as i am to them ive been in four institutions and my classification card always reads just about the same william collins blond extremely handsome very strong agile mild criminal tendencies or none according to environmental factors mild multiple neuroses psychosis korsakoff induced by shock aggravated by worry treatment absolute rest quiet wholesome food and surroundings collins is amiable polite patient but may be very dangerous if aroused i finished the beer and ordered another one i sauntered back to the restroom and washed my face in cold water i wondered staring at myself in the mirror where id be this time tomorrow and why i was bothering to go anywhere since every place was just like the last one i wondered why i hadnt stayed where i was a week ago and a thousand miles from here and whether it wouldnt be smart to go back of course they hadnt been doing me much good there they were too overcrowded too understaffed too hard up for money but theyd been pretty nice to me and if i hadnt gotten so damned restless and if they hadnt made it so easy to escape it was so easy you know youd almost think they wanted you to do it id just walked off across the fields and into the forest and when i came out to the highway on the other side there was a guy fixing a tire on his car he didnt see me he never knew what hit him i dragged him back into the trees took the seventy bucks he was carrying and tramped on into town i caught a freight across the state line and id been traveling ever since no i didnt really hurt the guy ive gotten alittle rougher and tougher down through the years but ive very seldom really hurt anyone i havent had to i counted the money in my pocket totting it up mentally with the change id left on the bar four bucks a little less than four bucks maybe i thought maybe i ought to go back the doctors had thought i was making a little progress i couldnt see it myself but i guessed i wouldnt go back i couldnt the guy hadnt seen me slug him but what with me skipping out about that time they probably knew id done it and if i went back theyd pin it on me they wouldnt do it otherwise they probably wouldnt even report me missing unless a guy is a maniac or a kind of big shot someone in the public eye you know hes very seldom reported its bad publicity for the institution and anyway people usually arent interested i left the rest room and went back to the bar there was a big station wagon parked in front of the door and a woman was sitting on a stool near mine she didnt look too good to me not right then she didnt but that station wagon looked plenty good i nodded to her politely and smiled in the mirror as i sat down rather a warm day i said really develops a persons thirst doesnt it she turned her head and looked at me taking her time about it looking me over very carefully from head to foot well ill tell you about that she said if youre really interested in that ill give you my theory on the subject of course im interested id like to hear it its a pronoun she said also an adverb conjunction and adjective she turned away picking up her drink again i picked up my beer my hand shaking a little what a day i said kind of laughing to myself i was driving south with this friend of mine jack bfflingsley i guess you know the bfflingsleys big real estate family and our car stalled and i walked back to a garage to get help so i get back with the towtruck and darned if that crazy jack isnt gone i imagine what happened is jack got the car started himself she said thats what happened he started looking for you and somehow you passed each other on the highway now he doesnt know where you are and you dont know where he is she finished her drink a double martini and motioned to the bartender he fixed her another one giving me a long hard glare as he placed it in front of her that darned crazy jack i said laughing and shaking my head i wonder where in the world he can be he ought to know id come in some place like this and wait for him he probably had an accident she said in fact i think i read something about it huh but you couldnt uhhuh he and a young lady called jill you read about it too didnt you bert yeah the bartender kept on staring at me yeah i read about it theyre all wet mister they got their heads busted i wouldnt wait around for em much longer if i was you i played it dumb kind of goodnatured dumb i said i certainly wasnt going to wait very much longer i think ill have just one more beer and if he hasnt shown up by then im going to go back to the city and catch a plane he slopped me out another beer i started to drink it my eyes beginning to burn a hedgedin feeling creeping over me they had my number and hanging around wasnt going to make me a thing but somehow i couldnt leave i couldnt any more than i could have walked away from the burlington bearcat that night years ago the bearcat had been fouling me too giving it to me in the clinches and calling me all kinds of dirty names hed kept it up just like they were keeping it up i couldnt walk away from him just like i couldnt walk away from them and i couldnt get him to stop just like i couldnt get them to stop it came back with neonlike clarity the lights were scorching my eyes the resin dust the beerish smell of ammonia were strangling me and above the roar of the crowd i could hear that one wildly shrieking voice stop him stop him hes kicking his brains out its murder murder now i raised my glass and took the rest of the beer at a gulp i wished i could leave i wished theyd lay off of me and it didnt look like they would speaking of planes she was saying heard the funniest story about a man on a plane honestly i just thought id die laughing when i she broke off laughing holding her handkerchief to her mouth why dont you tell it to him the bartender grinned and jerked his head at me youd like to hear a real funny story wouldnt you mister why yes i always enjoy a good story all right she said this one will slay you it seems there was an old man with a long gray beard and he took the plane from los angeles to san diego the fare was fifteen dollars but he only had twelve so they dropped him off at oceanside i waited she didnt say anything more finally i said yes maam i guess i dont get the point well reach up on top of your head maybe youll feel it they both grinned at me the bartender jerked his thumb toward the door okay mac disappear but i havent done anything ive been acting all right youve got no right to beat it he snapped i havent asked you for anything i said i came in here to wait for a friend and im clean and respectablelooking and polite and and im an exserviceman and ive been to college had a year and a half of college and and the veins in my throat were swelling everything began to look red and blurred and hazy i heard a voice her voice say aah take it easy boy dont race your motor kid and from what i could see of her through the haze she didnt look so bad now she looked rather gentle and pretty like someone youd like to have for a friend the bartender was reaching across the counter for me dont bert leave the guy alone she said and then she let out a scream because hed grabbed me by the shirt front and when he did that i grabbed him i locked an arm around his neck and dragged him halfway across the counter i slugged him so hard it made my wrist ache i let go of him he slid down behind the counter and i ran its funny how wrong your first impressions of people can be me now the first impression id had of her was that she wasnt much to look at just a female barfly with money and she did hit the booze too hard even i could see that but i was all wrong about her looks she was young im thirtythree and she couldnt have been any older she was pretty beautiful i should say when she dolled herself up a little shed led a hard life for a long time and it told on her face but she had the looks all right the features and the figure and sometimes well quite a bit of the time she could act just as nice as she looked id only got down the road a few hundred yards when the station wagon drew up beside me and she swung the door open get in she said smiling its all right bert isnt going to make any trouble for you yeah well hes not going to get the chance lady i just stopped in there for a minute and now im going on i tell you its all right berts the last person in the world to holler for the cops anyway were not going back there im taking you home with me home with you i said its not far from here she patted the seat smiling at me come on now thats a good boy i got in rather uncertainly wondering why she was acting so friendly now when shed been so ornery a little while ago she answered the question just as i started to ask it i had a couple of reasons she said for one thing i didnt want bert to know that i might be interested in you the less a man like bert knows about my business the better i like it what else the other reason well i wanted to see what you would do how nervy you were whether you were really the kind of guy i thought you might be i asked her what kind of guy that was exactly she shrugged a little impatiently oh i dont know maybe probably it doesnt make any difference anyway the highway dipped down through a grove of trees with a narrow lane leading off to the south she turned the car into the lane and after about a quarter of a mile just over the crest of a little hifi we came to her house it was a big white cottage standing in a clearing among several acres of trees it looked like it might have been a nice place at one time it still was fairly nice but nothing like it could have been the paint was peeling and dingy some of the front steps were caved in bricks from the chimney were scattered over the roof and there were big rustedout holes in some of the screens the lawn didnt look like it had ever been cut the grass was so high you could hardly see the sidewalks she sat looking out the window for a moment after wed stopped then she sighed and shook her head murmuring something about work being the curse of the drinking classes well here we are she opened the door by the way im mrs anderson fay anderson im very happy to meet you mrs anderson and im very happy to meet you its a unique privilege i dont believe ive ever met a man before who didnt have a name oh excuse me i laughed im bill collins no not the bill collins well uh i dont know i guess maybe i am well dont you feel bad about it its your story so you stick with it she was changing again getting back to the orneriness she was on and off like that all the time i found out nice to you one minute needling you the next it all depended upon how she felt and how she felt depended upon how much booze she had in her with just the right amount and that changed too from hour to hour she was nice but if she didnt have it if she had a little too much or not quite enough she got mean well come on she snapped what are you waiting for anyway do you want me to carry you piggyback i hesitated kind of fumbling around for something to say she swore under her breath are you worried mr collins are you afraid ill rob you of your money and valuables i laughed and said no of course not i was just wondering well what about your husband you said you were he wont rob you either they only let him out of his grave on national holidays she slammed out of the car and flounced away a few steps then she kind of got control of herself i guess and she came back ive got a big steak in the refrigerator ive got some cold beer and just about everything else in the beverage line ive got some pretty good suits that belonged to my husband and but let it go do whatever you want to just say the word and ill drive you back to the highway i said i wasnt in any particular hurry to get back to the highway i was just wondering i mean what can i do for you how do i know her voice went brittle again probably nothing whats the difference who are you to do anything for anyone well i guess i will come in for a little while we went in through the back door she got busy in the kitchen fixing drinks and i went on into the living room everything was kind of torn up and messy in there like it was in the kitchen the furniture was good or rather it had been good but there wasnt a whole lot of it it looked incomplete you know like there might have been more at one time i kind of sauntered around looking things over i picked up some newspaper clippings from the sideboard and began to turn through them they were all pictures of the same boy a little sevenyearold youngster named charles vanderventer iii i tossed them back on the sideboard and sat down she came in with the drinks bringing the bottle with her while i was having one drink she had three bill collins she leaned back and looked at me bifi collins you know i think ill call you collie all right a lot of people do call me collie thats because you look like one stupid and shaggy and with a big long nose to poke into other peoples business just what was the idea in snooping around those clippings i wasnt snooping they were just lying there so i picked them up and looked at them uhhuh oh sure naturally hes uh his family are friends of yours i was just making conversation trying to steer her away from the orneriness youre related in some way hes my greatgreat grandson she said one of the poorer branches of the family i know you wont believe it but they only have a paltry forty million dollars she poured another drink filling her glass half full of whiskey she leaned back again face flushed her narrowed black eyes sparkling with meanness youre very fast with your mitts collie fast and efficient did you ever fight professionally a little a long time ago i had a few fights what happened stop a few too many with your head theres nothing wrong with my head i said i got out of it before there was anything wrong and when did you get out of jail the last time that is i tried to keep smiling i said that well as a matter of fact i had had a few brushes with the police just like any citizen would never anything serious just little misunderstandings and traffic tickets and so on oof she rolled her eyes run for the hills men ill tell you something mrs anderson id like to correct an erroneous impression you seem to have about me im not at all stupid mrs anderson i may sound like i am but im really not youll have to swear to that collie you give me your sworn statement signed by two witnesses and ill take it under consideration im not stupid i dont like for people to treat me like i am most of my life ive been in ive worked in places where it was hard to converse with anyone on an equal footing it was hard to carry on an intelligent conversation so i kind of lost the knack roger wilco collins coming in on the beam im trying to explain something why dont you be polite and listen i was saying that when you dont get to talk much you get to where you sound kind of funny when you do talk kind of stilted and awkward you know youre not sure of yourself shut up but i dammit will you shut up theres somebody coming she jumped up and ran into the kitchen i followed her i watched as she opened the back door and stepped out onto the porch it was getting dark now the lights of a car swept over the trees and blinked out the driver tapped out a shaveandahaircut on his horn fay anderson laughed and stayed down the steps its all right collie its just uncle bud uncle uncle bud fix yourself another drink fix three of them well be in in a minute it wasnt a minute it was a lot nearer id say to thirty minutes and i couldnt hear their conversation of course but i had a strong hunch that i was the subject of it i fixed three drinks and drank them his real name was stoker garret stoker he wasnt her uncle and i doubt that he was anyones but everyone called him uncle bud he was a man of about forty i think he had snowy prematurely gray hair and warm friendly eyes and a smile that made you feel good every time he turned it on i dont know how shed gotten acquainted with him and probably she didnt either because thats the kind of a guy he was if you know what i mean you meet guys like uncle bud once just over a drink or a cup of coffee and you feel like youve known them all your life they make you feel that way the first thing you know theyre writing down your address and telephone number and the next thing you know theyre dropping around to see you or giving you a ring just being friendly you understand not because they want anything sooner or later of course they want something and when they do its awfully hard to say no to them no matter what it is even when its like something this uncle bud wanted he wrung my hand and said it was a great pleasure to meet me then still hanging onto my hand giving it a little squeeze now and then he turned around to fay i just cant understand it fay i still believe youre joking with me why id have bet money that there wasnt a man woman or child in the united states who hadnt heard of kid collins bet me some money she said ill give you seven to five well he laughed and released my hand aint this little lady a case kid never serious for a moment but shes trueblue understand a real little pal and the kiddings all in fun she dont mean a thing by it yes sir i understand lets see now when was that last fight of yours the big one wasnt it in uh it it was in the burlington bearcat he was my voice trailed away i mean it wasnt a very big fight sir sure sure a preliminary bout but it was still a mighty big fight uh it was in i was arguing with a fellow about it the other day and he claimed it was held in newark i said it was in uh it was in detroit i said thats right thats exactly right he exclaimed detroit a fourround prelim what did i tell you fay didnt i tell you i knew the kids record backwards and forwards fay groaned and slapped herself on the forehead uncle bud winked at me and i grinned and winked back at him i began to like him a lot fay said that if we wanted any dinner we could darned well fix it ourselves so thats what we did uncle bud pounded the steak and put it on to broil and i peeled and sliced potatoes he opened some cans of peas and apple sauce and i made coffee and ice water well kid he said while we were waiting for the stuff to cook im glad youve decided to settle down for a while now that youve found friends people who admire you and really take an interest in you settle down i blinked settle down where why right here where else he said firmly our little lady kind of needs someone to keep an eye on her and theres a nice little apartment out over the garage yes sir you just move right in kid just take it easy for a few days get rested up and keep fay out of trouble and ill see what i can stir up for you i got an idea that i might be able to put you next to something pretty good he nodded to me giving the steak a turn i said maybe he already had his eye on something he could put me next to sharp he laughed i told fay you were i said now fay maybe the guys had a rough time but if thats kid collins youve got with you hes nobodys fool hes nervy and hes sharp i said hell know a good angle when he sees one and hell have what it takes to carry through on it and you treat him right and hell treat you right look sir look uncle bud yeah kid go right ahead and get it off your chest well i appreciate your kindness the compliments and all but but you dont really know anything about me you couldnt youre just trying to be nice and probably if you really knew the kind of guy i was you wouldnt feel like this ill tell you what i know i know people kid i know what theyll do and what they wont or put it another way what they can do and what they cant i was a city detective here for years maybe fay told you well i was and i was able to put a lot of bright boys next to some pretty good things some of them had played an angle before but most of em hadnt theyd never turned a trick didnt think they could until i showed them the way and youre not a detective now he glanced around sharply frowning at me for the first time then he pursed his lips and went back to stirring the potatoes well have to see he said absently well have to get better acquainted i think youd be just right smart enough but not too yes i said never mind kid his smile came back theres no rush its something well have to take our time on we ate dinner he and i did rather fay came to the table but she didnt really eat anything she just sat there mussing the food on her plate drinking and sniping at us every time we opened our mouths this damned house she said glaring at uncle bud i thought you were going to turn it in for me right away i thought you were going to make me a nice little profit on it you talked me into buying the damned dump and then you now fay he said calmly youll do all right on it youll make out one way or another oh yeah her eyes wavered and what about that lousy station wagon i tie up practically the last nickel i got in the thing and you now fay you know i got you a good deal on it you know you need a good car living out here who the hell wants to live out here she almost yelled it who the hell talked me into it youll thank me for it you just trust your old uncle bud and youll be wearing diamonds he turned the conversation to me asked me what id been doing since i quit fighting i said id been in the army for a while right after i quit and id just been knocking around since then the army huh get along all right why pretty good i thought i did anyway fay laughed uncle bud frowned and shook his head at her i did the best i could i said but they werent very patient and it kind of looked like they were trying to see how tough they could make things on me so well i landed in the brig a few times and finally they sent me to the hospital and right after that they let me go mmmhmm he nodded thoughtfully you were uh all right then just uh just couldnt adjust to the military life well thats not unusual i understand that there were any number of men who had that kind of trouble fay laughed again and uncle bud gave her another shake of his head sure he said softly i understand how it was kid its that way all through life it seems like people expecting a guy to get along with them but they wont try to get along with him maybe he just needs a little help just a little understanding but ninetynine times out of a hundred he wont get it i said i wouldnt want him to get the idea that there was anything wrong with me there really wasnt much wrong with me you know not then there wasnt and i felt that i had to say it because if theres one thing that scares people its mental trouble you can be an exconvict even a murderer say and maybe it wont bother em a bit theyll give you a job take you into their homes make friends with you but if youve got any kind of mental trouble or if youve ever had any well thats another story theyre afraid of you they want no part of you uncle bud seemed to believe what i told him the way he had me sized up i guess was as a guy who hadnt been too bright to begin with and had got just a shade punchy in the ring sure youre okay kid all you need is some dough enough sos you can take life easy and not have to worry yeah but well i guess i ought to tell you something else too uncle bud ive ive always tried to do the right thing never anything really bad or oh well he spread his hands what do the words mean kid whats good and whats bad now id say it was bad for a nice guy like you to have to go on like hes been going id say it would be good if you never had to worry about money for the rest of your life yeah i guess it would be naturally naturally you wouldnt want to hurt anyone you wouldnt have to it would just be a case of putting pressure on certain people people that have more dough than they know what to do with and making em come across that would be all right wouldnt it i hesitated well it sounds and fay slammed her glass down on the table it sounds rotten she yelled at uncle bud it sounds terrible filthy lousy i dont know why i ever i wont have any part of it understand you may talk stupid here into it bbut you can go ahead without me and i w wont she stumbled to her feet crying and staggered out of the room uncle bud raised his eyebrows at me poor little lady but shell snap out of it now why dont you and i do these dishes and then ill run along we deared up the dishes i tried to talk to him while we were working trying to get something more out of him about this proposition he had in mind but he kept changing the subject his voice getting shorter and shorter and finally he turned on me halfsnarling and told me to drop it forget it ill tell you whatever you need to know when you need to know it he glared at me his eyes kind of glazed and i was too startled to say anything back to him id thought he was such an easygoing goodnatured guy and now he looked like some sort of vicious meantempered animal ill tell you something else too he tapped me on the chest i aint just kidding about you sleeping in the garage thats where you sleep get me and you sleep by yourself you dont make no play for the little lady i nodded feeling kind of hurt and embarrassed i guessed i had stared at her quite a bit that evening but i hadnt meant anything by it i didnt have the slightest idea of trying to take advantage of her maybe id better clear out if you think im that kind of guy i wouldnt want to stick around aw now dont take it that way he said soothingly and suddenly he was his old self again youll have to excuse me kid just forget i said anything ive had a pretty hard day and i spoke without thinking i walked out to the car with him we shook hands and he said not to worry about a thing just to take it easy and hed be out to see me the next day he left then and i went back into the house and of course i didnt feel very easy i couldnt help but worry i fixed myself a couple of drinks they kind of eased me down a little so i fixed another one i sauntered over to the sideboard with it and picked up the newspaper clippings again i thumbed through them absently wondering why they were there and why fayd had me come here and suddenly i stopped wondering suddenly i knew why i didnt know the how of it the details but i knew what it was all about i dropped the clippings as though theyd all at once caught fire i turned back around and there she was just coming out of the bedroom she was pale and sicklooking but she seemed fairly sober she sat down and reached for the bottle smiling at me in a kind of tired taunting way well collie she said well my blushing boy my beamish friend well what you really dont know she poured a big drink of whiskey youve been slapped in the face with a polecat and you still cant smell anything i shrugged she drained her glass and reached for the bottle again sure you know she nodded this house and a crooked excop and those pictures and and you even you could add that one up about that crooked excop about him and you he sort of acts like i mean he said a thing or two to me that yes well thats one thing you dont need to worry about theres nothing between us there isnt going to be anything i dont think he looks at it that way its none of my business of course right so lets get back to something that is listen closely to old mother anderson and then get the hell out because im only laying it on the line for you once a chump is required collie a gradea hundredproof sucker someone with a barrel of nerve and a pint of brains does that description fit anyone of your acquaintance i wouldnt care to say it might partly fit certain people ive met women who drink too much and talk while theyre drinking boing she triggered a finger at her forehead but im my own chump collie strictly my own oh i do an occasional benefit performance but by and large and on the whole to coin a phrase correction two phrases i thought you were going to tell me something you make a big production out of it and then you dont say anything ill tell you something this all you need to know collie if he thought you were halfway bright uncle bud wouldnt want you hes not too sharp himself if he was hed still be on the force and he wont play with anyone who is including you forget about me i dont count and you can sing that to any tune you like i guess i dont understand i said you picked me up today you brought me here to meet uncle bud you do all that and then after im halfway in you its confusing isnt it why not just say that im a cuhrazy mixedup neurotic or we might say that occasionally just occasionally now i feel a twinge of decency she took a swig straight from the bottle and the whiskey trickled down over her chin get out collie this little frammis has been cooking for months and if you leave itll go right on cooking until it boils away nothing will happen without you no one else would be chump enough to touch it well i said i guess and then something happened inside my head and i left the sentence unfinished it was as though id been walking in my sleep and suddenly waked up kidnaping me a kidnaper why was i arguing with her what in hell had come over me id never done anything really bad just the things a man like me has to do to stay alive yet now just since this afternoon i was i pushed myself to my feet feeling dizzy and sick everything was kind of blurred for a minute thats my good boy thats my collie darling i heard her say just a minute honey she hurried into her bedroom and came back with her purse she took out a small roll of bills stripped off one of them and squeezed the rest into my hand id ask you to stay tonight collie if it wasnt for uncle bud i dont want him talking you into this mess and if he saw you before you got away i know id better go now take the bottle with you you look lonely and a bottle can be a lot of company she stood on tiptoe and kissed me and afterwards she leaned against me for a moment her head against my chest she made a mighty nice armful all warmness and fullness and sweetsmelling softness i brushed her thick black hair with my lips and she sighed and shivered and moved out of my arms what about you whats going to happen to you fay nothing the same thing thats been happenmg since my husband died but i thought there was something some organization or treatment that could help you there is but not for what ails me they havent found that yet when youve leaned on someone all your life been completely dependent upon him and never made a decision of your own and when hes suddenly taken away oh nnever mind collie just go and keep going she turned on the porchlight for me so i could find my way across the yard where the lane entered the trees i turned around and waved the lights went off if she waved back i didnt see her everything was dark and she and the house were gone as though they had never existed i felt kind of sad in a way but at the same time i felt good i picked my way down the lane taking a sip from the bottle now and then a couple of times i stumbled and fell down but it didnt bother me much and it didnt seem dark but light id been in the dark a nightmare id almost been trapped in one but now id waked up and got away and it was light again id seen my last of that place i thought it was gone away vanished into the darkness id never been there and it had never been there but it was there i hadnt seen the last of it the truck driver took the bottle out of my hand and poured a little of it in his coke he passed it on to the other truck driver and the other one poured some in his coffee and handed the bottle back to me the counterman watched us frowning a little but not really sore hed taken a couple of drinks too and he was just worried not sore dont flash the jug around so much huh he said some highway patrolman comes by here he might make trouble aaah one of the truck drivers winked at him why would anyone make trouble for collie collies just waiting for a streetcar not a streetcar im waiting for this friend of mine jack billingsley you see sure the other truck driver grinned what kind of plane did you say he was flying ive told you several times now i said its an automobile it oh yeah a rollsroyce wasnt it no hes got a rollsroyce two of them in fact but he wasnt driving one today what he had today was a big cadillac convertible some little thing went wrong with it so i started walking back to a garage maybe he had to stop to feed the horses maybe the caboose ran off the track maybe i said a couple of wise guys would like to have their faces pushed in the lunchroom went dead silent the truck drivers stopped grinning and the counterman glanced uneasily toward the telephone after a moment i forced a laugh im only joking of course were all here joking and drinking together so i joked a little too i didnt mean it any more than you meant the things you said to me one of the truck drivers laid some change on the counter he and the other one got up and kind of edged toward the door i stood up too how about a ride i said ive got a little money and theres still some of the whiskey left sorry company says no riders i can ride in the back just let me ride with you until daylight maybe not even until daylight ill probably see that darned crazy jack billingsley on the road the screen door slammed then the truck doors the motor roared and they were gone the counterman stared at me i stared back at him finally his eyes wavered and he spoke sort of whining please mac clear out will you huh you aint never going to get no ride i certainly wont get one out on the highway no onell stop for me at night but that aint my fault you got no right hanging around here getting me into trouble whatll people think for gosh sake they come in here an you start jabbering away at em im sorry i wont say another word to anyone ill just wait around quietly until it gets a little lighter he groaned and cursed under his breath well get away from the counter then if you simply got to hang around go an set in that rear booth why certainly ill be glad to i went back to the rear booth i slid in as dose as i could to the wall and put my head down on my arms i was worn out what with all id been through and not being in a bed for three days but i couldnt relax let alone sleep my mind kept going back to fay how nice shed been to me and what was going to happen to her i couldnt rest or relax i sat up and lighted a cigarette i took a couple more drinks and put my head down again finally i dozed or i guess i should say i passed out i came out of it frightened not knowing where i was not remembering how i had got here i jumped up almost before my eyes were open and headed for the door the bottle slid out of my pocket i made a grab for it and it sort of jumped out of my hands it bounced and rolled along the floor and i stumbled after it staggering and bumping into the other booths until i finally fell down in one there was a man in it a customer sitting on the bench opposite me a youngoldish looking fellow or maybe you could call him oldyoungish looking he glanced at the counterman and shook his head then he stooped down and picked up the bottle he handed it to me picking up the sandwich hed been eating pretty good he motioned with it casually like to have me order you one no thank you i think you should have some coffee anyway i said thank you i guessed id wait to eat until my friend jack billingsley showed up that darned crazy jack i laughed we were on our way to california driving at night you know because its so much cooler and he went on eating keeping his eyes on his plate then suddenly he looked up he listened frowning staring into my eyes and studying my face all right he laid a hand on my arm gently no harm done its a nice harmless little story and shows a fine imagination but its not necessary with me where do you live well i see been getting along all right about like always pretty good i guess not really good you know but all right how long since you were under commitment i started to say a few days but then i changed it real fast i said it had been over a year the name of the place i gave him was the one before the last one would you like to go back to it dont you think you should go back well i guess i should kind of i havent been in trouble or anything but youre a doctor yes and i think you should go back too unless of course youve got some friend or member of your family who can help you i havent well lets see he rubbed his face lets see now i wonder what youd better he broke off scowling looking sort of mad at himself ill tell you whats your name collins well ill tell you collins youd better take whatever money you can get together and go straight back yes sir ill do that i can probably hitchhike most of the way i wish i could help you myself but i just dont have the time and the money i can only do so much and im already ill tell you what i might do i broke in maybe i could get a commitment in this state a nonresident he laughed briefly not that it would mean much if you were resident sometimes collins sometimes i think they take them in the front door here and lead them right on out the back yes sir i guess its pretty much that way everywhere they cant get the money to operate on theres money for highways and swimming pools and football stadiums for everything but the most important things and then people wonder they wonder why when some terrible tragedy takes place that ill be all right i assured him you dont need to worry about me doctor well he bit his lip well here let me give you my card anyway if you should remain in this section and if theres any kind of emergency even if it isnt an emergency if you just want to talk to someone why be sure to call me i thanked him and said id certainly do that he slid out of the booth walked over to the counter and paid his check he started toward the door then he wheeled around abruptly and came back to the booth youre sure youll be all right collins youll lay off the booze and uh behave yourself yes sir fine good boy you go back there and stay this time stay no matter how long it takes yes sir thats just what im going to do doctor he kind of sighed and shook his head you are like hell how can you why the hell should you come on what i said come on and make it snappy dammit before i have time to change my mind he lived in the city the one id passed through that morning he had a nice little brick cottage there just inside the city limits with his offices in the front and his living quarters in the rear except that i kept thinking about fay anderson and worrying about her the three days i spent there were just about the most pleasant i can remember there were plenty of books to read there was a big lawn i could work on whenever i got restless lots of food in the refrigerator and a bedroom all of my own i think i enjoyed that last more than anything else most places id been in you know places i was always crowded thered maybe be a dozen of us in one little room you looked around and theyd be watching you they looked around and youd be watching them and you never got used to it the longer it went on the more it bothered you it would have been bad enough if you were all the same kind of guys and had the same degree of mental disturbance but you just never were just when you thought you had a pretty good gang theyd move in someone that was honesttogosh bad a real wildeyed guy just anyone it looked like that could get around without a strait jacket and before long you began to feel a little wildeyed yourself you couldnt rest how can you rest when theres some lunatic in the same room with you there at docs house in a big room all of my own i really slept for the first time in years i didnt have any medication after the first night i didnt want any and doc said i didnt need any the third night well it was actually the fourth he came in and sat down on the edge of my bed he asked me how i was feeling and i said id never felt better he murmured that that was good to get all the rest i could so id be in good shape for my trip of course he said not looking at me youll probably be here several weeks yet perhaps several months i sent the institution a wire three days ago but these things take a lot of time yes i agreed i dont know why they should but i guess they do i was going to ask you collie he kept his eyes away from mine in case they should refuse to send for you if they dont feel able to that is because of the expense yes doc how would you feel about staying on here with me theres plenty you could do to earn your keep yard work and car repairs and so on youd be a big help to me and i think id be of some help to you and well it would be a fine arrangement for both of us what do you say collie would you like to do that i i excuse me just a minute doc ill be right back i got up and went into the bathroom i stayed in there with the door closed until i was sure i could control myself good old doc i thought he was a swell guy but he was just about the worlds worst liar hed had plenty of time to hear from the institutional authorities in that state where id been i knew that he had heard from them too and that they had refused to send for me id been almost sure that they would theyll very seldom send for a guy unless hes a violent or criminal case now since there was no one else to look after me doc was willing to take on the job himself i washed my face and ran a drink of water then i made myself smile and went back into the bedroom again i said that id be tickled to death to stay i tried to look natural and sound natural but i guess it wasnt a perfect try i can afford it collie he looked at me closely and looked away again why id tell you so in a minute if i couldnt fine its all settled then youll stay as long as you can afford it i can i want you to and you must you see collie your judgment just isnt good youre inherently decent with a lot of good strong moral fibre but that isnt enough therell come a time or a situation when it wont be enough a man in your condition is readily influenced by others broadly speaking he has to depend on them and you and i know theyre not always dependable he paused and lit his pipe he took a few puffs on it then went on again sometimes theyre merely ignorant sometimes theyre cruel or criminal in any case theyre playing with dynamite actually collie thered be much less danger in your roaming around on your own if you were an outandout lunatic one of the wildeyed guys to borrow your own expression people could see the danger then now well what do they see now why they see an unusually handsome young man a little eccentric perhaps a little slow on the uptake occasionally but in most respects normal so they treat you as though you were normal and the result sooner or later is certain to be tragedy for you for others you only need to look at almost any daily newspaper to see that im right i dont know doc ive been pretty good about steering clear of trouble ive never hurt anyone or ever done anything really bad what do you call really bad collie and how do you take it when someone kids you or teases you never mind he smiled and slapped me on the knee im sure youve done fine hard as it was and from now on youll do even better you stay here for a year or so however long it takes and he left on his calls around ten the next morning as soon as he was gone i called the doctors answering service and reported him out then i left too fay anderson had given me about thirty dollars when i left her place and id had around three of my own but now i had a little less than five i dont know what had happened to the rest of it whether id jerked it out of my pocket and lost it or whether someone had gotten it away from me in that lunchroom but that little bit around five dollars was all i had left it was almost worse than having nothing i couldnt really travel anywhere on it it wasnt more than enough to live on a day or so a few days before five dollars would have looked pretty good to me but id kind of changed since then i didnt see how i could go back to living like i had knocking around and getting knocked around sleeping in culverts and begging for handouts and bumming rides to places i didnt actually care about going to as uncle bud said that was bad really bad when i thought about it certain other things didnt look so bad at all i used fifteen cents of my money for a crosstown bus fare i got off at the highway the one that led past her place and well for a while i just loafed around there i sat on the busstop bench and i got an ice cream cone from a peddler and i windowshopped the neighborhood stores it was hard to decide what to do i always have trouble making decisions and this was a particularly hard one i paced back and forth in front of the store windows arguing with myself fumbling with that little bit of money i had in my pockets i certainly didnt want to put fay on the spot more or less force her to go ahead with something she was against on the other hand she was already on a pretty bad spot wasnt she she couldnt go on like that anymore than i could go on like this and it would be good to see her again so i could just stop by for a visit couldnt i i wouldnt need to stay it was when i was looking in a liquor store window that i finally made up my mind there was a big curvedneck bottle inside just wine but it looked mighty fancy and the price was only three ninetyeight i figured it would make a nice present for her i could take that out to her and it would give me a reason for stopping by i bought it then i stepped out on the highway and started thumbing no one would stop for me but finally a truck came by slow enough so i could hop on the tailgate it was pretty rough riding there and the day was another scorcher i kept jouncing up and down and of course the wine did too and i imagine it got a lot hotter than i did we came to the little lane that led up to her house i swung off the truck running and that final jouncing was just a little bit more than the wine could take the bottle exploded it blew up right in my arms there must have been a gallon of that sticky red wine and ill bet every drop of it went on me i hated to call on fay looking that way but i didnt have any choice i had to get washed up and do something about my clothes and her house was the only place i could it was early in the afternoon when i got there shed only been up a couple hours so she hadnt had too much to drink quite a lot for the average person i suppose but not for fay it was just enough to put her in a good mood oh collie you crazy silly sweet she threw her arms around me laughing what in the world happened to you baby well i just happened to be in the neighborhood i thought id bring you a little present a little wine a barrel darling were you rolling it across she laughed uproariously across the highway and through the trees to grandmas house she laughed and laughed kind of crying along with it she pushed me into a chair and sat down on my lap and i tried to tell her shed get all messy but she didnt even seem to hear me im glad you came back collie she whispered i wish you hadnt i prayed that you wouldnt collie but im glad im glad too i didnt mean to but it just seemed like i had to after i met you and and everything i just couldnt take that old concrete pasture any more the the what collie the concrete pasture i mean thats what it seems like to me you keep going and going and its always the same everywhere wherever youve been wherever you go everywhere you look just grayness and hardness as far as you can see i know i know what you mean she shivered and kissed me but this other it seems like there should be some other way i guess there probably is theres probably lots of other ways but no ones ever pointed them out to me and ive never been able to find them for myself poor collie have you had a hard time these last few days darling where have you been nowhere just fooling around i took a bath and put on some clothes she gave me we had lunch and then we talked some more at first she said wed find another way out there was bound to be another way and wed find it when uncle bud showed up wed toss him out on his ear but she was drinking while she was talking and she kept tossing the booze down so it wasnt long before the good mood was gone and shed completely reversed herself collie collie the wonder souphound why dont you dig us up some bones boy dig us a cave to live in you shouldnt say things like that fay i know you dont mean it there in the bar that day you thought you were hooking into a soft touch didnt you you thought you could take me for everything i had well you can so why dont you take the damned car and the damned house and see what you can do with em of course youll have to pay off a couple of little mortgages first maybe i could i said i mean maybe if we had a little money and i could get some kind of a job you jerk you imbecile what kind of job could you hold hunting sand in the sahara a blinding pain stabbed through my forehead i said that if that was the way she felt about me id better clear out well why the hell dont you she yelled do it and stop talking about it she staggered into the bedroom slamming the door behind her i got up and went out to the back porch and then after a minute or two i started down the lane toward the highway it was the best thing to do i figured the only thing to do because if she acted this way now when she didnt know there was really anything wrong with me how would she act if she knew the truth a lot of normal people are scared to death of anyone with mental trouble and with those boozeshot nerves of hers she was a long ways from being normal probably she wouldnt say anything do anything openly shed be too scared but she wouldnt want any part of me she wouldnt and uncle bud wouldnt and yet if i was tied up with them in a kidnaping if i knew something about them that might send them to the chair well you see what i mean theyd feel that they had to get rid of me they might not like to do it at least fay might not but theyd think that they had to and they would anyway thats the way things looked to me just then i was almost to the highway when uncle buds car turned into the lane he came to a quick stop and leaned out i gave him a grunt and a nod and kept on going wait a minute kid he jumped out and caught me by the arm this is a way to treat a pal kid ive been laying awake nights worrying about you and hoping youd come back and then the minute i see you im in a hurry i cut him off i just stopped at the house to tell fay goodbye and now im on my way again naw no youre not kid he said firmly i aint letting you pass up a deal as sweet as this you hop right in the car and whatevers bothering you well you aint sore at me are you i didnt hurt your feelings with that little joke i made about sleeping by yourself he looked up at me anxiously his face all friendly concern i said that it hadnt sounded like much of a joke to me so i just wasnt thinking he said so he laughed uncomfortably so maybe it wasnt a joke maybe i dont like the idea of another guy making time with fay when ive never been able to get to first base well i wasnt trying anything like that sure you werent but if you do try to kid if you want to and she wants to youll never hear another peep out of me i need you too much know what i mean ive been looking for a guy like you for months and now that ive found you i think youd better count me out i i dont seem to get along too well with fay aah sure you do he clapped me on the back she was needling you huh well dont you mind her at all because she dont mean a thing in the world by it but theres something else i hesitated something about me so youve had a little trouble he shrugged who the hell hasnt now pile into the car and forget this stuff about clearing out i knew it was all wrong he had to have me so he was willing to forget about fay for a while but as soon as he was through with me or if something made him decide that i wasnt any use to him it was all wrong any way you looked at it fay in the shape she was in and me in my condition and uncle bud feeling like he did about me and the kidnaping itself kidnaping the dirtiest kind of crime there is still it was either this or nothing the way things looked to me it was either this or the old concrete pasture so i got into the car with him and went back to the house i wanted to believe that things would turn out all right so i went back and inside of an hour i was back up on top of the world again everything was fine everything was going to be finer uncle bud knew it and he made me know it he didnt try to kid me that the job wouldnt be dangerous but once it was pulled wed be safe and we were a cinch for the dough wed be able to duck the traps that kidnapers are usually caught in wed know about them in advance whether the ransom bills were marked or registered or whether there was a police stakeout at the payoff place uncle bud still had all kinds of contacts inside of the department hed know every move that was being made before it was made so there might be traps but they wouldnt catch anyone wed get the money a quarter of a million dollars and wed get away with it we didnt discuss the actual kidnaping that evening uncle bud said wed take that up after i got settled down a bit i didnt argue with him i was feeling good whatever there was to worry about and i guessed there was probably plenty i didnt want to face up to it just then fay waked up she got to feeling fairly good again and the three of us went out to the garage apartment we dusted it out put clean sheets on the bed and so on then we went back to the house and after a while fay began to razz me a little but she was more funny about it than mean so i didnt really mind uncle bud left around ten oclock or i should say he started to he was telling me good night shaking hands with me when he turned suddenly and looked out the window somebodys coming get that light off get out of sight kid fay fay hurried to the window and looked out she stood there a moment peering through the glass i heard a car door slam youd better go into the bedroom collie take your glass with you but its all right for uncle bud to stay she turned around its only bert bert uncle bud turned white you mean that character from the roadhouse hell if he sees me whats the difference he cant tie you in with anything hes threatened to kill me we were in on a deal together and he thinks he broke off frantically snatching up his glass dont let on im here understand there aint no one here but you but your car whatll i tell him he doesnt know my car when he sees it tell him tell him it broke down on the highway and the people pushed it in here for the night i was already in her bedroom he beat it in after me leaving the door cracked open a little he was really scared i could hear him panting in the darkness hear the nervous rattle of papers in his pockets whatever hed pulled on bert it must have been pretty raw bert only came in as far as the kitchen so we couldnt hear everything that was said but from what we could hear it sounded like a purely social call fay was a good customer of his she hadnt been into his place for several days and hed wanted to see if she was all right he left after a few minutes uncle bud followed me out of the bedroom wiping the sweat from his face boy he said shakily was that a close one mmm said fay so it would seem just what kind of swindle did you work on him anyway none nothing uncle bud shook his head fretfully berts just plain unreasonable know what i mean you try to explain something to him show him exactly why a proposition went wrong and it isnt your fault and he wont even listen he just holds his hand out and tells you to come across fay yawned and sat down again she looked at me that mean sparkle coming into her eyes well collie what do you think of our head man the genius whos going to lead us safely from rags to riches a truly great mind wouldnt you say of course it may get him killed but at least he did manage to swindle a barkeep uncle bud laughed and gave me a nudge he said i wasnt to pay fay any mind because she was just the worlds greatest little kidder but look fay he added it aint going to do for that character to be dropping by here if it should happen later on after we forget it fay snapped that was berts first visit here in months and ill see that its his last ive got a strong stomach but one bird like you is about all i can take uncle bud laughed again he was after something you see and he wasnt going to let himself be insulted until hed got it he left a few minutes later fay and i talked for a while longer after hed gone or i should say i tried to talk to her because i didnt have much luck at it shed slugged down four or five drinks in a row so that killed any chance of really talking why do i ride uncle bud she said well why does one ride a jackass because its the shortest distance between two points quad erat demonstandum which translated into canine means look fay this is important if you think he cant pull this off or that he might try to pull something on me will you stop interrupting it means never look for bones in a bottle you remember that collie its the secret of my success good night i got up and started for the garage i was just about to the back door when she called collie and followed me out to the kitchen i dont know honey she said putting her arms around me theres something insidious about the guy he sort of takes you over and makes you over and its hard not to like him but the things hes pulled on people and as for this present deal a man who would dream up a thing like this collie hes considerably less than upright if it would make him anything and if he thought he could get away with it hed doublecross anyone but you dont see how he could you just razz him to see him squirm like you do me something like that when a person cant stand herself collie when she loathes herself itll be all right i said everything will be all right afterwards will it do you really think any good can come from it its got to fay its got to come from somewhere we stood there close together her arms tightly around me she squirmed contentedly and her robe opened a little she had nothing on underneath fay bent her knees a little sliding her warm flesh against me she took a long shivery breath the sweet softness of her breasts seemed suddenly to harden then she waited all i had to do was make one little move and somehow i couldnt make it with any other dame yes but not with her she meant too much to me this had to mean more than it could now after a moment fay looked up at me eyes twinkling a soft smile on her face well collie is this part of your college training not to take advantage of a lady in her cups i i dont know i felt rather embarrassed and foolish i mean well i never really went to college just some night classes when i didnt have to work so she stood on tiptoe and kissed me gave me a pat on the cheek well its an excellent argument for the midnight oil look i dont want you to think i wouldnt like to also for abstinence go to bed my friend yes i really want you to we have a nice thing here and let us not louse it up she kissed me again and gave me a push toward the door i went to bed usually during the past fifteenodd years id hated to see morning come thats a psychotic symptom you know not wanting to awaken hating to face things that are bound to be more than you can handle it had gotten so that i was almost always sick in the morning id start vomiting almost as soon as i opened my eyes id gone on that way for years for more than fifteen years and i guess id just about forgotten there was any other way but that morning i knew better that morning the morning after that night it was like all those years had never been i waked up early not long after daylight and the way i was feeling you couldnt have paid me to stay in bed i lay real still for a minute sort of holding myself in feeling the energy build up then i jumped up and for about the next ten minutes youd have thought i was crazy i skipped rope i shadowboxed i did a handspring up onto the bed and off the other side and i wound up by walking into the bathroom on my hands i was breathing a little hard but that was all right it was good to have done something to breathe hard about i shaved and showered using the toilet articles uncle bud had bought me i got dressed and went over to the house fay was still asleep of course she hardly ever got up much before noon i fixed myself a big breakfast keeping quiet about it so as not to disturb her and after id eaten i went back outside i sat out on the back porch a while looking at the waisthigh grass of the lawn it looked to me like it was just kind of begging for it just daring me to move in and cut it down to size so finally i dug an old scythe up out of the garage and went to work on it well though it wasnt much of a scythe and that grass was almost as tough as wire after an hour of hard swinging id hardly made a dent in it i straightened up and rested my back i walked up to the far corner of the garage and sized the yard up from that angle it looked to me like id better do my cutting in rows starting here on the outside and working in toward the house i could keep track of the job better that way i wouldnt actually cut any more but at least it would show up better i started swinging again cutting a broad swath clear down to where the trees began i was standing there resting in the shade when i saw a car coming i ducked down out of sight wondering who it was because i could tell it wasnt uncle bud then the sun struck against the license plate lighting up the lettering and i jumped up and ran i ran straight down the lane toward it it stopped and i hesitated a moment panting and then i opened the door and climbed in doc goldman took out his pipe he tamped tobacco into the bowl and struck a match to it not looking at me just looking straight ahead through the windshield im sorry doc i explained i couldnt stay there with you you know i couldnt it it just wouldnt have been right id have been worried about it but this didnt worry you simply walking out on a friend you thought that was all right he shook his head thats not very straight thinking collie its the kind of mixedup onesided thinking that can get you into serious trouble im not mixed up it was just something that i had to do so i did it with a gallon of red wine i suppose and the rear end of a truck for transportation he laughed tiredly no it wasnt too difficult tracing you collie youre hardly what one would call nondescript but with all that wine i didnt expect you to get this far that wasnt for me it was a present i bought it for the for these people im working for here he motioned up the lane with his pipe then you lied to me when you said you didnt know anyone in this state no i mean well i didnt really know them i just met them that night the night i met you kind of an elderly couple we had a few drinks together and stop it collie ive made a few discreet inquiries i know who lives in this place i felt my face turning red i wanted to tell him to go to hell that it wasnt any of his business what i did but he just wasnt the kind you could say things like that to and i couldnt have done it anyway hed been too nice to me and i knew he was trying to be my friend shes a widow isnt she collie he said she picked you up in a bar just as i suspect any number of other women have and for much the same reason but being a nice guy if a little naive you didnt hang around you knew it was the wrong thing to do so you left then yesterday you changed your mind you convinced yourself that wrong was right so you came back and moved in no not the way you mean it doc im working here really working you can see that i am and you can see theres plenty to be done he glanced at the house and then skeptically at the patch of grass i had cut im not living with her i explained hastily ive got a little apartment out there above the garage sure i like her i like her a lot and she likes me and she needs me she she drinks too much and she needs someone to but collie collie my friend he laid a hand on my arm dont you see you did see the danger in such a situation a few days ago you by no means a well man and a woman who also is not well an alcoholic the two of you together a woman whose behavior is certain to be erratic and trying at least at times and a man who is apt to be upset by ordinary giveandtake she needs me i insisted do you know what that means to have someone really need you for the first time in your life i know but collie it still isnt right it must be because when i woke up this morning i was glad i was glad to be alive doc because i knew someone else would be glad and people just arent glad unless they need you they may be nice and friendly like you were but if they dont need you they cant really be glad they cant really care whether youre alive or not and when no one else cares when it goes on that way year after year doc and nobody cares i stopped i guess id said about everything there was to say doc cleared his throat uncomfortably all right collie he sighed ill agree to your staying on here but shell have to be told about your condition i gave him a scathing look and he added i can do it in a way so that she wont be alarmed not alarm her youll tell her that im on the loose from an insane asylum that if i get crowded very hard i may haul off and start swinging youd tell her that what the hell else could you tell her and you say she wouldnt be alarmed now collie i think i could pose the situation much better than that besides its for your own good collie yours and hers id be violating my duty if i didnt do it the cords in my throat began to swell i rubbed at my eyes trying to brush away the red haze and i said i heard a voice saying dont do it doc if you do this to me if you make me llose her ill he turned full around in the seat he put his hands up on the wheel where i could see them watch them and he simply sat there calmly looking into my face and waiting the reddish haze went away my throat relaxed i leaned back in the seat feeling limp and empty and kind of dull but knowing what to do i opened the door of the car and started to get out he drew me back looked at me worriedly collie he hesitated if youd just understand i understand ill get my coat and leave with you no wait a minute he stared at me thoughtfully you are looking good collie you look a hundred percent better than you did when you left my place i feel better at least i did until you showed up he winced and went on studying me it seemed like an hour before he spoke again are you covering up anything collie i was thinking that if mrs anderson was the type who picked up men in bars shed quite likely have some pretty shady acquaintances shes not that type she did it with me but that doesnt make her the type he nodded slowly well all right my friend for the time being until youre a little better settled at least i wont see her gosh doc i gosh i just dont know how to thank you dont he said sort of embarrassed im not entitled to any thanks we talked for a few minutes more finally we shook hands and he left backing down the lane to the highway instead of coming up into the yard i went back to the grasscutting but i didnt work at it long i was too weak that strain id been under when id thought he was going to see fay had taken too much out of me i stretched out in the grass letting the sun beat down into my face hoping id never have to go through a thing like that again doc goldman i thought my friend doc one of the squarest guys that ever lived and for the moment id been on the point of killing him i shivered feeling cold despite the sunlight doc id almost killed doc and i probably would kill him if but that if was never going to be because hed promised not to see her it didnt hit me till later that he hadnt promised not to call her on the telephone it was three nights later we were all sitting around the living room table fay and uncle bud and i studying the city map and going over uncle buds notes there were a lot of them the notes i mean as fay had said hed been planning this thing working on it for months and there wasnt much about charles vanderventer iii that he didnt know as a matter of fact i guess he knew quite a bit more than the boys own folks did because if theyd known what we knew and if theyd done anything about it there couldnt have been any kidnaping i got to thinking about that part afterwards when all the hullabaloo broke loose when there was a fourstate alarm out and thousands of police were called up for extra duty and hundreds of suspects were rounded up and questioned just guessing id say that it must have cost someone several million dollars and of course theres no way of counting what it must have cost the parents what they went through and it was all so senseless you know it would all have been so easy to avoid the more i thought about it the more it seemed to me that bill collins and charles vanderventer ill were pretty much in the same boat i know that sounds funny but we were aside from doc goldman who really wasnt able to do anything no one was interested in either of us until the kidnaping no one did anything to stop it they must have known that he was practically a cinch for something like this and they must have known that i or someone like me was a cinch for it but no one did anything about us they just let us rock along with a pat or a pinch now and then but not really giving a damn about us it seemed like as long as we kept out of the way and were quiet but we were all in it then and plotting hard i remember uncle bud pouring himself a drink and raising his eyebrows at me well kid i guess those are our two best bets either the playground or the picture show you name it lets see i said if its the picture show it would have to be tomorrow well we could wait another week it would have to be on a saturday thats when they have the horse operas at this place so thats when he always goes and the nurse leaves him alone there sometimes while she and this chauffeur rogers gad around shes done it but not very much we cant count on it all we can count on is that shell leave him alone while she goes to the womens rest room a matter of fifteen or twenty minutes maybe i hesitated she always stays that long ive timed her a dozen times and its never been less than that once it was a half an hour she doesnt care for cowboy pictures i guess so she doesnt hurry theres just one trouble with it i couldnt already be in the show in the uniform fay would have to be inside then when the nurse left shed have to come out and tell me i could do it fay shrugged and id just as soon do that as wait in the car yeah i said but it kind of leaves a time gap in there something might happen between the time you came out and signaled me and i got into the show fay gave uncle bud one of her mean grins shed been tapering down on the booze doing a good job of it and it was making her pretty sharp smart boy isnt he she said just when you think he couldnt see holes in swiss cheese he spots one like that i said he was smart uncle bud frowned at her i said so right from the beginning so you did yes you did say that well uncle bud twisted in his chair sort of turning his back on her i still think it might be the best of the two bets the chauffeurs come into the show before and picked him up after all the kids used to doing what hes told hell do what hes told just as well at the playground i said and we wont have the nurse to worry about but youll have to ask for him at the playground hell be mixed in with a lot of other kids you know and youll probably have to go to the playground matron all that takes time i guess ill take it i said that shows right down in the middle of town if there was any trouble wed never be able to get away fay laughed she poured a little whiskey into her glass and shoved the bottle toward me to collie boy may his sense of smell ever sharpen will you drink to that uncle bud uncle bud gave her a hard look then he laughed too and said hed drink to anything but watch this stuff huh he added i know youve been cutting down but you cant be boozed up or have a hangover on this job fay gave him another mean smile then she smiled at me in a different way and i knew she meant to be sober before we pulled the job qkay then kid uncle bud turned back to me well make it at the playground on monday tomorrows out because of the show and sunday he stays at home so make it monday around three oclock i said around three a few minutes before to play it safe the chauffeur this rogers takes the boy to the playground at one and he never picks him up before threethirty or four we went on talking running through the details again after a while i buttoned up the uniform jacket and put on the big outsize sunglasses and let uncle bud look me over hed bought the stuff in another city it was all exactly like the real chauffeurs uhhuh he nodded for me to sit down once we do that touchup job on your hair youll pass fine youre maybe a little taller than the other guy but no onell be measuring you these glasses kind of bother me i said they make my face sweat so that i cant see good well you wont have to do much seeing with em you wont put them on until the last minute i picked up my drink and took a swallow i couldnt think of anything more to say but i kept feeling that i should yeah kid he was studying me feeling a little nervous something on your mind i said i wasnt particularly nervous i wasnt worried about anything i had to do im just uh hes wondering about the money fay winked at me he feels lost without his pockets full of money well he wont feel lost much longer uncle bud said well have it inside of a week kid a hundred grand for me a hundred and fifty for you and fay to split thats fair enough isnt it its fair i guess thats what bothers me thinking about all that money i mean i just cant believe that were really going to get it well get it said fay well get our share or someone else will get something else uncle bud lighted a cigarette and jabbed the match down into an ashtray he took a couple of short quick puffs his hand jerky when he raised the cigarette to his mouth this aint something to horse around with the kids got something on his mind hed better unload it i said it wasnt anything really just an idea that had come to me i was just wondering if maybe there wasnt some way we could make a haul without actually going through with the kidnaping just start to you know kind of fake it and then you step in and rescue the boy something like that yeah he stared at me sort of startled yeah he poured himself a drink keeping his eyes on the glass go on kid well the family would probably give you a pretty good reward and you could probably get your job back in the department there wouldnt be nearly as much money to divide of course but fay and i could get by on a lot less but how could you work it out kid wheres your convincer how do i play the big hero when no one gets caught i scratched my head fay laughed down boy thats a good collie it cant be done kid uncle bud shrugged theres just no way no i said i guess it cant be nope not a chance so well just go right ahead monday and by this time next week well be sitting pretty i had a funny dream that night a damned bothersome one i should say one of those dreams in which everything turns out to be just the opposite of what you thought it was it began back with that first day when i went into berts roadhouse and this guy bert according to the dream was really a pretty good guy he hadnt wanted to act like he had hed done it because he was told to he was just following orders and i guess you know who was giving them and it was the same way with uncle bud uncle bud hadnt planned the kidnaping fay had she was calling the shots all the way down the line the drinking was an act she didnt drink nearly as much as she appeared to that business about being halfhelpless and needing someone to lean on was an act she was tough scheming rotten all the way through according to the dream to get what she wanted shed slept with uncle bud and bert that was the way she held them in line but they didnt mean anything to her and i didnt and when she was through with us wed wind up with a lot less than nothing it was all jumbled and mixed up of course as dreams always are but thats the way it ran generally it seemed to go on for hours but when i waked up sweating groaning out loud i saw that it couldnt have the alarm dock said a little after midnight and i hadnt gone to bed until almost eleven i sat up in bed and lighted a cigarette the dream went away the realness of it and i stopped sweating and my pulse calmed down id had these nightmares before the psychiatrists had explained some of them to me showed me that while they appeared to be different they were all basically the same dream back in the beginning id usually dreamed about getting beat up id be in the ring with two or three guys and theyd all have me outclassed or maybe thered only be one but the referee would be crooked or maybe the other fighter would be a woman or an old man with a beard someone you know that i couldnt hit back at anyway however it was id get the hell knocked out of me that was about the worst thing that could happen to a guy you see i mean it had seemed like the worst thing back in the beginning when i wasnt much more than a kid as i got older of course i began to see that there could be a lot worse things like being sane and not being able to prove it or being crowded into a corner where you might hurt someone or being around degenerates and perverts so much that you got that way yourself so i dreamed about those things id always felt guilty about the bearcat subconsciously although the feeling wasnt nearly as strong as it had been id felt that i ought to be punished that was why i had the dreams and that was why id dreamed what i had about fay losing her having things shape up so that i might lose her was the thing i dreaded most it was the worst punishment i could get so in the dream i got it i lay awake a while thinking the thing through making myself see how foolish it was i was just drifting off to sleep again when a light flickered through my window and i jumped up and looked out it was a moonlit night far down the lane i got a glimpse of a car i couldnt see anything else any people in or around it just a black car parked with its lights off i put on my pants and shoes slipped quietly out of the apartment and down through the trees the car pulled away started backing off toward the highway just about the time i came even with it but from the little i managed to hear and see i knew id gotten myself out of bed for nothing it was just a man and a woman a guy and his girl friend theyd driven in here to do a little petting and now they were on their way again it was as innocent as that but coming right on top of the dream it bothered me a little bit i couldnt help thinking that it could have been someone else someone could park there and slip up to the house and ten to one i wouldnt know about it i went back to bed after a long time i went to sleep but even sleeping i was still kind of bothered i knew i shouldnt be that there was nothing to be bothered about but when a guys whole life is wrapped up in just one thing or just one person well he doesnt really need anything to throw him saturday the next day was kind of a bad day for me fay only took four or five drinks but with the alcoholic fog pretty well gone from her mind she began to ask questions she didnt appear suspicious as though she thought i had something to hide she simply wanted to know about me as people do when theyre deeply interested in a person and i wanted her to feel that way but you can see the spot iwasin i couldnt tell her the truth even the halfway truth glossing everything over sounded like hell id been charged with murder after the fight with the burlington bearcat then the charge had been reduced to seconddegree manslaughter id taken a plea to it and the judge had made the sentence equal to the time id already spent in jail id joined the army and theyd bounced me out fast with a medical discharge since then id gone from one institution to another with a few cheap jobs in between i didnt have the training for a good job i couldnt give any references and sooner or later my record always caught up with me that was the truth without going into a lot of details what i told her was that id stopped fighting after i hurt a guy so bad that he never recovered from it i said id been permanently banned from the ring after that and anyway i didnt have the heart for it but since i wasnt much good for anything else id just sort of drifted that didnt satisfy her i mean she wanted to know more but she saw i was getting upset so finally she laid off i went to bed early completely worn out from the strain of all this i slept well and i waked up feeling pretty good i dressed and went over to the house after breakfast i went to work on the grass again id just about shaken off the worrying like a guy will id swung down through the bottom of the blues and come up on the other side i wasnt entirely up but i was coming up fast it was probably a couple hours after i went to work that i heard fay stirring around in the kitchen then maybe thirty minutes later she came to the door and called to me i dropped the scythe and started across the yard wiping the sweat out of my eyes mopping my face and arms with my handkerchief i went up the steps and across the porch opened the door and went in and and then i just stood there staring at her because id known she was beautiful that she had the stuff to be but id never thought fay could be this beautiful i didnt think that any woman could her eyes were sparkling crystal clear her hair had that soft brushedshiny look and her face was roseandwhite softness that seemed to glow from the inside she was wearing tan shorts and a white offtheshoulders blouse she took a deep breath smiling at me and her breasts swelled and i could see she was wearing nothing beneath the blouse well she tilted her head to one side smiling how do i stack up as an advertisement for prohibition ffine you stack up period mmmm really think so but you ought to make sure shouldnt you fay fay honey i took a quick step forward then i stopped looking down at myself i guess with you so clean and pretty and everything i ought to i hesitated kind of hoping shed say it didnt matter and i think she did start to say that but this was something that meant a lot to her as much probably as marriage would have meant and in a sense it was marriage it was something she wanted to be perfect so after a moment she nodded all right collie its a nice thing as i recently remarked so why louse it up ill be right back i said just as soon as i wash up a bit and you know where ill be she smiled ill be ready in fact i think i may as well fay tugged suggestively at the blouse then she turned and went through the living room and into the bedroom i couldnt move for a second or two and then i beat it out of there fast i ran across the lawn and up the stairs to my apartment i turned the water on in the tub and started shaving i finished shaving got in the tub and scrubbed and soaked myself then i put on all clean clothes and went back down the stairs again in all i guess it had taken me about twentyfive minutes it couldnt have been any more than that but in that little time just that little time everything changed for me i hadnt heard the car leave i wouldnt have heard it with all the noise i was making in the tub but it was gone and of course she was gone too i looked in the house hoping against hope hoping that it wasnt like i knew it was but she was gone apparently shed gone dressed as she was taking a coat with her maybe i sat down in the living room and for a while i just sat staring into space staring at nothing my mind a blank then gradually i began to think again and what i thought was that this was all so unnecessary that it was one more piece of the pattern that had put me where i was doc goldman doc and the dozens of other doctors id come up against they said that my thinking was onesided and hell compared with theirs mine had more sides than a bar they knew all about me at least some of them did but they knew me as something kind of isolated something set off by itself and not really a part of the world i was a case not a person what i thought or felt was of minor importance if any it was unreliable i knew nothing and they knew everything and if id just hold still long enough a year two years fifteen years why theyd fix me up in fine shape yes sir theyd take care of my case or if they didnt it wouldnt matter because life would have passed me by id been listening to doctors for half my lifetime but i couldnt remember one that had really listened to me whod actually given any thought to what id said and why not tell me why not i was the guy most concerned i was the one guy who knew exactly what i was up against i was the worlds best authority on kid collins not a case but the kid himself i knew what hed taken and how much he could take and most of all most important of all i knew how people took him there wasnt any theory about it there wasnt any of this business about how people ought to or should act i knew id learned by firsthand experience and if anyone had listened to me if doc had listened yeah sure i was in on a pretty rotten deal but it had taken me more than fifteen years to get into it more than fifteen years of holding still of being the nothingness of a case and and doc hadnt known about the deal all hed known was that i seemed to be getting along fine that i had something to live for for almost the first time in my life and still he hadnt listened to me what i knew didnt matter only what he thought i got the telephone directory and looked up his number i dialed it and he answered immediately i said collie and waited collie he hesitated look fellow uh where are you right where ive always been but he cleared his throat uncomfortably you remember i didnt make any promises collie i said wed let it stand for the time being and i only agreed not to see her i didnt say that i wouldnt uh telephone i know youre a man of your word doc he was silent for a moment when he spoke his voice sounded a little bewildered kind of halfangry i didnt say a word that should have alarmed her collie on the contrary i was very careful to reassure her well that makes her kind of crazy doesnt it she shouldnt have been alarmed and she should have been reassured but it turned out exactly the other way she didnt react properly did she doc shes abnormal isnt she judging by her attitude yes she i know i remember the time i had three spine taps in one month and the time i had the electricjolt treatment and the insulinshock routine there wasnt anything wrong with the treatment you know it wasnt the treatments fault that i couldnt focus my eyes or stand up or remember my own name that was mine i just didnt react properly collie please listen to me i remember a doctor at one of the places i was in a guy that specialized in lobotomies so he performed one of them right after another and of course he was absolutely correct in doing it but somehow the patients just wouldnt cooperate with him they didnt react as they should have hed give em these swell prefrontals just the prettiest jobs you ever saw and these damned stubborn patients just wouldnt turn out right i guess they probably liked being idiots wouldnt you say they liked being so stupid that they couldnt button their own pants or count the fingers on one hand they liked i broke off choking let it go just let it go there was a pause and i could all but see him frowning i could see the worry in his eyes im terribly sorry collie but you must know that it was the only thing i could do its hardly my fault if mrs anderson adopts an attitude that is completely unreasonable thats the word all right doc now maybe youll tell me what a reasonable attitude would be she lives alone remember and her nerves are in pretty bad shape and she hasnt known me much more than a week so tell me doc just how should she have acted well i i certainly dont think that she he paused now listen to me collie i said i was sorry you dont know do you you didnt know but you know now and you found out the easy way why didnt you do it to yourself doc why didnt you go to some of your normal people and tell em you were a mental case and see how they acted collie and now i could visualize the red flush on his face i did what i had to im sorry that mrs anderson took it as she did and ill be more than glad to is she with you now i laughed i didnt say anything youre at her house well stay there and ill come right out i you know im your friend boy i dont mean to throw anything up to you i know im glad i can remember youll stay there then give me a chance to straighten this out im leaving here i lied im hitting the trail again no no collie if you dont feel that you can stay there you must come back over here well go ahead just as we planned im leaving dec im hitting the trail and dont try to pick that trail up because if you do i might stop remembering i hung up the phone a minute later it started ringing again it rang and rang and then finally it stopped and i went on sitting here looking into nothingness the tears streaming down my face i waited there at the house until around midnight then i want out to the garage stretched out on the bed and waited at four in the morning when i fell asleep she still hadnt returned it was almost noon when i awakened and i was conscious of someone being in the room with me i lay still keeping my eyes slits and looking out from beneath the lids it was uncle bud he was seated near the bed his hat pushed back on his smooth white hair he was watching me studying me rather there was a thoughtful calculating look on his toofriendly face and i felt that i knew what he was thinking as well as he did so what if the kid isa little off and it couldnt be more than a little i can still use him use him and then get rid of him with fays help because the way she feels about the kid now shed be even more anxious to wash him up than i am i waked up i opened my eyes i mean i looked surprised and uncle bud apologized for walking in on me hed just that moment come in he said and i told him sure it was okay i went into the bathroom and washed when i came out he had that warm warm smile turned on the friendliness and sympathy stuck right out at me you know what happened kid fay had a pretty big load on when she showed up at my place and im not sure i got things straight i know what happened i checked with my friend the doctor a hell of a note yes sir a hell of a note he shook his head sadly two people hitting it off like you were and then a thing like this has to happen but shell snap out of it kid just give her a little time to get used to the notion and shell come around sure she will it wont bother her a bit well he glanced at me sharply well no of course it wont but we better not rush it huh kid we better wait for her to lead and speaking of that you just take it easy here and ill bring you some breakfast uncle bud went over to the house and fixed me a tray bacon and eggs and a big pot of coffee fay was really knocked out he said so sick and hungover she could hardly stand up and that kind of put us on the spot didnt it it really fouled up the ball game didnt it kid it sure does if were going to pull it today we ought to be leaving in a couple hours or less kid or less id say to wait until tomorrow but how do we know shell be straightened out by then once she starts batting that jug shes liable to be on it for a week yeah thats right kid he hesitated what do you think anyway id take her place go with you myself to take care of the boy but im pretty well known in this town and if someone should see us together yes i said well i dont think it would be a good idea maybe it wouldnt hurt anything and maybe it would the way i look at it theres just no sense in taking chances i filled my coffee cup and lighted a cigarette he waited kind of fidgeting wanting me to grab the ball and carry it and i let him go right on waiting i had to be absolutely sure you see it had to be his proposition well he said at last what dya say kid what do you think me now i think you can swing it fine you can do it just as well by yourself as you could with fay i took a swallow of coffee hesitating pretending to think it over i screwed up my face thoughtfully and slowly drained the cup he watched every move he leaned back in his chair one arm thrown over the back trying to appear easy and unanxious but feeling so much the other way he just couldnt put it across fay had called the turn on him all right he was stupid stupid and cheap a little squeezing and it cropped out all over him it oozed out of him like sweat well i said im pretty dumb myself but if you think yeah yeah kid if you think itll be all right why okay swell thats swell he jumped up beaming now if youre all through there wed better start getting you ready my hair is blond almost yellow maybe i told you that well anyway it is it was and the real chauffeurs hair was black so that was where the dye touchup came in i shaved shaving extra close when i was through uncle bud took the razor and shaved my neck he stood back and looked me over he went over my face again taking care of any little places id missed and then he went to work with the dye i looked pretty funny when i was through the sides and back of my hair black and the top of it yellow the outsize sunglasses covered my lashes and brows so we let them go i put on the uniform everything including the cap glasses and gloves then after uncle bud had checked me over i stripped off the cap jacket glasses and gloves and put on my hat i was wearing a sports shirt in the car id look just about like any other guy out for a ride uncle bud helped me carry the uniform stuff downstairs we put it down on the floor of the station wagon behind the front seat and i got in uncle bud wished me luck he beamed at me almost laughing he was so happy and i almost laughed myself i drove off wondering why it was always the stupid people who figured everyone else to be stupid why they always think they can outsmart the other guy because i wasnt supposed to be bright of course but even an idiot could have seen through this stunt id never meant anything to him now that i didnt mean anything to fay either and since id practically told him how he could cash in and play it absolutely safe well you see what he was going to do what they were going to do and it looked like a very sweet setup for them everything seemed to fit together perfectly they could even use dec goldman to back up their story fay had felt sorry for me and given me a job then when dec had told her about my background shed fired me giving me until the following day monday to clear out shed slept late that day this day and when she waked up she found that id stolen her car she hadnt known quite what to do being so innocent and unworldly you know so shed called uncle bud and he remembered id done some talking about the vanderventer boy he hadnt thought anything of it at the time just supposed it was some wild talk but if i was an escaped lunatic and a car thief well maybe i didnt have it figured exactly right but it was close enough i was due to get killed uncle bud was due or thought he was to be a hero knowing what i did i couldnt say why i was going ahead somehow i didnt really think about the why of it it just seemed like something i had to do like id been set in a rut and had to follow it out to the end i was hurt of course hurt and sore at the whole world and probably that was why but i dont know all i knew was that i had to go ahead and that i needed an angle to do it something that would pull them into the deal and hold them in it it would drive them nuts i thought they figured on cashing in fast and easy and it wasnt going to be that way id make them go ahead theyd have to play it right out to the end with an escaped lunatic for a partner a lunatic who was suspicious of them who knew theyd tried to kill him and before it was all over theyd probably be ten times crazier than they thought i was but i needed an angle i had to have an angle that neighborhood was the finest in the city just about the fanciest id ever seen anywhere there were a few apartment houses with pools and fountains in front and long wide walks leading up to them but almost everything was estates the houses sat far back from the street so far and so hidden by trees that they could hardly be seen most of them most of their yards rather were enclosed by walls that cut them off from the street i was parked at the corner of one of these walled places the playground was just across the street ahead of me it covered a square block and it had about everything you could name in the way of play equipment practically all of the kids that came here of course had as much or more at home but this private park gave them something they didnt have at home something that ordinary kids take for granted a chance to play with other children so i guess their folks felt it was necessary the grounds were enclosed by a high spikedsteel fence with a gate on each side across one end fronting on this street and a side street was a brick clubhouse i suppose youd call it that anyway it was a place where the kids could romp in bad weather and with rest rooms and so on the gates werent guarded i guess a guard for each one would have been pretty expensive they werent locked either since the matron had twentyfive or thirty kids on her hands and she couldnt keep running back and forth to the gates she was a fairly young woman dressed all in white like a nurse she was kind of pretty too and also rather flustered and crosslooking because children like those she could only crack down on them so hard she could tell them what to do but she couldnt really insist or get tough with them if she wanted to keep her job and it looked like she wasnt the only one who knew it shed been chasing after them straightening out first one then the other ever since id driven up now finally she had them all together in the middle of the playground trying to get some kind of ringaroundarosy game started i took off my sunglasses and wiped them i looked at the dashboard clock it was five minutes after three if he kept to his usual schedule the real chauffeur would be showing up between threethirty and four so i had to be moving if i was going to move i had to but i couldnt i hadnt spotted my angle yet i put the glasses on again and looked back over at the playground i looked just in time to see a kid a little boy give a girl a shove she sat down hard on her bottom squalling like shed been killed the matron shook her finger at the boy and squatted down in front of the little girl she dusted her off and petted her put her on her feet again she straightened up and looked around for the boy then she sort of shrugged and went back to the game maybe she thought he was stifi in the group because with all those kids it would be easy to overlook one or maybe she thought hed gone to the toilet anyway she couldnt be bothered and i mean she really couldnt be she had maybe thirty kids to look after so she couldnt devote her whole time to one of them but i could any guy who wanted to pick one off could do it so i knew where the little boy was hed gone off to the clubhouse but he hadnt gone inside instead hed scooted through the patio dropped down on his hands and knees on the other side and started crawling along the row of sandboxes he was headed straight for the gate from the way he went about it you could tell hed done it plenty of times before i started the car watching him as he reached out from behind a sandbox and eased the gate open a few inches his hair was the same color as the vanderventer boys they were about the same size too but i could see he was older he must be at least nine i guessed and probably he was as old as ten he was my angle he could be the angle if he got out and he did he did it so fast that i almost missed it one second he was snaked down behind the sandbox the next second he was out the gate running stooped along the concrete base of the fence at the rear of the clubhouse he straightened up casually and walked on down to about the middle of it then he took a cigarette from the pocket of his little sawedoff pants and tapped it against his wrist a few times he took a lighter from another pocket and lit it he leaned against the building one foot crossed over the other puffing away like a little old man i put the car into gear i drove past the playground the fenced part and stopped at the rear of the clubhouse he flicked his fingers at me in a kind of wiseguy salute hi rogers he said sauntering forward what do you know for sure i mumbled something hello or how are you or something like that or maybe i didnt either because i was pretty mixed up to begin with and the way he talked and acted it didnt do anything to straighten me out okay he hesitated with his hand on the fender then he nodded at me through the windshield went to the door and climbed in how about a little ride rog i want to talk to you about charlie and this will be my last chance i got the car started again i started it with a jerk he was doing exactly what i wanted him to do doing everything for me but well i just dont know i just couldnt think dont remember me do you rog he leaned back propping his feet up on the dashboard well i guess you wouldnt ive been on the coast for six months just here for a few days with grandma and i have to go back to paris tonight thats the way the judge made it when my parents got divorced six months with dad in the states and six months with mom he lighted another cigarette and held the package out to me i shook my head looking into the rear view mirror there was a car or two behind me but neither was uncle buds i wondered if id figured him and fay wrong now about charlie the boy said whats happened to him anyway rog what kind of shoving around are those goofy parents of his giving him shoving around i mumbled i uh i guess i dont know what you mean never mind i know how they treat him how theyve always treated him hes been sick for years and hes getting sicker and the worse he gets the tougher they make it for a him making a man out of him they call it teaching him responsibility boy i wish i was a little bigger id get me a club and i saw them now fay and uncle bud they were in his car fay was driving and they were coming up fast something wrong rogers the boy gave me a knowing look want me to duck out of sight just some friends of mine i said and no i want you to sit right up just act like i get you you were too early to pick charlie up so youre killing a little time with a pal i swung into the curb and stopped their car shot past us skidded to a stop and uncle bud jumped out he started toward us at a run his hand inside his coat then he got a good look at the boy and his mouth dropped open and he stopped as suddenly as the car had i got out i sauntered up to him deliberately looking puzzled whats the matter i asked what are you two doing out this way i we he shook his head helplessly his eyes wavering hed planned on doing just one thing and now he didnt know what the hell to do that bboy he said at last damn it all kid you got the wrong boy huh i let out a grunt but he looks well damn it to hell hes not a blind man could see hes not i told you i told you i couldnt see good with these glasses but theres no use in getting sore ill just take him back and get the right one tomorrow just like that huh hell of all the dumb he wont say anything ill make him think its some kind of game yeah but uncle bud hesitated but its so damned late youre practically a cinch to run into the other chauffer i can make it i explained and im sure the kid wont talk hell be afraid to see he slipped off from the playground and hell be okay all right he made up his mind suddenly but get moving will you snap into it and ill see you out at the house uncle bud ran back to his car pushing fay back in just as she started to get out they drove off with him at the wheel and i went back to the station wagon well rogers the boy nodded at the dashboard clock ive got to be getting back to the playground right away i agreed i pulled the car around in a fast uturn now about this little ride of ours ill appreciate it if you dont say anything about it i wont he promised and dont you say anything either just give me a minute to duck into the dubhouse then you can pick up charlie and no onell know a thing i turned at the corner of the playground and parked at the side of the clubhouse he opened the door kind of reluctantly sat hesitating halfin and halfout of the car then he turned slowly around and stared thoughtfully into my face and for a moment he looked every bit as old as he talked charlies sick he said awful sick i cant do anything about it and anyway ive got to go back to paris tonight ill see about him i said hurriedly ill look after him dont you worry you better you sure as heck better rogers he slid out of the car looked back in for a second take it easy he said his folks need a good jolt but dont be too tough on em then he was gone so quickly that it was hard to believe that he had ever been there i got out of the car right away but by the time i reached the playground he was nowhere in sight i opened the gate i went inside leaving it off the latch it was threethirty it had been threethirty when i left the car the real chauffeur was due at any time but i had to go through with this deal and it was now or never they were still out in the middle of the playground the children and the matron i stopped about twenty feet away and after a moment she turned and saw me oh hello rogers she said it in the halfhaughty way people use when they think theyre better than you are and feel that they have to keep proving it youre early for a change arent you i didnt say anything just touched my fingers to my cap she gave her head a little toss and looked around at the children charles charles vanderventer she called oh here you are run along with rogers now he moved out of the group a pale weaklooking kid he looked at me uncertainly and then he looked at her is that rogers he said puzzled is it oh my goodness she took him by the shoulders and gave him a push who else would it be he started toward me moving slowly feeling knowing that something was wrong but afraid to say so he followed reluctantly as i turned around and started toward the gate i walked fast for a few steps listening to him listening to his footsteps he kept that same slow pace so i had to slow down too i couldnt let him get too far behind and i couldnt hurry him he was used to doing what he was told but i couldnt lean on that too hard if i tried to rush him if he got scared enough oh rogers it was the matron rogers i paused turned partly around charles has had a pretty trying day will you tell will you please tell mrs vanderventer that i suggest he stay at home tomorrow i waved my hand i started toward the gate again and after a long moment i heard the boy following moving as slowly as he could barely dragging his feet my glasses were steaming over i shifted them and they cleared for a moment and then they seemed to fog up worse than ever the gate was less than thirty feet away but i could hardly see it i glanced over my shoulder and i could barely see the boy everything was blurred a watery hazy blur everything was kind of meaningless i was a blind man a man who had blinded himself to get something and now whatever it was id wanted was slipping away from me all it once my mind was a complete blank i didnt know where i was i didnt know how i had gotten here or what i was doing or supposed to be doing i was just there here walking across a childrens playground a guy in hot funnylooking clothes with a little boy tagging along behind him and how why what it was all about i didnt know i guessed it must be some kind of a gag the only thing i could think of was that id blanked out there in berts roadhouse and theyd dressed me up in these clothes and dumped me out here it could have happened id pulled blanks before when my mind got too tight and people had done some funny things to me when i had i sort of laughed to myself going along with the gag thinking the joke would be on them when that crazy jack billingsley showed up wed been heading for the coast see me and that crazy jack billingsley so the car had broken down and id started back to the garage to get help and somehow jack had got it running again and i stumbled i almost fell flat on my face i yanked the glasses off and wiped them cleaned them off good and the bright sunlight struck into my eyes and suddenly i knew where i was and why and what i had to do i slapped the glasses back on i whirled around grabbed the boy by the hand and yanked him along with me it was only a few steps to the gate but there couldnt be any more of the footdragging my nerves wouldnt take it there wasnt time the boy whimpered a little when i grabbed him now he was hanging back trying to and i was afraid he might get up the nerve to yell so i stooped and picked him up in my arms that quieted him paralyzed him with fear i guess i straightened up and started through the gate and a big black limousine pulled in at the curb and a chauffeur hopped out he was dressed exactly as i was he was the man i was supposed to be he dusted at his trousers like a man will when he first gets out of a car he took his sunglasses off and wiped them gave me a glance and a nod and put them back on again i nodded back at him i went through the gate and down the steps to the walk he started toward me still dusting at himself we passed each other he went up the steps and through the gate i started down the walk i reached the corner of the clubhouse i stepped behind it glancing over my shoulder the real chauffeur had stopped and was staring at me i dont know how it came about whether he got a glimpse of the boys face or whether it had just taken that long for the situation to sink in on him probably it was the last a thing can be so completely startling that it doesnt startle anyway the man swung into action fast he didnt even yell which of course he should have he came charging through the gate in a leap and down the steps in another and he came pounding up the walk after me fists churning his head ducked all action and nothing else i backed away from him getting further behind the clubhouse still holding onto the boy when he was right on top of me i stuck my fist out i gave him a straight arm with a fist at the end of it and he piled right into it with his face his glasses exploded i felt his nose flatten and crunch he reeled wobbled on his heels and toppled forward he was out like a light hit harder than i could have hit him and no one had seen it that fancy clubhouse was in the way and the estate walls were in the way they were walled off from the world and the world was walled off from them i ducked around the corner i put the boy flat on the floor of the car climbing in over him keeping a foot on him while i shucked out of the uniform stuff and put on the hat then i wheeled the car around in a uturn crossed through the intersection and headed for the highway the vanderventer chauffeur was still lying where i had left him as i turned the comer and the playground vanished from view he was still sprawled behind the clubhouse thered been no cars passing by at the moment i gave it to him but several had passed since then and others were passing now yet no one stopped they had other things to do and it was none of their business if a man had fallen down id gone a couple of miles before i realized i had my foot on the boy i lifted it off fast and gave him a little pat there was nothing to be afraid of i told him hed just stay there and take it easy and no one would hurt him he looked up at me his big blue eyes filled with tears his lips trembling and as pale as his face all right all he gulped ill ill he tried to tell me that hed do what id said but it got all tangled up in a sob i told him not to try just rest charlie boy just be real nice and quiet and everything will be fine i wont hurt you i wont let anyone else hurt you i went on talking to him soothing him i guess he must have believed what i said because the sobbing stopped and a little color came back into his face i turned on the car radio keeping the volume low there was nothing on the air yet about the kidnaping i didnt think there would be but i was curious to know when the news would break how long it would take apparently the chauffeur was still knocked out lying where i had left him and no one had stopped to see why he was there the matron well i was kind of puzzled about her too because she must have seen the two of us together and she must have known that things werent as they should be but well there you were thats the way it usually goes people who might do something that needs doing are too busy to do it the others dont give a damn yes the police department was on the job relatively speaking that was just about the best patrolled area in the city in this section there were regularly assigned squad cars covering a fivemile area the way it worked out on paper the cars were supposed to cover as much territory as a dozen men on foot and they could too they could cover it all right but the police in it couldnt do a hell of a lot more than that they couldnt drive licketysplit all day and see everything they should see the officers couldnt be looking into trouble while they were driving around if there was trouble they had to leave the car and the radio while they investigated and if something popped meanwhile it had to wait until they got back that was the setup the same kind of efficiency arrangement you find in lots of cities it saved money for the taxpayers and it was good business running the department on a businesslike basis at least it must have seemed that way then ordinarily it should have taken about half to threequarters of an hour for the trip from the playground to the house but i took the trouble to drive slowly so as not to attract attention from the police or anybody it was a strain doing that talking to the boy now and then and listening to the radio so i turned it off i wanted more and more to open up the station wagon and get there as fast as i could but i kept well within the speed limits then somehow maybe because i was trying so hard i managed to get lost it was well over an hour and a half before i pulled up in the yard of the house uncle bud and fay were at the kitchen door just standing there whitefaced and kind of dazedlooking almost motionless inside the house i could hear the radio blaring the news of the kidnaping so it was out now i took my time walking up to them then i stopped just off the steps and listened like all firsthand reports it was confused the facts of the kidnaping were more or less there but the story was all garbled they had no description of me nothing beside the fact that i was fairly tall and of medium build they didnt know what kind of car id used both the matron and the chauffeur were being questioned all available police including those offduty had been ordered to the area the entire neighborhood had been blocked off a search of every estate in the vicinity was underway all servants particularly uniformedchauffeurs were being intensively grilled the boys parents were prostrated the mayor had demanded allout action the police commissioner was pressing for an immediate solution of the case and the chief of police had promised that no stone would be left unturned the news had just broken but everyone that was anyone was all ready with a statement they were so ready with their predictions and promises and demands you might have thought theyd been expecting something like this but dont guess they had or if they had it hadnt bothered em much i went back to the car and around to the other door i spoke to the boy and then i lifted him out gently and started up the wall he was sound asleep exhausted with the excitement and strain i was practically knocked out myself but naturally everything had hit him a bit harder fay and uncle bud moved out of the doorway id have knocked them out of it if they hadnt moved i brushed past them carried the boy into the spare bedroom and laid him down on the bed i slipped off his shoes partly unbuttoned his shirt then i went back into the living room pulling the door shut behind me fay and uncle bud had snapped out of it a little enough at least to wobble back into the living room and fix themselves a drink i fixed myself one and sat down fay looked at me out of the corner of her eyes she gave me a straighter look her lips trembling as she tried to smile i stared back at her and she dropped her eyes and the smile went away then it was uncle buds turn i went through the same thing with him staring through him forcing the smile back into his face making him look away they both sat looking at the floor almost holding their breaths sort of poised on the edge of their chairs they looked like theyd jump if i said boo and i left them that way it was the way i wanted them to feel i leaned back and sipped at my drink listening to the radio there was nothing new just the same hot air without anything behind it i got up and fixed another drink i switched the radio off and sat back down well whats the matter i didnt surprise you did i fays head came up her breath went out in a deep quavery sigh surprise us she said surprise us oh collie how why in the world did you do it why not it was what we planned on it was what i was supposed to do bbut but not that way not after youd made a mistake and it was so late you were almost sure toto to her voice broke and she covered her face with her hands she rocked back and forth kind of sobbing and laughing smiling and frowning all at the same time that seemed to bring uncle bud back to life he let out a laugh slapping his hand on his knee surprise he beamed at me and what a surprise kid i got to hand it to you boy i bet there aint another man in the country that could have pulled a stunt like that and got away with it theres plenty that could do it all youd have to do is get them sore pick yourself a guy thats a little bit off and then try to throw a curve under him and hed do it yeah he weaved around that one well i know what you mean kid you hold the short end of the stick just so long and then you start swinging it youve had enough see people just dont want to get along with you no matter how wffling you are so finally shut up huh now look kid i said to shut up but he brushed the back of his hand against his mouth wwell sure anything you say kid you gave me a card when i first came here i said you wrote your name and your address and telephone number on it in case i had to get in touch with you its in your own handwriting remember not just a printed business card that i might have come by accidentally i paused letting it sink in on him he wet his lips uneasily you wouldnt have found that card on me today i went on you couldnt have got it back i wont tell you where it is but ill tell you this ive got a good friend or two around the country even a guy like me wifi pick up a few friends and if anything should happen to me the cops will get that card mighty fast and theyll be told where it came from i was lying of course probably uncle bud had a good hunch that i was but he wasnt very bright and he didnt have much in the way of guts and if his hunch was wrong if i wasnt lying his eyes flickered as he tried to make up his mind he brushed at his coat nervously his fingers lingering at the ominous bulge under his handkerchief pocket he wanted to do it he wanted to so bad that he could taste it but he couldnt quite talk himself into the job it was a pretty screwy thing id told him like something out of a cheap movie but well i was a pretty screwy guy wasnt i id already outsmarted him once today and with a stunt that made less than no sense at all so if id done it once why wouldnt i do it again how the hell did he know what i might do collie said fay breaking the silence what what is this what are you getting at i didnt answer her or even look at her i sat watching uncle bud a moment longer grinning at him then i got up and walked over in front of him well how about it youve got a gun you were all set to use it an hour or so ago why dont you do it now his mouth opened his lips moved silently helplessly i caught him by the shirt front and yanked him to his feet cant make up your mind huh youre scared stupid and scared well ill give you a little help maybe if you get good and sore i gave him a little jolt under the heart just a little tap with my fist uncle bud grunted his face went white and i tapped him again around the heart down in the kidneys and up on the wishbone i held him with one hand and fed him those little jolts with the other and his face seem to turn from white to green and his tongue slid out from his teeth i reached under his coat grabbed his gun and shoved it into my belt then i dropped him down into his chair and went back to the sofa uncle bud sat bent over hugging himself he wasnt really hurt bad just temporarily paralyzed with pain but i guess he thought hed been about halfkilled fay frowned at me scared but more puzzled it seemed than anything else collie she said sharply i want to know what this is all about you know fay i told you right from the beginning i told you i wasnt stupid and i didnt like for people to treat me like i was but but whats that got to do with it she paused and went on in a lower voice is it does it have something to do with yesterday im terribly sorry about that darling it just came as such a shock to me that i couldnt think i didnt know what i was doing for a while then i ran off and started drinking and made such a mess of myself that i was ashamed to face you forget it i know how you felt and what you felt so dont bother to tell me but she hesitated again is it im sorry i let you down today collie but i just didnt see how i could go through with it i wouldnt have been any good to you the way i felt id have been almost sure to spoil things but you pulled yourself together you felt well enough to leave right behind me to be johnnyonthespot after id pulled the job well she nodded slowly yes uncle bud thought we ought to do that much to help at least if something went wrong if there was trouble we might be able to pull you out of it i was stifi sick but i was worried about leaving you to do everything and uncle bud thought i we thats right kid it was uncle bud getting back to normal thats just the way it was we were concerned for you having to do everything yourself and we figured wed better kind of keep an eye on things i laughed i didnt say anything just laughed the one time and chopped it off short fays eyes flashed and its a good thing we were there if we hadnt been youd have taken the wrong boy yeah it hasnt maybe occurred to you that i picked that boy up deliberately deliberately but but why would you do that what now look she said im getting fed up whats he talking about uncle bud he looked at me uneasily he cleared his throat tried to work up a smile and it looked like something on a corpse fay frowned she asked him again what i was talking about it was a pretty good act youd have almost thought she didnt know answer me she said i swear if this keeps up much longer ill ill now now he squirmed there aint nothing to get excited about the kids just kinda got the wrong slant on things an and i dont blame him yunderstand i dont hold the slightest grudge whatsoever hes been under a big strain today wifi you stop stalling and tell me said fay loudly well uh you remember what we were talking about the other night about maybe not actually going through with the snatch just faking it kind of and then having me step in and collect a fat reward fay nodded but we couldnt do it there was just no way we could so what about that well uh yeah there was a way all right just one way to make it look good and i guess thats kind of what the kids thinking about then maybe the thought i was jealous of you two or something of course hes all wrong but but you see how it might look to him you act like youre completely washed up with him the kid figures were both plenty leery of having him around so when he had to go by himself today and then we show up why fays glass slid out of her hands it bounced against the carpet and then toppled onto its side rocked back and forth the ice tinkling she stooped and picked it up she reached out and set the glass on the table she wasnt looking at what she was doing she was staring at me and it fell to the floor again fay didnt seem to notice there was an expression on her face id never seen before a kind of wakingup expression it was the way a blind person might look if he was suddenly able to see if he really saw himself for the first time in his life so thats what you think she said thats what you think of me why not i said yes why not if a person wont stop at kidnaping why would he stop at murder i dont think it makes much difference about yesterday collie about what happened or didnt happen it may have brought about this situation a little sooner but with people like us people whove become what we have we were bound to arrive at it she rubbed her eyes tiredly and shook her head you were wrong about not being stupid collie you are i am uncle bud also to cite a selfevident fact now now said uncle bud whats the sense in all this glooming around we had a little misunderstanding but its all over now were all square with the world again we got what we wanted and now were all set to collect fay laughed collect yes gentlemen and lady now we can collect i said so didnt i uncle bud turned to me now ive been thinking kid theres nothing in the news about the station wagon but isnt there a chance that that first boy might peep i know it dont look like he would he wouldnt want to admit hed sneaked off and gone for a ride with a stranger and probably if he did admit it that matron would swear he was lying but the cops wont be passing up any bets on this one so fay got up suddenly and went into her bedroom i started to get up too just instinctively without thinking wanting to go after her to ask her if something was wrong and then i caught myself and i settled back down again i can ditch it over at my place kid what do you think what oh well yeah maybe youd better do that im pretty sure the boy wont say anything but someone else might have spotted it right ill take it with me then when i go and leave you my car i can pick up another heap to get around in until we pull down our jackpot now he reached for the bottle and poured his glass halffull he was trying to be friendly and casual but his hand shook underneath his big easy smile he was scared stiff now i figured id mail the ransom note tonight if thats okay with you theyll get it the first thing in the morning look i said weve been all through this you know what you have to do and theres no point in asking me about it yeah but he hesitated well i dont want you to get any more wrong ideas kid i dont want to do anything that maybe you uh i wont get any ideas without a damned good reason just dont give me any reason and i wont get any ideas his smile warmed up began to look a little more natural now youre talking kid hell theres no use getting all up in the air and acting unfriendly is there we had a little misunderstanding and i dont blame you a bit see but now that we got it cleared up all right lets just cut it off there im tired of kicking it around and im tired period sure sure kid he said hastily now what do you think about he broke off started another sentence i think id better have something of the boys kid a label out of his dothes or maybe his handkerchief something to send with the ransom note so theyll know its just not some crank writing a case like this you know therell i got up cutting him off and went into the bedroom i eased the boys handkerchief out of his pocket saw that it was initialed and took it back into the living room uncle bud said it would do fine it was just what he needed and maybe hed better be running along now i walked out to his car with him he gave me the keys to it and got into the station wagon but he still didnt leave he kept rambling on thinking of things to say that uniform and stuff kid better get rid of it right away take it out and and bury it i know im going to better get to work on that hair right away too scrub it out until there aint a trace of the dye left in it i said i would i knew everything i had to do and id do it but he stifi didnt leave he still sat there fidgeting with the car keys making conversation so finally i did the only thing i could do hed made a half a dozen starts at doing it but he was afraid to carry through so i took the lead i shook hands with him and a minute or so later he drove off i buried the uniform and the things that went with it i came back up from the trees returned the spade to the garage and went up to the apartment i washed my hair out flopping down on the bed for a while afterwards but tired as i was i couldnt rest i kept tossing around trying to straighten my mind out and i sure didnt feel much like laughing but somehow i wanted to laugh because id played one hell of a joke on myself doc goldman had called the turn on me all right my judgment was anything but good guys with my background and maybe a lot of guys without it cant think very far ahead they knock themselves out getting something they just have to have it it seems like and then it turns out to be something they dont want and they dont know how to get rid of it id looked forward to making fay and uncle bud squirm crowding them onto the ragged edge and keeping them there but now i could see it wasnt going to work they might crack up and be unable to do what they had to they might feel i was just waiting for a chance to pay them off that they had to get me before i got them id had to shake hands with uncle bud id had to pull him off the spot id put him on make him think that things were at least reasonably okay and fay id have to do the same thing with her if i could because the other wouldnt work the other took more out of me than i had i couldnt beat them over the head without beating myself it was night dark when i finally thought things out as good i mean as i could think them out i got up and went downstairs and i stood there in the yard awhile looking in through the back door of the house fay and the boy were at the kitchen table she was holding him on her lap not eating anything herself but it looked like he was eating quite a bit he finished after a few minutes they left the kitchen the boy holding on to her hand and watching through the windows i saw her take him into the bedroom i went on inside there was a lot of stuff left on the table canned beans and boiled ham and half of a pie so i warmed up the coffee and started eating fay came in pulling the door shut behind her i looked up and nodded hows the boy doing did he eat his dinner all right did he she shrugged dont tell me you dont know i supposed she must have noticed me out in the yard i said id just waited out there until the boy was through because i was afraid i might upset him uhhuh well if thats all you were just doing ill just tell you that young charles heir apparent to the vanderventer fortune had a light repast consisting of onehalf of a pie and approximately one pound of beans not to mention ham bread and perhaps another pound of beans by way of dessert i see i guess he must have been pretty hungry now ill just bet he was it hadnt occurred to me but i can see now that he must have been shed brought a bottle in from the living room a full one so i guessed she must have finished the other one fay poured herself a drink that mean little smile playing around her lips when she saw me frown yes he must have been hungry she continued and i must be thirsty you have parted the clouds collie and at last everything is clear to me i want to say something ive been thinking things over and i think maybe i was wrong about today yes you think so maybe about you not uncle bud i know what he was planning to do but you didnt have to be in on it youdve had to ride along with him after hed done it but you might not have known about it beforehand go on i maybe didnt i might not have she nodded over her glass its algebra isnt it you multiply the two minuses and it gives you a plus look i did you or didnt you just tell me tell you oh thats against the rules collie when you have to ask another person for the answer it doesnt count well well at least tell me this about yesterday and you finding out about me could you would it have been all right i know how people feel about those things but i was through the worst of it and if i could have just gone on yes so would i have cared to accompany you for the rest of the journey well her eyes glinted would i or wouldnt i as i said before my answer doesnt count i shoved my plate back i poured coffee into my cup slopping it over into the saucer fay poured another drink of the whiskey aside from the rules collie i cant answer you the question is posed on circumstances that no longer exist before three this afternoon i could have answered it and you would have believed me youd have had no reason not to but after that after your little setto with uncle bud and your flat accusation that i was all right i interrupted her why do you have to keep harping on it what would you have thought if youd been in my place exactly what you did my friend i implied as much at the time i got up suddenly and went to the door i stood there wanting to leave feeling like i had to get away from her and feeling and wanting just the opposite wanting feeling i didnt know just what i didnt want her to think i was suspicious of her but i didnt want her to think she could get away with a doublecross either i didnt want to be afraid of her or to have her afraid of me i wanted i looked out into the yard out at the rakedup piles of grass withered heaps in the moonlight and i knew that what i wanted i wasnt going to get it was gone it couldnt be brought back to life any more than that moweddown grass could that door fay said if you go through it youll find a walk and at the end of the walk theres a lane and at the end of the lane theres a highway yeah that door is wide enough for two people these two look i said im not sure i know what you want you mean just walk off and forget about the money youre wffling to forget the whole thing if i am the money has nothing to do with the matter collie after all it was supposed to be purely a means to an end wasnt it whether it would achieve that end a happy partnership well call it depends largely on us well sure but so theres our door to life lets see if its wide enough for both of us she got up and went into her bedroom i listened to her moving around wondering uneasily what she was up to because it should have been dear enough to me but it wasnt it was almost twenty minutes before fay came back her face made up and her coat and hat on she nodded to me and started for the door i was too startled to move for a second then i jumped up and got in front of her wait a minute where are you going going she smiled up at me why im going out i said where youve got nothing to see uncle bud about youve got no business at berts place so where else could you be going her smile drew in at the corners she stepped back from me just a step but it seemed to take her awfully far away and held out her hand i almost forgot the car keys collie but where i broke off oh i said youre youre just going for a little ride you want to get a breath of air the car keys collie i gave her the keys sort of laying them in her hand without quite letting go what does this prove fay you just get up without any warning and start to leave i suppose it wouldnt have bothered you if id done that do you do you so suppose well treasure the thought my friend some wastrel who doesnt care about inflation may give you a penny for it she jerked the keys out of my hand and left just before she started the car i heard her laugh angry and teasing or maybe disgusted and disappointed i took a fast step toward the door then snatched up the whiskey bottle and went into the living room i sat down with my back to the windows i made myself sit there not moving or looking around until shed driven away but why i did it i dont know it didnt mean anything feeling like i did wanting to stop her worried about where she was going and what she might be doing it meant just the opposite of what it should have meant we couldnt go through the door together we couldnt walk together very far on the other side of the door so shed proved her point thats what shed meant to do and how did i know that fay had maybe it had all been a buildup a way of pointing me in one direction so she could move in another why not fay couldnt get me to clear out and leave her and uncle bud or someone else with my share of the loot so shed picked up with another plan another way of cutting me out of the deal shed know just how to go about it right from the beginning shed been able to get me so rattled and mixed up i didnt know what i was doing sure shed sent me away that first time but fay must have known id come back i didnt have any place else to go and mister it was the boy standing in the bedroom door mister im sick i got to to his tiny body swayed doubled at the waist he put his hands over his mouth and there was a gurgling sound then i swept him up in my arms and ran with him to the bathroom i wasnt quite fast enough he was vomiting before i could get him over the toilet stool the stuff gushed out of his mouth splashing over the bathroom floor just when i thought there couldnt be anything left in him it started coming out the other way sorry gasping for breath he tried to apologize ill ill clean it up mister no you wont i said never mind sonny you just cut loose as much as you want to i had him sitting on the stool at the time i was down in front of him mopping and wiping with a towel and there was something in his expression that stabbed through me like a knife yyoure not rnmad at me he said mad i chucked him under the chin hell no sonny why should i be mad at a little boy for being sick he looked at me doubtfully apparently hed been expecting a spanking and he stifi couldnt believe that he wasnt going to get one honest he said skeptically youre really not mad honest im not mad and no one else is going to get mad because if they do if anyone even looks like theyre going to say a cross word to you ill well theyd better not thats all he was sick terribly sick but a smile slowly spread over his face and i think it was the most beautiful smile i have ever seen then his arms went around my neck and he pressed his face against mine and the words he whispered to me i guess they were the nicest i have ever heard i like you mister i like you very much it was around eleven oclock when fay got home id dozed off in my chair and i waked up when i heard the back door slam there was another bang as she dropped a bag of groceries on the kitchen table she came into the living room threw her hat and coat into a chair and sat down in another one she didnt look drunk i mean she didnt wobble or stagget but you could see the booze in her eyes see it in her tight twisted little smile the rats are still in the harness she said im saving the pumpkin to make a pie i didnt say anything right just then i didnt trust myself to thats pie without an e collie you multiply it by the frammis and it gives you cinderella coach on or would you like to try for the jackpot if you win you get a window to throw it out of the boys been sick fay ive taken him to the bathroom a half a dozen times my my well you just tell him he has to take you the next half dozen damn it its not funny what the hells the matter with you anyway i told you hes sick and i heard you her voice sharpened what do you want me to do about it ring for doctor kildare i told her shed done too damned much already stuffing a kid full of junk when he was already upset you must have known it would make him sick you load him up on the worst stuff you could think of beans and pie and sure i did she yelled i forcefed him didnt i i ran a hose down his throat and pumped it into him i tried to kill him why the hell dont you say so now wait a minute i didnt say aah shut up go file the point on your head but just dont try to kid me dont tell me you hadnt thought of it i blinked i didnt know what she was talking about id been pretty mad when she first came in pretty sore and worried so i guess id talked kind of rough youre not that stupid said fay sure youve thought of it weve got him havent we we collect just as much if hes dead and we save ourselves a lot of trouble i shook my head i just sat there shaking my head fay grinned at me her eyes narrowed cant take it huh well in a case like that thered seem to be only one logical alternative youre drunk you dont know what youre saying want to bet lets bet pumpkins yours looks pretty green from here but im a sport she reached for the bottle on the table and took a swig from it she hefted it studying me two trickles of booze running down the corners of her mouth then she shrugged and slammed it back on the table to hell with it she said to hell with you im going to bed fay pushed herself up from the chair picked up her coat and hat wobbling a little now that last jolt of whiskey had hit her hard midnight she mumbled so its the end of the ball lil cinderellas gotta crawl back under her cork well whats layin on your larynx stupid nothing had better happen to that boy i said thered sure better not anything happen to him yeah well right back at you brother rat paste it into your hat line that pumpkin with it you heard me you may be drunk but you know what youre doing her eyes flickered her face twisted suddenly like maybe she was going to vomit then she turned and staggered toward her bedroom door stupid she mumbled ssstupid an cant help it hhe cant but fay went through the door kicking it shut with her foot i stayed where i was for a while afterwards thinking that the boy might need me to help him again and just thinking in general about myself about uncle bud about her thinking in circles and not getting anywhere that stuff shed said about the boy about it being better for us if he was dead maybe she was trying to chase me off with that talk to scare me into leaving for my own good or maybe she was doing it for her their own good or maybe she really meant it or maybe she was just testing me out to see how id take it and if they really planned on having him dead and if i wouldnt go along with the plan maybe if if and maybe how the hell was i going to know how could you know what people would do if theyd go in on a deal like this one i made myself stop thinking about it my head just wouldnt take it any more all that chasing around and around so i started thinking about the little boy not the one we had charles vanderventer iii but the first one that little kid who was heading for paris tonight i wondered if hed meant what he kind of seemed to mean whether you know hed been wise to what i was doing and had deliberately let me get away with it i guessed he hadnt it was hard to be sure he was such a sharp fasttalking youngster but i guessed he hadnt i mean he just couldnt have no kid would have felt like that felt that another kid would be better off kidnaped i turned the radio on low the newscaster was just winding up his last broadcast for the night no further developments in the vanderventer case at this time and now a few words about that plane disaster i mentioned a moment ago the deluxe transatlantic airliner crashed at la guardia airport shortly after eleven tonight when two of its motors failed simultaneously during the takeoff all of the crew and all but three of the passengers were kified among the fatalities was tenyearold jacques flannagan son of motionpicture actor howard flannagan of hollywood and margot flannagan wentworth darcy holmes of paris and london in accordance with their divorce agreement the boy spent six months a year with each parent he had left this city earlier tonight following a brief visit with his grandmother that next day just about everything happened that day just about everything seemed to go wrong it was the day the boy almost died it was the day bert tried to kill uncle bud it was the day i robbed dec goldmans office it was the day fay tried to to what everything happened everything went wrong everything got worse than it had been so maybe id better take it from the beginning id better start with fay shaking me awake yelling at me to get up and me darting my hand under the pillow and coming out with the automatic id taken off of uncle bud i didnt mean to kifi her naturally i hadnt got to that point then it was just that id gone to bed late and gone to sleep a hell of a lot later and when she but lets go back to the beginning collie collie stop i heard her screaming from a long way off screaming my name yelling for some guy named collie to stop and for a moment it meant nothing at all to me it was just a voice just a name it was coming from just one more of the twisted white faces that had swarmed around me all night long they meant nothing the only thing that mattered was this thing that someone had put in my hand something hard and cold and heavy i looked down at it while the screaming went on not really looking because my eyes were open but i couldnt see with them i just knew i had it and that i must have it for a reason and the only reason i could think of was collie dont ddont huh what the boy collie hhes put it down i saw that the face had a body the two merged then slid down the wall and into a chair and my mind began to wake up it moved up from the darkness slowly patching up the past trying to make the day something i would wake up to going to put the grass back i mumbled put everything back like it was wasnt very pretty but but aaah hell she sobbed aaah damn it to hell my fingers loosened and the gun dropped to the bed i sat up feeling the old sickness clutch at my stomach i stared at her rubbing the sleep out of my eyes hating her and myself and this whole world id had to come back to whats the matter i said whats wrong with the boy what did you do to him do to him fays head jerked up why damn you i aaah whats the use hes sick thats whats the matter he looks like hes dying i just woke up a few minutes ago and i went right in to see how he was and he hhe he cant seem to get awake collie all right get back over there with him just stay there until i get over dont bother him or try to feed him feed him how the hell could i go on get out fay got out i threw on my clothes shoved the gun into my hip pocket and ran down the stairs it was noon the hot sunlight hit me like a club stirring up my stomach all over again i stopped and was sick i ran on a few steps and then i vomited again i stood panting bent over waiting a few moments but that seemed to do it for the time being the sickness was gone as much as it was going to go i ran on into the house and into the boys bedroom fay was in there with him i brushed her out of the way and bent down by his bedside i studied him listened to his breathing i turned on the light and went down on my knees bringing myself doser to him while i looked and listened his skin was flushed hot but damp looking his eyes were partly open sort of slitted they were glazed but he blinked a little when i passed my hand in front of them he hardly seemed to breathe at all his breath had a faint sweetish smell and there was the same smell to his body his pulse was pretty slow but the beat wasnt bad i mean it seemed fairly steady well fay frowned at me damn it say something do something turn the radio on get the newscast turn the radio on there ought to be something about this i said about the boy i think i know whats the matter but i want to make sure she turned it on a minute or two later uncle bud arrived from town with an armload of newspapers so we got the word both ways at once and it was just what id thought i was right about the boy and i wished to god that i wasnt i covered him up good then i got a spoon and a cup and fed him a few sips of lukewarm water that didnt seem to help much but it was about all i could do i turned the light off and went into the living room fay was working on a water glass full of whiskey uncle bud who also had a drink was settled back in a chair taking things easy hed been all pepped up when he arrived the family had got the ransom note and theyd asked the police to stay out of the deal to cooperate as the newspapers put it just to keep hands off and let them pay the ransom and get the boy back and it looked like the police were going to let them have their way i sat down looking from fay to uncle bud he wiped the pleased grin off his face turned on a sympathetic frown diabetes he said now thats bad that is whodve ever thought hed have a thing like that i could think of a couple of people who might have thought it who damned well ought to have known about it because hell uncle bud knew everything else about the kid didnt he he and fay had been kicking the kidnaping around for months and hed been digging into the boys and the familys background even before that so why wouldnt he have found out about this but well maybe he hadnt if the kid was taken care of properly if he was kept on a strict diet and got the right amount of rest and exercise and so on the disease wouldnt bother him much he wouldnt need too much in the way of actual medical treatment then maybe his family was touchy on the subject like some people are touchy about anything in the way of sickness or weakness and theyd tried to keep the trouble hushed up it could have been that way the family keeping quiet the boy not too bad off anyway regardless of whether fay and uncle bud had known or not it didnt change anything and there was no point in trying to pin them down yes sir said uncle bud yes sir its sure a shame a nice little boy like that i guess you know quite a bit about the stuff huh kid i nodded people in mental institutions have it the same as anyone else they dont always get treated for it but they have it yeah now thats sure a shame i dont suppose you uh you wouldnt have any ideas about what we ought to do fay laughed and choked on her drink i said i had a pretty good idea of what we ought to do but i didnt have the stuff to do it with ive worked as an orderly in several places they never have enough help so when they find a patient thats intelligent they fay let out another whoop i looked at her not saying anything just sitting and staring until she was all through laughing she cut it off pretty fast she raised her drink holding it up in front of her face and i went on staring a moment longer the boys in a diabetic coma i explained it isnt a bad one and i think hell pull through it i think he can be pulled through it but if he is if we get him through this hes practically a cinch to slide into another one and as weak and run down as he is yeah uncle bud frowned i guess all that starch and sugar was pretty bad for him huh its a wonder it didnt kill him well maybe it will yet fay snatched up the bottle refilled the water glass maybe ill get him next time why the hhell dont you say what you mean now now uncle bud shook his head so what do you drink kid he needs insulin hell die if he doesnt get it yeah well lets see i know a few places drug stores where they aint too particular if they know a guy but to do it now when its in all the papers and the heats on itd be asking for trouble really begging for it im out in front on this deal and if theword leaked out he was right even someone with a prescription would probably be checked on now i just dont see what we can do kid i dont hardly know what we could do if we had the stuff i mean youve been around people with the disease worked with the doctors but the papers and radio dont say how much of the insulin the boys been getting they couldnt the dosage would vary according to his condition id have to kind of feel around for what he needed start off with the minimum dose and work up uhhuh i see he went on asking questions sort of aimlessly it seemed to me not paying too much attention to the answers he was all for helping the boy yknow he loved children uncle bud did but it looked to him like there was every chance of harming him rather than helping him after all i wasnt a doctor i just naturally couldnt be sure of whether i was doing the right thing or not and with the boy as bad off as he was just one little wrong move would probably push him over the line you see my point kid and it aint that i dont think you mean well i see your point i said i see yours all right but maybe you dont see mine if theres no trouble like were all hoping we dont need the boy alive in fact its a lot less risky for us if he isnt alive they have to take our word for it that were going to return him we get the money either way and without him around as evidence someone we might get caught with and wholl be telling all he knows afterwards wed be a lot safer but i broke off for a moment because it was hard to talk this way so coldblooded and everything but i figured it was the best way to talk i didnt know what was in their minds whether they were just putting on an act or whether they really didnt want the boy to die but i knew that if they did want him dead theyd see that he was theyd arrange it somehow sometime and the only way i could stop them was to prove that it just wouldnt be smart go on kid uncle bud nodded of course i wouldnt want a nice little boy like that to die but if we just cant help it well its like you say it would work out pretty nice for us i didnt say that i mean i said it but i was just pointing out how you might look on it me i dont look on it that way that family has half of the money in the state if they dont get the boy back theyll probably spend every nickel of it running us down but then well suppose things dont come off as smooth as we hope they will and we got caught it would sure be a lot better for us if the boy was alive even if he wasnt if we could just show that wed done everything we could do for him it would be a lot better uncle bud frowned chewing his lip he hesitated nodded slowly yeah he sighed i guess youre right kid we sure got to do what we can even if it dont work out right but how can we get that insulin doc goldman i said impatiently he comes back to his office at two and hes there until five he doesnt take any office patients after that time if someone could call him just before five get him out on a fake call i could have a good look around i get it i get you kid there wouldnt be anyone there you could get in and out all right easy he never locks the place up i know right where he keeps everything the chances are hed never know that anyone had been there swell well that settles that then he got up and put his glass on the table now im going to be tied up right until about five i got to keep right on top of this deal you know keep in touch with everything thats happening so ill just run along now and you can come in later come in said fay hows he going to get there you think im going to be stuck out here without a car why not i said what do you want with a car what do you think stupid i want to take the tires off and make myself a girdle but why shes right kid uncle bud broke in hastily everythings going to be jake but still the little ladyll feel a lot easier with a car i know i would so you come in with me i guessed i probably would too anyway with fay dead set on keeping the car there was no use in arguing about it i ran over to the garage and got my coat and tie he was waiting in his car for me when i came down and we started for the city hed dumped the station wagon with a salvage dealer pal of his he said a guy that bought hot cars and wrecked them for their parts of course he went on casually he hadnt been able to get any money for it only a few bucks that is the guy was just trying to be friendly yknow just being a pal so it wouldnt have been right to take money from him i grinned to myself kind of embarrassed for him for uncle bud i mean kind of ashamed for him here he was about to pull down a hundred thousand dollars his share of the ransom and he couldnt pass up the smallest chance to chisel someone it was the way he was made hed rather chisel a dollar than earn a hundred thats the way i am kid he continued i play straight with my pals and i like to have them play straight with me like take us for example now weve had our little spats and misunderstandings maybe but they dont amount to nothing we all like and trust each other were pals yknow everythings on the up and up with us with no one holding out anything on another one he paused studying me slyly out of the corner of his eyes i didnt say anything and he went on now take that little yarn you told me kid i was kind of hurt at the time but i know you were just joking why hell you wouldnt have passed that card i gave you to someone else youd be afraid the party might ask you some questions try to cut himself in maybe thats right aint it he laughed and nudged me with his elbow you were just having a little joke with your old uncle bud i shrugged i still didnt say anything well he said his laugh trailing off what about it kid what about it i said well uh what i was saying dammit i said you wouldnt have done it because youd be afraid that that he broke off abruptly his face falling oh he said the guy aint in a position to ask questions huh or maybe you promised him a nice piece of change i shrugged again he was doing a lot better with the answers than i could but thats not giving me a fair shake kid suppose something happens thats not my fault i play it straight with you but someone else pulls something and this guy cracks down on me i still didnt say anything he looked at me uncertainly you wouldnt put me on a spot like that kid youre a guy that likes to play fair and youd have seen it wasnt fair you didnt do it did you i smiled at him he waited a moment and then he grumbled something under his breath and for the rest of the ride he didnt have much to say either it was twothirty when he pulled up at a bar on the edge of the business district he said hed pick me up there in a couple hours and i got out and went in it was a dingy dimly lit place with a bar and lunch counter up front and a few pool tables in the back there were only a couple of customers and they drifted out while i was having a sandwich and some beer i bought another beer picked up an afternoon newspaper from the counter and went over to a booth there was a big picture of the boy on the front page there were pictures of his parents and the playground matron and the chauffeur practically everyone that could be tied into the case in any way and just about the whole paper was filled with news of the kidnaping or i should say stories about it because they hadnt been able to dig up much of anything new a ransom note had been received the kidnapers had demanded a quarter of a million dollars for the boys return how where and when the money was to be paid had not been revealed the details were a secret between the police and the family and of course uncle bud i went through the stories carefully making sure that i didnt miss anything i took them apart word by word and they still added up to nothing but for me it was a kind of uncomfortable nothing the cops wouldnt reveal the details about the ransom payment but there could be more than one reason for that it could be that they just didnt know any to reveal uncle bud said that they did hed said that the family had shown them the ransom note to make sure that they wouldnt accidently mix up in the case get in the way of the payoff you know and endanger the boys life that sounded reasonable enough because the boy wasnt to be released until twentyfour hours after the money had been paid the cops might grab the guy at the payoff but it was likely to get the boy killed if they did so so it sounded reasonable it was the way uncle bud had planned things the way hed explained them to fay and me and everything seemed to be going according to plan so perhaps everything was okay but i was beginning to have some doubts it was uncle buds job to pick up the money it was his job to keep track of what the police knew and if they didnt know how or where or when the ransom was to be paid if they were cooperating because they had to it made a nice setup for him or even if the cops did know it was still just about as nice if they werent ready to cooperate yet hed just wait until they were and only he knew exactly when that would be only he knew how much time the vanderventers had been given to come across hed told fay and me it was seventytwo hours but it could be less he could collect the dough one night tomorrow night say and be out of the country the next morning i got another beer and brought it over to the booth i wondered how if he was planning a fast one i could head him off demand to pick up the money myself uhuh i guessed not he could send me into a police trap then while i was getting bumped off he could grab the money and skip he wouldnt need to worry about that friend of mine then that friend couldnt make him any more trouble than i could fay should i wise her up see if we could work out something together uhuh again she might be in on uncle buds scheme she might have plans of her own anyway and regardless of whether she was on the level with me or not it wasnt safe to tell her anything not after shed turned on me like she had not with her boozing like she was she might do something crazy and dangerous just for the hell of it i didnt know what i should do hell i didnt even know whether i should even be thinking about doing anything everything was working out like wed planned wasnt it the only thing that had really changed was me my mind i was getting so confused and mixedup that nothing looked straight to me and any little thing made me suspicious anything or nothing if things went one way i didnt like them and if they went another way i didnt like them and and it had to stop if it didnt if people didnt stop worrying me coming at me from every direction pushing and crowding and a band seemed to tighten around my head i closed my eyes and for a moment i just wasnt there there was nothing but blackness with me floating away on it after a while the band got looser and the blackness faded away i gulped down the rest of the beer fast and in a minute or two i was all right again or as right as i was going to be i lighted a cigarette i heard the screen door slam and i started to peer out of the booth then i jerked my head back and raised the newspaper up in front of my face because it was uncle bud all right hed come right on the dot of fourthirty but he had someone with him bert uncle bud was in front bert was walking right on his heels kind of moving him along with his body the bartender glanced at them casually and went back to polishing glasses uncle bud was looking straight ahead his face a white blur in the dimness and bert was looking straight at the back of uncle buds neck they passed down the length of the bar they went down the long lane at the side of the pool tables they reached the rear of the place and uncle bud stopped in front of the rest room door bert nudged him he said something to him gave him another nudge uncle bud opened the door bert shoved him through it and went in after him i was on my feet the moment the door closed i carried my beer bottle over to the bar took a step or two toward the front door then turned around and headed back toward the rear just short of the rest room i turned and glanced behind me the bartender was still at his glasspolishing no one else had come in i hurried on walking on the balls of my feet and paused outside the rest room door keeping an eye on the bartender listening cheatin bastard bert was saying thought id never catch up with you huh well im the last guy youll ever chisel im gonna naw naw bbert uncle bud gave a kind of stuttering gasp you got to listen to me you got to give me a little time jjust give me no there was a click a knife coming open and a slow scuffing of feet as i imagined bert moved toward him and uncle bud backed away naw naw he gasped again a little time bbert jjust give me a little time an youll get every penny i swear it bb i eased the door open a crack saw that berts back was toward me i pulled it open a little further watching him watching that long sharp knife in his hand ill give you somethin the blade trembled and he grunted for emphasis ill give you all the time in the world and the next one too you rotten chiseling noaccount sonofabitch he brought the knife up suddenly uncle bud sort of moaned and sobbed then i threw the door back and went in bert didnt have time to turn around i had one all set for him a hard right hook and he got it in the back of the neck the knife flew out of his hand he pitched forward striking his head on the stained iron urinal then fell sprawling facedown to the floor uncle bud sagged against the wall pawing the sweat from his white face he looked down at bert straightened up suddenly and kicked him as hard as he could in the head going to give it to me were you he spat well damn you ill he aimed another kick i shoved him back against the wall then grabbed him by the arm and hustled him toward the door come on come on dammit weve got to get out of here bbut he tried to hang back he was going to kill me you saw him kid hhe was goin to he took a deep shuddering breath and the glaze went out of his eyes yeah he said yeah sure kid we got out of there a few blocks away we stopped at another bar and he put down a couple of fast drinks he needed them he had the shakes so bad that you could almost hear him rattle hell kid he said as we drove away from the place i never got such a scare in my life i didnt dare turn my head to see if you were there i was afraid maybe youd stepped out for a few minutes yeah whered he pick you up anyway thats what i dont know thats what gave me such a jolt id parked my car and was just starting through the door of the joint and there the murdering sonofabitch was right behind me with that knife in my back hell he seemed to come from nowhere it was like hed dropped down out of the sky then he could have been tagging you around for quite a while he could have been but it doesnt seem likely it looks like id have spotted him if he had no i figure he must have just been there in the neighborhood and he picked me up when i got out of the car he shook his head stared frowning through the windshield i hope it was that way anyhow i mean that he just happened to bump into me accidentally id sure hate to think that i nodded id have hated to think it too i didnt care about uncle bud particularly because a guy like he was a guy that had taken everyone he could that had caused all the misery he must have caused was long overdue for the cemetery but this would be a bad time for him to go there and hed be going there pretty fast if things were like they might be i wonder he said worriedly i know a hell of a lot of people and it could be that hes buddies with some of the same ones he might have someone keeping an eye on me several people maybe tipping him off every time they run into me anywhere why hell it could be and i wouldnt know it all the people ive met had dealings with yknow i dont always remember em myself he was getting the shakes all over again i told him there was probably nothing to worry about after all bert had been gunning for him for quite a while but he hadnt caught up with him until today it was just an accident i said he just happened to be in that neighborhood at the same time you were if he had any help hedve tagged you before this well he hesitated well maybe it kind of looks that way dont it of course he may be just now deciding to crack down its been quite a while since i skinned him since we had this little misunderstanding i mean what about that bar i said are you in there every day kind of on schedule you mean uhuh not me kid not your old uncle bud he winked at me grinning i dont do things that way i move around even with living quarters i dont keep any of em more than a few weeks no one knew you were going to be there at the bar today you didnt mention it to anyone uhuh not a soul well i may have mentioned it to fay but no one else yeah kid he pushed his hat back began to relax i guess its like you say it was just one of them things just an accident i had a hunch that it wasnt that someone had tipped bert off and that someone would tip him off again that theyd keep doing it until bert managed to nail him but it was only a hunch uncle bud was jumpy enough already and we still had things to do it was almost five oclock when we stopped at a drug store a few blocks from doc goldmans house i sat down at the counter and bought a coke while he put in the phony call from a booth phone he came out of the booth paused at my side a moment okay kid he fell for it ill be back for you as soon as he leaves he drove off about ten minutes later when i was finishing my second coke he pulled up in front again he gave me a sharpeyed look as i climbed into the car you look pretty peaked kid how you holding up with all this anyway all right im all right well uh isnt all this nervous strain and excitement pretty hard on you i know youre not really cra i mean youve just got a little nervous trouble but dont count on it i turned around in the seat and stared at him dont try to force me into it because if i do crack up it wont be nice for anyone around me aah now kid he looked hurt aint we pals didnt you save my life today im all right im going to go right on being all right and no one had better try to trim me or doublecross me sure sure kid he said hastily i was just concerned for you was all he let me out in front of docs place and headed back to the drug store to wait for me i took a quick glance around and started up the walk the house was on the outskirts of the city i guess i mentioned that before there were two vacant lots between his house and the next one and there were no houses at all on the other side of the street i could be seen of course the people in that nearest place could see me if they happened to look that way but if they did i guessed they wouldnt think anything of it theyd be used to seeing people come and go from docs house id be just one more another patient i went up the steps and across the porch then i opened the door and went in that was the reception room there the room the door opened into the living quarters were on through to the rear and his office and lab were on the right i looked around and everything looked just as i remembered it the chairs sitting around the wails the little table stacked with magazines the rug in the middle of the carpet to cover up a worn spot the dimestore ash trays the i couldnt go any further for a minute i just had to stand there looking feeling kind of good safe and comforted in one way and pretty lousy in another it was like coming home and pulling some dirty trick but i had to do it i was doing it for the boy not myself so i crossed the reception room and opened the office door and bumped smack into doc goldman he had his hat on hed been coming through the door from the other side and he was just about as startled as i was which was plenty believe me i tried to speak to smile but my mouth seemed to be in a knot i didnt know what in the hell to do and all i could think of was that hed caught me redhanded right in the act of breaking in on him i backed up a step i mumbled something god only knows what and i was just about to turn and run but by then he was over his start collie collie my friend he grabbed my hand and wrung it im sorry i didnt hear you come in i got a flat on my car right around the corner and i just ran back to call a cab oh i began to breathe easier for a moment id thought that uncle bud had tried to trick me well if youre going out no no itll take a few minutes for the cab to get here how have you been anyway come on in the lab and let me get a look at you he herded me into the laboratory made me lie down on the examination table he went on talking asking questions as he took my pulse and rested his hand on my forehead i said that i was still living at mrs andersons shed got over the shock of finding out about me and now things were just like they had been well thats fine wonderful i know how it must have seemed to you at the time collie i cant tell you how blue i felt after youd called me im sorry about that i didnt mean any of that stuff i said of course you didnt not that there wasnt a certain amount of truth in it but you understand now dont you collie you see that she had to be told she had to all right but it would have been a lot better if id told her right in the beginning yes well anyway weve got it all over with now havent we now if youll just relax just let yourself go limp he dug his fingers into my biceps he raised one of my arms and shook it watching the movement of my hand then he slid a light refractor onto his head and bent over me pulling the lids back from my eyes uhuh not that way collie look straight at me he stared into first one eye then the other my eyes began to water and he let me rest them for a moment and then he went on staring at last he straightened and took off the refractor he stood frowning down at me slapping the shiny metal disc against the palm of his hand not good collie not good at all youre a lot more tense than you were the first night i met you yeah i mean i am i feel fine like hell you do whats bothering you and dont tell me there isnt anything well i there isnt anything now but there was mrs anderson took what you told her pretty hard shes all right now but i guess im still kind of upset kind of is hardly the phrase for it and it doesnt quite add up for me collie you were very far down in the dumps the pendulum was right at its lowest point even without the situation ending reasonably happy as you indicate it did you should have been on the upswing by this time well anyway its like i told you everything is all right a horn honked in the street his taxi he hesitated fidgeting i guess ill have to run collie but can you wait here for me i shouldnt be gone more than an hour i dont know id sure like to but well mrs anderson drove me into town tonight there was some friends she had to see and i guess ill have to leave whenever she stops back by you tell her to wait for you collie he put his hat back on tell her id like to see her too will you do that the horn honked again i told him i didnt think she could wait shed probably be in a hurry well wait by yourself then ill drive you home myself i cant i mean well i dont think i can you see i i yes he said yes collie and then his expression changed became kind of a noexpression and he turned and started for the door ill have to run now you stay if you can collie he hurried out the front door slammed and a moment later i heard the cab drive off i eased a hand under my right hip i turned carefully grabbing the gun just as it fell to the table the damned thing had slipped when id laid down if doc had shifted me around any hedve seen it i shoved it back into my pocket i boosted myself off the table and went to work on the medicine chest it was a tall steel cabinet with six big drawers and about a dozen little drawers inside of each of the six they were all unlocked the only thing dec locked up was his narcotics and they were in the office safe i took a twocc syringe and a couple of hypodermic needles two in case one got broken i went on looking working fast jerking the drawers in and out until i found the insulin it was the regular type but there were only two vials of it two of those glass unit cc teardrop tubes i hesitated staring down at the little crystalclear tubes then i laid them on the table with the hypodermic syringe and the needles and went back to the cabinet the drawer labels might be haywire dec had a pretty big practice and no one to help him and sometimes he mixed things up i started at the top of the cabinet again and worked down taking it slower this time looking carefully through each drawer i worked from the top to the bottom not missing a bet and then well that was it there was just the twenty ccs there wasnt any more and this would have to do it didnt look like it but it could be more than enough to get the boy out of it and keep him going awhile actually i really didnt know i didnt know a lot of things i got a paper towel from the sink and wrapped the stuff up i left the house worried about getting what seemed so little and worried about taking that little doc was sure to miss it his entire supply all i could hope was that he wouldnt need it any time soon uncle bud was waiting in front of the drug store we started for the house and i told him my doubts it didnt seem to exactly break his heart might not be enough huh well thats sure a shame but you did your best kid we all did our best i looked straight ahead not saying anything he took his hand off the wheel and gave me a little pat on the back now dont you take it to heart kid its too bad sure but these things always work out for the best its like we were saying this morning you know we sure dont want that nice little boy to die but it might not be too bad for us if he did yeah thats right isnt it i guess that kind of slipped my mind why sure so cheer up huh he gave me a nudge this may be a good break of course well hope thisll be enough well we cant be sure that it wont be i said it might just do it it might keep him alive for another couple of days anyway maybe a lot longer i dont know yeah but you said i said hed probably need more in his condition im not sure thisll even halfway put him back on his feet but it could keep him alive until after we get the money well he shrugged so we got nothing to worry about either way have we i nodded shook my head and it looked to me like hed said a lot in that last sentence fay might want the boy dead or she might want him to live i didnt know which but uncle bud hed given himself away he wanted to keep fay and me satisfied to keep us from doing anything that would upset the apple cart aside from that he didnt care what happened to the boy and there was just one reason why he didnt he was going to skip with the money when the storm broke hed be a long way off or anyway he thought he would the boy was conscious but he was awfully weak his kidneys had been moving all day trying to get rid of the sugar that his system couldnt burn he was too weak to even whisper i asked him how he felt and his lips moved a little but no words came out uncle bud had left he just couldnt be around anything like this he said anyone getting a needle stuck in them it made him sick to his stomach and anyway he had things to do in town using a fork i lifted a needle from the pan of water boiling on the stove then i fitted it to the hypodermic syringe and jabbed it into the rubbercapped tip of one of the cc vials i pulled back the plunger carefully the syringe held two ccs and i wasnt sure of the minimum dosage for a sevenyearold child a mighty sick one at that but i figured he needed a good jolt stifi giving him too much at one time could be bad even fatal i remembered from the mental hospitals that one cubic centimeter was equal to units the label on the tubes said this was unit regular insulin i knew this had to do with the concentration but well i had to admit it i was scared and confused but i had to go through with it and hope for the best i lifted the boys limp arm and fay who had been watching from the doorway frowned thats not right is it ive always gotten shots in the left arm i shook my head not answering her concentrating on the boy he gave a little jump when the needle went in fay jumped too standing right behind me and of course that gave me a start i gave him the full two centimeters more than id meant to but then id been startled i took out the needle and waited i watched his face carefully for a reaction but there was none so i refilled the syringe with another two ccs inserted the needle into his arm and gave him more he jumped and she jumped and i jumped i put the needle down looked at the boy and now there was a definite reaction he shuddered suddenly took a long shivering breath his face turned red and he burst out all over with sweat he really felt that one i was elated that hed come out of it overcome with doubts that id given him an overdose and then suddenly confident that i knew what i was doing it was like it should have been like it often was as i remembered and i knew just what to do about it but i didnt get the chance id just snatched up the bowl of thick sugarwater and started to spoon it down the boy when fay yelled and knocked it out of my hand you dont know what youre doing youre crazy you you i jumped up and grabbed her by the shoulders but i know what youre doing and now youre through doing it i shoved her out of the room i ran her backwards through the doorway and slammed her down hard in a chair now stay there if you foul me up again ill ill i raced into the kitchen threw together another bowl of sugar and water i ran back into the bedroom with it mixing it on the way and began feeding it to the boy it was all he needed something to cushion the shock of the insulin i held him up with one arm shoving the sugar into him as fast as i could move the spoon his breathing eased there were no more of those shuddering gasps it leveled off became even and effortless the sweating stopped and the red went out of his face i lowered him to the pillow he looked up at me wideeyed stffl scared naturally frightened at being here and lonesome for his own home but feeling a lot better feeling so much better than he had that he couldnt help smiling feebly i smiled back at him his eyes drifted shut and he fell asleep i stayed there with him a while watching to see if there was a delayed reaction there wasnt any though so i turned off the light and went into the living room fay was right where ihad put her i fixed myself a drink and sat down hes all right you can go in and look at him if you want to i can huh fay looked grim hes all right and hes going to stay that way i it just makes good sense fay you ought to see that the better he is when he gets back to his folks the better itll be for us she grimaced her hand went out for the whiskey bottle and tilted it over her glass when she said dully you mean if dont you then before i could answer her how long is that stuff you gave him going to last long enough i think it will anyhow sure you think but you dont know do you all you know is that weve got him on our hands a kid thats liable to go on us at any time a kid thats got his picture in every paper in the country we cant beat it with him and we cant leave without him we just have to sit here hanging onto a keg of dynamite and hope that lightning wont strike us have you got any better ideas skip it forget it ill be screwy myself if i talk to you much longer i went out into the kitchen and made a couple of sandwiches i ate one of them and carried the other back into the living room she watched me as i began to eat then laughed a kind of tired laugh poor collie they may hang him but hell fill his stomach first with food i said pointedly mmm she frowned then she laughed again very good too damned good it was things like that that sort of thing that threw me off you were so sharp sometimes that i didnt see how yeah never mind thats the way it was this is the way it is i dont know what the doctor told you about me i said exactly what but id like to know then ill fill you in on the important points he told me that with the right kind of environment and the right kind of associates youd be all right you were well on the road to recovery and youd soon be at the end of it on the other hand she hesitated on the other hand well why bother with the rest of it the unreasoning suspicion the verydangerousifaroused part lets just say that its my fault and im sorry but that doesnt change anything i cant let it change anything look fay if i just knew what you wanted if youd just talk straight maybe i could ditto double ditto you might say since your background is considerably more ominous potentially than mine no she held up a hand lets dont keep hashing it over because it gets a little messier each time and i get a little sorrier for you just tell me one thing if you can how long are you absolutely sure the boy will last without proper medical treatment i gave him proper treatment maybe you dont think so but now dont go touchy on me collie you know what i mean so answer the question well with the insulin i gave him and the way it took hold hes sure to be all right for another twentyfour hours you sound so positive i had fooled her with my confident air so i ignored her remark he can eat something tomorrow and thatll help a poached egg maybe a little lean meat and some milk she nodded leaned back in her chair yawning excuse me its not the whiskey but the company why dont you take yourself off doctor i think theyre calling for you in the annex i said i guessed i would turn in i was pretty tired and the boy should sleep soundly for the rest of the night she looked at me absently not saying anything so i carried my plate out into the kitchen and left quite a breeze had sprung up and it was actually kind of cold but i left the front window of the apartment open it faced on the driveway and if she started the car or if anyone came up the lane id be sure to hear it i well i just didnt know you see i didnt know why anyone might be coming up there or why she might try to drive off i didnt know what might happen or why so i just had to try to look out for everything i undressed i started to slide the gun under my pillow but then i thought that might be something else to look out for she knew i kept it there so maybe id better put it some place else i looked around finally i pulled the reading stand a little closer to the bed laid the gun on top of it and covered it with an opened magazine that looked natural enough like id been reading the magazine and laid it down open to hold my place i could reach the gun as fast as if it was under my pifiow i turned off the light and went to bed i fell alseep right away thirty minutes later i waked up still dead tired but too tense to relax i got a drink of water and smoked a couple cigarettes afterwards i dozed a little and then came awake again restless and uneasy my nerves drawn into a knot my mind going around and around uncle bud i knew what he was going to pull so what was i going to do about it how was i going to stop him i knew i had to even if didnt know why i had to but i had no idea how to go about it he was there in my mind there was a big picture of him there hat pushed back on his smooth gray head an easy smile on his face his eyes warm and friendly i could see him as plain as day hear his soft restful voice i concentrated and i could hear him talking about about i listened carefully clearing my mind of everything but him and the words came through at last about the ransom payoff he told me about it all over again patiently beaming at me and all the time laughing to himself yeah i know kid thats the way its usually done and thats the way so many guys get knocked off they go way to hell out in the country somewhere and they fix it up so the money will be thrown out of a car or some deal like that they think theyre safe because theres no one else around but thats just why they aint safe how do they know whats off in the woods or behind a hill how do they know the whole damned area aint been staked out you see what i mean kid they actually give the cops a setup if theres no one around but one guy that guy has to be it so we wont do it that way i wont the way ill work it the money would be left at the railroad station checkroom for a mr whitcomb a messenger ordered by telephone would be sent to pick it up it would be in a plain suitcase there would be plenty of other people around in the station coming and going from the checkroom carrying suitcases exactly like it the cops would have a job keeping track of one of them theyd be almost sure to give themselves away if they tried if they did though if they did follow that plainclothes messenger they wouldnt catch uncle bud he knew a stumblebum a wino with a criminal record the guy would do anything for a few bucks no questions asked and the suitcase would be delivered to him at this flophouse he lived in if nothing happened after about an hour unde bud would pick it up if something did happen if the cops grabbed the guy well it was just too bad for him hed be caught with the evidence hed talk of course but he couldnt prove anything uncle bud would just say that the guy was lying and that would be that no uncle bud wasnt taking any chances on anything chances were for the other guy me hed already let me take them all and now he was going to take all the money he was there in my mind smiling and explaining and laughing at me all set to take the money my money and laughing about it laughing laughing laughing and there had to be some way i had to find some way to stop him somehow i went to sleep it was late when i waked up around noon i saw what time it was and i jumped out of bed fast kind of frightened feeling that something was wrong that someone must have pulled something on me all those hours id been asleep i looked under the magazine and that was all right the gun was right where i had left it the door was all right too stifi closed tight like id left it with a chair hooked under the knob i looked out the window pulling on my pants the car hadnt been moved it stood in exactly the same spot as it had last night there was no one coming up the lane and everything seemed the way it should be no someone was coming fay she was coming out of the house carrying a coffee tray she was coming toward the garage and she was dressed as she had been a few mornings ago the day that dec goldman had called her and everything had started going to pieces bare legs bare shoulders ivorycolored in the sunlight tan shorts curved to the curves of her thighs and the thin white blouse drawn tight straining softly with the flesh beneath it she saw me staring at her and smiled she paused beneath the window looked up smiling and if last nights whiskey had left any marks on her i sure didnt notice she looked just as fresh and beautiful as she had that other morning her eyes were as sparkling and crystal clear as i remembered her hair had that same soft brushedshiny look and her face was the same roseandwhite softness everything was the same it was like that other morning all over again as though it was still that morning and everything since then had been a bad dream well she smiled up at me like to have some i nodded or shook my head or something i managed to mumble that i did some coffee i mean she said and then she laughed and started toward the steps i let her into the room and set the tray down for her i acted tried to act just like she did friendly and joking and laughing but i figured that there must be something wrong that she just about had to be working up to some kind of trick so i gave her a good chance a chance that looked good to spring it i excused myself and went into the bathroom i turned on the water in the sink and then i tiptoed back to the door on my bare feet and peered out through a crack fay was still in her chair several feet away from the bed i watched for a couple of minutes thinking and hoping that she wouldnt thinking that shed look under the pillow for the gun that shed do some more fast looking when she didnt find it there getting the gun was just about the only thing she could be up to and if she didnt try for it then what was she up to she didnt she stayed there in the chair one bare leg crossed over the other kind of humming to herself i washed and went back into the room she poured two cups of coffee and handed me one the boy seemed to be feeling fine she said very lively hed eaten two poached eggs and a glass of milk he wanted to get up but i wouldnt let him i thought he should stay in bed dont you i nodded and i thought that maybe he was the reason for this with him feeling pretty good why she wasnt so worried anymore she was feeling pretty good herself i frowned not realizing that i did just thinking so hard you know thinking and hoping that things might really be like they looked she frowned too a sort of shamed expression crossing her face shamed and kind of doubtful and then she smiled again yes collie yes my pugilist apollo well i hesitated well i was just wondering and i and i dont seem to be able to explain i suppose she paused and shrugged i suppose i said it all in the beginning im just a crazy mixedup neurotic anyone who drinks as i do for as long as i have is bound to be pretty shaky in the cerebrum he she i should say was an unstable character to begin with and the booze makes her a lot worse than she was it takes very little to throw her out of kilter very little and what ive taken in these past few days has been somewhat more than a little so she put her coffee cup down she glanced at me took my cup and put it down with hers so she said so collie i nodded that i understood and i thought i did pretty well those institutions have a lot of alcoholic inmates no one can be nicer or smarter than they are when theyve leveled off and no one can be as downright onery and crazy when theyre in a bad way lets see she tilted her head to one side didnt we have a date a few mornings ago did we or not collie do you remember fay i i words fail you huh she laughed softly well lets hope it isnt symptomatic of any physical weakness now if youll just step into the bathroom the the bathroom i stammered that small room you were in a moment ago the one with the concave furniture i got up and went into the bathroom i heard her draw the shade and i started to jerk the door open then i saw what she was doing and i stayed where i was until she called to me her shoes were on the floor beside a chair her blouse was on the chair and so were the shorts she was lying on the bed her black hair spread out on the pillow she held out her arms to me there are some things you cant fake you cant pretend about and thats one of them a person wants you that way or she doesnt and you always know which and i knew which it was with her the want was there there wasnt a second of pretense in that long hour we were together so even if fay had a reason and of course she did for allowing the want to take over there wasnt any faking afterwards that was genuine if nothing else was now she was gone shed dressed and gone over to the house to see how the boy was and i stayed there on the bed because she was coming back in a few minutes she was just going to look in on the boy she wanted to check to see if uncle bud had been calling and then shed be back shed be back there with me any minute now wed be together again fay and i would be together and this time wed talk things out id find out how she really felt about the boy whether she didnt really feel like i did that if we could get him back to his family safe and sound nothing else would matter much we wouldnt have to give ourselves up although there was a good chance that the cops would catch up with us in time we could just leave the boy here say or leave him some place where hed be comfortable and safe then we could beat it and send back word where to find him that would fix uncle bud keeping him from getting money if we did get caught finally things would sure go a lot easier on us wed done something pretty bad but if we did our best to straighten it out of course it wouldnt be our best that way what we ought to do was call the cops right now give up without waiting to be caught but i didnt think that i could go that far and i was positive that she couldnt a person that drinks a lot is always frightened they may act just the opposite tough and hard like they dont give a damn for anything but inside theyre scared they have too much imagination everything is magnified in their minds made a hundred times worse than it actually is and a thing like this facing a kidnaping rap was plenty scary without any magnifying so wed just do the best we were capable of if she felt like i did if that was what she wanted like id told her the boy was sure to be all right for a day we could leave him here or someplace else then beat it and tip off the cops where he was we didnt have much money i didnt have any and she couldnt have a great deal but wed get by some way and the boy would be all right right now nothing else seemed to matter much i lighted a cigarette and lay down again wondering just how i could work around to the subject hoping that she would bring it up first wishing i wasnt still suspicious of her and that she wasnt of me because of course she was and i was there hadnt been much between us but suspicion and distrust these last few days it couldnt all be wiped away in an hour even right now i guessed if she should make the proposition to me suggest doing what i wanted to do id be a little leery of it id think she was just trying to test me out find out what i was thinking so that she could make sure i didnt go through with it and if i felt that uneasy about her she was bound to feel the same way about me only a hell of a lot more so i was a mental case i was an escapee from an insane asylum a psycho with a gun an expug who could do plenty without a gun if he took a notion i was that and she was the other a kind of mental case herself unstable always afraid inside trying to drown the fear in booze and always having it float to the top stronger than ever it would be hard for her to talk straight with me probably it would be just about impossible shed done just about all she could i guess toward breaking the ice the rest would be up to me and how i was going to go about it i didnt know but i figured that it ought to be a lot easier after what had happened she must think a lot of me or she wouldnt have done it fay had to care didnt she or did she she hadnt been faking but maybe that didnt mean that she really cared shed been batting around on her own a long time drinking so much she didnt know what she was doing or not giving a damn if she did know hanging out in joints like berts getting on close terms with guys like bert and uncle bud a woman like that but fay wasnt a woman like that like it seemed she might be she wasnt cheap shoddy whatever else she was she wasnt that even if this was some kind of a trick and i sure hoped that it wasnt for her sake and mine because a guy like me you sure never want to try to trick him for one thing you probably wont get away with it hes watching for it hes thought of every angle you might try to play you make just one little move toward one of them and hes in there ahead of you moving in fast on you he wont take any explanations if youre smart you wont try to give him any you tricked him tried to take advantage of him thats all he sees and about all you can do from then on is to keep out of his way if you can if hell let you for hell never completely trust you again hell be watching you closer than ever and if you take one little step in the wrong direction or even look like you are youll never take another one id already had a fast one or two pulled on me i was already damned watchful i didnt want to be i wanted to be able to trust fay but i just couldnt help it so i sure hoped this wasnt some kind of a trick i heard the kitchen door slam i pulled the shade back and glanced out the window she was coming across the yard she had a dress on and she was walking pretty fast and yet she seemed to be sort of dragging her feet hanging back as though she was working against herself forcing herself forward i felt the tension coming back i sat up and began putting on my clothes shoving the gun into my hip pocket i heard her coming up the stairs i reached for my shoes and started putting them on as she opened the door she came in she looked at me her face stiff her eyes nervous and frightened i straightened up and stared at her whats up collie i i she hesitated took a deep breath i just talked with uncle bud collie yeah i he thinks wed better come over there right away i ccalled him and thats what he said collie i nodded i finished tying my shoelaces and stood up she backed away a step go on why does uncle bud think wed better come over there right away dont you think maybe id better know her eyes wavered her face twitched as she tried to smile back at me and then i guess she saw that i wasnt smiling that it just looked like a smile she backed away another step youd better watch out i said youll be out the door in a minute you might fall over the banister and break your neck fay looked over her shoulder quickly she looked back at me lips trembling her face getting whiter than ever i wondered how shed ever gotten up the nerve to try this even to get this far with the trick she was pulling and knowing how frightened she was i guess i should have liked and admired her for trying but i didnt what i felt toward her was anything but liking and admiration go on youre not afraid to tell me are you fay after all two people as close as us sweethearts i guess youd call us they shouldnt be afraid of each other a touch of red came into her face she took another deep breath hesitated and then at last she got it out the boy ccollie hes run away i nodded and gave her a smile a smile that wasnt one i said that well there wasnt anything to get too excited about the shape the boy was in he couldnt have gone very far he was probably over in the house hiding somewhere nno fay shook her head i looked before i called uncle bud well let me look well look together stay nice and close together you know so that if one of us sees something he can point it out to the other b but thats what well do and well do it right now i took her by the arm pushed her through the door we went down the steps across the yard and into the house we started going through the rooms with me talking and kind of joking and fay stammering and answering me in almost a whisper well his clothes are gone it sure looks like he dressed himself and ran off collie weve got to yes sir thats just the way it looks and it looks like he probably did it when you were over there with me when we were both pretty busy with the shades pulled and we werent paying much attention to anything for about an hour thats when it happened it looks like i grinned at her i let go of her arm suddenly let go with a jerk that jerked her shoulder weve got to leave collie hes had plenty of time to get to the highway he wouldnt get that far im sure of it and so is uncle bud otherwise he wouldnt be coming anywhere near here b but uncle bud thinks the same thing that i do that hes passed out somewhere right around here hes got to that place some nice secluded spot where no one can see him and thats as far as hell go thats what uncle bud thinks and i got a hunch its what you think no aaah no collie i wouldnt i told you i told you that boy had to stay alive and i told you why he had to stay alive now where is he where did you leave him i i she shook her head is that what you think of me ddo you really think id do that to him and for a moment i wavered for a moment i could almost see why shed done it and why shed done it in this way fay was afraid she wasnt sure of what i wanted to do so shed tried to take the decision out of my hands shed hidden the boy left him where hed be safe until she could get word to the cops then shed told me hed run away so that wed have to run it was the only thing she could do as she looked at it it was practically the same thing that id been thinking about doing so so ihad it all figured out almost we were on the same side of the fence we both wanted the boy to get back to his parents thats the way i figured the way i thought it was but with a thing like this a guy like me figuring and thinking werent enough i needed fay to tell me just to come right out with the truth without any tricks or hedging around it was all shedve had to do and she didnt do it she was too frightened too anxious and when a persons that way they almost always do the wrong thing and what she did was the worst thing she could possibly have done shed just hit me with one trick now while i was still rocking from it fighting to hang onto myself because i thought so much of her now she hit me with another one collie she forced herself to smile lets be nice hmm lets llets lie down a while get all nice and calm so we can talk aand fay came toward me holding onto the smile forcing herself every inch of the way her hand went up to the shoulder of her dress tugged at it shakily and slowly slid it down she hesitated than pleading mutely with her eyes blushing shamed despite the fear then she took hold of the other shoulder and slid it down and waited sshall we collie she was almost against me what do you think i sneered and swung with my open hand fay screamed and staggered backwards doubled over and clutching at her breasts she bumped into a chair and screamed again then she fell down on the sofa sat there moaning rocking back and forth that was just a sample try something like that again and ill really clobber you yyou fay gasped you you the rocking stopped she raised her head slowly and looked up at me i want you to know i want you to remember i warned you im going to kill you for that maybe maybe you will but right now youre going to do something else fast and no maybe she didnt argue about it fay pulled her dress back up and led the way down through the trees we came to the culvert that ran under the lane she nodded and stood back and i got down and lifted him out i didnt know whether he was just unconscious from the exertion or whether hed been slugged but there was a big bruise on the right side of his forehead i looked down at it at him so little and so limp in my arms and then i looked at her and if id had my hands free just then well it was a good thing for her that i didnt have we went back to the house and i put the boy down on the sofa fay stood watching kind of defiantly as i sponged his face and forehead with cold water he came to and whispered that he felt ffine when i asked him i guessed that he wasnt really hurt just weak and frightened by so many things he couldnt understand most of the bruise turned out to be dirt he had a little knot there on his forehead but the biggest part of it what id thought was bruise washed off well fay sloshed whiskey into a glass gulped it i guess i missed that time didnt i i didnt hit him hard enough what happened did you fall down with him did i she reached for the bottle again youve got all the answers you tell me whether i did or not i guess you probably did you do huh youd actually give me a break well shove it bright boy i hit him get me i slugged him as hard as i could with a big rock and if id had more time idve beat his brains out i told her to quiet down shed disturb the boy fay yelled that she didnt give a damn if she did disturb him why the hell should i didnt i try to kill him well didnt i you rotten mean hateful sonofabitch sure i did thats the kind of a dame i am i meant to kill him i tried to i did i did i did and i knew that she hadnt i knew it in my heart but still it was easy to believe that she had fay looked twenty years older haggard and vicious her eyes glaring crazily she was all crazy meanness and viciousness drained dry of everything else and it was easy to believe shed do anything i told her to shut up she yelled all the louder backing away as i moved toward her shed never said anything dirty before sharp and ornery maybe but never dirty but now she cut loose and the names she called me the things she said well ive heard some rough talk but never anything as bad as that some of the words but never all at one time no one had ever called me one of them without losing some teeth the red haze gathered in front of me i had to get rid of it let off steam some way because if i didnt id kill her so i started yelling myself i shouted back at her cursing calling her names i yelled and she yelled and how long it went on i dont know everything was a screaming red haze yells and filth and redness and how long it lasted i dont know but it was long enough long enough for him to stop his car in the drive to come up the walk and onto the back porch whether he knocked i dont know we wouldnt have known with the noise we were making probably he did knock then just walked right on in like doctors do we heard the screen door slam and that brought us up short the room went completely silent but by then he was right on top of us hed heard it all and of course hed seen the boy he sauntered forward casually winked at me and smiled at fay mrs anderson isnt it im doctor goldman hhow her mouth twisted how do you do doctor i just dropped in for a moment im due at the office now but i happened to be out this way and his voice trailed off and he nodded toward the boy your son collie didnt tell me you had any children its her nephew i said hes just visiting here for a couple of days i see fine looking boy a little under the weather is he he strolled over to the sofa and sat down still acting casual acting as though he hadnt heard the racket we were making as though he didnt know exactly who the boy was not feeling too well eh sonny never mind you dont need to talk lets see if i dont have something to he opened his medicine kit snapped it shut again no i guess not i remember i was looking for some this morning before i left the office he bent over the boy a minute or two longer afraid to look around i guess nerving himself for what he was going to do then he stood up carelessly and picked up the kit he could do with a b shot he said you might mention it to his mother id give him one but i havent any with me aall right fay shot a glance at me thank you doctor dont mention it just sorry i couldnt do something for him he smiled and nodded to us or to be more exact to the space between us then he moved toward the doorway looking at the floor just ahead of him making a big business out of buttoning his coat he paused looking down he went a couple of steps further and came to another stop i watched him silently then crossed in front of him outside the wind rustled the dead grass and the curtains swirled away from the windows they fell back softly flattening against the screens and in the kitchen the clock ticked off the seconds fays breath went out in a sigh doc looked up his eyes wavered at first then they steadied and held mine how did it happen collie how could you have done it i shook my head i didnt really know how it had happened it seemed simple enough taken step by step but i couldnt explain now and explaining wouldnt change anything get out of the way he ordered do you hear me collie stand out of the doorway at once i shook my head again waiting for him to make the first move wishing hed get it over with so that i could do what i had to you dont know what youre doing collie im sure mrs anderson cant realize what shes doing someone has duped you into this theyre using you for their own criminal purposes it doesnt make any difference dec youre not going anywhere were leaving and youre going to stay no collie you cant he bit his lip looked at fay cant i appeal to you mrs anderson cant you understand make him understand fay i said were leaving get together anything you want to take and go on out to the car i stared into his eyes waiting and watching fay circled around behind him and went into her bedroom there was another gust of wind the grass rustled again and the curtains swirled and in the kitchen the clock ticked off the seconds well doc said well he shrugged i suppose if thats the way it has to be he turned then he whirled suddenly hurled the medicine kit and dived for the door i ducked and swung all in one motion i pulled the punch but it landed right on the button docs head snapped back his knees buckled and i had to catch him to keep him from falling i picked him up and carried him into the bedroom his answering service knew that hed come here they phoned just as i finished binding and gagging him with his own adhesive tape i told them he wouldnt get back to the office today he was tied up on an emergency and they were to check here again in the morning fay was already waiting in the car i put the boy down on the floor in the rear got in with him and we drove off fast down the lane and into the highway headed for uncle buds place rushing toward the end uncle bud kept on the move switching from one place to another but i guess that every place he lived would always be just about like the others it would have the same features it would be a dump because he was tight with his money because he seldom stayed at home if he had any place else to go it would be fairly close in a place he could circulate from easily it would be a place youd probably never find by yourself one hed have to tell you how to find this one the place we went to that day when everything began rushing toward the end was in the citys old business district or on the edge of it i should say fifty years ago it had been the main part of town but then the railroad station had been moved and the highways built around the city instead of passing through it that had put it on the downgrade and now it was about as far down as it could go flop houses twobit hotels cheap bars and greasyspoon restaurants that was about all you saw there now and you didnt see any of them after the first few blocks after that there were just empty buildings or vacant lots where the buildings had been torn down until you came to a bridge a kind of a viaduct it crossed the abandoned railroad rightofway and opened into the abandoned highway right at the foot of it was an old garage building wellbuilt and still in pretty good shape with living quarters on the second floor and that was where uncle bud lived i drove the car into the garage part uncle bud was waiting for us and he led the way upstairs he wasnt at all upset about what had happened it didnt change the picture at all he said not that much kid no sir not even that much everything was working out fine and dandy and wed all be wearing diamonds in another day or two fay went into the bedroom with the boy uncle bud nudged me whispered that i didnt want to be too hard on the little lady she was just jumpy like little ladies got sometimes and it was up to me and him to keep our heads now wasnt it im going to thats just what im going to do uncle bud atta boy youre my kind of people kid now you just sit tight here and ill get you fixed up right i looked him over as he left i gave him another good onceover when he came back and started piling groceries beer and whiskey on the table and i saw that he wasnt packing a gun things were working out real nice for him he thought and there was nothing he needed a gun for well kid he motioned toward the table see anything i overlooked anything you think of just name it youve got plenty were not going to need all that well you cant never tell now i want you and fay to be comfortable and you may have to hole up here quite a while i grinned to myself i said i was sure wed have plenty of everything yeah he gave me a sharp look but theyll find that doctor in the morning wont they you wont be able to do no chasing around after that thats right i said well uh well he said hastily what i meant was you might want something and i wouldnt be around to get it for you sure but well have plenty you dont have to worry about that at all he hesitated started to say something else then he gave up on it chalked it up i guess to some more of my screwy talk and uncorked a bottle of whiskey we poured drinks he went on with the gabbing talking about how fine everything was and i nodded and grinned and told him he was sure right the fun was going to be over pretty soon pretty soon now i was going to set him back on his heels so i let him enjoy himself while he could fay came out of the bedroom and fixed the boy an egg and some milk i watched from the doorway as she tried to feed it to him and it was just no go he just didnt have the strength or the stomach for it she brought the plate and the glass back into the kitchen uncle bud pulled his everythingisfine line on her and she stood and looked at him until he was all through until the words kind of died in his throat then she fified a glass with whiskey and sat down in a corner with it evening came on uncle bud got busy with the food made a plate of lunchmeat sandwiches and opened up some potato salad and a few cans of stuff i ate a pretty good meal fay took a sandwich and more whiskey uncle bud didnt eat anything ill just grab me a bite later he said taking a big swallow of his drink i aint real hungry now so ill just get something when i go into town i didnt say anything he took another drink fidgeting a little i still got to keep right on top of this deal yknow kid this is the most important time were due to pull down the money in less than twentyfour hours and if the cops got any fast ones cooking they might try to pull something right at the last minute you know why its up to me to find out about it i waited still keeping silent looking at him and saying nothing he filled up his glass again yeah he mumbled yes sir i sure got to keep a close eye on everything from now until the windup you uh i guess you and fay can get along here all right by yourselves huh i smiled at him just smiled he glanced nervously at fay and she gave him a deadeyed stare i guess it all works out pretty good we cant very well all of us stay here so its just as well that ill be away i uh uncle bud paused fumbling with the buttons of his coat youre sure you dont need anything now youll be all right until tomorrow night well ill just run along then and i spoke at last i told him to stay right where he was for a moment and fay and i and the boy would go with him he laughed he put on his hat and started to get up and then it registered on him what id said and he sank back down in his chair ggo with me he stammered wwhat what for for the same reason youre going i said to get the money his mouth dropped open a guilty red flush spread over his face kkid i i it aint the right time yet you know it aint kid its not supposed to be until tomorrow night yeah how do i know that why why because its what we planned right from the beginning i gave the family seventytwo hours seventytwo hours from when from the time i took the boy from the time the ransom note was mailed from the time the family got it or the night of the day they got it or when well it it was forget it it doesnt mean anything it doesnt change anything maybe you didnt plan on running out on us in the beginning but youd never pass up a setup like the one youve got now fay and me tied down here the cops looking for us after tomorrow morning you on the loose i shook my head nodded to fay get the boy ready were leaving she got up and went into the bedroom not saying a word ignoring him when he told her to wait to talk the kid out of this crazy notion fay shut the door he stared at it helplessly all right kid the money aint there but if you wont take my word for it ill prove it to you its all wrong sending the messenger now showing our hand in advance but if thats the way you got to have it its not the way i said were going to pick the money up ourselves that one really threw him uncle bud looked like he was about to faint no he said no you cant mean it kid take that boy into the railroad station wwhy hell we probably wouldnt much moren get him out of the car before he was spotted all right well leave him in the car then just you and i and fay wifi go in leave him damn it thats even worse he might start stirring around someone might look in and see him thats right i nodded and no ones going to do anything to him to make sure that he doesnt stir around well then you can see yourself that your idea wont work kid fay doesnt trust me i dont trust her and we dont trust you but i can fix that part you well park near the station where i can see you go in and come out if you arent back in fifteen minutes ill tip the cops off to you but kid kid uncle bud mopped his face that it just aint right suppose the money really isnt there it is we both know it is so get it get it by yourself or fay and i will go with you and get it but you cant you cant leave the boy in the car like that so that brings us right back where we started from doesnt it you get it and dont take more than fifteen minutes to do it b but his mouth worked helplessly he looked down at the floor shaking his head wagging it back and forth until i thought it was going to fall off and then at last he looked up again there was a kind of greenish cast to his face but a red flush was spreading beneath it uncle bud was sick really sick he was scared so bad but along with it he was ashamed kid i guess i got to tell you something this deal i there wasnt much risk the way i had it figured with the messenger picking up the money you know and that wino to take the fall if there was one i well i didnt have to know if there was a police stakeout at the payoff place i mean if there was it wouldnt catch me i wouldnt lose nothing but the dough i i he licked his lips go on well uh about the money about maybe its being marked or the serials registered there wasnt any risk there either the way i figured hell all those small bills the biggest ones twenties they just couldnt trace em theres too many in circulation and by the time they traced em back to a guy why well i didnt believe they could i didnt think the family would play around to begin with theyd be so anxious about the boy and if they or the cops did try anything funny it wouldnt get them anywhere so so he paused glanced at me pleadingly you see what i mean kid you see what im driving at i nodded i saw it and i felt sorry for him but not as sorry as he wanted me to feel not after what hed done to me except for him i wouldnt be in this spot i wouldnt have hurt doc the only man whod ever done anything for me and the little boy wouldnt be dying and fay and i things might have been a lot different between us you couldnt judge by the way things were now wed both been pretty mixed up easy to swing one way or another and we might have swung the right way instead of this one we might have it could have worked out that way if uncle bud had left us alone ive been lying to you kid i dont have no pipelines into the department most of the guys i know they dont even speak to me any more they see me comin they turn the other way i guess i cant blame them much but anyway thats the way it is i dont know what theyre doing or what theyve done i figured i could get by safe enough without knowing if there was any kind of jam it would be someone else that got stuck and and naturally i didnt want no one else to get into trouble let it go at that you dont know anything youre not sure that the guy who goes for the money wont be walking into a police trap thats right kid well youll know pretty soon i said youre going to find out awfully fast we sat there for another halfhour or so and he was talking every minute of it begging pleading with me actually crying a little toward the last the words poured out of his mouth and they didnt mean a thing to me i didnt even hear them they were just a noise just a lot of noises coming from a sickishwhite face i didnt mind them particularly i didnt care whether uncle bud made them or whether he didnt other people had never meant anything to him what they said meant nothing to him and now it was his turn now he was meaningless and what he said was meaningless i was all those other people all the people in the world and i couldnt see him and i couldnt hear him he stopped talking at last hed talked himself kind of hoarse i finished my drink and set the glass on the table anything else ifyoure all through well shove off sshove off but kid i just all right theres no hurry you talk as long as you want to and then well leave his eyes watered his lips trembled and he managed to get his mouth open but no words came out i grinned at him i asked him again if there was anything he wanted to say uncle bud looked at me dully hesitated and made one last try i know quite a few people around that station kid guys that aint got much use for me if one of em should get in touch with bert go on make it nice and scary it could happen kid he always comes into town for dinner and if he had the word spread around to look out for me and you know he has you know hes been tipped off uhuh i dont know it and neither do you dont make me do it kid his eyes fified with tears again please dont make me do it if one of those guys should call bert he could be there in five minutes only five minutes i grinned you dont think he could make it in three im beggin you kid i got a bad feeling about this if the cops dont get me why shut up get up and start moving im sick of looking at you i rode in the back with the boy fay drove and uncle bud sat in the front with her there wasnt a halfdozen words passed between us on the way into town about three blocks from the railroad station i had fay stop the car and uncle bud got out it was about seventhirty the quiet part of the evening the day rush was over and it was too early for the dinner and theatre crowds uncle bud trudged down the street practically by himself he turned around near the end of the block and looked back at us he crossed the intersection and looked back again he hesitated sort of teetering too scared to go ahead knowing it was go ahead or else then he went on walking fairly fast anxious i guess to get the job and the suspense over with i got behind the wheel and made the boy lie on the floor in back then i followed uncle bud down the street letting the car creep along letting him stay well ahead of me the railroad station occupied a block on the other side of the street i stopped in the middle of the block just below it and shut off the motor i watched as uncle bud went up the broad marble steps and disappeared through the entrance i scooted down a little in the seat and peered up at the clock in the station tower it was twenty minutes of he had until five of eight to get back with the money if he wasnt back by then i kind of hoped that he wouldnt be because id meant just what id said about calling the cops and that would wind everything up just that much faster and that was all i wanted now just to get it over with to have the end come because it was bound to be bad no good no happiness could come out of this now so the quicker it was over the better id have ended it myself if i could have but somehow i couldnt and i guess it wasnt so strange that i couldnt theres something inside of every man that keeps him going long after he has any reason to hes no good to life and life is no good to him and he knows it will always be that way but still he cant quit something keeps prodding him whispering to him making him hope in the face of hopelessness making him believe theres a reason to stay in there and pitch and that if he fights long enough hell stumble onto it its that way with everyone or almost everyone i guess its hardly ever been any other way with me for years for as far back as i could remember id kept going when going didnt seem to make any sense and i had to keep on now if any quitting was done it had to be done for me uncle bud had been gone a little more than five minutes it was five minutes i mean since hed entered the station i looked down from the clock to the tall doors of the building and i saw a man hurry through one of them and pause at the top of the steps he had something in his hand a flashlight he flashed it three times and the light was red it didnt mean anything to me for a minute i just thought still theres a guy with a red flashlight so what about it then fay sat up with a gasp turned toward me her face blurred white in the semidarkness collie llook she said and pointed but i was already looking for the street had suddenly come to life a police car had pulled into each side of the intersection ahead of us two other cars had stopped at the next intersection shutting off the side streets and in the block beyond a car was out in the middle of the intersection and a cop was directing traffic off of the street collie fay whispered collie wwhat are they doing its a stakeout they tagged him as soon as he got the money but theyre afraid to take him in a crowd i guess thats the reason well do somethin llets get out of here aah collie i i i kind of frowned jerked my arm away from her hand this was what i wanted you see the end and it seemed like she should want it too that she should damned well get it regardless of what she wanted because fay wasnt fit to live because shed be better off dead or locked up for life and i started to tell her that and then when a man stops caring what happens all the strain is lifted from him suspicion and worry and fear all the things that twist his thinking out of focus are brushed aside and he can see people as they are at last exactly as they are as i saw fay then weak and frightened selfpitying maybe but good too basically as good as a woman could be and hating herself for not being better shed planned to call the cops telling them the boy was in the culvert after wed made our escape i knew that now i knew that if it came to a showdown shed protect him with her life i knew it and suddenly i wanted fay to live suddenly it made sense for fay to live it was the only way my having lived would make any sense it was why i had lived it seemed like it was why i had been made like i was to show her something to prove something to do something for her that she could not do for herself and then to protect her so that she could go on so that she would have the reason for living that id never had i turned on the switch key then i glanced over my shoulder hesitated and turned it off again because it was too late of course the whole area had been blocked off at the same time the street behind us was blocked and a motorcycle cop was bearing right down on us i barely had time to check that the boy was down flat when he drew up at the side of the car bracing his feet on the pavement i looked out the window smiling at him and he turned the flashlight into my face he held it on me for a moment then switched it over to fay then brought it back to me again something wrong i said hoping he wouldnt see the boy on the floor in back arent we supposed to park here officer he grunted as he held the light on my face whats all the excitement about i said why all the police cars my wife and i were just sitting here and why he snapped off the light what business you got here who you waitin for he was an older man maybe fifty he was kind of heavyset like motor cops get and he had a fat hardlooking face were waiting for a friend of mine jack billingsley hes coming in from the east about eightthirty coming in on the train and we were waiting for him whats your name this your car lets see the papers on it he said all in one breath i gave him my right name william collins this is our car all right but we left the house in kind of a hurry tonight and im not sure that i glanced at fay i guess youve got the papers with you havent you honey in your purse maybe she got her purse open fumbled it open she began pawing through it moving the stuff it was filled with this way and that the cop scowled suspiciously and bent close to me ive seen you some place before whatd you say your name was collins were waiting for a friend of mine jack billingsley hes due on the train soon ive seen you ever been in any trouble what do you do for a living how about them papers lady no i havent been in any trouble you must have me mixed up with someone else im retired now but i used to i aint got you mixed up ive seen you lets see your drivers license he glanced over into the back of the car i thought of the boy and i reached for the gun in my pocket but he jerked his eyes back to me then he turned the flashlight into my face again and suddenly he grabbed me by the arm hold it the light filled my eyes blinding me whatd you say your name was collins yeah yeah why sure it is he laughed and let go of my arm kid collins why sure it was on the west coast i won twentyfive bucks on you he shook hands leaned in and shook hands with fay you say youre retired now kid livin here in town are you didnt mean to give you and your wife a bad time but its been so long ago and you being right here where all this is happening whats going on i said innocently some kind of trouble you said it he glanced over his shoulder lets see dont believe youd better try to pull out now but maybe back it up a ways kid get back there around the middle of the block i started the car and put it in reverse he backed up with me kind of pushing himself along with his feet and i had to watch where i was going of course and keep an eye on him too so that was why i missed what went on i didnt see uncle bud come out of the station uncle bud with the suitcase and bert right on his heels i didnt see him try to break and run from bert i was looking behind me until i heard the shot and by the time i got turned around it was all just about over uncle bud was sprawled on the steps bert had grabbed up the suitcase and was heading back toward the station entrance and hes got just about two steps when the cops inside cut loose on him the detectives who had been waiting in there he screamed i heard the one scream above the blast of their guns then he toppled over backwards still hanging onto the suitcase went tumbling and rolling down the steps until his body struck the sidewalk well thats it the cop nodded to me guess youll have to pick up your friend a little later kid this place is going to be pretty hot for a while yeah it kind of looks like it would all right just make you a uturn right here and ill signal for the boys to let you through i turned around in the street and drove back to the intersection he signaled the cops let me through and i kept on going i drove almost until dawn just driving aimlessly just riding going on until it was time to stop going i didnt know when that time would be but i figured it couldnt be very far off and i knew id know it when it did come things would work out a certain way so that i could stop living and fay could go on it would all work out in time just a little more time and meanwhile i had to keep going finally a little before daylight i turned off the highway and into an old trail it was so overgrown with weeds and grass you could hardly see it and it faded off into a sort of jungle of underbrush but i ploughed the car on through it and after a few hundred yards the ground sloped downwards to a creek it was practically dried up just a little trickle of water between two high banks so i turned the car into it and stopped i had to with a trail that no one would ever spot and with this archway of trees overhead it was just what i needed exactly the right place to wait while things were working out a certain way and now that id gotten to it the car had run out of gas fay had brought a full quart of whiskey with her from uncle buds place shed started slugging it down as soon as wed got out of that police trap and now she had passed out i corked the bottle and sat it down on the floor i looked back at the boy he was asleep really asleep and not just unconscious i tucked the blanket around him a little better and went to sleep myself it was safe enough with fay passed out shed be that way for hours and id be sleeping pretty lightly i waked up around noon when the boy started stirring i got out quietly lifted him out and laid him down on the ground i scooped up some water in a rusty can and gave him a drink then i let him go to the toilet washed his face and hands for him and put him back in the car there was nothing else i could do for him and he wanted to get back in just that little exertion had worn him out i got back in the car myself there was still a good pint of whiskey in the bottle a little more than a pint i mean and that would be more than enough for fay so i took one pretty good drink of it and corked the bottle back up again it was the middle of the afternoon before fay waked up she took a drink and left the car for a few minutes when she returned she looked at the boy tried to talk to him to ask him how he was and so on and then she got back into the seat with me and picked up the bottle well what do we do now stupid i shrugged how do i know you tell me if youve got any ideas hell she shook her head dully hell what a mess the whole damned country looking for us no money and no car and a kid thats as good as dead and her voice broke and she took another big drink what a mess what a combination everything else and a lunatic to boot im not crazy im just no youre not youre just mean and rotten and no good i could feel sorry for you if you were really crazy but aah forget it turn on the radio i turned it on we sat listening all through the afternoon and it was all pretty much the same thing a lot of words built around a few facts or i should say what they thought were facts bert and uncle bud had died before they could talk the playground matron believed that bert was the kidnaper and the cops believed that he and uncle bud were the principals in the crime fay and i were kind of small fry supposedly just a couple of stooges then a familiar voice came over the radio doc goldmans doc goldman wasnt sure that fay was actually in on the deal it was possible he thought that she might have been acting under coercion as for me well i wasnt completely responsible for what i did i knew what i was doing so i could be held legally responsible but i had tried to save the boys life id risked discovery and capture to steal that insulin and it was just possible that id been forced to take part in the crime along with fay i could have been even though id slugged him and tied him up that was a natural reaction for a guy like me who thought he was in danger any time i got in a tight spot id just about have to turn violent it was a pretty thin theory of course about me being coerced i mean there were all kinds of holes in it that i couldnt fill and i sure wasnt going to try still it sounded hopeful taken along with some of the facts and what dec and the cops thought about fay sounded a hell of a lot better all she needed now was something to kind of top off their theories to sew them all up tight and leave her in the clear doc talked quite a while about us and to us he kept urging us to come in if we had the boy if we couldnt get away wed have to give up sooner or later so if the boy was alive if bert or uncle bud hadnt killed him if he was with us the car battery was going dead docs voice grew fainter and fainter and finally it faded out entirely and now it was night again i heard fay take a drink i heard her as she took another one a long one and dropped the bottle out of the side of the car shed be feeling pretty steady by this time her nerve would be built up and that hard ugly streak would be cropping out shed be up to anything in this mood and they didnt know that we had the boy that motorcycle cop had said that we didnt and the cops whod let us through the street block said the same thing maybe they really believed theyd looked in the car or maybe they were just trying to get themselves out of a jam but anyway no one knew the truth fay struck a match to a cigarette it glowed in the darkness lighting up her face as she took a long deep puff well we know what we have to do lets get it over with i nodded i said yeah we might as well one thing collie she hesitated some of the sharpness going out of her voice youve done some pretty inexcusable things but i know you werent responsible you thought you had to protect the boy from me whatever i said im sorry forget it fay its all my fault i thought it was smart to keep the boy alive but i guess its just about the dumbest thing i ever did well regardless of who was at fault i what her head snapped around why ccollie what do mean by that you dont get it you call me stupid and you dont see what i mean nno no i dont see aw youve got to berts stuck with the actual kidnaping isnt he he and uncle bud could be blamed for practically everything that i did couldnt they and you collie she said sharply what are you getting at and you i went on youve got it just about perfect it looks a hundred per cent better for you than it does for me you were a woman living alone bert and uncle bud threatened you and you were scared to death of me so you went along with us i asked you collie i asked you what you were getting at you really dont get it i laughed well i guess you probably wouldnt at that youre sitting pretty already and it wont hurt you if the kid talks but itll hurt me plenty so so theres your answer all spelled out for you hes not going to do any talking fay stared at me silent and motionless for a moment then still staring at me she raised her hand and let the cigarette butt drop out the window slowly she shook her head you dont mean that you cant mean it yyou youve been through more than even a normal person could take and youre excited and frightened you dont mean it do you darling i know my collie and i know hell i laughed cutting her off i really had you fooled didnt i well i guess i should all the practice ive had i started in almost fifteen years ago i was up for a murder rap see and it was the only thing i could think of so i went into the act and it got me out from under and then i went into the army and it got me out of that it looked like such a sweet deal that i started working the act full time what act she said wwhat are you saying the crazy stuff i laughed again hell its better than a pension i could just roam around doing what i pleased acting stupid and cracking down when people fell for it then whenever i got tired id just turn in at some institution for a while those places are pretty swell you know just like a high class country club a swell private room and anything you want to eat hell you never tasted anything like it and you ought to see how people knock themselves out to wait on you why i was in one place where they had a nurse for each patient real pretty ones to keep you cheered up and feeling good i made it as strong as i knew how laughing and kidding about it rubbing it in on her hard and at first fay cut in a time or two and then she just sat and listened and gradually i felt the change in her i could feel the last bit of uncertainty giving way to coldness and hatred and disgust i dont know why people never get wise i said you do all sorts of things to give yourself away to prove you know that youre plenty good at looking out for yourself but somehow they never seem to catch on they go right on falling for the act and feeling sorry for you i snickered and lighted a cigarette i held the match for a moment while i took the gun from my pocket and checked the chamber well i guess ill get it over with as i expected she made a wild grab for the gun i jerked it back and thrust it forward suddenly fay screamed as she had that time back at the house i wont kill you ill just mark you up real good like youd been through a struggle i was trying to keep you from killing the boy see and the gun went off accidentally ddont she sobbed do anything you want to me but dont kill him now theres a good idea its better than just bumping off the brat and leaving him here after all it was uncle buds gun and you knew him a long time before i did i turned in the seat and opened the door i slid the gun back onto my hip but not into the pocket i let it slip past the pocket as though id missed and didnt know it and down onto the seat then i got out my back turned to her there was one shattering explosion and i pitched forward against the creek bank everything was silent for a moment then i heard fay scramble out of the car and take the boy out stagger away with him her footsteps growing fainter and fainter and then vanishing entirely and i stayed where i was unable to turn my face pressed into the dirt and that was the way it should be i guessed right where it had always been and this this what had happened was as it had to be shed had to hate me fay had to go on hating me thinking what she did about me as long as she lived and and that that was the way it would be too but i wished shed stayed a little while longer just a little the minute or two more that i was going to stay and if shed wanted to talk mean or call me dirty names it would have been all right because it was just her way you know fay just if shed just you silly looking goof you couldnt sell cyanide in a suicide colony im just waiting for a friend maybe you know him jack billingsley big realestate family we were driving to california and california huh well new york here i come the car broke down and i went for help and i guess that darned crazy jack billingsley jerk stupid souphound bark for me roll over and do some tricks i grinned because she didnt really mean a thing by it you know i barked i guess it sounded like a bark maybe and my body jerked rolled a little and then i stopped i just kind of stopped all over about the author james meyers
