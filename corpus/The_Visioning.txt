 the visioning a novel by susan glaspell chapter i miss katherine wayneworth jones was bunkered having been bunkered many times in the past and knowing that she would be bunkered upon many occasions in the future miss jones was not disposed to take a tragic view of the situation the little white ball was all too secure down there in the sand as she had played her first nine and at least paid her respects to the game she could now scale the hazard and curl herself into a comfortable position it was a seductively lazy spring day the very day for making armchairs of ones hazards and let it be set down in the beginning that miss jones was more given to a comfortable place than to a tragic view katherine wayneworth jones affectionately known to many friends in many lands as katie jones was an army girl and that not only for the obvious reasons not because her people had been of the army even unto the second and third generations not because she had known the joys and jealousies of many posts not even because bachelor officers were committed to the habit of proposing to her those were but the trappings she was an army girl because well when you know her you dont have to be told and if you dont know her you cant be a floundering friend had once concluded her exposition of why katie was so army for her to marry outside the army would be regarded as little short of treason today she was giving a little undisturbing consideration to that thing of her marrying for it was her twentyfifth birthday and twentyfifth birthdays are prone to knock at the door of matrimonial possibilities just then the knock seemed answered by captain prescott unblushingly miss jones considered that doubtless before the summer was over she would be engaged to him and quite likely she would follow up the engagement with a wedding it seemed time for her to be following up some of her engagements she did not believe that she would at all mind marrying harry prescott all his people liked all hers which would facilitate things at the wedding she would not be rudely plunged into a new set of friends which would be trying at her time of life everything about him was quite all right he played a good game of golf not a maddening one of bridge danced and rode in a sort of joy of living fashion and she liked the way he showed his teeth when he laughed she always thought when he laughed most unreservedly that he was going to show more of them but he never did it interested her and it interested her the way people said prescott oh yes he was in cuba wasnt he and then smiled a little perhaps shrugged a trifle and added great fellow prescott never made a mess of things anyhow to have vague association with the mysterious things of life and yet not to have made a mess of things what more could one ask of course pounding irritably with her club the only reason for not marrying him was that there were too many reasons for doing so she could not think of a single person who would furnish the stimulus of an objection stupid to have every one so pleased but there must always be something wrong so let that be appeased in having everything just right and then there was cuba for ones adventurous sense she looked about her with satisfaction it frequently happened that the place where one was inspired keen sense of the attractions of some other place but this time there was no place she would rather be than just where she found herself for she was a little tired after a long round of visits at gay places and this quiet beautiful island out in the mississippi large apart serene seemed a great lap into which to sink she liked the quarters big oldfashioned houses in front of which the long stretch of green sloped down to the river there was something peculiarly restful in the spaciousness and stability a place which the disagreeable or distressing things of life could not invade most of the women were away which was the real godsend for the dreariness and desolation of pleasure would be eliminated a quiet post was charming until it tried to be gay so mused miss katherine wayneworth jones and of various other things mused she her brother captain wayneworth jones was divorced from his wife and wedded to something he was hoping would in turn be wedded to a rifle all the scientific cells of the family having been used for waynes brain it was hard for katie to get the nature of the attachment but she trusted the ordnance department would in time solemnly legalize the affair wayne giving in marriage destruction profiting happily by the union meanwhile wayne was so consecrated to the work of making warfare more deadly that he scarcely knew his sister had arrived but on the morrow or at least the day after would come young wayneworth called worth save when his aunt kate called him wayne the worthy wayne the worthy was also engaged in perfecting a deathdealing instrument the same being the interrogation point doubtless he would open fire on aunt kate with why didnt his mother and father live in the same place any more and why did he have to live half the time with mama if hed rather stay all the time with father poor worth he had only spent six years in a world of law and order and had yet to learn about courts and incompatibilities and annoying things like that it did not seem fair that the hardest part of the whole thing should fall to poor little wayne the worthy he couldnt help it certainly but how worthie would love those collie pups they would evolve all sorts of games to play with them picturing herself romping with the boy and dogs prowling about on the river in waynes new launch lounging under those great oak trees reading good lazying books doing everything because she wanted to and nothing because she had to flirting just enough with captain prescott to keep a sense of the reality of life she lay there gloating over the happy prospect and then in that most irresponsible and unsuspecting of moments something whizzed into her consciousness like a bullet something shot by her vision pierced the lazy hazy carelessly woven web of imagery bulletswift bullettrue bulletterrible striking the center clean and strong the suddenness and completeness with which she sat up almost sent her from her place for from the very instant that her eye rested upon the figure of the girl in pink organdie dress and big hat she knew something was wrong and when within a few feet of the river the girl stopped running shrank back covered her face with her hands then staggered on she knew that that girl was going to the river to kill herself there was one frozen instant of powerlessness then what to do call to her she would only hurry on run after her she could not get there it was intuition instinct took the short cut a benumbed reason could not make rolling headlong down the bunker twisting her neck and mercilessly bumping her elbow katherine wayneworth jones emitted a shriek to raise the very dead themselves and then three times a quick wild help help help and a less audible prayer that no one else was near it reached the girl stopped turned saw the rumpled lifelesslooking heap of blue linen turned back toward the river then once more to the motionless miss jones lying face downward in the sand and then the girl who thought life not worth living delaying her own preference with rather reluctant feet feet clad in pink satin slippers turned back to the girl who wanted to live badly enough to call for help through onehalf of one eye katie could see her she was thinking that there was something fine about a girl who wanted to kill herself putting it off long enough to turn back and help some one who wanted to live miss jones raised her head just a trifle showed her face long enough to roll her eyes in a grewsome way she had learned at school and with a help me buried her face in the sand and lay there quivering the girl knelt down you sick she asked and katie had the fancy of her voice sounding as though she had not expected to use it any more so ill panted kate rolling over on her back and holding her heart here my heart the girl looked around uncertainly it must be a jar katie conceded being called back to life expected to fight for the very thing one was running away from her rescuer was evidently considering going to the river for water saving water katie missed none of those fine points but instead she pulled the patient to a sitting position supporting her you can breathe better this way cant you she asked solicitously have you had them before will it go away shall i call some one katie rolled her head about as she had seen people do who were dying on the stage often before go away soon but dont leave me she implored clutching at the girl wildly i will not leave you the stranger assured her i have plenty of time miss jones made what the doctors would call a splendid recovery her breath began coming more naturally her spine seemed to regain control of her head her eyes rolled less wildly its going she panted but youll have to help me to the house why of course replied the girl who was being delayed do you think id leave a sick girl sitting out here all alone kate felt like apologizing it seemed rather small that interrupting a death to save a life where do you live her companion was asking she pointed to the quarters in one of those the second one katie told her and thank heaven she told herself the first one is closed lean on me directed the girl in pink with a touch of the gentle authority of strong to weak dont be afraid to lean on me kate felt the quick warm tears against her eyelids youre very kind she said and the quiver in her voice was real they walked slowly on silently katie was trembling now and in earnest my name is katherine jones she said at last looking timidly at the girl who was helping her it wrought a change the girls mouth closed in a hard line a hard defending glitter seemed to seal her eyes she did not respond may i ask to whom i am indebted for this kindness it was asked with gentleness but for the moment it brought no response my name is verna woods came at last with an unsteady defiance they had reached the steps of the big hospitable porch with deep relief katie saw that there was no one about nora had gone out with one of her adorers from the barracks they turned and were looking back to the river it was may at mays loveliest the grass and trees so tender a green the river so gently buoyant and a softly sympathetic sky over all a soldier had appeared and was picking twigs from the putting green in front of them another soldier was coming down the road with some eggs which he was evidently taking to captain prescotts quarters he was whistling everything seemed to be going very smoothly and a launch was coming down the river a girls laugh came musically across the water and the green it inspired the joyful throat of a nearby robin and into this had been shot katie turned to the intruder its lovely isnt it she asked in a queer hushed way the girl looked at her and at the fierce rush of things kate took a frightened step backward but quickly the other had turned away her face only her clenched hand and slightly moving shoulder told anything there was another call to make and instinct alone could not reach this time for the moment thought of it left her mute you have been so kind to me she began her timidity serving well as helplessness so very kind i wonder if i may ask one thing more am am i keeping you from anything you should be doing there was no response at first just a little convulsive clenching of the hand an accentuated movement of the shoulder then i have time enough was the low curt answer face still averted i am alone here as you see i am just a little afraid of a a return attack i wonder would you be willing to come up to my room with me help make a cup of tea for us and stay with me a little while again for the minute no reply then the girl turned hotly upon her suspicion resentment was it hatred too in her eyes but what she saw was as a childs face wide eyes beseeching mouth women who wondered what in the world men saw in katie jones might have wondered less had they seen her then the girl did not seem to know what to say suddenly she was trembling from head to foot kate laid a hand upon the quivering arm ive frightened you she said regretfully and tenderly you need the tea too youll come the girls eyes roved all around like the furtive eyes of a frightened animal but they came back to katies steadying gaze why yes ill come if you want me to she said in voice she was clearly making supreme effort to steady i do indeed said kate simply and led the way into the house chapter ii and now that they were face to face across a teatable miss jones was bunkered again how get out of the sand she did not know she did not even know what club to use for never had she drunk tea under similar circumstances life had brought her varied experiences but sitting across the teacups from one whom she had interrupted on the brink of suicide did not chance to be among them she was wholly without precedent and it was trying for an army girl to be stripped of precedent they were sitting at a window which overlooked the river the river which was flowing on so serenely which was so blue and lazy and lovely that may afternoon she looked to the place where then back to the girl across from her the girl who but for her she shivered is it coming back the girl asked n o i think not but i hope you will not go then desperately resolved to break through she asked boldly am i keeping you from anything important a strange gleam compounded of things she did not understand shot out at her to be followed with important oh i dont know that depends on how you look at it the only thing i have left to do is to kill myself i guess it wont take long kate met it with a sharp involuntary cry for the sullen steadiness dispassionateness detachment with which it was said made it more real than it had been at the waters edge but but you see its such a lovely day you know you know its such a beautiful place was what the resourceful miss jones found herself stammering yes agreed her companion pleasant weather isnt it she looked at katie contemptuously you think weather makes any difference thats like a girl like you katie laughed laughing seemed the only sand club she had just then i am a fool she agreed ive often thought so myself but like most other fools i mean well and this just didnt seem to me the sort of day when it would occur to one to kill ones self now if it were terribly hot the kind of hot that takes your brains away or so cold you were freezing or even if it were raining not a decent rain but that insulting drizzle that makes you hate everything why then yes i might understand but to kill ones self in the sunshine as she was finishing she had a strange sensation she saw that the girl was looking at her compassionately katherine wayneworth jones was not accustomed to being viewed with compassion it would be foolish to try to make you understand said the girl simply finality in her weariness it would be foolish to try to make a girl like you understand that nothing can be so bad as sunshine katie leaned across the table this interested her why i suppose that might be true i suppose but the girl was not listening she was leaning back in the great wicker chair she seemed actually to be relaxing resting that seemed strange to kate how could she be resting in an hour which had just been tacked on to her life and then it came to her that perhaps it was a long time since the girl had sat in a chair like that if she had had a chance when things were going badly to sit in such a chair and rest might the river have seemed a less desirable place she had always supposed it was big things queer abstract unknowable things like forces and traits that made life and death did chairs count as the girls eyes closed surrenderingly katie was glad that no matter what she might decide to do about things she had had that hour in the big tenderly cushioned wicker chair it might be a kinder memory to take with her from life than anything she had known for a long time katherine had grown very still still both outwardly and inwardly people spoke of her enviously as having experienced so much living in all parts of the world knowing people of all nations and kinds but it seemed all of that had been mere splashing around on the beach she was out in the big waves now she looked at the girl looked with the eyes of one who would understand and what she saw was that some one something had as it were struck a blow at the center and the girl the something that really was her had gone to pieces everything was scattered even her features scarcely seemed to belong to each other so how must it not be with those other things inner things oh things one did not know what to call was it because she could not get things together it seemed to her she must make them all stop was that it did people lose the power to hold themselves in the one that made you you what could do that something that reached the center not many things could something perhaps that kept battering at it for a long time and just shook it at first and then it was too dreadful to think of it that way she tried to make herself stop the girls face was turned to the outofdoors to a great tree in front of the window a tree in which some robins had built their nests such a tired face so many tear marks and so much less reachable than tear stains a beautiful face too if all were back which the blow at the center had struck away if she had all of her if lighted it would be a rarely beautiful face the girl was like a flower a flower it seemed to kate which had not been planted in the right place the gardener had been unwise in his selection of a place for this flower perhaps he had not used the right kind of soil perhaps he had put it in the full heat of the sun when it was a flower to have more shade perhaps too much wind or too much rain katie wondered just what the mistake had been for the flower would have been so lovely had the gardener not made those mistakes even now it was lovely lovely with a saddening loveliness for one saw at a glance how easily a breeze too rough could beat it down and one knew there had been those breezes every petal drooped a strange desire entered the heart of katherine a desire to see whether those petals could take their curves again whether a color which blunders had faded could come back to its own she was like the new gardener eager to see whether he can redeem the mistakes of the old and the new gardeners zeal is not all for the flower some of it is to show what he can do and much of it the true gardeners passion for experiment katie jones would have made a good gardener and yet it was something less cold than the experimenting instinct tightened her throat as she looked at the frail figure of the girl for whom life had been too much i must go now she was saying with what seemed mighty effort to summon all of herself over which she could get command you are all right now i must go but she sank back in the chair as if that one thing left at the center pulled her back crying out that if it could but have a little more time there the girl in blue linen was sitting at the feet of the girl in pink organdie she had hold of her hand so slim a hand everything about the girl was slim built for favoring breezes i have one thing more to ask it was kates voice was not well controlled this time you may call it a whim a notion foolish notion call it what you like but i want you to stay here tonight the girl was looking down at her down into the upturned face all light and strength and purpose as one standing apart and disinterested might view a spectacle slowly comprehendingly dispassionately she shook her head it would be no use perhaps katie acquiesced some of the very nicest things in life are no use but i have something planned may i tell you what it is i want to do still she did not take her eyes from katies kindling face looking at it as at something a long way off and foreign i am not a philanthropist have no fears of that but i have an idea a theory that what seem small things are perhaps the only things in life to help the big things for instance a hot bath i cant think of any sorrow in the world that a hot bath wouldnt help just a little bit now we have such a beautiful bathroom i loathe hot baths in tiny bathrooms where the air gets all steamy and you cant get your breath perhaps one thing the matter with you is that all the bathrooms youve been in lately were too small of course you didnt know that was one thing the matter like once at a dance i thought i was very sad about a mans dancing so much with another girl a new girl dont you loathe new girls but when i got home i found that one of my dress stays was digging into me and when i got my dress off i didnt feel half so broken up about the man an odd thing happened one thing struck away came back there was a light in the eyes telling that something human and understanding something to link her to other things human would like to come back she looked and listened as to something nearer seeing it katie chattered on against time about nothing foolish talk heartless talk it might even seem to be pouring out to a girl who felt there was no place for her in life but it was nonsense carried by tenderness nonsense which made for kinship it reached several times the girl who thought she must kill herself was not far from a smile and at last there was a tear on the long lashes so im going to undress you katie unfolded her plan encouraged by the tear and then lets just see what hot water can do about it and maybe a little rub i used to rub my mothers spine she said life always seemed worth living after i had done that she patted the hand she held ever so lightly as she said how happy i would be if i could make you feel that way about it too then ive a dear room to take you into all soft grays and greens and oh such a good bed why you know youre tired thats whats the matter with you and youre just too tired to know whats the matter the girl nodded tears upon her cheeks looking like a child that has had a cruel time and needs to be comforted katies voice was lower different as she went on then after ive brushed your hair and done all those comfy things im going to put you in a certain a very special gown i have it was made by the nuns in a convent in southern france as they worked upon it they sat in a garden on a hillside they thought serene thoughts those nuns you see i know them lived with them i dont know one has odd fancies sometimes and it always seemed to me that something of the peace of things there was absorbed in that wonderful bit of linen it seems far away from things that hurt and harm almost as if it might draw back things that had gone i was going to keep it katies eyes deepened there was a little catch in her voice well i was just keeping it but because you are so tired oh just because you need it so i want you to let me give it to you and with a tender strength holding the sobbing girl katie unfastened her collar and began taking off her dress chapter iii kate demanded captain jones whats that noise how should i know airily queried kate i heard a noise in the room above this chimney carries every sound nonsense jeered his sister wayne youve lived alone so long that youre getting spooky he turned to the other man prescott didnt you hear something believe i did it sounded like a cough well what of it railed kate isnt poor nora permitted to cough if she is disposed to cough shes in there doing the room for me im going to try sleeping in there isnt insomnia a fearful thing but the fussiness of men they were in the library over their coffee kate was peculiarly charming that night in one of the thin white gowns she wore so much and which it seemed so fitting she should wear she had been her gayest prescott was thinking he had never known any one who seemed to sparkle and bubble that way and so easily and naturally as though it came from an inner fount of perpetual action and could more easily rise than be held down and he was wondering why a girl who had so many of the attributes of a boy should be so much more fascinating than any mere girl there are two kinds of girl he had heard an older officer once say there are girls and then there is katie jones he had condemned that as distinctly maudlin at the time but recalled it tonight with less condemnation katie exclaimed wayne after his sister had read aloud some ones engagement from the army and navy register and wondered vehemently how those two people ever expected to live together noras out on the side porch with watts do you disapprove of this affair between nora and watts katie wanted to know critically inspecting the design on her coffee spoon i distinctly disapprove of having some one coughing in the room upstairs and not being satisfied who the some one is she leaned forward pointing her spoon at him earnestly wayne they say there are some excellent nerve specialists in chicago id advise you to take the night train take the rifle along wayne and find out just what its done to you thats all very well but if youd been reading the papers lately youd know that ideas of housebreaking are not necessarily neurasthenic dear wayne lover of maps and charts let me take this pencil and make a little sketch for you a is the chamber above in that chamber is nora nora coughs in parting then she parts b is the back hall through which nora walks c is the back stairs which she treads watts being waiting she treads or is it kinder to say trips with good blithe speed d is the side door and e the side porch now i ask you oh master of engineering and weird mechanical and mathematical mysteries what is to prevent nora from getting from a to e in the interval of time between the coughing and the viewing prescott laughed but wayne only grunted and ominously eyed the chimney place there he cried triumphantly on his feet before his sister as again came the faint but unmistakable little cough a little harder to make a map this time isnt it talk about nerve specialists he started for the door but katie slipped in in front of him and closed it dont go wayne she said quietly queerly prescott thought dont go kate whats the matter with you now dont be foolish katie he admonished with the maddening patronage of the older brother open the door i wish you wouldnt go she sighed plaintively arms outstretched against the door i do hope you wont insist on going youll frighten ann frighten who ann she repeated demurely ann who ann what ann who ann what thats a nice way to speak of my friends its all very well to blow up the world wayne but i think one should retain some of the civilities of life but i dont understand murmured poor wayne no of course not do you understand anything except things that nobody else wants to understand ann is not smokeless powder so i presume you are not interested in her but it seems to me you might tax your brain sufficiently to bear in mind that i told you she was coming im sorry said wayne humbly i dont seem able to recall a word about her i scarcely expected you would was the withering response tell me about her captain prescott asked sympathetically i like girls better than guns has ann another name do i know her katie was bending down inspecting a tear she had discovered at the bottom of her dress oh yes why yes certainly ann has another name her name is forrest no i think you do not know her i dont know that ann knows many army people i knew her in europe then as they seemed waiting for more i am very fond of ann she had resumed her seat and the critical examination of her coffee spoon the men were silent respecting the moment of tender contemplation of her fondness for ann ann is a dear girl she volunteered at last having had it impressed upon me that i am such a duffer captain jones began a little haughtily i naturally hesitate to make many inquiries but i cannot quite get it through my stupid and impossible head just why ann is hidden away in this mysterious manner theres nothing mysterious about it said kate sharply ann was tired and why if i may venture still another blundering question was poor nora held responsible for a cough she never coughed once more miss jones surveyed the torn ruffle at the bottom of her skirt she seemed to be giving it serious consideration i am glad that i do not live in the mississippi valley was the remark she finally raised herself to make one of kates greatest charms wayne informed prescott is the emphasis and assurance with which she unfailingly produces the irrelevant now when you ask her if she likes benedictine dont be at all surprised to have her dreamily murmur but why should oranges always be yellow i am glad that i do not live in the mississippi valley kate went on superiorly ignoring the observation because the joy of living seems to be at a very low ebb out here honestly now do you get that he demanded of his friend ann and i had planned a beautiful surprise for you wayne thanks said wayne drily tonight ann was tired she did not wish to come down to dinner of course i might have told you ann is here to the orderly westpointed mind the well oiled gunconstructing mind i presume that would present itself as the thing to do but ann and i have a sense of the joy of living a delight in the festive in the the bubbling wine of youth you know so we said how beautiful to surprise dear wayne in the morning ann refreshed by the long nights sleep was to go out and gather roses wayne the roses dont bloom until next month brutally interrupted wayne of course you would think of that as we had planned it wayne looking from his window was to see the beautiful girl she is a beautiful girl gathering dewladen roses in the garden perhaps captain prescott chancing at that very moment to look from his window would see her too it was to be a beautiful a nevertobeforgotten moment for you both we humbly apologize laughed prescott hum grunted dear wayne chapter iv she stepped out on the porch for a moment as captain prescott was saying goodnight the moonlight was falling weirdly through the big trees stretching itself over the grass in shapes that seemed to spell unearthly things and there were mystical lights on the water down there flitting about with the movement of the stream as ghosts might flit because it looked so otherworldlike she wondered if it knew what it had just missed she had never thought anything about water save as something to look beautiful and have a good time on it seemed now that perhaps it knew a great deal about things of which she knew nothing at all oh i say jolly night isnt it he exclaimed as they stood at the head of the steps yes said kate grimly pleasant weather isnt it and laughed oddly its great about your friend coming miss forrest she spoke it decisively she arrived this afternoon yes unexpectedly i was never more surprised in my life than when i looked up and saw ann standing there katie was not too impressed to resist toying a little with the situation oh is that so i thought but he was too wellbred to press it of course she hastened to patch together her thread of course as i told wayne i knew that ann was coming but i didnt really expect her until day after tomorrow you see there have been complications oh i see well at any rate its great that shes here she will be with you for the summer anns plans are a little uncertain kate informed him i hope shell not find it dull does she care for golf u m i ann has never played much i believe you see she has lived so much in europe on the continent places where they dont play golf and then ann is not very strong then this is just the place for her great place for loafing you know i hope she is fond of the water kate was leaning against one of the pillars still looking down toward the river it might have been the moonlight made her look so strange as she said with a smile of the same quality as those shadows on the grass why yes in fact anns fondness for the water was the first thing i ever noticed about her i think i might even say it was the water drew us together oh well then that is great we can take the boat and do all sorts of jolly things now i wonder about a horse for her she rides perhaps you had better make no plans for ann she suddenly advised it really would not surprise me at all if she went away tomorrow there is a great deal of uncertainty about the whole thing in fact ann has had a great deal of trouble im sorry he said with a simplicity she liked in him yes a great deal of trouble last year both her father and mother died which was a great blow to her well rather and now there are all sorts of business things to straighten out its really very hard for ann perhaps we can help her he suggested perhaps we can agreed kate her eyes left him to wander across the shadows down to the river again but she came back to him to say and this with the oddest smile of all wouldnt it be a queer sensation for us that thing of really helping some one she could not go to sleep that night for a long time she sat in her room in the same big chair in which ann had sat that afternoon poor ann who had sat there before she knew she was ann who was sleeping now without knowing she was ann for ann was indeed sleeping from her door as kate carefully opened it had come the deep breathing as of an exhausted child who was ann where had she come from how did she get there what had happened why had she wanted to kill herself she wanted to know in truth she was madly curious to know and probably she never would know and what would happen now it suddenly occurred to her that wayne might be rather annoyed at having ann commit suicide but there was a little catch in her laugh at the thought of waynes consternation a long time she sat there wondering where had ann come from she had just seemed whirled out of the nowhere into the there as an unannounced comet in wellordered heavens ann had come from what other world and why did she belong to anybody another pleasant prospect for poor wayne was some one looking for ann would there be things in the paper about her surely a girl could not step out of her life and leave no trail behind things could not close up like that even about ann every one had a place then how could one step from that place without leaving a conspicuous looking vacancy why had ann been dressed that way it seemed a strange costume in which to kill ones self it seemed to katie that one would prefer to meet the unknown in a smaller hat she went to the closet and took out the organdie dress and satin slippers from whence and why thither they opened long paths of wondering the dress was bedraggled about the bottom as though trailed through fields and over roads and so strangely crumpled and so strange the scent a scent hauntingly familiar yet baffling in its relation to gowns a poorly made gown katie noted but effective she tried to read the story but could not read beyond the fact that there was a story the pink satin slippers had broken heels and were stained and soaked they had traveled ground never meant for them something about ann made one feel she was not the girl to be walking about in satin slippers something had happened she had been dressed for one thing and then had done another thing could it be that ever since the night before she had been out of her place in the scheme of things loosened from the great human unit seeking destruction perhaps because she could not regain her place therein where have you been katie murmured to the ruined slippers what did it what do you know what did you want many a pair of just such slippers she had danced to the verge of shabbiness to her they were associated with hops the gayest of music and lightest of laughter brilliant crowds in flowerscented rooms dancing and flirtation the froth and bubble of life but something sterner than waxed floors had wrought the havoc here how much of lifes ground all unknown to her had these poor little slippers trodden was it often like that that the things created for the fun and the joy found the paths of tragedy she had put them away and was at last going to bed when she idly picked up the evening paper what she saw was that the daiseymaisey opera company was playing at the city across the river something made her stand there very still could it be might it not be she did not know would she ever know it drew her back to the girls room she was sleeping serenely with shaded candle katie stood at the door watching her surely the hour was past sleep such as that must draw one back to life lying there in the sweet dignity of her braided hair in that simple lovely gown she might have been ann indeed there was tenderness just then in the heart of katherine wayneworth jones she was glad that this girl who was sleeping as though sleep had been a treasure long withheld was knowing tonight the balm of a good bed glad that she could sink so unquestioningly into the lap of protection protection it was that which one had in a place like this why was it given the anns and not the vernas the sleeping girl seemed to feel that all was well in the house which sheltered her that night suddenly katie knew what it was had gone fear it was terror had slipped back leaving the weariness which can give itself over to sleep katie was thinking striking deeper things than were wont to invade katies meditations the protection of a wayne the chivalrous comradeship of a captain prescott how different the life of an ann from the life this girl might have had she stood at the door for a long moment looking at her with a searching tenderness what had she been through what was there left for her once as a child she had taken a turtle from its native mud and brought it home soon after that they moved into an apartment and her father said that she must give the turtle up but father she had cried you dont understand i took it now how can i throw it away you are right katherine he had replied gravely her dear honorable understanding father it is rather inconvenient to have a turtle in an apartment but as you say responsibilities are greater than conveniences she was thinking of that story as she finally went to bed chapter v nora said katie next morning miss forrest has had a great misfortune nora paused in her dusting all ready with the emotion which katies tone invited she has lost all of her luggage the poor young lady cried good nora yes it is really terrible isnt it everything lost through the carelessness of the railroads you know and such beautiful gowns as they were so so unusual poor miss ann was forced to arrive in a dress most unsuited to traveling and is now quite oh quite destitute nora held her head with both hands speechless didnt you tell me nora that your cousins wife was very clever at sewing at fixing things over yes yes miss kate yesm i wonder nora would she come and help us she would be that glad miss kate she you see miss ann is not very well she poor miss ann i hope you will be very kind to her she is an orphan like you nora nora wiped both eyes and just now it would be too dreadful for her to have to see about a lot of things so i think temporarily we could arrange some of my things let them down a little and perhaps take them in miss ann is a little taller and a little slimmer than i could you send for your cousins wife to help us nora profusely oerflowingly nora affirmed that this would be possible when captain jones came in from the shops for luncheon it was to find his sister installed in the hall one of those roomy halls adapted to all purposes of living some white and pink and blue things strewn around her doing something with a scissors just what she was doing seemed to concern him very little for he sat down at a table near her pulled out some blue prints and began studying them thank heaven for the saving qualities of firearms mused katherine industriously letting out a tuck but luncheon seemed to suggest the social side of life for after they were seated he asked oh yes by the way wheres miss ann is still sleeping replied kate easily she must be a good sleeper ventured wayne ann is tired wayne she said with reproving dignity and as i have already told you several times without seeming to reach through the bullets on your brain not well she is here for a rest she may not come down for several days not what one would call a hilarious guest he commented no less hilarious than zelda fraser katie spitefully mentioned a former guest whom wayne had particularly detested he laughed well who is she what did you say her name was oh wayne she sighed longsufferingly again once again let me tell you that her name is forrest what forrest um i dont believe you know anns people not the major forrest family no not that family not army people at all well what people i cant seem to place her ann is of artistic people her father was a great artist that is he would have been a great artist had he not died when he was very young rather an assumption isnt it that a man would have why not at all if he has done enough during his brief lifetime to warrant the assumption is her mother living oh no said katie irritably certainly not her mother has been dead five years then looking into the dreamy distance and drawing it out as though she loved it her mother was a great musician i shant like her announced wayne decisively she is probably exotic and selfconscious and supercilious and not at all a comfortable person to have about its bad enough for her father to have been a great artist without her mother needs having been a great musician she is simple and sweet and very shy reproved kate so shy that she will doubtless be painfully embarrassed at meeting you and seem well really ill at ease that will be an odd spectacle a young woman of today painfully embarrassed at meeting a man i never saw any of them very ill at ease save when there were no men about anns experiences have not all been happy ones wayne said katie in the manner of the deeply understanding to one of lesser comprehension i hope shell go on sleeping a young woman of artistic people painfully embarrassed unhappy experiences it doesnt sound at all comfortable to me but a little later he said prescott seems to think that daiseymaisey company not bad if you girls would like to go well telephone for seats katie paused in the eating of a peach thank you wayne but i have an idea just a vague sort of idea that ann would not care especially for that shes probably right said wayne returning with relief to the blue prints katies sporting blood was up ann was to be ann never in her life had she been so fascinated with anything as with this creation of an ann i have prepared a place for her she mused over the untucking of the softest of rose pink muslins i have prepared for her a family and a temperament and a sorrow and all that a young woman could most desire from out the nothing a conscious something i have evoked it would be most ungracious ungrateful of ann to refuse to be what i made her i invented her by all laws of decency she must be ann indeed she is ann and katie was truly beginning to think so katies imagination coquetted successfully with conviction ann or more accurately the idea of ann fascinated her never before had she known any one all unencumbered unbound by facts most people were rendered commonplace by the commonplace things one knew about them but ann was as interesting as ones brain could make her anything one choose to think or say about ann could just as well as not be true it swept one all unchained out into a virgin land of fancy there was but one question could ann keep within hailing distance of ones imagination did ann have it in her to live up to the things one wished to believe about her was she capable of taking unto herself the past and temperament with which one would graciously endow her katies sense of justice forced from her the admission that it was expecting a good deal of ann she could see that nothing would be more bootless than thrusting traditions upon people who would not know what to do with them but something about ann encouraged one to believe she could fit into a background prepared for her and if she could would the prospect lured excited it was as inexplicably intoxicating as a grimace at the preacher a wink at the professor it seemed to be saucily tweaking the ear of that insufferably solemn thingsastheyare goddess there was in her eyes the light of battle when nora finally came to tell her that miss forrest was awake but it changed to another light at sight of the girl sitting up in bed so bewilderedly turning upon her eyes which seemed to say and what are you going to do with me now fighting down the lump in her throat katie seized briskly upon that look of inquiry what she needs now she decided is not tears but a high hand next thing on the program she began buoyantly raising the shades and throwing the windows wide is air youre a good patient for you do as youre told its been a fine sleep hasnt it and now i mean to get you into some clothes and take you out for a drive the girl shrank down in the pillows pulling the covers clear to her chin as if to shut herself in she did not speak but shook her head but katie rode right over that look of pain and fear in her eyes refusing to emphasize it by recognition she left the room and returned after a moment with a white flannel suit which she spread out on the bed this is not a bad looking suit is it your dress is scarcely warm enough for driving so i want you to wear this i told nora that your luggage was lost it may be just as well for you to know from time to time what im telling about you i have an idea this suit will be very becoming to you it came from paris i presume im rather foolish about things from paris but they always seem to me to have brought a little life and gayety along theres a dear little white hat and stunning automobile veil goes with this suit i can scarcely wait to see how pretty youre going to look in it all for answer the girl turned to the wall hid her face in the pillows and sobbed kate laid a hand upon her hair soft fine brown hair with tempting little waves and gleams in it there came to her a hideous vision of how that hair might have looked by this time had she not by the merest chance it gave her a feeling of proprietary tenderness for the girl it seemed indeed that this life was in her hands for was it not her hands had kept it a life please she murmured gently persuasively as the sobs grew wilder suddenly the girl raised her head and turned upon katie passionately what do you mean what is this all about i know well enough that people are not like this this is not the way the world is not like what kate asked quietly doing things for people they dont have to do things for taking people into their houses and giving them things their best things treating them as if there was some reason for treating them like that i never heard of such a thing what are you doing it for katie sat there smiling at her calmly do you want to know the honest truth the girl nodded looking at her with anticipatory defiance but that defiance which could so easily crumble to despair very well then she began lightly here goes i dont know that it will sound very well but it has the doubtful virtue of being true the first reason is that it interests me perhaps i should even say amuses me i always did like new things queer things surprises things different and the other reason is that ive taken a sure enough liking to you she had drawn back at the first reason but the bluntness of the first must have conveyed a sense of honesty in the second for like the child who has been told something nice a smile was faintly suggested beneath the tears would you like to hear my favorite quotation from scripture kate wanted to know at thought of katies having a favorite quotation the smile grew a little more defined my favorite quotation is this take no thought for the morrow perhaps it ends in a way that spoils it i would never read the rest of it fearing it would ruin itself but taking just so much and no more and it certainly is your privilege to do that if you wish if all of a thing is good for you part of it must be somewhat good it does make the most comfortable philosophy of life i know of its a great solace to me now when i am seventy i dont doubt i will have lost my teeth losing ones teeth is such a distressing thing that i could sit here and weep bitterly for mine were it not for the sustaining power of my favorite quotation why dont you adopt it for your favorite too and taking no thought for the morrow is there any reason in the world why you shouldnt go out now and have a beautiful drive going for a drive doesnt commit one to any philosophy of life or line of action does it and whatever you do dont ever refuse nice things because you cant see the reason for peoples doing them i shudder to think how much or better how little fun i would have had in life had i first been compelled to satisfy myself i was entitled to it were entitled to nothing most of us thats all the more reason for taking all we can get but come now here are some fresh things yours seem a bit dusty in such wise she rambled on as a bewildered but unresisting girl surrendered herself to her wiles and hands when katie returned from a call to the telephone it was to find ann rubbing her hand over a pretty ankle adorned with the most silky of silken hose likes them katie made of it at sight of the downturned face always wanted them maybe never had them moral if you want people to believe in you give them something they dont need but would like to have she did her hair for her chatting all the while about ways of doing hair exclaiming about the beauty of anns and planning things she was going to do with it were i as proud of all my works as i am of this i might be a more selfrespecting person she said finally passing ann the hand mirror as if the girls one concern in life was to see whether she approved of the plaiting of those soft glossy braids and unmistakably she did approve it does look nice this way doesnt it she agreed looking up at katie with a shy eagerness when at last ann had been made ready when katie had slipped on the long loosely fitted white coat had adjusted the big veil with just the right touch of sophisticated carelessness as she surveyed the work of her hands her excitement could with difficulty contain itself she is ann she gloated her father was a great artist her mother simply couldnt be anything but a great musician and shes lived all her life in italy i think it is oh i know shes from florence why she couldnt be any place but from florence and she doesnt know anything about bridge and scandal and pay and promotion but she knows all about dreaming dreams and seeing visions shes lived a life apart aloof looking at great pictures and hearing great music of course shes a little shy with us she doesnt understand our roistering ways thats part of her being ann but when she came back after getting her own things ann had gone the girl in white was still sitting there in the chair but she was not at all ann things not from florence other things than dreams and visions and great pictures and music had taken hold of her frightened and disorganized again she was huddled in the chair and as katie stood in the doorway she said not a word but shook her head and the eyes told all katie bent over the chair its all up to me she said quietly dont you see that it is you havent a thing in the world to do but follow my lead wont you trust me enough to know that you will not be asked to do anything that would be too hard believe in me enough to feel i will put through anything i begin isnt it rather oh unthrifty to let pasts and futures spoil presents some time soon we may want to talk of the future but just now theres only the present and not a very terrifying present nothing more fearful than winding in and out of the wooded roads of this beautiful place listening to birds and but come changing briskly to the practical and helping her rise as though dismissing the question i hear our horse i see miss jones has got some of her swell friends visitin her a soldier who was cutting grass remarked to a comrade newer to the service great swell they tell me miss jones is they say shes it in washington all right way ahead of some that outranks her got outside money their own money handy aint it he laughed though it aint just the money either her mother was well somebody big dont just recollect the name friendly miss jones is not like some afraid youre going to forget your place the minute she has a civil word with you that one with her is some swell from washington or new york you can tell that by the looks of her all right lord dont they have it easy though chapter vi it would indeed seem so men looking from the windows of the big shops those great shops where army supplies were manufactured noticed them with much the same thought some of them admiringly some resentfully as they chanced to feel about things they drove past building after building buildings in which hundreds of men toiled on preparations for a possible war the throb of those engines sight of the perspiring faces might suggest that rather large a trifle extravagant a bit cumbersome was the price for peace but these girls did not seem to be thinking of the possible war or of the men who earned their bread thwarting it by preparation one would suppose them to be just two beautifully cared for carelessoflife girls thinking of what some man had said at the dance the night before or of the texture of the plume on some ones hat or to get down to the really serious issues of life whether or not they could afford that love of a dinner gown they left the main avenue and were winding in and out of the byroads roads which had all the care of a great park and all the charm of the deep woods here and there were soldiers doing nothing more warlike than raking grass or repairing roads it seemed far removed from the stress and the struggle place where the sense of protection but contributed to the sense of freedom there would come occasional glimpses of the river the beautiful homes and great factories of the busy prosperous middlewestern city opposite to the other side was a town too a little city of large enterprises to either side seethed the questions of steel and all those attendant questions of mind and heart whose pressure grew ever bigger and whose safety valves seemed tested to their uttermost to either side the savage battles of peace and there in between an island the peaceful preparations for war and in such places sheltered detached yet offered all she would have from without had always lived katie jones a favorite child of the favored men whom precautions against war offered so serene a life surrounded by friends who were likewise removed from the battles of peace to the peace of possible war knowing the social struggle only as it touched their own detached questions of pay and rank pleasant and stupid posts hospitable and inhospitable commandants and into this had rushed a victim of the battles of peace from the stony paths of peace there to the wellkept roads of war the irony of it struck katie anew the incongruity of choosing so wellregulated a place for the performance of so disorderly an act as the taking of ones life choosing army headquarters as the place in which to desert from the army of life such an infringement of discipline as seeking selfdestruction in that wellordered spot where the machinery of destruction was so peacefully accumulated she looked covertly at ann she could do it for the girl seemed for the most part unconscious of her she was leaning back in the comfortably rounded corner of the stanhope her hands lax in her lap her eyes often closed a tired child of peace drinking in the peace furnished by the military was ann it was plain that ann was one who could drink things in could draw beauty to her as something which was of her something too it seemed of which she had been long in need could it be that in the big outside world into which these new wonderings were sent world which they seemed to penetrate but such a little way there were many who did not find their own might it not be that some of the most genuine florentines had never been to florence and because all this was of ann it was banishing the things it could not assimilate those hurt looks fretted looks that hard look already kate had come to know them would come but always to go as ann would swiftly raise her head to get the song of a bird or yield her face to the caress of a soft spring breeze katie was grateful to the benign breezes rich with the messages of opening buds full tender restoring which could blow away hard memories and bitter visions yet those same breezes had blown yesterday why could they not reach then what was it had closed the door and shut in those things that were killing ann what were those things that had filled up and choked anns poor soul from a hundred different paths she kept approaching it could not keep away from it one read of those things in the papers they had always seemed to concern a people apart to be pitied but not understood much less reached overwhelming that one who had wished to kill ones self should be enjoying anything that a door so tragically shut should open to so simple a knock mere human voice reach that incomprehensible outermost brink were they not people different but just people like ones self who had simply fallen down in the struggle and only needed some one to help them up give them a cool drink and chance for a moments rest were the big and the little things so close ones own kind and the other kind just one kind after all i love winding roads katie was saying after a long silence i suppose the thing so alluring about them is that one can never be sure just what is around the bend when i was a little girl i used to pretend it was fairies waiting around the next curve and i have never but she drew in her horse sharply for the moment at a loss for it was not fairies but captain prescott riding smilingly toward them very handsome on his fine mount its one of our officers she said sharply i ill have to present him oh please please was the girls panicstricken whisper let me get out i must i cant you can you must commanded katie and then she had just time for just an imploring little for my sake he had halted beside them and katie was saying with her usual cool gaiety you care for this day too do you were fairly steeped in it ann not with the courage to look squarely at her at this moment i present your nextdoor neighbor and a very good neighbor he is we use his telephone when our telephone is discouraged we borrow his books and bridles we eat his bread and salt drink his water and wine especially his wine we impose on him in every way known to good neighboring yes to be sure this is miss forrest of whom i told you last night as the captain was looking at ann and not seeming overpowered with amazement looking on the other hand as though seeing something rarely good to look at katie had the courage to look too and at what she saw her heart swelled quite as the heart of the mother swells when the child speaks his piece unstutteringly ann was doing it rising to the occasion meeting the situation then she had other qualities no less valuable than looking florentine that thing of doing it was a thing that had always commanded the affectionate admiration of katie jones it was not what ann did so much as her effective manner of doing nothing one would not say she lacked assurance one would put it the other way that she seemed shy it seemed to katie she looked for all the world like a startled bird and it also seemed that captain prescott particularly admired startled birds he turned and rode a little way beside them he and katie assuming conversational responsibilities but anns smile warmed her aloofness and her very shyness seemed well adjusted to her fragility and just fits in with what i told him gloated kate and though she said so little for some reason perhaps because she looked so different one got the impression of her having said something unusual she had a way of listening which conveyed the impression she could say things worth listening to if she chose one took her on faith he said to her at the last with that direct boyish smile it seemed could not frighten even a startled bird you think you are going to like it here and ann replied slowly a tremor in her voice and a childs earnestness and sweetness in it too i think it the most beautiful place i ever saw in all my life at the simple enough words his face softened strangely it was with an odd gentleness he said he hoped they could all have some good times together but the moment conquered things which it had called up swept in the whole of it seemed to rush in upon her she turned harshly upon katie this is ridiculous im going away tonight we will talk it over this evening replied kate quietly you will wait for that wont you i have something to suggest and in the end you will be at liberty to do exactly as you think best certainly there can be no question as to that on their way home they encountered the throng of men from the shops dirty greasy alien it was not pleasant meeting the men when one was driving and yet though certainly distasteful they interested katie perhaps just because they were so different she wondered how they lived and what they talked about chancing to look at ann she saw that stranger than the men was the look with which ann regarded them she could not make it out but one thing she did see the soft spring breezes had much yet to do chapter vii wayne had gone over to colonel leonards for bridge kate was to have gone too but had pleaded fatigue the plea was not wholly hollow the last thirty hours had not been restful ones and now she was to go upstairs and do something which she did not know how to do or why she was doing sitting there alone in the library she grew serious in the thought that a game was something more than a game when played with human beings not that seriousness robbed her of the charm that was her own the distinctive thing about katie was that there always seemed a certain light about her upon her coming from her usually it was as iridescent lights dancing upon the water but tonight it was more as one light a more steady deeper light it made her gray eyes almost black made her clearcut nose and chin seem more finely chiseled than they actually were and brought out both the strength and the tenderness of her not very small mouth katies friends when pinned down to it always admitted with some little surprise that she was not pretty they made amends for that however in saying that she just missed being beautiful but thats not what you think of when you see her they would tell you you think what a good sort she must be great fun and there were some few who would add katie is the kind you would expect to find doing splendid service in that last ditch yet even those few were not familiar with the katie jones of that moment for it was a new katie less new when leaning forward tense puzzled hand clenched brow knitted her whole wellknit athletic body at attention than when leaning back lax open to new and awesome things and as though she must come back where she felt acquainted with herself she suddenly began to whistle katie found whistling a convenient and pleasant recepticle for excess emotion she had enjoyed it when a little girl because she had been told it was unladylike kept it up to find out if it were really true that it would spoil her mouth and now liked doing it because she could do it so successfully she was still whistling herself back to familiar things as she ran lightly up the stairs had warmed to a long final trill as she stood in the doorway the girl looked up in amazement she had been sitting there elbows on her knees face in her hands it was hard to see what might have been seen in her face because at that moment the chief thing seen was astonishment katie slipped down among the pillows of the couch an arm curled about her head didnt know i could do that did you she laughed oh yes i have several accomplishments whistling is perhaps the chiefest thereof then next i think would come golf my games not bad then there are a few wizardy things i do with a chafing dish and lastly and after all lastly should be firstly is my genius for getting everything and everybody into a most hopeless mess the girl moved impatiently at first as if determined not to be evaded by that light mood but sight of katie lying there so much as a child would lie seemed to suggest how truly katie might have spoken and she was betrayed into the shadow of a smile i suppose there has never been a human being as gifted in balling things up as i am meditatively boasted kate now here you are she continued plaintively you want to go away well of course thats your affair why should you have to stay here if you dont want to but in the twentyfour hours youve been here i presume ive told twentyfour unnecessary lies to my brother and if you do go away as i admit you have a perfect right to do it will put me in such a compromising position because of those deathless lies that will trail me round through life that oh well she concluded petulantly i suppose ill just have to go away too but the girl put it resolutely from her a wave of sternness swept her face as she said with a certain dignity that made katie draw herself to a position more adapted to the contemplation of serious things thats all very well your pretending trying to pretend that i would be doing you a favor in staying it is so so clever i mean so cleverly kind but i cant help seeing through it and im not going to accept hospitality ive no right to stay here under false pretenses pretend to be what im not why what i couldnt even pretend to be she concluded with bitterness katie was leaning forward all keen interest but do you know i think you could i honestly believe we could put it through and dont you see that it would be the most fascinating altogether jolliest sort of thing for us to try it would be a game a lark the very best kind of sport she saw in an instant that she had wounded her im sorry i would like very much to do something for you after all this but i am afraid this is sport i cannot furnish you i am not im not feeling just like a lark now do you see kate demanded with turbulent gesture talk about balling things up i like you i want you to stay and when i come in here and try and induce you to stay what do i do but muddle things so that youll probably walk right out of the house why was i born like that she demanded in righteous resentment katherine a worldlywise aunt of mine said to me once you have two grave faults one is telling the truth the other is telling lies i have never known you to fail in telling the one when it was a time to tell the other cant you see what a curse it is to mix times that way as one too tired to resist the tide not accepting but going with it for the minute because the tide was kindly and the force to withstand it small the girl her arm upon the table her head leaning wearily upon her hand sat there looking at katie that combination of the nonaccepting and the unresisting which weariness can breed kate seemed in profound thought of course you would naturally be suspicious of me she broke in as if merely continuing the thinking aloud katies fashion of doing that often made commonplace things seem very intimate a statement to which considerable masculine testimony could be affixed i dont blame you in the least id be suspicious too in your place its not unnatural that not knowing me well you should think i had some designs about doing good or helping you and of course nothing makes selfrespecting persons so furious as the thought that some one may be trying to do them good now if i could only prove to you as could be proved that i never did any good in my life then perhaps youd have more belief in me or less suspicion of me i wonder if you would do this could you bring yourself to stay just long enough to see that i am not trying to do you good fancy how i should feel to have you go away looking upon me as an officious philanthropist isnt it only square to give me a chance to demonstrate the honor of my worthlessness still the girl just drifted her eyes now revealing a certain halfamused halfaffectionate tenderness for the tide which would bear her so craftily and speaking of honor moves me to my usual truthtelling blunder and i cant resist telling you that in one respect i really have designs on you but be at peace it has nothing to do with your soul never having so much as discovered my own soul i should scarcely presume to undertake the management of yours but what i do want to do is to feed you eggs no now dont take it that way youre thinking of eggs one orders at a hotel or or a boardinghouse maybe but did you ever eat the eggs that were triumphantly announced by the darlingest bantam she paused beaten back by the things gathering in the girls face tell me the truth it broke what are you doing this for what have you to gain by it i hadnt thought just what i had to gain by it katie stammered at a loss before so fierce an intensity does must one always gain something if you knew the world the girl threw out at her youd know well enough one always expects to gain something but you dont know the world thats plain katie was humbly silent she had thought she knew the world she had lived in the philippines and japan and all over europe and america she would have said that the difference between her and this other girl was in just that thing of her knowing the world being of it but there seemed nothing to say when ann told her so emphatically that she did not know the world the girl seemed on fire no of course not you dont know the world you dont know life thats why you dont know what an unheardof thing youre doing what do you know about me she thrust at her fiercely what do you think about me i think you have had a hard time katie murmured thinking to herself that one must have had hard time and whats that to you whys that your affair its not exactly my affair to be sure katie admitted except that we seem to have been thrown together and as i said theres something about you that ive taken a fancy to it drew her but she beat it back resistance made her face the more stern as she went on do you think im going to impose on you just because you know so little why with all your cleverness youre just a baby when it comes to life shall i tell you what life is like her gaze narrowed and grew hard life is everybody fighting for something and knocking down everybody in their way life is people who are strong kicking people who are weak out of their road then going on with a laugh a laugh loud enough to drown the groans life is lying and scheming to get what you want life is not caring giving up getting hardened i know it i loathe it katie sat there quite still she was frightened and you here in a place like this what do you know about it why youre nothing but an outsider an outsider was she and she had thought that ann the girls passion seemed suddenly to flow into one long cunning look what are you doing it for she asked quietly with a sort of insolently indifferent suspicion i dont know katie replied simply at least until a minute ago i didnt know and now i wonder if perhaps without knowing it i was not trying to make up for some of those people for i fear some of them were friends of mine who have gone ahead by kicking other people out of their way perhaps their kicks provided my laughs perhaps unconsciously it bothered me passion had burned to helplessness the appealing helplessness of the weary child she sat there hands loosely clasped in her lap looking at katie with great solemn eyes tired wistful mouth and it seemed to kate that she was looking not at her but at life that life which had cast her out looking not with rage now but with a hurt reproachfulness in which there was a heartbreaking longing it drew katie over to the table she stretched her hand out across it as if seeking to bridge something and spoke with an earnest dignity you say im an outsider then wont you take me in i dont want to be an outsider you mustnt think too badly of me for it because you see i have just stayed where i was put but i want to know life i love it now and yet easy and pleasant though it is i cant say that i find it very satisfying i have more than once felt it was cheating me im not getting enough just because i dont know loving a thing because you dont know it isnt a very high way of loving it is it i believe i could know it and still love it love it indeed the more truly no you dont think so but i want to try she paused thinking then saw it and spoke it strongly ive never done anything real ive never done anything that counted thats why im an outsider if making a place for you here is going to make one for me there on the inside i mean youre not going to refuse to take me in are you something seemed to leap up in the girls eyes but to crouch back afraid what do you know about me she whispered not much only that youve met things i never had to meet met them much better doubtless than i should have met them only that youve fought in the real while ive flitted around here on the playground katies eyes contracted to keenness and i wonder if there isnt more dignity in fighting yes and losing in the real than just sitting around where you get nothing more unpleasant than the faint roar of the guns to lose fighting or not to fight why certainly there can be no question about it what do i know about you she came back to it only that you seemed just shot into my life strangely disturbing it ruffling it so queerly its too ruffled now to settle down without more ruffling so youre not going away leaving it in any such distressing state are you she concluded with a smile which lighted her face with a fine seriousness she made a last stand but you dont know you dont understand no i dont know and dont think i ever need know as a matter of obligation but should there ever come a time when you feel i would understand understand enough to help then i should be glad and proud to know for it would make me feel i was no longer an outsider and let me tell you something in whatever school you learned about life theres one thing they taught you wrong theyve developed you too much in suspicion they didnt give you a big enough course in trust all the people in this world arent designing and cruel why the old globe is just covered with beautiful people who are made happy in doing things for the people about them i havent met them were the words which came from the sob i see you havent thats why i want you to your education has been onesided so has mine perhaps we can strike a balance what would you think of our trying to do that the wonder of it seemed stealing up upon the girl growing upon her you mean she asked in slow hushed voice that i should stay here here as a friend of yours stay here as a friend and become a friend came the answer quick and true so true that it went straight to the girls heart tears came different tears tears which were melting something and yet once again she whispered but i dont understand try to understand stay here with me and learn to laugh and be foolish thatll help you understand and if youre ever in the least oppressed with a sense of obligation horrid thing isnt it just put it down with but she likes it its fun for her for really now ann i hope this is not going to hurt you but i simply cant help getting fun out of things i get fun out of everything its my great failing not a particularly unkind sort of fun though i dont believe youll mind it as you get used to it my friends all seem to accept the fact that i enjoy them and then my curiosity well like the eggs its not entirely to make you stronger its to see whether the things ive always heard about milk and eggs are really so see how it works not altogether for the good of the works you see oh i dont know motives are slippery things dont you think so mine seem particularly athletic they hop from their pigeon holes and turn handsprings and do all sorts of stunts the minute i turn my back so i never know for sure why i want to do a thing for that matter i dont know why i named you ann i had to give you a name i thought you might prefer my not using yours so all in a flash i had to make one up and ann was what came i love that name it never would have come if something in you hadnt called it the ann in you has had a hard time she was speaking uncertainly timidly as if on ground where words had broken no paths oh im not so much the outsider i cant see that but the ann in you has never died that i see too maybe it was to save ann you were going to give up verna and because i see ann like her because i called her back wont you let her stay here and katies voice broke so to offset that she cocked her head and made a wry little face as she concluded not succeeding in concealing the deep tenderness in her eyes just try the eggs chapter viii katie was writing to her uncle the bishop at least that was what she would have said she was doing to be literal she was nibbling at the end of her pen writing to her uncle had never been a solemn affair with kate she gossiped and jested with him quite as she would with a playfellow it was playfellow rather than spiritual adviser he had always been to her kates need seeming rather more for playfellows than for spiritual advisers but the trouble that morning was that the things of which she was wont to gossip and jest seemed remote and uninteresting things finally she wrote my friend ann forrest is with us now i am hoping to be able to keep her for some time poor dear she has not been well and has had much sorrow such a story and i think the peace of things here peace you know uncle being poetic rendition of stupidity is just what ann needs a robin on a lilac bush entered passionate protest against the word stupidity what will you have what will you have trilled the robin in joyous frenzy wise robin after all what would one have and when within the world of may that robins love one was finding a whole undiscovered country to explore no i dont mean that about stupidity she wrote after a wide look and a deep breath it does seem peace peace that makes some other things seem stupidity i must be tired for you will be saying dear uncle that a yearning for peace has never been one of the most conspicuous of my attributes there she fell to nibbling again looking over at the girl in the deep garden chair in the choice corner of the big porch my friend ann forrest katie murmured smiling strangely her friend ann forrest was turning the leaves of a book days in florence which kate had left carelessly upon the arm of the chair she commended to ann it was after watching her covertly for sometime that katie set down a little elf dancing in her eye yet something of the seer in that very eye in which the elf danced of course you have heard me tell of ann the girl to whom i was so devoted in italy i should think uncle that you of the cloth would find ann a most interesting subject not that shes of your flock her mother was a passionate catholic her father a relentless atheist he wrote a famous attack on the church which ann tells me hastened her mothers death the conflict shows curiously in ann when we were together in florence a restlessness would many times come upon her she would say you go on home katie without me i have things to attend to i came to know what it meant once i followed her and saw her go to the church and literally fling herself into its arms in a passion of surrender and that night she sat up until daybreak reading her fathers books you see what i mean a wealth of feeling but always pulled two ways it has left its mark upon her she read it over gloated over it and destroyed it uncle would be coming on the next train she saw hed hold ann up for a copy of the attack and why this mad passion of mine for destruction should a man walking on a tightrope yield to every playful little desire to chase butterflies but as she looked again ann was deep in the illustrations of days in florence and could be surveyed with impunity she wondered if she might not have written better than she knew her choice of facts doubtless was preposterous enough what had been the conflicting elements her fancy might wander far afield in finding that but she was sure she saw truly in seeing marks of conflict life had pulled her now this way now that as if playing some sort of cruel game with her and that game had left her very tired tired as some lovely creature of the woods is tired after pursuit and fearful with that fear of the hunted from which safety cannot rescue it was in anns eyes that looking out from shadowy retreat that pain of pain remembered that fear which fear has left katie had seen it once in the eyes of an exhausted fawn who fleeing from the searchers for the stag had come full upon the waiting hunt in face of the frantic hounds in leash the terror in those eyes that should have been so soft and gentle the sick certitude of doom where there should have been the glad joy of life struck the death blow to katies ambitions to become the mighty huntress she had never joined another hunt or wished to hear another story of the hunt saying she flattered herself she could be resourceful enough to gain her pleasures in some other way than crazing gentle creatures with terror ann made her think of that quivering fawn suggesting as the fawn had suggested what life might have been in a woods uninvaded she had a vision of ann as the creature of pure delight she had been fashioned to be loving life and not knowing fear from which musings she broke off with a hearty good drive and ann looked up inquiringly she pointed to the teeing ground some men were just leaving caddies straggling on behind two girls driving in a runabout along the river road calling gaily over to the men it all seemed sunny and unfettered as the morning ill wager he feels good she laughed i know no more exhilarating feeling than that thing of having just made a good drive it makes life seem at your feet you must play ann im going to teach you do all those people belong here ann asked still looking at the girls who were calling laughingly back and forth to the men on the island oh no they belong over there she nodded to the city which rose upon the hills across the river but they use these links dont they dont they have to work ann asked timidly oh yes laughed katie i fancy most of them work some though whats the good working a morning like this i think theyre very wise but look now at the hope of the future hes certainly working the hope of the future was ascending the steps heavily burdened so heavily was he burdened that for the moment ascent looked impossible each arm was filled with a shapeless bundle of white and yellow fur which closer inspection revealed as the collie pups with each step the hind legs of a wriggling puppy slipped a little farther through worths arms when finally he stood before them only a big puppy head was visible underneath each shoulder approaching ann then backing around he let one squirming pair of legs rest on her lap freed his arm and ann had the puppy you can play with him a little while he remarked graciously worth said katie it is unto my friend miss forrest known in the intimacies of the household as miss ann that you have just made this tender offering worth took firm hold on his remaining puppy and stood there surveying ann i came last night he volunteered after what seemed satisfactory inspection ann just smiled at him rumpling the puppys soft woolly coat how long you been here he asked cordially just two days she told him im going to stay all summer he announced hoisting his puppy a little higher thats nice said ann her puppy was climbing too how long you goin to stay he wanted to know miss ann is going to stay just as long as we are real nice to her worthie said katie looking up from the magazine she was cutting she can play with the puppies every morning aunt kate he cried in a fervent burst of hospitality you got a dog at home he asked of ann at the silence katie looked up the puppy was now cuddled upon anns breast her two arms about it as she shook her head her chin brushed the soft puppy fur then buried itself in it her eyes deepened it must be just the dreadfulest thing there is not to have a dog worth condoled there was no response the puppys head was on anns shoulder he was ambitious to mount to her face didnt you never have a dog worth asked drawling it out tragically the head nodded yes but the eyes did not grow any more glad at thought of once having had a dog worth took a step nearer and lay an awed hand upon her arm did he die she nodded her face had grown less sorrowful than hard it was the look of that first day worth shook his head slowly to express deep melancholy its awful to have em die mine died once i cried and cried and cried then papa got me a bigger one he waited for confidences which did not come ann was holding the puppy tight didnt your papa get you nother one he asked as one searching for the best worth dear called katie lets talk about the live puppies there are so many live puppies in the world and just see how the puppy loves miss ann and miss ann loves the puppy mustnt squeeze him too tight he admonished watts says its bad for em to squeeze em watts knows just everything bout puppies he knows when they have got to eat and when they have got to sleep and when they ought to have a bath do you suppose aunt kate well ever know as much as watts probably not dont hitch your wagon to too far a star worthie no use smashing the wagon suddenly ann had squeezed her puppy very tight o h cried worth you mustnt i like to do it too but watts says it squeezes the grows out of em its hard not to squeeze em though aint it he concluded with tolerance again katie looked up the girl holding the puppy close was looking at the little boy something long beaten back seemed rushing on and in her eyes was the consciousness of its having been long beaten back something of which did not escape the astute wayne the worthy aunt kate he called excitedly aunt kate miss anns eyes go such a long way down worth im not at all sure that it is the best of form for a grownup young gentleman of six summers to be audibly estimating the fathomless depths of a young womans eyes note well the word audibly worthie they go farther down than yours aunt kate um yes another remark better left with the inaudible it looks it looks as if there was such a lot of cries in them o h ones coming now worth she called sharply come here you mustnt talk to miss ann about cries dear when you talk about cries it brings the cries and when you talk about laughs the laughs come and miss ann is so pretty when she laughs miss ann is pretty all the time announced gallant worth she has a mouth like a mouth like she has a mouth like yes dear i understand when they say she has a mouth like a mouth like i know just what kind of mouth they mean but how do you know aunt kate i didnt say what kind did i no but as years and wisdom and guile descend upon you you will learn that sometimes the surest way of making ones self clear is not to say what one means but i dont see no one doesnt at six wait till youve added twenty thereto aunt kate yes how old is miss ann worth when this twenty im talking about has been added on you will know that never never never must one speak or think or dream of a ladys age why not oh because it brings the cries lots of times he had seated himself on the floor the puppy was in spasms of excitement over the discovery of a considerable expanse of bare legs are they sorry theyre not as old as somebody else he asked trying to get his legs out of the puppys lurching reach no theyre usually able to endure the grief brought them by that thought aunt kate oh yes it was a good story would miss ann be sorry shes not as old as you hateful ungrateful little wretch aunt kate i am all attention wayneworth she said with inflection which should not have been wasted on ears too young do you know aunt kate sometimes i dont know just what youre talking about no really and this from your sex to mine do you always say what you mean aunt kate very seldom why not somebody might find out what i thought dont you want them to know what you think aunt kate he pursued making a complete revolution and for the instant evading the frisking puppy certainly not but why not aunt kate squirming as the puppy placed a long warm lick right below the knee oh i dont know the story was getting better then looking up with kates queer smile it might hurt their feelings why would it oh wayneworth jones why were you born with your brain cells screwed into question marks and why do i have to go through life getting them unscrewed she actually read a paragraph and as there she had to turn a page she looked over at ann anns puppy had joined worths on the floor and together they were indulging in bites of puppyish delight at the little boys legs at each others tails at so much of the earths atmosphere as came within range of their newly created jaws craving the exercise of their function mad with the joy of living were those two collie pups on that essentially live and joyous morning and ann if not mad with the joy of living seemed sensible of the wonder of it days in florence open on her lap hands loose upon it she was looking off at the river from hard thoughts of other days kate could see her drawn to that day its softness and sunshine its breath of the river and breath of the trees folded in the arms of that day was ann just then the breeze stirred a little wisp of hair on her temple gently swayed the knot of ribbon at her throat the spring was wooing ann her face softened as she listened was it something of that same force which bounded boisterously up in boy and dogs which was stealing over ann softening healing claiming the next paragraph of the story on the printed page was less interesting aunt kate said worth gathering both puppies into his arms as they were succeeding all too well in demonstrating that they were going to grow up and be real dogs watts says it is the ungodliest thing he knows of that these puppies havent got any names i am glad to learn murmured kate that watts is a true son of the church he yearns for a christening he says that being as nobody else has thought up names for them he calls the one that is most yellow mike and the one that is most white pat do you think mike and pat are pretty names aunt kate well i cant say that my esthetic sense fairly swoons with delight at sound of mike and pat she laughed ill tell you worthie she suggested looking up with twinkling eye after her young nephew had been experimenting with various intonations of mike pat pat mike why dont you call one of them pourquoi he walked right into it with the neverfailing why just so call one pourquoi and the other nestcepas they do good team work in both the spirit and the letter pourquoi worth is your favorite word in french need i add that it means why and nestcepas well watts would say nestcepas meant aint it and more flexible translators find it to mean anything they are seeking to persuade you is true pourquoi is the inquirer and nestcepas the universalist i trust watts will give this his endorsement ill ask him gravely replied worth and sought to accustom the puppies to their new names with chanting poor qua nessa pa the chant grew so melancholy that the puppies subsided oppressed overpowered perhaps with the sense of being anything as large and terrible as inquirer and universalist but worth was too true a son of the army to leave a brooding damsel long alone in the corner you seen the new cow was his friendly approach why i dont believe i have she confessed i spose youve seen the chickens he asked a trifle condescendingly ann shamefacedly confessed that she had not as yet seen the chickens he took a step backward for the weighty crushing well youve seen the horses havent you aunt kate aunt kate he called peremptorily as ann humbly shook her head miss anns not seen the cow or the chickens nor the horses isnt it scandalous agreed kate it shows what sort of hostess i am doesnt it but you see worth i thought as long as you were coming so soon you could do the honors of the stables i think its always a little more satisfactory to have a man do those things ill take you now announced worth in manner which brooked neither delay nor gratitude and so the girl and the little boy and the two puppies the joy of motion freeing them from the sad weight of inquirer and universalist started across the lawn for the stables pourquoi caught at anns dress and she had to be manfully rescued by worth and no sooner had the inquirer been loosened from one side than the universalist was firmly fastened to the other and the rescue must be enacted all over again amid considerable confusion and laughter anns laugh was borne to katie on a wave of the spring just the laugh of a girl playing with a boy and his dogs it was a whole hour later and as kate was starting out for golf she saw ann and worth sitting on the sandpile a tired inquirer and very weary universalist asleep at their feet ann was picking sand up in her hands and letting it sift through worth was digging with masculine vigor kate passed close enough to hear anns well once upon a time ann opening to a little child the door of that wondrous country of once upon a time no mother had ever done it more sweetly with more tender zeal more loving understanding of the joys and necessities of once upon a time some once upon a time notions of kates were quite overturned by that once upon a time voice of anns then the once upon a time of the sandpile did not shut them out they who had known another once upon a time did it perhaps love to take them in knowing that upon the sands of this once upon a time the other could keep no foothold once upon a time once upon a time it kept singing itself in her ears for her too it opened a door chapter ix having conquered the son katie that evening set vigorously about for the conquest of the father the trouble is she turned it over in giving a few minutes to her own toilet for dinner after having given many minutes to anns that theres simply no telling about wayne he is just the most provokingly uncertain man now living and yet it was not a formidable looking man she found in the library a few minutes before the dinner hour he was poring over some pictures of panama in one of the weeklies sufficiently deep in them to permit katie to sit there for the moment pondering methods of attack but instead of outlining her campaign she found herself concluding what she had concluded many times before that wayne was very goodlooking not handsome like harry prescott she granted but wayne seems the product of something the result of things to be desired he hasnt a new look katherine is going to give us more trouble than wayne ever will their mother had sighed after one of those escapades which made life more colorful than restful during katies childhood to which major jones replied that while kate might give them more trouble he thought it probable wayne would give himself the more certain it had been from the first that if wayne could help it no one would know what trouble he might be giving himself oldfashioned folk who expected brothers and sisters to be alike had on the surface at least a sorry time with wayneworth and katherine jones katie was sunny katie had a genius for play she laughed and danced up and down the highways and the byways of life and she had such a joyous time about it that it had not yet occurred to any one to expect her to help pay the fiddler just watching katie dance would seem pay enough for any reasonable fiddler katie laughed a great deal and was smiling most of the time she seemed always to have things in her thoughts to make smiles wayne laughed little and some of his smiles made one understand how the cat felt about having its fur rubbed the wrong way their friend major darrett once said when i meet katie i have a fancy she has just come from a jolly dip in the ocean that she lay on the sands in the sun and kicked up her heels longer than she had any business to and now shes flying along to keep the most enchanting engagement she ever had in all her life shes smiling to herself to think how bad she was to lie in the sand so long and shes not at all concerned because she knows her friends will be so happy to see her that theyll forget to scold her for being late katies spoiled the major concluded but we like her that way of wayne this same friend remarked waynes a hard nut to crack many army people felt that way in fact wayne was a nut the army itself had not quite cracked some army people maintained that wayne was disagreeable but that may have been because he was not just like all other army people he did not seem to have grasped the idea that being army set him apart sometimes he made the mistake of judging army affairs by ordinary standards that was when they got some idea of how the cat felt and of all cats an army cat would most resent having its fur rubbed in any but the prescribed direction katie continuing her ruminations about wayne as the product of things had come to see that with it all he was detached from those desirable things which had produced him one knew that wayne had traditions yet he was not tradition fettered he suggested ancestors without being ancestor conscious was it the gun as wayne the worthy persisted in calling it and the guns predecessors for wayne always had something made him so distinctly more than the mere result of things which had formed him it is the gun katie decided taking him in with half shut eyes as a portrait painter might had the same ancestors myself and yet im both less and more of them than he is what i needs a gun then id stand out of the background better too then with one of katies queer twists of fancy ann might not ann be her gun perhaps she had been wanting a gun for a long time without knowing what it was she was wanting when surely wanting something perhaps every one felt the gun need to make them less the product and more the person then there was another thing the thing that had traced those lines about waynes mouth and had whitened a little the brown hair of his temples wayne had cared for clara heaven only knew how he could katies thoughts ran on perhaps heaven did understand those things certainly it was too much for mere earth why wayne about whom there had always seemed a certain brooding bigness certainly a certain rare indifference should have fallen so absurdly in love with the most vain and selfish and vapid girl that ever wrecked a post was more than katie could make out and it had been her painful experience to watch waynes disappointment develop watch that happiness which had so mellowed him recede as day by day clara fretted and pouted and showed plainly enough that to her love was just a convenient thing which might impel ones husband to get one a new set of furs she remembered so well one evening she had been in claras room when wayne came in after having been away since early morning so eager and tender was waynes face as he approached clara who was looking over an advertising circular there was a light in his eyes which it would seem would have made clara forget all about advertising circulars but before he had said a word but stood there loving her with that look and it would have to be admitted clara did look lovely in one of the neglige affairs she affected so much she said with a babyish little whine she evidently thought alluring i just dont see wayne why we cant have a new rug for the reception room we can certainly afford things as well as the mitchells and wayne had just stood there with a smile which closed the gates and said with an irony not lost upon katie at least why i fancy we can have a new rug if that is the thing most essential to our happiness clara had cried oh wayne you dear and twittered and fluttered around but the twittering and fluttering did not bring that light back to waynes face he went over to the far side of the room and began reading the paper and that grim little understanding smile a smile at himself made katie yearn to go over and wind her arms about his neck dear strange wayne who had believed there was so much and found so little and who was so alive to the bitter humor of being drawn to the heart of things only to be pushed back to the outer rim but katie knew it was not her arms could do any good and so she had left the room not cleareyed clara still twittering about the kind of rug she would have and day by day she had watched wayne go back to the outer circle that grim little smile as milestones in his progress but he was folding his paper it was growing too near the hour to speculate longer on wayne and his past wayne she began he looked up smiling at the beseeching tone yes what is it katie just what brand of boredom are you planning to inflict you can be so nice wayne when you want to be um hum a none too subtle way of calling a man a brute i presume there are times when you cant help being a brute wayne but i do hope tonight will not be one of them why it must be something very horrible indeed that you must approach with all this flaunting of diplomacy it is something a long way from horrible i assure you she replied with dignity ann will be down for dinner tonight wayne he leaned back and devoted himself to his cigarette with maddening deliberation then he smiled through sleeping wayne im in earnest please dont get yourself into a hateful mood he laughed in real amusement at sight of katies puckered face i am conscious that feminine wiles are being exercised upon me i wonder why because i am so anxious you should like ann wayne and be nice to her why again it was that probing provoking why because of what she means to me i suppose something in her voice made him look at her differently and what does she mean to you katie ann is different from all the other girls ive known she means something different strange ive never heard you speak of her i think you have and have forgotten though possibly not just because of the way i feel about her she paused seeking to express how she felt about her unable to do so she concluded simply i have a very tender feeling for ann i see you have he replied quietly he looked at her meditatively and then asked humorously but gently well katie what were you expecting me to do order her out of the house but i want you to be more than civil wayne i want you to be sympathetic ill be civil and you can bring prescott on for the sympathetic he laughed you know i havent great founts of sympathy gushing up in my heart for the jeune fille anns not the jeune fille wayne shes something far more interesting and worth while than that she paused again trying to get it but could do no better than i sometimes think of ann as sitting a little apart listening to beautiful music he smiled i can only reply to that katie that i trust she is more inviting than your pictures of her a young woman who looked as though sitting apart listening to beautiful music should certainly be left sitting apart ill bring her down laughed kate rising then you can get your own picture ill be decent katie he called after her in laughing but reassuring voice the meeting had been accomplished dinner had reached the salad and all was well yes and a little more than well from the moment she stood in the doorway of anns room and the girl rose at her suggestion of dinner katies courage had gone up anns whole bearing told that she was on her mettle and what katie found most reassuring was less the results of the effort ann was making than her unmistakable sense of the necessity for making it there was hope in that not that she suggested anything so hopeless as effort she suggested reserve feeling and she was so beautiful so rare that the suggestion was of feeling more beautiful and rare than a determination to live up to the way she was gowned her timidity was of a quality which seemed related to things of the spirit rather than to social embarrassment jubilantly kate saw that ann meant to put it over and her depth of feeling on the subject suggested a depth which in itself dismissed the subject she saw at a glance that wayne related ann to the things her appearance suggested rather than to the suggestions causing that appearance as katie said ann i am so glad that at last my brother is to know you she was thinking that it seemed a friend to whom one might indeed be proud to present ones brother she never lost the picture of the ann whom wayne advanced to meet she loved her in that rose pink muslin the skirt cascaded in oldfashioned way an oldfashioned looking surplice about the shoulders and on her long slim throat a lovely florentine cameo swinging on the thinnest of old silver chains she might have been a cameo herself and she never forgot the way ann said her first words to wayne they were two most commonplace words merely the thank you with which she responded to his hospitable greeting but that thank you seemed let out of a whole under sea of feeling for which it would try to speak before wayne could carry out his unmistakable intention of saying more katie was airily off into a story about the cook dragging it in with a thin hook about the late dinner and the cook in the present case suggested a former cook in washington whom katie held and sought to prove nature had ordained for a great humorist the ever faithful subject of cooks served stanchly until they had reached the safety of soup katie was in storytelling mood she seemed to have an inexhaustible fund of them in reserve which she could deftly strap on as lifepreserver at the first far sign of danger and she would flash into her stories an as you said ann or as you would put it ann whenever she found anything to fit the ann she would create several times however the rescuing party had to knock down good form and trample gentle breeding under foot to reach the spot in time wayne spoke of a friend in vienna from whom he had heard that day and turned to ann with an interrogation about the viennese katie contemplating the suppleness of anns neck momentarily asleep at her post missed the come over and help us look and ann had begun upon a fatal i have never been in when katie with ringing laugh broke in isnt it odd ann that you should never have been in vienna when you lived all those years right there in florence i do think it the oddest thing ann agreed that it was odd wayne concurring but driven from vienna he sought florence and italy i presume i go on record as the worst sort of bounder in asking if you really care greatly about living there katie thought it time ann try a stroke for herself one would never develop strength on a lifepreserver seeing that she had it to make she paused before it an instant fear seemed to be feeling and a possible sense of the absurdity of her situation made for a slightly tremulous dignity as she said i do love it love it so much it is hard to tell just how much or why and then it was as if she shrank back having uncovered too much she looked as though she might be dreaming of the court of the uffizi or santa maria novella but katie surmised that that dreamy look was not failing to find out what wayne was going to do with his lettuce but one who suggested dreams of tuscany when taking observations on the use of the salad fork was there not hope unbounded for such a one wayne was silent for the moment as though getting the fact that the love of italy or perhaps its associations was to this girl not a thing to be compressed within the thin vein of dinner talk well he laughed understanding to be sure i dont know it from the inside i never was of it i merely looked at it and i thought the plumbing was abominable wayne scoffed kate plumbing indeed have you no soul yes i have and bad plumbing is bad for it ann laughed quite blithely at that and as though finding confidence in the sound of her own laugh she boldly volunteered a stroke i dont know much about plumbing katie heard ann saying i suppose perhaps it is bad but do you care much about plumbing when looking at her pause before it might have been one of reverence the madonna of the chair katie treated herself to a particularly tender bit of lettuce and secretly hugged herself ann and days in florence the madonna of the chair furnished the frontispiece for that valuable work ann had receded flushed her lip trembling a little wayne was looking at her thoughtfully and a little as one might look at the madonna of the chair katie heard the trump of duty call her to another story chapter x feeling that first efforts even on lifepreservers should not be long ones it was soon after they returned to the library that katie threw out well ann if that letter must be written ann rose yes and it must but morning is the time for letter writing urged wayne morning in this instance is the time for shopping said kate she had left ann at the foot of the stairs murmuring something about having to see nora it was a half hour later that she looked in upon her what she saw was too much for katie had the whole of creation been wrecked by her laughing katie must needs have laughed just then for anns two hands gripped days in florence with fierce resolution anns head was bent over the book in a sort of stern frenzy ann not even having waited to disrobe was attacking florence as the good old city had never been attacked before she seemed to get the significance of katies laugh however for it was as to a confederate she whispered ill get caught trust me said kate and laughed from a new angle ann could laugh too and when katie sat down to talk it over they were that most intimate of all things in the world two girls with a secret two girls set apart from all the world by that secret they held from all the world hugging between them a beautiful brilliant secret and laughing at the rest of the world because it couldnt get in that secret shared and recognized and laughed over and loved did what no amount of sympathy or gratitude could have done it was as if the whole situation heaved a sigh of relief and settled itself in more comfortable position why no sparkled kate in response to anns protestation the only thing you have to do is not to try lovers of italy must take their italy with a superior calm and when you dont know what to say just seem too full for utterance that being too full for utterance throws such a safe and lovely cover over the lack of utterance and if you fear youre mixed up just look as though you were going to cry wayne will be so terrified at that prospect that hell turn the conversation to airships and youll always be safe with wayne in an airship because hell do all the talking himself ann grew thoughtful she seemed to have turned back to something katie would have given much to know what it was anns deep brown eyes were surveying so somberly the strange part of it is she said i used to dream of some such place of course you did thats why you belong there a great deal more than some of us whove tramped miles through galleries then swiftly katie changed her position her expression and the conversation elizabeth barrett browning is your favorite poet isnt she ann why why no stammered ann im afraid i havent any favorite you see so much the better then you can take elizabeth without being untrue to any one else she loved florence you know shes buried there i think you used to make pilgrimages to her tomb again ann turned back and at what she saw smiled a little half bitterly half wistfully id like to have made pilgrimages somewhere to be sure you would thats why you did the things we would like to have done and would have done if we could are lots more part of us than just the things we did do because we had to do them just consider that all those things youd like to have done are things you did it will make you feel at home with yourself and tomorrow well go over the river and order elizabeth barrett browning and a tailored suit but with that the girl who would like to have done things receded leaving baldly exposed the girl who had done the things she had had to do no said ann stubbornly and sullenly but blue gingham morning dress and rosecolored evening dress are scarcely sufficient unto ones needs murmured kate ann turned away her head i cant take things not things like that but why not pursued kate why cant you take as well as i can take she turned upon her hotly as if resentful of being toyed with how silly it is yours katie had said it at random but once expressed it interested her why i dont know whether it is or not she said suddenly more interested in the idea itself than in its effect upon ann why is it i didnt earn it theres no use talking that way its yours because youve got it that not seeming to bring ethical satisfaction she added its yours because your family earned it katie was unfastening the muslin gown but as a matter of fact getting more and more interested they didnt they didnt earn it they just got it what they earned they had to use to live on this that is left over is just something my grandfather fell upon through luck then why should it be mine now any more than yours ann deemed her intelligence insulted thats ridiculous well now i dont know whether it is or not she was silent for a moment considering it but anyhow she came back to the issue we have our hands on this money so well get the suit youre in the army now ann youre enlisted under me and ill have no insubordination you know into the jaws of death even so into the jaws of elizabeth barrett browning and a tailormade suit so katie laughed herself out of the room and softly she whistled herself back into the library the whistling did not seem to break through the smoke which surrounded wayne after several moments of ostentatious indifference she threw out at him with a conspicuous yawn well wayne what did you think of the terrifying jeune fille waynes reply was long in coming simple quiet and queer shes a lady startled peculiarly gratified impishly delighted she yet replied lightly a lady is she um once at school one of the girls said she had a tradelast for me and after i had searched the closets of memory and dragged out that some one had said she had pretty eyes dressed it up until this some one had called her ravishingly beautiful after all that conscientious dishonesty what does she tell me but that some one had said i was so cleanlooking one rather takes cleanlooking for granted even so with our friends being ladies quaint old word for you to resurrect wayne yes he laughed quite quaint but she seems to me just that oldfashioned thing our forefathers called a lady now we have good fellows and thoroughbreds and belongers not many of this girls type katie wanted to chuckle but suddenly the unborn chuckle dissolved into a sea of awe thoughts and smoke seemed circling around wayne together and perhaps the blue rim of it all was dreams his face was not what one would expect the face of a man engaged in making warfare more deadly to be as he murmured not to katie but to the thin outer rim softly as to rims barely material and more than that a woman he puzzled her well wayne she laughed arent you getting a little cryptic i certainly told you by implication that she was both a lady and a woman then why this air of discovery but it did not get katie into the smoke he made no effort to get her in but after a moment came back to her with a kindly i am glad you have such a friend katie it will do you good that inward chuckle showed no disposition to dissolve into anything it fought hard to be just a live healthy chuckle moved by an impulse half serious half mischievous she asked you would say then wayne that ann seems to you more of a lady than zelda fraser waynes real answer lay in his look of disgust he did condescend to put into words oh dont be absurd katie but zelda has a splendid ancestry she pressed and suggests a chorus girl that stilled her it left her things to think about at last she asked and wayne which would you say i was he came back from a considerable distance which of what lady or chorus girl he looked at her and smiled katie was all aglow with the daring of her adventure i should say katie dear that you were a halfbreed what a sounding thing to be but major darrett in his last letter tells me i am his idea of a thoroughbred how can i be a halfbreed if im a thoroughbred true it makes you a biological freak but you should be too original to complain of that but i do complain it sounds like something with three legs not but what id rather be a biological freak than a grind or a prude be at peace drily advised wayne ann was quiet tonight mused katie feeling an irresistible desire to get back to her post of duty not because there was any need for her being there but merely because she liked the post she felt a little strange i think she has been much alone and with people of a different sort and i presume it never occurred to you katie that neither ann nor i was fairly surfeited with opportunities for conversational initiative just drop me a hint sometime when you are not going to be at home will you i should like a chance to get acquainted with your friend katie was straightway the hen with feathers ruffled over her brood you must be careful wayne she clucked at him when you are alone with ann please try to avoid all unpleasant subjects or anything you see she would rather not talk about thanks awfully for the hint returned wayne quietly i had been meaning to speak first of her fathers funeral i thought i would follow that with a searching inquiry into her mothers last illness but of course if you think this not wise i am glad to be guided by your judgment katie wayne she reproached laughingly now you know well enough i simply meant if you saw ann wished to avoid a subject not to pursue it thanks again dear sister kate for these easy lessons in behavior rule but she waved it laughingly aside rising to leave him just the same she maintained from the doorway experience may make the familiar things and dear things the very things of which one wishes least to speak talk to ann about the army wayne talk about but as he was holding out notebook and pencil she beat grimacing retreat that night miss jones dreamed the world had been all shaken up and everything was confused and no one could put it to rights all those dames whose ancestors had sailed unknown waters were in the front row of the chorus and all the chorus girls were dancing a stately minuet at old point comfort elizabeth barrett browning was trying to commit suicide by becoming a biological freak and the madonna of the chair was wearing a smartly tailored brown rajah suit chapter xi peacefully and pleasantly one day slipped after another some thirty of them had joined their unnumbered fellows and tomorrow bade fair to pass serenely as yesterday this dear queen katie confided to the dog stretched at her feet is what in vulgar parlance is known as nothing doing and in poetic language is termed the simple life thirty days of nothing doing and yet there had been more doing in those days than in all the thousands of their predecessors gaily crowded to the brim those crowded days seemed days of a long sleep these quiet ones days of waking ann was out on the links that afternoon with captain prescott from her place on the porch katie had a glimpse of them at that moment anns white dress with its big knot of red ribbon was a vivid and a pleasing spot the olive of the captains uniform seemed part of the background of turf and trees all of it for ann so live and so pretty in white and red he was seeking to correct her stroke both were much in earnest about it it would seem that the whole of anns life hung upon that thing of better form in her golf finally she made a fair drive and turned to him jubilantly he was commending enthusiastically and ann quite pranced under his enthusiasm seeing katie she waved her hand and pointed off to her ball that katie too might mark the triumph then they came along laughing and chatting when the ball was reached they were in about the spot where katie had first seen ann thirty days before she knew how ann felt there was joy in the good stroke in this other game she had been playing in the last thirty days this more difficult and more alluring game she had come to know anew the exhilaration of bunker cleared the satisfaction of the long drive and the sure putt and katie had played a good game it was not strange she should have convinced others for there were times when her game was so good as to convince even herself though it had ever been so with kate the things in the world of lets play like had always been persuasive things curious she was to know how often or how completely ann was able to forget they were playing a game she had come to think of ann not as a hardandfast allfinished product but as something fluid certainly plastic it was as if anything could be poured into ann making her a dream could be woven round her and ann could grow into that dream that was a new fancy to kate she had always thought of people more as made than as constantly in the making it opened up long paths of wondering to all sides those paths were opening in those days it was that that made them such eventful days down this path strayed the fancy how much people were made by the things which surrounded them the things expected of them that path led to the vista that amazing responsibility might lie with the things surrounding the things expected it even made her wonder in what measure she would have been katie jones differently surrounded differently called upon her little trip down that path jostled both her approval of herself and her disapproval of others it was only once or twice that the real girl had stirred in the dream for the most part she had remained in the shadow of katies fancyings she was as an actor on the stage inarticulate save as regards her part katie had grown so absorbed in that part that there were times of forgetting there was a real girl behind it often she believed in her friend ann forrest the dear girl she had known in florence the poor child who had gone through so many hard things and was so different from the zelda frasers of the world she rejoiced with wayne and captain prescott in seeing dear ann grow a little more plump a little rosier a little more smiling she could understand perfectly as she had made them understand why ann did not talk more of italy and the things of her own life life had crowded in too hard upon her that setting of the other days made other days live again too acutely ann was taking a vacation from her life she had laughingly put it to wayne that was why she played so much with worth and the dogs and talked so little of grownup things though one could never completely take a vacation from ones life that was why ann looked that way when she was sometimes sitting very still and did not know that any one was looking at her persuasion was the easier as fabrication was but a fanciful dress for truth imagination did not have it all to do it only followed where ann called blazing its own trail yet there were times when the country of makebelieve was swept down by a whirlwind a whirlwind of realization which crashed through katies consciousness and knocked over the fancyings those whirlwinds would come all unannounced when ann seemed most ann playing with worth perhaps wearing one of the prettiest dresses and smilingly listening to something wayne was telling her had happened over at the shops and on the heels of the whirlwind knocking down the country of makebelieve would come the girl from a vast unknown rushing wildly from what what had become of that girl would she hear from her again it was almost as if the girl made by reality had indeed gone down under the waters that day and the things the years had made her had abdicated in favor of the things katie would make her and yet did the things the years had made one ever really abdicate was it because the girl of the years was too worn for assertiveness that the girl of fancy could seem the all was it only that she slumbered and sometimes stirred a little in her sleep and when she awoke even to each other they did not speak of that other girl as if fearing a word might wake her sometimes they heard her stir as one day soon after anns coming katie had said ann just what is it is the matter with your vocal chords why i didnt know anything was stammered ann but you seem unable to pronounce my name ann colored it is spelled katie kate went on and is pronounced k t try it ann see if you can say it ann looked at her the look itself crossed the border country katie she choked and the country of makebelieve fell palely away but they did not speak of the things they had stirred that thing of not saying it had been established the day anns bank account was opened katie had been over the river as she called going over to the city upon returning she found ann up in her room she stood there unpinning her hat telling of an automobile accident on the bridge katie seldom came in without some stirring tale as she was leaving she rummaged in her bag and oh yes ann she said carelessly heres your bank book i presumed to draw twenty dollars for you thinking you might need it before you could get over oh dear that telephone and i know its wayne for me but she did not escape ann was waiting for her when she came back up stairs she held out the book shaking her head her face told that she had been pulled back not money she said unsteadily all the rest of it is bad enough but not money id have no selfrespect selfrespect jeered kate id have no selfrespect if i didnt take money nobody can be selfrespecting when broke none of the rest of us seem to be inquiring into our sources of revenue so why should you as had happened that other time in relation to the suit the thing shot out at ann turned back to her it had more than once occurred that the thing thrown out sparingly persisted as thing to be considered genuinely her browbeating of ann for it was a sort of tender protective browbeating led her to reach out blindly for weapons and once in her hand many of those weapons proved ideas we take everything we can get she followed it up forcing herself from interest in the weapon to the use of it from everybody we can get it from we take this house from the government and heaven only knows how many sons of toil the government takes it from i take this money were so stupidly quibbling about now from a company the papers say takes it from everybody in reach take or you will be taken from is the basis of modern finance please dont be fanatical ann i cant take it repeated ann katie looked worried then she took new ground well ann if you wont take the sane financial outlook at least be a good sport were in this game the money has got to be part of making it go well never get anywhere at all if were going to balk and fuss at every turn there now honey as if to worth put your book away dont lose it it makes them cross to have you lose them and another principle of modern finance with which i am heartily in sympathy is that money should be kept in circulation it encourages embezzlement to leave it in banks too long then seeing what was gathering she said quietly but authoritatively leave it unsaid ann cant we always just leave it unsaid nothing makes me so uncomfortable as to feel im constantly in danger of having something nice said to me perhaps katie knew that countries of makebelieve are sensitive things that it does not do to admit you know them for that there had been that one time when the hand of reality reached savagely into the dream as if the things the girl had run away from had come to claim her it seemed through that long night that they had claimed her that anns vacation was over captain prescott had been dining with them that night and after dinner they were sitting out on the porch he was humming a snatch of something katie heard a chair scrape and saw that ann had moved farther into the shadow she was all in shadow save her hand that katie could see was gripping the arm of her chair he turned to ann did you see daiseymaisey ann wasnt here then said kate did you see it katie no it was a jolly joyous sort of thing he laughed sort of thing to make you feel nothing matters that was the name of that thing i was humming no not nothing matters but dont you care and there were the dont you care girls pink dresses and big black hats they seemed to mean what they sang they didnt care certainly it was wayne who spoke think not ann came a little way out of the shadow she had leaned toward wayne well youd never know it if they did laughed prescott he turned to wayne whats your theory oh i have no theory just a wondering cant see how girls who have their living to earn could sing dont you care with complete abandon ann leaned forward looking at him tensely then as if afraid she sank back into shadow katie could still see her hand gripping the arm of her chair but theyre not the caring sort prescott was holding think not said wayne again in waynes queer way there was a silence and then ann had murmured something and slipped away katie followed her for hours she sat by her bed holding her hand trying to soothe her it was almost morning before that other girl that girl they were trying to get away from would let ann go to sleep sitting beside the tortured girl that night hearing the heartbreaking little moans which as sleep finally drew near replaced the sobs katie jones wondered whether many of the things people so serenely took for granted were as absurd and perhaps as tragically absurd as captain prescotts complacent conclusion that the dont you care girls were girls who didnt care how she would love turning it all over in her mind that afternoon to talk some of those things over with the man who mends the boats chapter xii she had only known him for about twenty days the man who mends the boats but she had fallen into the way of referring all interesting questions to him that was perhaps the more remarkable as her eyes had never rested upon him one morning worth had looked up from some comparative measurements of the tails of pourquoi and nestcepas to demand why aunt kate what do you think there are times replied aunt kate looking over at the girl swaying in the hammock humming gently to herself when i dont know just what to think well sir what do you think the man that mends the boats knows more an watts worthie she admonished its bad business for an army man to turn traitor but yes he does cause i asked watts why pourquoi had more yellow than white and why nestcepas was more white an yellow and he said i sure had him there hed be blowed if he knew and he guessed nobody did less maybe the almighty had some ideas about it but yesterday i asked the man that mends the boats and he explained it oh a whole lot of long words aunt kate more long words an i ever heard before and the explanation i trust it was satisfactory i guess it was replied worth uncertainly twas an awful lot of long words my experience too laughed aunt kate with the man that mends the boats no with other sages you see when theyre afraid to stay down here on the ground with us any longer afraid theyll be hit with a question that will knock them over they get into little airships they have and hurl the long words down at our heads until were too stunned to ask any more questions and in such wise is learning disseminated ill ask the man that mends the boats if hes got any airships hes got most everything up there up where oh up there with vague nod toward the head of the island he says hed like to get acquainted with you aunt kate he says he really believes you might be worth knowing thereupon aunt kates book fell to the floor with a thud of amazement that reverberated indignation well upon my word gasped she then recovering her book and more why what a kindly gentleman he must be she drawled oh yes hes kind hes awful kind i guess hell talk to you any time you want him to aunt kate hell tell you just anything you want to know he said you must be a i forgot the word oh no you havent wheedled aunt kate try to think of it dearie cant think of it now shall i ask him again certainly not how preposterous as if it made the slightest difference in the world but it made difference enough for aunt kate to ask a moment later and how did it happen worthie that this kindly philosopher should have deemed me worth knowing oh i dont know cause he liked the puppies names i guess i told him how their mother was just queen but how they was pourquoi and nestcepas a quirer and versalist and so then he said and which is aunt kate which is aunt kate what did he mean is she content to be just queen he said or is she there was a lot of long words you wouldnt understand them aunt kate i didnt either does she show a puppyish tendon tendon something to butt into the universe suddenly aunt kates face grew pink and she sat straight worth was this one of the men oh no aunt kate hes not one of the men hes just a man hes the man that mends the boats the man that mends the boats he sounds like a creature in flowing robes out of a mythology book or the being expressing the high and noble sentiments calling everybody down in a newthoughtish play from time to time worth would bring word of him what boats does he mend aunt kate wanted to know and what business has he landing them on our island to which came the answer that he mended boats sick unto death with speed mania and other social disease and that he didnt land them on the island but on an island off the tip of the island a tiny island which the lord had thoughtlessly left lying disrespectfully close to the isle of dignity katie was too true a romancer to inquire closely about the man who mended the boats for she liked to think of him as an unreal being who only touched the earth off the tip of the island and only touched humanity through worth that wove something alluringly mysterious and mysteriously alluring about the man who made sick boats well whereas had she given rein to the possibility of his belonging to the motorboat factory across the river and scientifically testing gasoline engines it would be neither proper nor interesting that her young nephew should run back and forth with pearls of wit and wisdom it developed that worth visited this tip of the island with the ever faithful watts and that one day the boat mender and watts had oh just the awfulest fight with words worth had ever heard it was about the government which the man who mended the boats said was running on one cylinder drawing from patriotic watts the profane defense that it had all the power it needed for blowing up just such fools as that he further held that soldiers were firstclass dishwashers and should be brave enough to demand firstclass dishwashing pay katie had chuckled over that but she had puzzled rather than chuckled over the statement that the first war the saddles manufactured on that island would see would be the war over the manufacturing of them now what in the world had he meant by that she had asked wayne but wayne had seemed so seriously interested in the remark and asked such direct questions as to who made it that she had tried to cover her tracks thinking perhaps the man who mended the boats could be thrown into the guardhouse for saying such dark things about army saddles on the way home from that talk watts had branded the man who mended the boats as one of them lowdown anarchists that ought to be shot at sunrise things was as they was held watts and how could anybody but a fool expect them to be any way but the way they was it showed what he was and after that worth had had no more fireworks of thought for a week watts standing guard over the world as it was but he slipped into an odd place in katies life of wonderings and fancyings and that life of musing and questioning was so big and so real a life in those days he was something to shoot things out at to hang things to she held imaginary conversations with him demolished him in imaginary arguments only to stand him up and demolish him again sometimes she quite winked with him at the world as it was and at other times she withdrew to lofty heights and said cutting things in more friendly mood she asked him questions sometimes questions he could not answer and she could not answer them either and then their thoughts would hover around together brooding over a world of unanswerable things all her life she had held those imaginary conversations but heretofore it had been with her horse her dog the trees a white cloud against the blue something somewhere none of the hundreds of nice people she knew had ever moved her to imaginary conversations and so now it was stimulating energizing not to have to diffuse her thought into the unknown but to direct it at and through the man who mended the boats and said strange things to worth up at the tip of the island and he came at a time when she had great need of him never before had there been so many things to start one on imaginary conversations conversations which ended usually in a limitless wondering since ann had come the simplest thought had a way of opening a door into a vast country too many doors were opening that afternoon she was making no headway with the letters she had told herself she would dispose of while ann and captain prescott were out on the links the letter from harry prescotts mother was the most imperative she was returning from california and sent some inquiries as to the habitability of her sons house katie was thinking as she reread it that it was a letter with a background it expressed one whom dead days loved well the writer of the letter seemed to be holding in life all those gentlewomen who had formed her in a short time mrs prescott would be at the arsenal that meant a more difficult game did it also mean an impossible one yet katie would prefer showing her ann to mrs prescott than to zelda fraser zelda the fashionable young woman would pounce upon the absence of certain little tricks and get no glimmer of what katie vaguely called the essence might not mrs prescott find the reality in the possibilities it comes to this katie suddenly saw im not shamming im revealing im not vulgarly imitating im restoring the connoisseur should be the first to appreciate that it turned her off into one of those long paths of wondering paths which sometimes seemed to circle the whole of the globe it was on those paths she frequently found the man who mended the boats waiting for her sometimes he was irritating turning off into little bypaths bypaths leading off to the dim source of things katie could not follow him there she did not know her way and often as today he turned off there just when she was most eager to ask him something she would ask him what he thought about backgrounds how much there was in that thing of having the background all prepared for one in simply fitting into the place one was expected to fit into how many people would create for themselves the background it was assumed they belonged in just because they had been put in it suddenly she laughed she had a most absurd vision of jove katie believed it would be jove standing over humanity with some kind of heroic feather duster and mightily calling shoo shoo move on every fellow find his place for himself such a scampering as there would be and how many would be let stay in the places where they had been put who would get the nice corners it had been taken for granted certain people should have just because they had been fixed up for them in advance how about the case of miss katherine wayneworth jones would she be ranked out of quarters certain it was that a very choice corner had been fitted up for said katherine wayneworth jones people said that she belonged in her corner that no one else could fit it that she could not as well fit anywhere else but she was not at all sure that under the feather duster act that would give her the right of possession people were so stupid just because they saw a person sitting in a place they held that was the place for that person to be sitting katie almost wished that mighty shoo would indeed reverberate round the world it would be such fun to see them scamper and squirm and would there not be the keenest of satisfaction in finding out what sort of place one would fit up for ones self if none had been fitted up for one in advance few people were called upon to prove themselves most people judged people as they judged pictures at an exhibition they went around with a catalogue and when they saw a good name they held that they saw a good picture and when they did not know the name even though the picture pleased them they waited around until they heard someone else saying good things then they stood before it murmuring how lovely she had put ann in the catalogue she had seen to it that she was properly hung and she herself had stood before her proclaiming something rare and fine that meant that ann was taken for granted and being taken for granted meant ninetenths the battle it would be fun to fool the catalogue folks and she need have no compunctions about lowering the standard of art because the picture she had found out in the back room and surreptitiously hung in the night belonged in the gallery a great deal more than some of the pictures which had been solemnly carried in the front way it was the catalogue folks rather than the lovers of art were being imposed upon and mrs prescott though to be sure a maker of catalogues was also a lover of art there lay katies hope for her and apology to her though she was apprehensive a stronger light was to be turned on that was indisputable you and i know dear queen katie confided to the member of her sex lying at her feet that men are not at all difficult you can get them to swallow most anything if the girl in the case is beautiful enough and feminine enough masculine dotes on discovering feminine but have you ever noticed what the rest of the feminine dote on doing to that discovery women can even look at wondrous soft brown eyes and lovely tender mouths through those who was your father specs they keep so well dusted the manner of holding a teacup is more important than the hearts deep dreams when it comes to passing inspection the souls not in it with the fork we know em dont we old queen queen wagged concurrence and katie pulled herself sternly back to her letters mrs prescott spoke of the chance of her sons being ordered away i hope not she wrote for i want the quiet summer for him and for myself too the great trees and the river and you there dear katie it seems the thing i most desire but we of the army learn often to relinquish the things we most desire we the homeless for in the abiding sense we are homeless make homes possible think of it with pride sometimes katie our girls think of it all too little now i sometimes wonder how they can forego that just pride in their traditions during this spring in the west my thoughts have many times turned to those other days days when men like your father and my husband performed the frontier service which made the west of today possible recently at a dinner i heard a young woman one of the advanced type and i am sorry to say of army people speak laughingly to one of our men of the uselessness of the army she was worthy nothing but scorn or i might have spoken of some of the things your mother and i endured in those days of frontier posts and now we have a california serene fruitful and can speak of the uselessness of the army does the absurdity of it never strike them katie pondered that wondered if mrs prescotts attitude and spirit were not passing with the frontier few of the army girls she knew thought of themselves as homeless or gave much consideration to that thing of making other homes possible save to be sure the homes they were hoping and plotting to make for themselves and she could not see that the young woman was answered the young woman had not been talking about traditions probably the young woman would say that yesterday having made today possible it was quite time to be quit of yesterday though to be sure katie now answered her while we may not seem to be doing anything were keeping something from being done and that perhaps is the greatest service of all were it not for us and our dear navy we should be sailed on from east and west marched on from north and south at least thats what were told by our superiors and are you the kind of young woman to question what youre told by your superiors because if you are id like to meet you her letter continued harry writes glowingly of your charming friend strange that i am not able to recall her though to be sure i knew little of you in those years abroad was she a school friend i presume so harry speaks of her as the dear sort of girl not leaving a clear image in my mind but soon my vision will be cleared oh will it mumbled kate i dont know whether it will or not the dear sort of girl and i presume the young goose thought he had given a vivid picture she turned to major darretts note a charming note it was to turn to he had the gift of making himself very real and correspondingly attractive in those notes a few days before she had been telling ann about major darrett hes a bachelor she had said and a joy ann had looked vague and katie laughed now in seeing that her characterization was broad as the dear sort of girl it was probable major darrett would relieve one of the officers at the arsenal he touched it lightly should fate that part of it dwelling in washington waft me to your island katie jones i foresee a summer to compensate me for all the hard cruel lonely years kate smiled knowingly not that she actually knew much to be knowing about she wondered why she did not disapprove of major darrett certain she was that some of the things which had kept his years from being hard cruel and lonely were in the category for disapproval but he managed them so well one could not but admire his deftness and admiration was weakening to disapproval one disapproved of things which offended one and in this instance the results of the things one knew one should disapprove were so far from offensive that one let it go at smiling knowingly mildly disapproving of ones self for not disapproving ann had not responded enthusiastically to katies drawing of major darrett she had not seemed to grasp the idea that much was forgiven the very charming that ordinary standards were not rigidly applied to the extraordinarily fascinating when katie was laughingly telling of one of the majors most interesting flirtations anns eyes had seemed to crouch back in that queer way they had katie had had an odd sense of anns disapproving of her disapproving of her for her not disapproving of him more than once ann had given her that sense of being disapproved of as with all things in the universe just then he was a new angle back to ann if he were to come there for major darrett would not at all disapprove of those eyes of anns and yet his own eyes would see more than wayne and harry prescott had seen major darrett had been little on the frontier but much in the drawingroom he had never led up san juan hill but he had led many a cotillion he had had that form of military training which makes society favorites as to ann he would have the feminine specs and the masculine delight at one and the same time what of that union katies eyes began to dance she hoped he would come he would be a foe worthy her steel she would have to fix up all her fortifications look well to her ammunition whatever might be held against major darrett it could not be said he was not worthy ones cleverest fabrications but the triumph of holding ones own with a veteran then of a sudden she wondered what the man who mended the boats would think of the major chapter xiii before she had finished her writing wayne and worth came up on the porch the little boy had been over at the shops with his father father he was saying imagination under the stimulus of things he had been seeing i suppose our gun will kill bout forty thousand million folks wont it father why no son i hope its not going to be such a beastly gun as that laughed captain jones yes but father isnt a good gun a gun that kills folks whats the use making a gun at all if it isnt going to kill folks his father looked at him strangely sonny he said youre hitting home rather hard your reasoning is poor worth said katie fact is we make guns to keep folks from getting killed if we didnt have the guns everybody would get killed now dont say why cause you dont know why calmly remarked worth adding ill ask watts and if he dont know ill ask the man that mends the boats do said katie having to his own satisfaction exterminated some forty thousand million members of the human family worth opened attack on the puppies he was an indian and they were poor white settlers and he was going to kill them no poor white settlers had ever received an indian so joyously but he seemed to have left those forty thousand million souls on his fathers hands wayne was looking very serious he did not respond to did not appear to have heard katies remark about worth needing some new clothes katie wondered what he was thinking about she supposed some new kind of barrel steel she took it for granted that nothing short of steel could produce that look she was proud of the things that look had done proud of the distinction her brother had already won in the army proud in advance of the things she was confident he would do captain jones was at the arsenal on special detail an invention of his pertaining to the rifle was being manufactured for tests there was keen interest in it and its final adoption seemed assured it was of sufficient importance to make his name one of those conspicuous in army affairs he had already several lesser things devices pertaining to equipment to his credit and was looked upon as one of the most promising of the armys men of invention and aside from her pride in him katies affection for her brother was deep intensified because of their being alone their father had died when katie was sixteen died as a result of wounds received long before in frontier skirmishes where he had been one of those many brave men to serve fearlessly and faithfully men who gave more to their country than their country perhaps understood their mother survived him only two years katie sometimes said that her mother too gave her life to her country her health had been undermined by hard living on the frontier she who had been so tenderly reared in her southern home and in the end she also died from a wound that wound dealt the heart in the death of her husband katie revered her fathers memory and adored her mothers and while youth and katies indomitable spirit made it hard for one to think of her as sad the memory of those two was the deepest biggest thing in the girls life oh katie wayne suddenly roused himself to say your cousin fred wayneworth is in town i had luncheon with him over the river he sent all sorts of messages to you well really messages why this haughty aloofness doesnt he mean to come over oh yes of course tomorrow perhaps tonight hes fearfully busy stopped off on his way east theres a row on in the forest service about some of osbornes timber claims mining claims too i believe in colorado those years in the west have developed fred splendidly hes gone from boy to man and a fine specimen of man at that he likes his work full of it wayne was silent for a moment then added i envied him it startled katie envied him why why wayne surely youre lucky he laughed not the laugh of a man too pleased with his luck oh am i perhaps i am but just the same i envy a fellow who can look that way when talking about his work but you have a work wayne no i have a place she grew more and more puzzled why wayne youve been all wrapped up in this thing you were doing he threw his cigarette away impatiently oh yes just for the sake of doing it i get a certain satisfaction in scheming things out i must say however id like to scheme out something id get some satisfaction in having schemed out a morsel of truth dropped from the mouth of a babe a minute ago you may have observed katie that his inquiry was more direct and reasonable than your reply an improvement on a rifle not such a satisfying thing to leave to a rifle eliminating future but i didnt know the army admitted it was to be a rifle eliminating future im not saying that the army does he laughed he passed again to that look of almost passionate concentration which katie had always supposed meant metallic fouling or some to her equally incomprehensible thing he emerged from it to exclaim tensely oh i get so sick of the spirit of the army instinctively katie looked around he saw it and laughed there you go weve made a perfect fetich of loyalty its a different sort of loyalty those forestry fellows have a more live more constructive loyalty the loyalty that comes not through form but through devotion to the work a common interest in a common cause ours is built on dead things custom and the caste i know no other word just the bullheaded asinine undemocratic caste that custom has built up and yet there must be discipline katie murmured it seemed dreadful wayne should be tearing down their house in that rude fashion house in which they had dwelt so long and so comfortably discipline is one thing bullyings another ive never been satisfied discipline couldnt be enforced without snobbery today solesby one year out of west point walked through a shop i was in he passed men working at their machines skilled mechanics many of them men of intelligence ideas character as though he were passing so much cattle i wanted to take him by the neck and throw him out oh well protested katie one year out of the point hes yet to learn men are not cattle well leonard never learned it his back gets some black looks let me tell you wayne dear she laughed im afraid youre not talking like an officer and a gentleman i get tired talking like an officer and a gentleman sometimes i feel like talking like a man but couldnt you be courtmartialed for doing that she laughed i think leonard thinks i should be why why wayne because i talk to the men theres a young mechanic who has been detailed to me and he and i get on famously all too famously i take it leonard thinks he came in today when this young ferguson was telling me some things about his union he treated ferguson like a dog and me like a suspicious character dear me wayne she murmured dont get in trouble trouble he scoffed well if i can get in trouble for talking with an intelligent man im working with about the things that man knows then let me get in trouble id rather talk to ferguson than solesby weve more in common oh ill get in no trouble he added grimly leonard knows it wouldnt sound well to say it but he feels it just the same right theres the difference between our service and this forest service thats where theyre democrats and were fossils look at the difference in the spirit of the ranger and the spirit of the soldier and its not because theyre whipped into line and bullied and snarled at its because theyre treated like men and made to feel theyre a needed part of a big whole you should hear fred tell of the way men meet in this forest service superintendent meeting ranger on a common ground and why because theyre doing something constructive because the works the thing that counts youll see what its done for fred the boy has a real dignity not the stiffnecked kind hed acquire around an army post but the dignity that comes with the consciousness of being not in the service but of service he fell silent there and katie watched him he had never spoken to her that way before she had not dreamed he felt like that heretofore it had been only through laughing little jibes at the army she had had any inkling of his feeling toward it that she had not taken seriously half the people she knew in the service jibed at it to others in the service this depth of feeling disturbed her moved her to defense after a moments consideration she emerged triumphant with the panama canal he shook his head when you consider the percentage of the army so engaged you cant feel as happy about it as youd like to we ought all to be digging panama canals heavens wayne we dont need them plenty of things we do need well i dont think youre fair to the army wayne youre not looking into it deeply enough youre doing just as much as fred for in safeguarding the country you permit this constructive work to go on as to our formalities they have run off into absurdity at some points but it was a real spirit created those very forms true and now the spirits dead and the forms left and whats so absurd as a form that rattles dead bones father didnt feel as you do wayne he had no cause to he was needed but we dont need the army on the frontier now thats done and we do need the forest service the thing to build up theres no use harking back to traditions the world moves on too fast for that question is not what did you do yesterday but what good are you today what are you worth tomorrow oh im not condemning the army half so much as im sympathizing with it he laughed its full of live men who want to be doing something instead of being compelled to argue that theyre some good they get very tired saying theyre useful theyd like to make it selfevident well perhaps well have a war with japan said katie consolingly perhaps we will having an army thats spoiling for it i dont see how we can very well miss it but if we had no army we certainly should have a war his silence led katie to gasp wayne are you becoming antimilitarist he laughed oh i dont know what im becoming but as to myself i do know this there would be more satisfaction in constructive work than in work that constructs only that it may be ready to destroy i would find it more satisfying to help give my country itself through natural and legitimate means than stand ready to give it some corner of some other country but to keep the other country from getting a corner of it doesnt it occur to you katie that as a matter of fact the other country might like a chance to develop its resources were like a crowd of boys with rocks in their hands and all afraid to throw down the rocks if one did the others might be immensely relieved it seems rather absurd standing there with rocks nobody wants to throw especially when there are so many other things to be doing and everybody saying ive got to keep mine because hes got his would you call that a very intelligent gang of kids ferguson says its the workingmen of the world will bring about disarmament that theyre coming to feel their common cause as workers too keenly to be forced into war with each other thats what the man that mends the boats says piped up worth he says that when theyre all socialists there wont be any wars cause nobodyll go but watts says that dayll never come thank god are you thanking god for yourself or for watts sonny laughed his father and who pray is the man that mends the boats the man that mends the boats father is a man thats most as smart as you are it has been a long time gravely remarked wayne since any man has been brought to my attention so highly commended as that but their talk had been sobering to them both for they spoke seriously then of various things it was probable that before long wayne would be ordered to washington he wanted to know what katie would do then why not spend next season in washington with him just what were her plans but katie had no plans and suddenly she realized how completely all things had been changed by the coming of ann she had spent much of her life in washington she loved it loved its official life in particular its army and diplomatic life and loved too that rigidly guarded old washington to which as her mothers daughter the door stood open to her her uncle the bishop lived in a city close by his home was the fixed spot which katie called home in washington and near it she would find friends on all sides just thirty days before she would have gloated over that prospect of next season there but she was not prepared to bombard washington with ann the mere suggestion carried realization of how propitious things had been how simple she had found it the little game they were playing seemed to cut katie off from her life too and without leaving the luxury of feeling sorry for herself with it all washington did not greatly allure washington as she knew it was distinctly things as they were just now nothing allured half so much as those long dim paths of wondering leading off into the unknown suddenly she had an odd sense of washington all that it represented to her being the play the game the thing made to order and seeming very tame to her because she was dwelling with real things it was as if her craft of makebelieve was the thing which had been able to carry her toward the shore of reality and so she told wayne that she had no plans perhaps she would go back to europe with ann he turned quickly at that she goes back oh yes i suppose so but why where to whom why why why not why does one go anywhere florence is to ann what washington is to me a sort of center katie he asked abruptly has she no people no ties isnt she moored any place am i moored any place returned kate why yes to the things that have made you to the things youre part of by moored i dont mean necessarily a fixed spot but i have a feeling he seemed either unable or unwilling to express it and instead laughed id like to know how much her father made a month and whether her mother was a good cook a few little things like that to make her less a shadow do you really get at her katie why why yes stammered katie though i told you wayne that ann was different quiet and just now sad i dont think of her as particularly quiet he replied and sad isnt it either i think of her he paused and concluded uncertainly as a girl in a dream her dream or your dream wayne laughed katie just to turn it she was throwing sticks for the puppies and missed his startled look but it was katie who was startled when he said still uncertainly and more to himself than to katie though shes so real ann and captain prescott were coming toward them she had never looked less like a girl in a dream laughing and jesting with her companion she looked simply like an exceedingly pretty girl having a very good time but you like ann dont you wayne katie asked anxiously yes said wayne i like her she came running up the steps to them flushed happy as free from selfconsciousness as worth would have been katie she cried i played the last one in four didnt i turning proudly to the captain for endorsement both men were looking at her with pleasure cheeks flushed eyes glowing hair a little disheveled and a little damp about the forehead panting a little her lithe beautiful body swaying gently hands outstretched to show wayne how she had hardened her palms ann had never seemed so lovely and so live in that moment it mattered not whether one knew anything about the earning capacity of her father or the culinary abilities of her mother she was real real as sunshine and breezes and birds are real as worth and the puppies tumbling over each other on the grass were real as all that is lifeloving is real and not detached not mistily floating but moored to that very love of life capacity for life to that look she had awakened in the faces of the men to whom she was talking it seemed a paltry thing just then to wonder whether ann was child of farmer or clothing merchant or great artist she was lifes child loves child loves child only she had not dwelt all her days in her fathers house but it was her fathers house that was why once warmed and comforted she could radiantly take her place watching her as she was going over her game for wayne demonstrating some of her strokes and her slim beautiful body made even the poor strokes wonderful things katie was not speculating on whether ann had come from chicago or florence or big creek she was thinking that ann was product expression of the love of the world that love which had brought the laughter and the tears brought the hope and the radiance and the tragedy of life and then suddenly and inexplicably katie was afraid of just what she did not know of things big tempestuous things which katie did not very well understand and which ann perhaps not understanding either seemed to embody come ann she said we must make ready for dinner captain prescott called after them that next he was going to teach ann to ride oh well make an army girl of her yet he laughed ann turned back do you know she said i dont understand the army very well just what is it the army does they laughed ask the peace society in boston suggested prescott but wayne said some day soon you and ill take a ride on the river and ill deliver a little lecture on the army oh that will be nice said ann radiantly chapter xiv it was astonishing how ann seemed to find herself in just that thing of being able to learn to play golf they were gay at dinner that night and ann was as gay as any one she continued to talk about her game which they jestingly permitted her to do and the men told some good golf stories which she entered into merrily it was katie who was rather quiet while they still lingered around the table fred wayneworth joined them and katie eager to talk with him of his people and his work left ann alone with wayne and captain prescott something which up to that time she had been reluctant to do but tonight she did not feel ann clinging to her calling out to her as she had felt her before she seemed on surer ground it was as if golf had given her a passport from her place in the garden with her cousin anns laugh came down to them from time to time just a girls happy laugh who is your stunning friend katie fred asked no stunning doesnt fit her but lovely she is lovely isnt she anns very pretty said kate shortly oh pretty he laughed that wont do at all so many girls are pretty and i never saw any girl just like her again she was vaguely uneasy and the uneasiness irritated her and then she was ashamed of the irritation didnt she want poor ann to have a good time and feel at home and be admired did she care for her when she was somber and shy and resent her when happy and confident she told herself she was glad to hear ann laughing and yet each time the happy little laugh stirred that elusive foreboding in the not usually apprehensive soul of katie jones i want to tell you about my girl katie her cousin was saying ive got the only girl he was off into the story of helen helen who was a clerk in the forest service and put it all over any girl he had ever known before who was worth the whole bunch of girls he had known in the east girls who had been brought up like dollbabies and had dollbaby brains didnt katie agree that a girl who could make her own way distanced the girls who could do nothing but spend their fathers money in her heart katie did had she been defending fred to his father the bishop or to his bostonian mother she would have grown eloquent for helen but listening to fred it seemed something was being attacked and she unreasonably enough instead of throwing herself with the aggressor was in the stormed citadel with her aunt and uncle and the girls with the dollbaby brains and she had been within the citadel that afternoon when wayne was attacking the army she gloried in attacks of her own but let some one else begin one and she found herself running for cover and to defense she wondered if that were anything more meaningful than just natural perversity the bishop had wanted his son for the church but fred not taking amicably to the cloth he had urged the navy fred had settled that by failing to pass the examinations for annapolis failing purposely his father stormily held a theory supported by the good work he did subsequently at yale there he became interested in forestry again to the disapproval of his parents who looked upon forestry as an upstart institution not hallowed by the mellowing traditions of church or navy now they would hold that helen proved it and helen did prove something certain it was that from neither church nor navy would fred have seen his helen in just this way perhaps it was that democracy wayne had been talking about perhaps this democracy was a thing not contented with any one section of a mans life perhaps once it had him it had its way with him katie thought of the last thirty days of paths leading out from other paths once one started freds father had never started bishop wayneworth was only democratic when delivering addresses on the signers of the declaration of independence the democracy of the past was sanctified the democracy of the present pernicious and uncouth thought of her uncle put katie on the outside eyes dancing with the fun of the attack who are her people fred oh western people ranchers best sort of people they raised the best crop of potatoes in the valley this year katie yearned to commend the family of her daughterinlaw to her aunt elizabeth with the boast that they raised the best crop of potatoes in the valley they had hard sledding for a long time but theyre making a go of it now theyve worked let me tell you helen wouldnt have to work now but dont you say that to helen what do you think katie she even wants to keep on working after were married that planted katie firmly within oh she cant do that fred well i wish youd tell her she cant thats where we are now we stick on that point i try to assert my manly authority but manly authority doesnt faze helen much she has some kind of theory about the economic independence of woman you know anything about it katie you forget that im one of the dollbaby girls she replied in a light voice which trailed a little bitterness on behind not you just before i left i said to helen well theres at least one relative of mine who will have sense enough to appreciate you and thats my corking cousin katie jones that lured feminine kate outside again fred she asked moved by her never slumbering impulse to find out about things just what is it you care for in helen is she pretty funny sympathetic clever what she watched his face as he tried to frame it and watching she decided that whatever kind of girl helen was she was a girl to be envied yes and to be admired well i fear it doesnt sound sufficiently romantic he laughed but helens such a sturdy little wretch the first things i ever noticed about her was her horse sense shes good on her job too she seems to me like the west though thats rather amusing for shes such a little bit of a thing shes afraid shell get fat but she wont shes not that kind why of course not said katie stoutly and they laughed and seemed very near to helen in thus scorning her fear of getting fat he continued his confidences laughter from the porch coming down to them all the while helen was so real she was so square so independent so dauntless and yet she had such dear little ways he couldnt make her sound as nice as she was katie would have to come and see her in fact they were counting on katies coming she was to come and stay a long time with them and really get acquainted with the west ill tell you what helens like he summed it up shes very much what you would have been if youd lived out there and had the advantages she has katie stared no he was not trying to be funny they started toward the house katie he broke out if you have any cousinly love in your heart and know anything about walt whitman tell me something so i can go back and spring it on helen shes mad over him he was one of the advantages i didnt have said katie he didnt play a heavy part in the thing i had that passed for an education isnt it the limit the way they do you at those girls schools agreed fred sympathetically helen says that in religion and education the more you pay the less you get i should like her laughed katie but what would her aunt elizabeth think of a sturdy little wretch believing in the economic independence of woman whatever that might be with lots of horse sense and good on her job katie was on the outside now and for good if nothing else the fun was out there and there was something else that light on freds face when he was trying to tell about helen captain prescott had come down the steps to meet them i was just coming for you dont you think katie it would be fun to look in on the dance up here at the club house on the alert for shielding ann katie demurred it was late and ann was tired from her golf there was an eager little flutter and ann had stepped forward oh im not at all tired katie she said does she look tired scoffed wayne shes only tired of being made to play the invalid hurry along katie if you girls arent sufficiently befrocked frock up at once katie hesitated annoyed she felt shorn of the function of her office and she was dubious the party was one which the younger set over the river were giving at the golf clubhouse on the island for the returned college boys she did not know who might be there she was always meeting friends of her friends she felt a trifle injured in thinking that just for the sake of ann she had avoided the social life those people offered her and now ann was speaking again her voice stripped of the happy eagerness just as you say katie it is late and perhaps i am too tired that moved katie that a girl should not be privileged to be insistent about going to a dance it seemed depriving her of her birthright and more cruel than taking away a birthright was bringing the consciousness of having no birthright katie entered gayly into the plans they decided that ann was to wear the rosecolored muslin the same gown she had worn that first night as she was fastening it for her katie saw that ann was smiling at herself in the mirror giving herself little pats of approval here and there she had not done that the first time katie helped her into that dress but it was the ann of the first days who turned strained face to her in the dressingroom at the clubhouse all the girlish radiance girlish vanity was gone katie she whispered i think id better go home i i didnt know it would be like this so many people so many lights and things gently katie reassured her ann needing her was the ann she knew how to care for and would care for in the face of all the people all the lights and things you neednt dance if you dont want to she told her ill tell wayne to look out for you that youre really not able to meet people if i put him on guard hell go through fire and water for you yes i know that said ann and seemed to take heart and for some time she did not dance from the floor katie would get glimpses of ann and wayne sauntering on the veranda on which the ballroom opened more than once she found anns eyes following her ann out in the shadow looking in at the gay people in the light but with the opening of a lively twostep captain prescott insisted ann dance with him oh come now he urged lifes too short to sit on the side lines this is a ripping twostep the music too was urgent and persuasive as if without volition she fell into gliding little steps moving toward the dancing floor it was katie who watched that time she wanted to see ann dancing at first it puzzled her she was too graceful not to dance well but she danced as if differently trained as if unaccustomed to their way of dancing but as the twostep progressed she fell into the swing of it and seemed no different from the rest of the pretty happy girls all about her she was radiant when she came back to them like the golf the dancing seemed to have given her confidence and confidence happiness though she still shrank from meeting people katie fell in with a whole troop of college boys who hovered around her as both college boys and their elders were wont to hover around katie she wanted to bring some of them to ann but ann demurred oh no katie i dont want to dance with any strange men please just our own why katie wondered should one not wish to dance with strange men it seemed so curious a thing to shrink from katie herself had never felt at all strange with strange men nice fellows were nice fellows the world over and she never felt farther from strange than when dancing with a nice man strange or otherwise even in the swing of her gayety katie wondered what it was could make one feel like that and she wondered what wayne must think of that plaintive little just our own which she was sure he had overheard katie had come out at last to say she thought they should go ann must not get too tired but just then the orchestra began dreaming out a waltz one of those waltzes lovers love to remember having danced together now there said wayne is a nice peaceful waltz youll have to wait katie and his arm was about ann and they had glided away together katie told her cousin she would rather not dance lets stand here and watch she said couple after couple passed by not the crowd of the gay twostep of a few moments before few were talking some were gently humming many dreaming with a veiled smile for the dream it was one of those waltzes to find its way back to cherished moments flood with lovely color the dear things held apart fred was saying he wished helen were there katie turned from the vivid picture out to the subtle night warm summers night the dreaming music carried her back to vanished things other waltzes other warm summers nights to the times when she had been in her lighthearted fashion in love to those various flirtations for which she had more tenderness than regret just for the glimpses they brought and suddenly the heart of things gone seemed to flow into a great longing for that never known tenderness and wildness of feeling that sobbed in the music she was being borne out to the heart of the night and at the heart of the night some one waited for her with arms held out but as she was swept nearer the some one was the man who mended the boats with a little catch of her breath for that sorry twist of her consciousness that must make lovely moments ludicrous ones she turned back to the bright room crowded colorful moving room which seemed set in the vast soft night her brother was just passing her brother and her friend ann forrest they did not look out at her they did not seem to know that katie was near she had never seen anns face so beautiful it had that beauty she had all the while seen as possible for it only more intense more exalted than she had been able to foresee it the music stopped on a sob every one was still for an instant then they were applauding for more ann was not clapping katie had never seen anything as beautiful as that look of rapt loveliness on anns face as she stood there waiting she might have been the very spirit of love waiting in the mists at the heart of the night as softly the music began again and wayne once more guided her in and out among those boys and girls boys and girls for whom life had meant little more than laughing and dancing katie had a piercing vision of the girl with her hands over her face stumbling on toward the river they were all very quiet on the way home that night just as she was falling asleep katie was startled it seemed at first she was being awakened by a sharp dart one of those darts of apprehension seemed shot into her approaching slumber but it was nothing more than wayne whistling out on the porch whistling the dreaming waltz which would bear one to the love waiting at the heart of the night but katie was sleepy now how did wayne expect any one to go to sleep she thought crossly whistling at that time of night but across the hall was another girl who listened she had not been asleep she had been lying there looking out into the night very wide awake and when she heard the whistling she too sat up in bed swaying ever so gently to the rhythm of it inarticulately following it under her breath and smiling a hushed tender little smile something lovely seemed stealing over her but in the wake of it was something else something cold blighting before he had finished she had covered her ears with her hands and was sobbing chapter xv as she looked back afterward upon that span of days searching them translating katie saw that the day of the golf and the dancing marked the farthest advance after that it was as if ann frightened at finding herself so far out in the open shrank back into the shadows but having gone a little way into the open she was not again the same girl of the shadows her response to life seeming thwarted there came an incipient sullenness in her view of that life which she had reached over the bridge of makebelieve it did not show itself at once but afterward it seemed to katie that the next day marked the beginning of anns retreat on the bridge of makebelieve and she wondered whether the stray dog or the dangerous literature had most to do with that retreat ann was pale and quiet the day after the dance and it was not merely the languor of the girl who has fatigued herself in having a good time at luncheon katie suddenly demanded wayne where do you get dangerous literature i dont know what form of danger youre courting katie i have a valuable work on high explosives and i have a couple of volumes of de maupassant oh i weathered all that kind of danger long ago said she airily i want the kind that is distressing editors of church papers the man who edits this religious paper uncle sends me is a most unchristian gentleman he devoted a whole page to talking about dangerous literature and then didnt tell you where to get it well ill try walt whitman hes very popular in the west im told and as the west likes danger perhaps hes dangerous enough to begin on and you feel do you katie that the need of your life just now is for danger yes dear brother danger i must have at any cost whats the good living in a dangerous age if you dont get hold of any of the danger this unchristian editor says that little do we realize what a dangerous age it is and he says its the literature thats making it so then find the literature only he beast doesnt tell you where to worth there requested the privilege of whispering in his aunt kates ear the ear being proffered he poured into it i guess the man that mends the boats has got some dangerous literature aunt kate tell him to endanger aunt kate she whispered back do you suppose there is any way wayne she began after a moment of seeming to have a very good time all to herself of getting back the money we spent for my socalled education it would considerably enrich us grimly observed wayne when doctors or lawyers dont do things right cant you sue them and get your money back why cant you do the same thing with educators im going to enter suit against miss sisson this unchristian editor says modern education is dangerous but there was no danger in the course at miss sissons i want my money back that you may invest it in dangerous literature laughed wayne after he had gone ann was standing at the window looking down toward the river suddenly she turned passionately upon katie if you had ever had anything to do with danger you might not be so anxious to find it she was trembling and seemed close to tears katie felt it no time to explain herself and when she spoke again the tears were in her voice i cant tell you when i begin to talk about it the tears were in her eyes too then and upon her cheeks you see i cant but katie i want you to be safe i want you to be safe you dont know what it means to be safe with that she passed swiftly from her room katie sat brooding over it for some time if youve been in danger she concluded you think it beautiful to be safe but if youve never been anything but safe her smile finished that but katie was more in earnest than her manner of treating herself might indicate to be safe seemed to mean being shielded from life she had always been shielded from life and now she was beginning to feel that that same shielding had kept her from knowledge of life understanding of it katie was disturbingly conscious of a great deal going on around her that she knew nothing about ann wished her to be safe yet it was ann who had brought a dissatisfaction with that very safety it was ann had stirred the vague feeling that perhaps the greatest danger of all was in being too safe katie felt an acute humiliation in the idea that she might be living in a dangerous age and knowing nothing of the danger she would rather brave it than be ignorant of it indeed braving it was just what she was keen for but she could not brave it until she found it she would find it but the next afternoon she went over to the city with ann and found nothing more dangerous than a forlorn little stray dog it was evident that he had never belonged to anybody it was written all over his thin squirming little yellow body that he was nobodys dog written just as plainly as the name of somebodys dog would be written on a nameplate on a collar and it was written in his wistful little watery eyes told by his unconquerable tail that with all his dogs heart he yearned to be somebodys dog so he thought he would try miss katherine wayneworth jones she had a number of errands to do and he followed her from place to place she saw him first when she came out from the hairdressers he seemed to have been waiting for her his heart was too experienced in being broken for him to dance around her with barks of joy but he stood a little way off and wigglingly tried to ingratiate himself his eyes looking love and the longing for love impulsively katie stooped down to him poor little doggie does he want a pat he fairly crouched to the sidewalk in his thankfulness for the pat his tail and eyes saying all they could then she saw that he was following her dont come with me doggie she said please dont you must go home youll get lost but in her heart katie knew he would not get lost for to be so unfortunate as to be lost presupposed being so fortunate as to have a home and she knew that he was of the homeless but because that was so terrible a thing to face between him and her she kept up that pretense of a home when she came out from the confectioners he was waiting for her again a little braver this time until katie mildly stamped her foot and told him to go back at the third place she expostulated with him please doggie youre making me feel so badly wont you run along and play the hypocrisy of that left a lump in her throat as she turned from him when she found him waiting again she said nothing at all but began talking to ann about some flowers in a window across the street ann had seemed to dislike the dog she would step away when katie stopped to speak to him and be looking intently at something else as if trying not to know that there were such things as homeless dogs watts was waiting for them with the station wagon when they had finished their shopping after they had gone a little way katie in the manner of one doing what she was forced to do turned around he was coming after them he had not yet fallen to the ranks of those human and other living creatures too drugged in wretchedness to make a fight for happiness nor was he finding it a sympathetic world in which to fight for happiness at that very moment a man crossing the street was giving him a kick he yelped and crouched away for an instant but his eyes told that the real hurt was in the thought of losing sight of the carriage that held katie jones as he dodged in and out crouching always before the possible kick she could read all too clearly how harassed he was with that fear they were approaching the bridge the guard on the bridge would foil that quest he would not permit a forlorn little yellow dog to seek happiness by following members of an officers family across the government bridge probably in the name of law and order he would kick him as the other man had done the dogs bleared little eyes eyes through which the love longing must look would cast one last look after the unattainable and then another hope gone another promise unrealized he would return miserably back to his loveless world but always watts said katie sharply stop a moment please i want to get something ann was sitting very straight looking with great absorption up the river when katie got back in the carriage with her dog her face was pale and it seemed to katie hard she moved as far away from the dog as she could her mouth set he sat just where katie put him on the floor trembling and looking up at her with those asking eyes when they were almost home ann spoke you cant take in all the homeless dogs of the world katie i dont know that thats any reason for not taking in this one replied katie shortly i hate to have you make yourself feel badly ann said tremulously why shouldnt i let myself feel badly demanded katie roughly in a world of homeless dogs why shouldnt i feel badly they made a great deal of fun of katies dog they named him pet captain prescott wanted to know if she meant to exhibit him at a bench show and mention various points he was sure would excite attention what i hate katie said wayne is the way he cringes none of that cringing about queen and why not she demanded hotly because queen was never kicked because queen was never chased down alleys by boys with rocks and tin cans because queen never asked for a pat and got a cuff nor did queens mother queen hasnt a drop of kicked blood in her this sorry little dog comes from a long line of the kicked and the cuffed and then you blame him for cringing im ashamed of you wayne he was about to make laughing retort but katies cheeks were so red her eyes so bright that he refrained and turned to ann with katie was always great for taking in all kinds of superfluous things yes said ann i know and she always takes her outcasts so very seriously yes agreed ann the trouble is she cant hope to make them over no admitted ann she cant do that and then she breaks her heart over their forlorn condition yes said ann these wretched things exist in the world but katie only makes her own life wretched in trying to do anything about them she cant reach far enough to count so why make herself unhappy katie doesnt look at it that way replied ann and turned away after the others had gone katie committed her new dog to worth honey will you play with him sometimes i know hes not as nice to play with as the puppies but maybe thats because nobody ever did play with him the things that arent nice about him arent his fault worthie so we mustnt be hard on him for them must we the reason hes so queer acting is just because he never had anybody to love him worth was so impressed that he not only accepted the dog himself but volunteered to say a good word for him to watts but a little later he brought back word that watts said the newcomer was an ornery cur that he was born an ornery cur that he was meant to be an ornery cur and never would be anything but an ornery cur watts is what you might call a conservative said katie and not being sure how a conservative member of the united states army would treat a canine child of the alley katie went herself to the stable that night to see that the newcomer was fed and made to feel at home he did not appear to be feeling at all at home he was crouching in his comfortable corner just as dejectedly as he would crouch in the most miserable alley his native city afforded he came thankfully but cringingly out to see katie doggie said she dont be so apologetic i dont like the apologetic temperament you were born into this world you have a right to live in it why dont you assert your right his answer was to look around for the possible tin can watts had approached begging your pardon miss jones but hes the ungrateful kind theres no use trying to do anything for that kind hes deservin no better than he gets he snapped at one of our own pups tonight i suppose so said kate i suppose when you spend your life asking for pats and getting kicks you do get suspicious and learn to snap it seems too bad that little dogs that want to be loved should have to learn to snarl you see watts hes had a hard life hes wandered up and down a world where nobody wanted him hes spent his days trying now this one now that maybe theyll take me he thinks his poor little heart warms at the thought that maybe they will he opens it up anew every day opens it for a new wound and now that hes found somebody to say the kind word hes still expecting the surly one his lifes shut him out from life even though he wants it it seems to me rather sad watts watts was surveying him dubiously that kind is deserving what they get they couldnt have been no other way and beggin your pardon miss jones but its not us thats responsible for his life isnt it said katie i wonder watts not responding to the suggestion of the complexity of responsibility she sought the personal as a favor to me watts will you be good to the little dog as a favor to you miss jones said watts making it clear that for his part watts she asked how long have you been in the service twill be five years in december miss jones reenlistment must mean that you like it ive no complaint to offer miss jones of course there are sometimes a few little things why did you enter the army watts a man has to make a living some way miss jones katie was thinking that she had not asked for an apology and yet i presume you could make more in some other way working in these shops for instance theres nothin sure about them said watts the armys certain and i like things to move on decent and orderly like for one thats willing to recognize his betters the service is a good place miss jones but i suppose there are some not willing to recognize their betters ventured kate theres all too many such said watts all too many nowadays thinks theyre just as good as them thats above them but you never feel that way so you are contented and like the service watts yes miss it suits me well enough miss jones im not one to think i can make over the world theres a fellow workin up here at the point i sometimes have some conversation with i was up there tonight at sundown me and the little boy now theres a man miss that dont know his place hes a troublemaker he said to me tonight but as watts was there joined by a fellowsoldier katie said thank you for looking out for the poor little dog watts and turned reluctantly to the house she would like to have remained she would like to have talked with the other soldier and found out why he entered the service and what he thought of it she was possessed of a great desire to ask people questions find out why they had done what they did and what they thought about things other people were doing her mind was sending out little shoots in all directions and those little shoots were begging for food and drink she wished she might have a long talk with the troublemaker she would like to talk about dogs who had lived in alleys and dogs that had been reared in kennels about soldiers who were willing to recognize their betters and soldiers who thought they were as good as some above them she would like to talk about watts watts was the son of an old english servant it was in watts blood to recognize his betters was that why he could be moved to no sense of responsibility about stray dogs was that why he was a good man for the service and had no ambitions as civilian and ann she would like to talk to the boatmending troublemaker about ann why ann whom one would expect to find sympathetic with the homeless should be so hard and so queer about forlorn little stray dogs oh the world was just full of things that katie jones wanted to talk about that night when she reached the house she found that she had just received a package by special messenger she tore off the outer wrapper and on the inner was written in red ink danger murmuring some inane thing about its being her shoes she ran with the package to her room for a young woman who had all her life received packages of all kinds she was inordinately excited it held three books one of them was about women who worked there were pictures of girls working in factories and in different places one was something about evolution and one was on socialism and there was a pamphlet about the united states army and another pamphlet about religion she looked for a name in the books but found none the flyleaves had been torn out she was not sorry she was just as glad to go on thinking of her troublemaker as the man who mended the boats there was something freeing about keeping him impersonal but in the book about women she found an envelope addressed to one looking for trouble this was what was typewritten on the single sheet it contained here are a couple of books warranted to disturb ones peace of mind they are marked danger as both warning and commendation it is absolutely guaranteed that one will not be so pleased with the world and with ones self after reading them there is more both books and danger where they came from it was signed one who loves to lead adventurous souls into dangerous paths it was two oclock when katie turned off her light that night chapter xvi perhaps after all it was neither the dog nor the literature but the heat for the heat of that next day was the kind to prey through countries of makebelieve it oppressed every one but ann it seemed to excite as if it stirred memories in their sleep dont fight heat ann katie finally admonished puzzled and disturbed by the way ann kept moving about the only way to get ahead of the heat is to give up to it can you always do what you want to do ann demanded with a touch of petulance isnt there ever something makes you do things you know arent the things to do oh dear me yes laughed kate but youre simply your own worst enemy when you try to get ahead of the heat i dont know how youre going to help being your own worst enemy ann murmured she picked some leaves from the vines and threw them away purposelessly she made the cat get out of a chair and sat down in it herself only to get up again and pile all the magazines in a different way not facilitating anything by the change then after walking the length of the veranda she stood there looking at katie katie in the coolest and coolestlooking of summer dresses leaning back in a coollooking chair adjusting herself to things as they were poised victorious in her submission then ann said a strange thing a hot days just nothing but a hot day to you is it the words themselves said less than the laugh which followed them a laugh which carried both envy and resentment which at once admired and accused a laugh straight from the girl they were trying to ignore and pray what was a hot day to her katie wondered what was a hot day save a hot day but as she watched ann in the next few moments she seemed to be surveying a figure oppressed less by heat than by that to which the heat laid her open it seemed that the hot day might stand for the friction and the fretting of the world for things which closed in upon one as heat closed in bore down as heat bore down as ann pushed back the hair from her forehead it seemed she would push back the weight of the years it was at that moment that caroline osborne richest and most prominent girl of the vicinity stepped from her motor car katie had met her a few nights before at the dance and wayne knew her father a man of many interests it was his quarrel with the forest service that had brought her cousin fred wayneworth there fred was not one of his admirers isnt this heat distressing was her greeting though she had succeeded in keeping herself very fresh and sweet looking under the distress as katie turned to introduce the two girls she saw that ann was pulling at her handkerchief nervously was it irritating to have people for whom hot days were but hot days call heat distressing though one always has a breeze motoring she took it up there are so many ways in which automobiles make life more bearable dont you find it so miss jones katie replied inanely ann was still pulling at her handkerchief that they were indispensable of course though personally she was so fond of horses yes miss osborne loved horses too indeed it was army people had taught her to ride once when she visited at fort riley she had spent a month there with mrs baxter katie knew her oh yes katie knew her and almost all the rest of the army people whom miss osborne told of adoring of a common world they were not long strangers they came together through a whole network of associations finally they reached south carolina and concluded they must be related something about katies grandmother and miss osbornes greataunt katie in the midst of her interest turning instinctively to include ann was curiously arrested ann was sitting a little apart and there seemed so poignant a significance in her sitting apart it was an order of things from which she sat apart the network went too far back too deep down it was too intricate for either sympathy or ingenuity to shape it at will though katie tried for katie enough that she was sitting apart and consciously leaving grandmothers and greataunts in a sadly unfinished state she was lightly off into a story of something which had once happened to her and ann in rome but ann was as an actor refusing to play her part perhaps she was too resentfully conscious of its being but a part of her having no approach save through a part for the first time she failed in that adaptability which had always made the stories plausible in the midst of her tale katie met anns eyes and faltered they were mocking eyes as best she could she turned the conversation to local affairs for miss osborne was looking curiously at miss jones unresponsive friend and as ann for the first time seemed deliberately yes maliciously to fail katie for the first time felt out of patience and injured perhaps the heat was enervating but was that sufficient reason for embarrassing ones hostess perhaps it did make her think of hard things but was that any reason for failing in the things that made all this possible it was not appreciative it was not kind it did not show the right spirit katie told herself as she listened with what she was pleased to consider both atoning and rebuking graciousness to the plans for miss osbornes garden party it is for the working girls especially the lower class of working girls who are in the factories for instance the candy factory girls i am especially interested in that as father owns the candy factory it is a pet side issue of his you can see it from here across the river there on the little neck of land you see the girls are just beginning to come from work now the three girls looked across the river where groups of other girls were quitting a large building they could be seen but dimly but even at that distance something in the prevalent droop suggested that they too had found the day distressingly warm i hadnt realized said katie that making candy was such serious business it couldnt have been very pleasant today their guest granted but i believe it is regarded a very good place to work the book katie had been reading the night before had shown her the value of facts when it came to judging places where women worked and she was moved to the blunt inquiry how much do those girls make about six dollars a week i believe miss osborne replied katie watched them the long dim line of girls engaged in preparation of the sweets of life she was wondering what she would have thought it worth to go over there and work all day then each of those girls made a dollar today she asked and her inflection was curious well no miss osborne confessed the experienced and the skillful made a dollar and how much pressed katie did the least experienced and skillful make fifty cents i believe replied miss osborne seeming to have less enthusiasm when the scientific method was employed there was a jarring sound the girl sitting apart had pushed her chair still farther back you call that a good place to work she addressed it to miss osborne in voice that scraped as the chair had scraped why yes as places go i believe so though that is why i am giving the garden party they do need more pleasure in their lives it is one of the underlying principles of life is it not that all must have their pleasures ann laughed recklessly miss osborne looked puzzled katie worried and we are organizing this working girls club we think we can do a great deal through that oh yes help them get higher wages i suppose katie asked innocently n o that would scarcely be possible but help them to get on better with what they have help them learn to manage better again ann laughed not only recklessly but rudely that is surely a splendid thing she said and the voice which said it was highpitched and unsteady helping a girl to manage better on fifty cents a day you do not approve of these things miss osborne asked coldly and with all the heat katie felt herself growing suddenly cold as she heard ann replying oh if they help you pass the time i dont suppose they do any harm you see katie hastened miss forrest and i were once associated with one of those things which wasnt very well conducted i fear it prejudiced us evidently was miss osbornes reply though to be sure kate further propitiated resentment at having to do so growing with the propitiation that is very narrow of us i am sure your club will be quite different we may come to the garden party katie followed her guest to her car i am hoping it will be cooler soon she said my friend is here to grow stronger and this heat is quite unnerving her miss osborne accepted it with polite i trust she will soon be much better yes the heat is trying katie did not return to ann but sat at the head of the steps looking across the river she was genuinely offended she knew nothing more unpardonable than to embarrass ones hostess she grew hard in contemplation of it nothing justified it nothing a few girls were still coming from the candy factory miss osbornes car had crossed the bridge and was speeding toward her beautiful home up the river just the home for a garden party the last group of girls going along very slowly had to step back for the machine to rush by katie forgot her own grievance in wondering about those girls who had waited for the osborne car to pass she knew where miss osborne was going where and how she lived she was wondering where the girls not enjoying the breeze always to be found in motoring were going what they would do when they got there and what they thought of the efforts to help them manage better on their dollar or less a day it made her rise and return to ann ann too was looking across the river at the girls who had given miss osborne right of way two very red spots burned in anns cheeks and her eyes also were feverish i suppose i shouldnt have spoken that way to your friend she began but less contritely than defiantly katie flushed she had been prepared to understand and be kind but she was not equal to being scoffed at she who had been so embarrassed and betrayed it was certainly not very good form she said coolly and of course thats all that matters said ann shrilly its just good form that matters not the truth oh i dont see that you achieved any great thing for the truth ann anyhow rudeness is no less rude when called truth garden parties choked ann i am not giving the garden party ann said katie longsufferingly i was doing nothing more than being civil to a guest against rather heavy odds you were pretending to think it was lovely but of course thats good form her perilously bright eyes had so much the look of an animal pushed into a corner that katie changed come ann dear lets not quarrel with each other just because it has been a disagreeable day or because caroline osborne may have a mistaken idea of doing good and i a mistaken idea of being pleasant i promised worth a little spin on the river before dinner youll come it will be cooling my head aches said ann but the tension of her voice broke on a sob if you dont mind ill stay here she looked up at her in a way which remotely suggested the look of that little dog the day before katie i dont mean you when i say things like that i dont mean you i mean i suppose i mean the things back of you all those things she stopped but katie did not speak you see said ann there are two worlds and you and i are in different ones i dont believe in two worlds said katie promptly its not a democratic view of things its all one world your miss osborne and the fifty cents a day girls all one world i am afraid laughed ann tremulously that even the underlying principles of life would have a hard time making them one chapter xvii even on the river it was not yet cool day had burned itself too deeply upon the earth for approaching night to hold messages for even its favorite messenger katie was herself at the steering wheel and alone with worth and queen she had learned to manage the boat and much to the disappointment of watts and the disapproval of wayne sometimes went about on the river unattended katie contended that as a good swimmer and not a bad mechanic she was entitled to freedom in the matter she held that to be taken about in a boat had no relation to taking a boat and going about in it that when watts went her soul stayed home tonight especially she would have the boat for what it meant to self for to katie too the sultry day had become more than sultry day the thing which pressed upon her seemed less humidity than the consciousness of a world she did not know it was not the heat which was fretting her so much as that growing sense of limitations in her thought and experience she wondered what the man who mended the boats would say about anns two worlds she suspected that he would agree with ann and then proceeded to work herself into a fine passion at his agreeing with ann against her that silly thing of two worlds is fixed up by people who cant get along in the one world said she and that childish idea of one world is clung to by people who dont know the real world retorted the troublemaker to either side of the river were factories katie had never given much thought to factories beyond the thought that they disfigured the landscape now she wondered what the people who had spent that hot day in the unsightly buildings thought about the world in general be it one world or two worth had come up to the front of the boat the day had weighed upon him too for he seemed a wistful little boy just then she smiled at him lovingly what thinking about worthie dear oh i wasnt thinking aunt kate he replied soberly i was just wondering you too she laughed and what would you say worthie she asked after they had gone a little way in silence was the difference between thinking and wondering worth maturely crossed his knees as a sign of the maturity of the subject well i dont know cept when you think you know what youre thinking about and when you wonder you just dont know anything maybe you wonder when you dont know what to think katie suggested yes maybe so theres more to wonder about than there is to think about dont you think so aunt kate i wonder she laughed you do wonder dont you aunt kate you wonder more than you think she flashed him a keen queer look worth she asked after another pause in which the mind of twentyfive and the mind of six were wondering in their respective fashions do you know anything about the underlying principles of life the what aunt kate underlying principles of life she repeated grimly why no he acknowledged i guess i never heard of them i never did either till just lately i want to find out something about them do you know worthie dear id go a long way to find out something about them where would you have to go aunt kate could you go in a boat no i fear you couldnt go in a boat trouble is she murmured more to herself than to him i dont know where you would go dont papa know bout them i sometimes think he would like to learn papa knows all there is to know bout guns and powders defended worth loyally yes i know but i dont believe guns and powders have any power to get you to these underlying principles of life well what does get you there demanded her companion of the practical sex she laughed i dont know dear i honestly dont know and id like to know perhaps some time i will meet some one who is very wise and then ill ask whether it is experience or wisdom or sympathy whether some people are born to get there and other people not or just how it is watts says you have more sympathy than wisdom aunt kate you mustnt talk about me to watts she admonished spiritedly then in the distance she heard a mocking voice insinuatingly inquiring but why not if its all one world but he said worth added that it shouldnt be held against you cause of course you never had half a chance no it wasnt watts said that either it was the man that mends the boats it was watts said you was a yard wide katies head had gone up she was looking straight ahead cheeks red indeed so its the man that mends the boats says these hateful things about me is it why no aunt kate not hateful things he says hes sorry for you why he says he dont know anybody more to be pitied than you are well really i must say that of all the insolent impertinent insufferable he says you would have amounted to something if youd had half a chance but hes afraid you never will aunt kate i do not wish to hear anything more about him said aunt kate haughtily now or at any future time but it was not five minutes later she asked with studied indifference pray what does this absurd being look like what being aunt kate innocently inquired the being who was very young why this sympathetic gentleman oh i dont know hes just a man sometimes he wears boots hes real nice aunt kate oh im sure he must be charming she turned toward home more erect attending to her duties with a dignified sense of responsibility the glare of day had gone but without bringing the cool of night it made the world seem very worn little by little resentment slipped away and she had joined the man who mended the boats in pitying herself she was disposed to agree with him that she might have amounted to something had she had half a chance no one else had ever thought of her amounting to anything amounting or not amounting they had merely thought of her as katie jones and certainly no one else had ever pitied her it made the man who mended the boats seem a wise and tender being as against the whole world she felt drawn to his large and kindly understanding excitement had suddenly seized worth aunt kate aunt kate he cried peremptorily pointing to a cove in one of the islands they were passing please land there why no worth we cant land its too hard and why should we oh aunt kate please oh please she was puzzled but why worthie cause i want you to dont you love me t all any more aunt kate that was too much he was suddenly just a baby who had been made to suffer for her grownup disturbances but dearie what will you do when we land i want to look for something ive got to get something i want to show you something twont take but a minute what do you want to show me dear why i cant tell you aunt kate its a surprise its a beautifulest surprise something i want to show you just because i love you aunt kate katies eyes brooded over him dear little chappie and aunt kates a cross mean old thing isnt she not if shell stop the boat said crafty worth she laughed and surveyed the shore it looked feasible im very easy worth just dont get it into your head all the world is as easy as i am the little boy and the dog were out before she had made her landing they were running through the brush worth she called dont go far dont go out of sound no he called back excitedly taint far she was anxious reproaching herself as absurd and rash and was just attempting to ground the boat and follow when queen came bounding back then came worths voice here tis heres aunt kate waiting for you next there emerged from the brush a flushed and triumphant little boy and after him came a somewhat less flushed and less obviously triumphant man chapter xviii her first emotion was fury at herself she must be losing her mind not to have suspected then the fury overflowed on worth and his companion it reached highwater mark with the strangers smile and there dissolved or rather flowed into a savage interest for the smile enticed her to mark what manner of man he was and as she looked the interest shed the savagery his sleeves were rolled up he had no hat no coat he had been working with something muddy a young man a large man and strong the first thing which she saw as distinctive was the way his smile lived on in his eyes after it had died on his lips as if his thought was smiling at the smile even in that first outraged panicstricken moment katie jones knew she had never known a man like that here he is aunt kate cried her young nephew dancing up and down this is him it was not a presentation calculated to set katie at ease she sought refuge in a frigid i beg pardon but that was quite lost on worth why aunt kate dont you know him you said youd rather see him than anybody now living dont you know aunt kate the man that mends the boats it seemed that in proclaiming their name for him worth was shamelessly proclaiming it all her conversations the intimacy to which she had admitted him her delight in him yes need of him but i thought she murmured as if in justification that you had a long white beard and so she had at times then there had been other times when he had no beard at all but just such a chin i am sorry to be disappointing the stranger replied with his voice with his eyes it became clear even in that early moment that his eyes were insurgents he said i dont take any stock in that long white beard then as if fearing his eyes had overstepped perhaps you have visions of the future a long white beard is a gift the years may bring me you can just ask him anything you want to aunt kate worth was brightly assuring her i told him you wanted to know about the under life the under what it is of life you neednt be fraid of him aunt kate you know hes the mans so sorry for you he knows all about everything and will tell you just everything he knows quite a sweeping commendation katie found herself murmuring foolishly and in the imaginary conversations she had talked so brilliantly but when one could not be brilliant one could always find cover under dignity if you will get in the boat now worth she said we will go home but worth serene in the consciousness of having accomplished his mission was sending queen out after sticks and did not appear to have heard and suddenly perhaps because the hot day had come to mean so much more than mere hot day the feeling of being in a ridiculous position together with that bristling sense of the need of a protective dignity fell away it became one of those rare moments when real things matter more than things which supposedly should matter she looked at him to find him looking intently at her he was not at all slipshod as inspector why are you sorry for me she asked what is there about me to pity he smiled as he surveyed her considering it even people for whom smiling was difficult must have smiled at the idea of pitying katie jones katie who looked so much as if the world existed that she might have the world but he looked with a different premise and saw a deeper thing the world might exist for her enjoyment but it eluded her understanding and that was beginning to encroach upon the enjoyment she seemed to follow and her divination stirred a singular emotion possibly a more turbulent emotion than katie jones had ever known its all very well to pity me but its not a genuine pity its a jeering one if youre going to pity me why dont you do it sincerely instead of scoffingly is it my fault that i dont know anything about life what chance did i ever have to know anything real i wasnt educated i was accomplished oh of course if i had been a big person a person with a real mind if i had had anything exceptional about me i would have stepped out but im nothing but the most ordinary sort of girl i havent any talents nobody myself included can see any reason for my being any different from the people im associated with i was brought up in the army army life isnt real life its army life to an army man a girl is a girl and what they mean by a girl has nothing to do with being a thinking being then what business has a man like you i dont know who you are or what youre doing but i believe you have some ideas about the real things of life tell me please what business have you jeering at me i have no business jeering at you he said quickly simply and strongly but katie had changed he had a fancy that she would always be changing that she was not one to rest in outlived emotions that one mood was always but the making and enriching of another mood moment ever flowing into moment taking with it the heart of the moment that had gone you are quite right to pity me she said and tears surged beneath both eyes and voice whether scoffingly or genuinely you were quite right feeling just enough to feel there is something but not a big enough feeling to go to that something knowing just enough to know im being cheated but without either the courage or the knowledge to do anything about it im surely a pitiable and laughable object come worth she said sharply were going home but worth had begun upon the construction of a raft and was not in a homegoing mood thus encouraged by his young friend the man who mended the boats sat down on a log when did you begin to want to know about the underlying principles of life his smile quoted it though less mockingly than tenderly katie was silent was it the day she came he asked quietly she gasped was he a wizard but looking at him and seeing he looked very much more like a man than like anything else she met him as man should be met the day who came i dont know what you mean the girl was it the day you took her in saved her by making her save you she was too startled by that for pretense she could only stare at him i saw her before you did he said she looked around apprehensively the man who mended the boats knowing about ann was the whole world losing its mind just because it had been such a hot day but the world looking natural enough she turned back to him i dont understand tell me please as he summoned it he changed she had an impression of all but the central thing falling away leaving his spirit exposed and a thought or a vision gripped that spirit and he tightened under it as a muscle would tighten when he turned to her taking her in selfconsciousness fell away there was no place for it you want to hear about it he asked she nodded as a matter of fact its nothing as facts go only an impression yet an impression that swore to facts perhaps you know that she came on the island from the south bridge katie shook her head i know nothing save that suddenly she was there that held him and knowing nothing you took her in she kept silence and he looked at her dwelling upon it and you he said softly dont know anything about the underlying principles of life perhaps you dont but if we had more you wed have no her she disclaimed it it wasnt that way an understanding way i didnt do it because i thought it should be done because i wanted to do good i oh i dont know i did it because i wanted to do it i did it because i couldnt help doing it that called to him he seemed one for whom ideas were as doors ever opening into new places and he did not shut those doors or turn from them until he had looked as far as he could see perhaps he saw now that is the way it must come doing it because you cant help doing it it seems wonderful enough to work the wonder work what wonder katie asked timidly the wonder of saving the world he spoke it quietly but passion the passion of the visioner leaped to his eyes at sound of what he had said katie looked about at so much of the world as her vision afforded prosperous factories beautiful homes hundreds of other homes less beautiful but comfortable looking some other very humble homes which yet looked habitable the beautifully kept government island in between the two cities seeming to stand for something stable and unifying far away hills and a distant sky line a steamboat going through the splendid government bridge automobiles and carriages and farm wagons passing over that bridge this man who mended the boats this young man so live that thoughts of life could change him as a sculptor can change his clay dear little worth who was happily building a raft the beautiful dog lying there drawing restoration from the breath of the water but it doesnt look as though it needed saving said katie he shook his head youre looking at the framework her eyes that day brought word from the inside to one knowing he broke off looking at her as though seeing her from a new angle he thought it aloud youve walked sunny paths havent you you never had your soul twisted life never tried to wring you out of shape and yet oh theres quite a yet he finished more lightly but you were telling me of ann katie felt she must say yes and when ive finished telling you youll go back to your sunny paths wont you please dont hurry me i can tell it better if i think im not being hurried she smiled openly i am in no hurry there was a sunny rim trying all the while to pierce the somber thing which drew them together little rays from the sunny paths would dart daringly in to the dark place from which ann rose it made him wonder how far she of the sunny paths could penetrate an unlighted country he looked at her peered at her fairly trying to decide but he could not decide katie baffled him on that i wonder he voiced it where its going to lead you i wonder if youre prepared to go where it may lead you have you thought of that perhaps its going to take you into a country too dark for you of the sunny paths she may be called back you know we are called back to countries where we have established a residence you might have to go with her to settle a claim or break a tie or pull some one else out that she might not be pulled back in then what perhaps you might feel you needed a guide if so he went boldly to the edge of it then halted and concluded with a boyishly bashful humor will you keep my application on file katie was not going to miss her chance of finding out something i should want a guide who knew the territory she said i qualify he replied shortly with a short unmirthful laugh that is one advantage of not having spent ones days on sunny paths his voice on that was neither bashful nor boyish but you must have spent some of them on sunny paths she urged with more feeling than she would have been able to account for you dont look katie added almost shyly as if you had grown in the dark he did not reply he looked so much older when sternness set his face leaving no hint of that teasing gleam in his eyes that pleasing little humorous twist of his mouth gently her voice went into the dark country claiming him then but you were telling me of my friend it brought him out wondering anew your friend there you go again how can you expect me to stick to a subject when paths open out on all sides of you like that but ill try to quit straying it happened that on that day just at that time i was going under the south bridge i chanced to look up a face was bending down her face our eyes met square i got it flung to me in that one look what the world had done to her what she thought of it for doing it what she meant to do about it i wish he went on with a slow heavy calm that the good men and women of the world those good men and women who eat good dinners and sleep in good beds some of the gods in heaven alls well with the world people could have that look wake them up in the middle of the night id like to think of them turning to the wall and trying to shut it out and the harder they tried the nearer and clearer it grew id like to think of them sitting up in bed praying god the god of good folks to please make it stop id like to have it haunt them dog them finally pierce their brains or souls or whatever it is they have and begin to burrow id like to have it right there on the job every time they mentioned the goodness of god or the justice of man till finally they threw up their hands in crazed despair with for gods sake what do you want me to do about it he had scarcely raised his voice he was smiling at her it was the smile led her to gasp why i believe you hate us why i really believe i do he replied quietly still smiling suddenly she flared thats not the thing youre not going to set the world right by hating the world youre not going to make it right for some people by hating other people what good thing can come of hate the greatest things have come of hate of a divine hate that transcends love why no they havent the greatest things have come of love what the world needs is more love you cant bring love by hating he seemed about to make heated reply but smiled or rather his smile became really a smile as he said what a lot of things you and i would find to talk about we must katie began impetuously but halted and flushed we must go on with our story was what it came to i havent any story except just the story of that look though it holds the story of love and hate and a hundred other things you and i would disagree about and i dont know that i can convey to you you of the sunny paths what the look conveyed to me but imagine a crowd a crazed crowd all pushing to the center and then in the center a face thrown back so you can see it for just an instant before it sinks to suffocation if you can fancy that look the last gasp for breath of one caught squeezed just going down a hatred of the crowd that got her there just to suffocate her and perhaps one last wild look at the hills out beyond the crowd if you can get that that fear suffocation terror and dont forget the hate yet like the dog youve kicked that grieved how could you when it was a pat i wanted i know it in the dog language said katie quiveringly then imagine the dog crazed with thirst tied just out of reach of a leaping dancing brook oh please thats too plain it hurts when applied to dogs does it he asked roughly but theyre so helpless and they love us so and theyre so helpless and they hate because they werent let love but surely there arent many such looks not many who feel theyre going down why such things couldnt be in this beautiful world such he said smilingly has ever been the philosophy of sunny paths you neednt talk to me like that she retorted angrily i guess i saw the look as well as you did and did a little more to banish it than you did too true i was just coming to that thing of my not having done anything perhaps it was a case of fools rushing in where angels feared to tread you mustnt mind being called a fool in any sentence so preposterous as to call me an angel you see one who had never been in the crowd would say why dont you get out it would be droll wouldnt it to have some one on a far hill call but why dont you come over here dont you see how that must appeal to the sense of humor of the one about to go down she made no reply the thing that hurt her was that he seemed to enjoy hurting her you see ive been in the crowd he said more simply and less bitterly i dont suppose men who have been most burned to death ever say the fire cant hurt you and do they never try to rescue others from fires asked katie scornfully do they let them burn just because they know fire for a dangerous thing rescue them for what more fires its a question whether its very sane or so very humane either to rescue a man from one fire just to have him on hand for another i dont think i ever in my life heard anything more farfetched pronounced katie how do you know therell be another because there are people for whom theres nothing else if you cant offer a safe place why rescue at all though its true he laughed that i hadnt the courage of my convictions in the matter after that look oh i havent been able to make it live burn as it did she passed on the island the guard evidently thinking she was with some people who had just got out of an automobile and gone on for a walk and suddenly i was corrupted driven by that impulse for saving life that beautiful passion for keeping things alive to suffer which is so humorously grounded in the human race he stopped with a little laugh watching him katie was thinking one need have small fear of his not always being corrupted there was a light in his eyes spoke for corruption i saw her making straight across the island he went back to his story i knew and i knew that on the other side she might find things very conveniently arranged for her purpose i turned the boat and went at its best speed around the head of the island hugged the shore on your side pulled into a little cove waited he looked at katie comparing her with an a priori idea of her i saw you sitting up there in the sun on the bunker just having received the last will and testament as it were of this other human soul cant you fancy how i hated you sitting there so serenely in the sun but why hate me she demanded passionately thats where youre small and unjust i dont make the crazed crowds do i yes thats just what you do thered be no crowds if it werent for you you take up too much room i dont see why you want to hurt me like that she said unevenly dont you want me to enjoy my place any more will it do any good for me to get in the crowd what can i do about it looking into her passionately earnest face it was perhaps the gulf between the girl and his a priori idea of her brought the smile a smile no kin to that hard smile of his and looking with a different slant across the gulf there was a sort of affectionate roguery in his eyes as he asked do you want to know what i honestly think about you she nodded i think youre in for it in for what i dont think youve the ghost of a chance to escape he gloated escape what seeing and when you do he laughed that laugh one thinks of as the exclusive possession of an affectionate understanding and when it died to a smile something tenderly teasing flickered in that smile she flushed under it you were telling me we keep stopping yes dont we i wonder if we always would we keep stopping to quarrel yes to quarrel i wonder if we always would i havent a doubt of it in the world said katie feelingly and they laughed together as friends laugh together well where did i leave myself oh yes waiting sitting there busily engaged in hating you then she came across the grass making straight for the river running i saw that you saw and the thing that mattered to me then was what you would do about it saved or not saved she was gone i thought the crowd had squeezed it all out of her the live thing to me was what you the you of the world that you became to me would do about her he paused smiling at that absurd and noble vision of katie tumbling down the bunker and when you did what you did do it was so treacherously disarming the quickwitted humanity the clever tenderness of it i loved you so for it that i just couldnt go on hating theres where youre a dangerous person how dare you standing for the you of the world dampen the splendid ardor of my hate katie did not let pass her chance perhaps if the me of the world were known a little more intimately it would be less hated he shook his head they just happened to have you they cant keep you there was another one of those pauses which drew them so much closer than the words she knew what he was wondering and he knew that she knew at length she colored a little and called him back to the greater reserve of words i saw how royally you put it through i could see you standing there on the porch looking back to the river ive wanted several things rather badly in my life but i doubt if ive ever wanted anything much worse than to know what you were saying and then with my own two eyes i saw the miracle saw her the girl who had just had all the concentrated passion of the her of the world turn and follow you into the house it was a blow to me oh twas an awful blow why a blow in the first place that you should want to and then that you should be able to my philosophy gives you of the sunny paths no such desire nor power showing she deduced quickly and firmly that your philosophy is all wrong oh no showing that the much toasted miss katherine jones is too big for mere sunny paths showing that she has a latent ambition to climb a mountain in a storm fleetingly she wondered how he should know her for the much toasted miss katherine jones but in the center of her consciousness rose that alluring picture of climbing a mountain in a storm tell me how you did it why i dont know i had no method i told her i needed her you needed her and afterwards in a different way i told her that again and i did i do why do you need her how do you need her he urged gently she hesitated her mouth her splendid mouth shaped by stern or tender thinking to lines of exquisite fineness or firmness trembled slightly and the eyes which turned seriously upon him were wistful perhaps said katie that even on sunny paths one guesses that there are such things as storms in the mountains it was only his eyes which answered but the fullness of the response ushered them into a silence in which they rested together understandingly i sat there watching the house he went back to it after the moment i was sure the girl would come out again shell bungle it i said to myself shell never be able to put it through but time passed and she did not come out inconsistently enough that came with a ring of triumph and then the next day after the wonder had grown and grown i saw her driving with you i was just off the head of the island she was turned toward me looking up the river again i saw her eyes and in them that time i read you and i dont believe he concluded with a little laugh that my stock of hate can ever be quite so secure again they talked on not conscious that it was growing late time and place and the conventions of time and place seemed outside she let him in quite freely to that edge of fun and excitement as well as to the strange and somber places it was fun sharing fun with him and something in his way of receiving it suggested that he had been in need of sharing some ones fun he had a way of looking at her when she laughed that had vague suggestion of something not far from gratitude but the fun light and that other light which seemed wanting to thank her for something went from his eyes leaving a glimmer of something deeper as he asked but youve never asked for her story youve demanded nothing why no said katie only that i should be proud if she ever felt i could help he turned his face a little away one looking into it then would not have given much for his stock of hate worth had approached aint you getting awful hungry aunt kate it recalled her and to embarrassment we must go at once she said confused did you find out all you wanted to know from him aunt kate he asked getting in the boat she transcended her embarrassment no worth only that there is a very great deal i would like to know he was standing ready to push her boat away she did not give the word as she looked at him she had a fancy that she was leaving him in a lonely place she who was going back to what he called the sunny paths and not only did she feel that he was lonely but she felt curiously lonely herself sitting there waiting to tell him to push her away she wanted to say come and see me but she was too bound by the things to which she was returning to put it in the language of those things and so she said and the new shyness brought its own sweetness you tell me to come to you if i need a guide thank you for that i shall remember and perhaps sunshine is a thing that soaks in and can be stored up and given out again if it ever seems i can be of any use in any way will you come where you know you can find me her eyes fell before the things which had leaped to his chapter xix two hours later she found herself alone on the porch with captain prescott a good deal had happened in the meantime mrs prescott had arrived during katies absence a stopover of two weeks having been shortened to two hours because of the illness of her friend her room at her sons quarters being uninhabitable because of fresh paint wayne had insisted she come to them and she was even then resting up in anns room or rather the room which had been put at her disposal a bed having been arranged for ann in katies room had katie been at home she would have planned it some other way for above all things she did not want it to occur to ann that she was in the way but katie had been very busy talking to the man who mended the boats and naturally it would not occur to wayne that ann would be at all sensitive about giving up her room for a few days to accommodate a dear old friend of theirs and perhaps she was not sensitive about it only this was no time katie felt to make ann feel she was crowding any one and in katies absence pet had been shot pet had not seemed to realize that alley methods of defense were not in good repute in the army he could not believe that pourquoi and nestcepas had no guile in their hearts when they pawed at him furthermore he seemed to have a prejudice against enlisted men and showed his teeth at several of them katie began to explain that that was because but wayne had curtly cut her short with saying that he didnt care why it was the fact that it was had made it impossible to have the dog around if one of the men had been bitten by the contemptible cur katie couldnt cauterize the wound with the story of the dogs hard life the only bright spot she could find in it was that probably watts had taken a great deal of pleasure in executing waynes orders and caroline osborne said that all needed pleasure she saw that anns hands were clenched and so had not pursued the discussion katie was not in high favor with her brother that night he said it was outrageous she should not have been there to receive mrs prescott when katie demurred that she would have been less outrageous had she had the slightest notion mrs prescott would be there to be received it developed that wayne was further irritated because he had come to take ann out for a boat ride and katie had gone in the boat heaven only knew where then when katie sought to demolish that irritation with the suggestion that just then was the most beautiful time of day for the river and she knew it would do ann good to go wayne clung manfully to his grievance this time labeling it worry he forbade katies going any more by herself it was preposterous she should have stayed so long he would have been out looking for her had it not been that watts had been able to get a glimpse of the boat pulled in on the upper island katie wondered what else watts had been able to get a glimpse of wayne was so bent on being abused hot days affected people differently that the only way she could get him to relinquish a grievance for a pleasure was to put it in the form of a duty ann needed a ride on the river katie affirmed and so they had gone wayne doing his best to cover his pleasure men never really grow up she mused to waynes back every so often they have to act just like little boys only little boys arent half so apt to do it though perhaps wayne had been downright disappointed at not having the boat for ann when he came home was he meaning to deliver that lecture on the army she hoped that whatever he talked about it would bring ann home without that strained harassed look and now katie was talking to captain prescott and thinking of the man who mended the boats captain prescott was a good one to be talking to when one wished to be thinking of some one else he called one to no dim receding distances she was thinking that in everything save the things which counted most he was not unlike this other man name unknown both were wellbuilt young vigorous attractive but life had dealt differently with them and they were dealing differently with life that made a difference big as life itself from the far country in which she was dreaming she heard captain prescott talking about girls he was talking sentimentally but even his sentiment opened no vistas and suddenly she remembered how she had at one time thought it possible she would marry him the remembrance appalled her less in the idea of marrying him than in the consciousness of how far she had gone from the place where marrying him suggested itself to her at all life had become different this showed her how vastly different but as he talked on she began to feel that it had not become as different to him as to her he had not been making little excursions up and down unknown paths he had remained right in his place that place seemed to him the place for katie jones as he talked on about what he called life sublimely unconscious of the fences all around him shutting out all view of what was really life it became unmistakable that captain prescott was getting ready to propose to her she had had too much experience with the symptoms not to recognize them katie did not want to be proposed to she was in no mood for dealing with a proposal she had too many other things to be thinking of wondering about but she reprimanded herself for selfishness it meant something to him whether it did to her or not she must be kind as kind as she could the kindest thing she could think of was to keep him from proposing to that end she answered every sentimental remark with a flippant one it grieved but did not restrain him i had thought you would understand better katie he said something in his voice made her question the kindness of her method better decline a love than laugh at it he talked on of how he had at various times cared in a way he said for various girls but had never found the thing he knew was fated to mean the real thing to him katie had heard it all before and always told with that same freedom from suspicion of its ever having been said before but perhaps it was the very fact that it was familiar made her listen with a certain tenderness for she seemed to be listening less to him than to the voice of bygone days all those merry unthinking days which in truth had dealt very kindly and generously with her she had a sense of leaving them behind that alone was enough to make her feel tenderly toward them even a place within a highboard fence intolerable if one thought one were to remain in it became a kindly and a pleasant spot from the top of the fence once free to turn ones face to the wide sweep without one was quite ready to cast loving looks back at the enclosure and so she softened prepared to deal tenderly with captain prescott as he seemed then less the individual than the incarnation of outlived days it was into that mellowed sweetly melancholy mood he sent the following and so katie i wanted to talk to you about it youre such a good pal such a bully sort i wanted to tell you that i care for ann and want to marry her she dropped from the highboard fence with a jolt that wellnigh knocked her senseless i suppose he said that you must have suspected well not exactly suspected said katie feeling her bumps as it were her first emotion was that it was pretty shabby treatment to accord one who was at such pains to be kind it gave one a distinctly injured feeling getting all sweet and mellow only to be dashed to the ground and let lie there in that foolish looking certainly foolish feeling heap but as soon as she had picked herself up and katie was too gamey to be long in picking herself up she wondered what under heaven she was going to do about things what had she let herself in for now the pains of an injured dignity throb of a pricked self love were forgotten in this real problem confronting her she even grew too grave to think about how funny it was for katie saw this as genuinely serious harry she asked have you said anything to your mother well not said anything he laughed but she knows mothers keen he replied i once thought i was was katies unspoken comment and have you you are so good as to confide in me so i presume to ask questions have you said anything to ann no not said anything he laughed again but she knows i dont know i wondered if you did no said katie i dont truth is ive been so wrapped up in my own affairs some things ive had on my mind that i havent been thinking about people around me falling in love people are always falling in love he remarked sentimentally one should always be prepared for that so it seems replied katie and yet one is not always entirely prepared she had picked herself up from her fall but she was not yet able to walk very well fortunately he was too absorbed in his own happy striding to mark her hobbling a young man talking of his love does not need a brilliant conversationalist for companion and he was a young man in love that grew plain had katie ever seen such eyes and as for the mouth though perhaps most remarkable of all was the voice just what did it make katie think of he enumerated various things it made him think of only to express his dissatisfaction with them all as inadequate had katie ever seen any one so beautiful and with such an adorable shy little way had katie ever heard her say anything about him did she think he had any chance was there any other fellow of course there must have been lots of other fellows in love with her a girl like that but had she cared for any of them would katie tell him something about her she had been reserved about herself the kind of reserve a fellow wouldnt try to break through would katie tell him of her life and her people not that it made any difference with him oh he wanted just her but his mother would want to know katie knew how mothers were about things like that and he did want his mother to like her surely she would how could she help it she wondered if ann knew him for a young man in love katies heart hardened against ann at the possibility that would not be playing a fair game ann was not in position to let katies friends fall in love with her katie had not counted on that have you any reason she asked to think ann cares for you he laughed happily n o only i dont think it displeases her to have me say nice things to her and again he laughed then ann had encouraged him a girl had no business to encourage a man to say nice things to her when she knew nothing could come of it but katies memory there nudged katies primness memory of all the men who had been encouraged to say nice things to katie jones even when it was not desirable or perhaps even possible that anything could come of it but of course that was different ann was in no position to permit nice things being said to her katie he was asking where did you first meet her how did you come to know her cant you tell me all about it there came a mad impulse to do so to say i first met her right down there at the edge of the water she was about to commit suicide i dont know why i think she was one of those dont you care girls you admired in daiseymaisey but im not sure of even that i didnt want her to kill herself so i took her in and pretended she was a friend of mine i made the whole thing up i even made up her name she said her name was verna woods but i think thats a madeup name too i havent the glimmering of an idea what her real name is who her people are where she came from or why she wanted to kill herself then what first bitter reproaches for katie she would be painted as having violated all the canons for the first time watching her friends face softened by his dreams seeing him as his mothers son she questioned her right to violate them she did not know why she had not thought more about it before it had seemed such a joke on the people in the enclosure but it was not going to be a joke to hurt them was that what came of violating the canons was the hurt to ones friends the punishment one got for it you cant cauterize the wounds with the story of the dogs hard life wayne had said of poor little unpetted and because unpetted unpettable pet was watts the real philosopher when he said things was as they was she was bewildered she was in a country where she could not find her way she needed a guide her throat grew tight her eyes hot at thought of how badly she needed her guide then perhaps in selfdefense she saw her friend captain prescott not as a victim of the violation of canons but as a violator of them himself she turned from anns past to his harry she asked in rather metallic voice how about that affair of yours down in cuba he flushed with surprise and resentment i must say katie he said stiffly i dont see what it has to do with this why i should think it might have something to do with it isnt there a popular notion that our pasts have something to do with our futures its all over he said shortly then you would say harry that when things are over theyre over that they neednt tie up the future certainly not said he making it clear that he wanted that phase of the conversation over its my own theory said katie but i didnt know whether or not it was yours now if i had had a past and it was as you say yours is all over i shouldnt think it was any mans business to go poking around in it that he said is a different matter whats a different matter she asked aggressively a womans past that would be a mans business though a mans past is not a womans business oh we certainly neednt argue that old nonsense youre too much the girl of the world to take any such absurd position katie of course being what you call a girl of the world its absurd i should question the mans point of view but i cant quite get the logic of it you wouldnt marry a woman with a past and yet the woman who marries you is marrying a man with one ive lived a mans life he said and he said it with a certain pride and perhaps shes lived a womans life katie was thinking only the woman was not entitled to the pride for her it led toward selfdestruction rather than selfapproval its this way katie he explained to her this is the difference a womans past doesnt stay in the past it marks her why i can tell a woman with a past every time he concluded confidently katie sat there smiling at him the smile puzzled him now look here katie surely you a girl of the world the good sort arent going to be so melodramatic as to dig up a past for me are you no said katie i dont want to be melodramatic ill try to dig up no pasts his talk ran on and her thoughts it seemed so cruel a thing that anns past whatever it might be and surely nothing short of a past could make a girl want to kill herself should rise up and damn her now to him she was a dear lovely girl the sort of a girl a man would want to marry very well then intrinsically she was that why not let people be what they were why not let them be themselves instead of what one thought they would be from what one knew of their lives it was so easy to see marks when one knew of things which ones philosophy held would leave marks it seemed a fairer and a saner thing to let human beings be what their experiences had actually made them rather than what one thought those experiences would make them captain prescott had blighted a cuban womans life for his own pleasure and vanity with ann it may have been the press of necessity or it may have been the call of life either one being driven by life or drawn to it seemed less ignominious than trifling with life why would it be so much worse for captain prescott to marry ann than it would be for ann to marry captain prescott the man who mended the boats would back her up in that through her somber perplexity there suddenly darted the sportive idea of getting ann in the army the audacious little imp of an idea peeped around corners in katies consciousness and tried to coquet with her banished it came scampering back to whisper that ann would not bring the army its first past either masculine or feminine only in the army they managed things in such wise that there was no need of committing suicide ann had been a bad manager but at that moment they were joined by captain prescotts mother and he retired for a solitary smoke chapter xx mrs prescott made vivid and compelling those days those things which katie had a little while before had the fancy of so easily slipping away from she made them things which wove themselves around one or rather things of which one seemed an organic part from which one could no more pull away than the trees branch could pull away from the trees trunk in her presence katie was claimed by those things out of which she had grown claimed so subtly that it seemed a thing outside volition mrs prescott did not in any form say things were as they were it was only that she breathed it how could one combat with words or in action that rooted so much deeper than mere words or action she was a slight and simple looking lady to be doing anything so large as stemming the tide of a revolutionary impulse she had never lost the girlishness of her figure or of her hands so much had youth left her her face was thin and pale and of the contour vaguely called aristocratic it was perhaps the iron gray hair rolling back from the pale face held the suggestion of austerity but that which best expressed her was the poise of her head she carried it as if she had a right to carry it that way it was of small things she talked the people she had met people they knew whom katie knew it was that network of small things she wove around katie one might meet a large thing in a large way but that subtle tissue of the little things they talked of katies mother and as they talked it came to katie that perhaps the most live things of all might be the dead things katies mother had not been unlike mrs prescott save that to katie at least she seemed softer and sweeter they had been girls together in charleston they had lived on the same street gone to the same school come out at the same party and katies mother had met katies father when he came to be best man at mrs prescotts wedding then they had been stationed together at a frontier post in a time of danger wayne had been born at that post they had been together in times of birth and times of death mrs prescott spoke of worth and of how happy she knew katie was to have him with her she talked of the responsibility it brought katie and as they talked it did seem responsibility and responsibility was another thing which stole subtly up around her chaining her with intangible and because intangible unbreakable chains mrs prescott wanted to know about wayne was he happy or had the unhappiness of his marriage gone too deep your dear mother grieved so about it katie she said she saw how it was going it hurt her yes said katie i know it made mother very sad i am glad that her death came before the separation oh i dont know said katie i think mother would have been glad she did not believe in divorce your mother and i katie were the oldfashioned kind of churchwomen neither did mother believe in unhappiness said katie and drew a longer breath for saying it for it was as if the things claiming her had crowded up around her throat mrs prescott sighed we cannot understand those things it is a strange age in which we are living katie i sometimes think that our only hope is to trust god a little more or help man a little more said katie perhaps said mrs prescott gently that giving more trust to god would be giving more help to man im not sure i get the connecting link said katie more sure of herself now that it had become articulate mrs prescott put one of her fine hands over upon katies why child you cant mean that that would have hurt your mother for the moment katie did not speak if mother had understood just what i meant understood all about it i dont believe it would a second time she was silent as it struggled and if it had she spoke it as a thing not to be lightly spoken i should be very deeply sorry but i would not be able to help it why child murmured her mothers friend youre talking strangely you the devoted daughter you always were not able to help hurting your mother katies eyes filled it had become so real the things stealing around her the thing in her which must push them back that it was as if she were hurting her mother and suffering in the consciousness of bringing suffering memory the tenderest of memories was another thing weaving itself around her clinging to her heart claiming her but suddenly she leaned forward would i be able to help being myself she asked passionately mrs prescott seemed startled i fear she said perplexed by the tears in katies eyes and the stern line of her mouth that we are speaking of things i do not understand katie was silent agreeing with her mrs prescott broke the silence the world is changing and again agreeing katie saw that in those changes friends bound together by dear ties might be driven far apart katie she asked after a moment tell me of my boy and your friend there was a wistful almost tremulous note in her voice you have sympathy and intelligence katie you must know what a time like this means to a mother katie could not speak it seemed she could bear little more that night and she longed for time to think it out know where she stood come to some terms with herself but forced to face it she tried to do so lightly she thought it just a fancy of harrys wasnt he quite given to falling in love with pretty girls his mother shook her head he cares for her i know and do you not see katie that that makes her about the biggest thing in life to me katies heart almost stood still she was staggered through her wretchedness surged a momentary yearning to be one of those people oh one of those safe people who never found the peepholes in their enclosure tell me of her katie urged her mothers friend harry seems to think she means much to you just what is it she means to you for the moment she was desperate in her wondering how to tell it and then it happened that from her frenzied wondering what to say of it she sank into the deeper wondering what it was what it was what in truth it had been all the time ann meant to her why had she done it what was that thing less fleeting than fancy more imperative than sympathy made ann mean more than things which had all her life meant most watching katie mrs prescott wavered between gratification and apprehension pleased that that light in katies eyes a finer light than she had ever known there before should come through thought of this girl for whom harry cared troubled by the strangeness and the sternness of katies face it was katie herself mrs prescott wanted had always wanted she had always hoped it would be that way not only because she loved katie but because it seemed so as it should be she believed that summer would have brought it about had it not been for this other girl this stranger katies embarrassment had fallen from her pushed away by feeling she was scarcely conscious of mrs prescott she was thinking of those paths of wondering every path leading into other paths intricate limitless she had been asleep now she was awake it was through ann it had come perhaps more had come through ann than was in ann but beneath all else deeper even than that warm tenderness flowering from anns need of her was that tenderness of the awakened spirit a grateful song coming through an opening door it had so claimed her that she was startled at sound of mrs prescotts voice as she said with a nervous little laugh why katie you alarm me you make me feel she must be strange she is strange said katie would you say katie she asked anxiously that she is the sort of girl to make my boy a good wife suddenly the idea of anns making harry prescott any kind of wife came upon katie as preposterous not because she would be bringing him a past but because she would bring gifts he would not know what to do with i dont think of ann as the making some man a good wife type i think of ann she tried to formulate it as having gone upon a quest as being ever upon a quest a quest faltered mrs prescott for what life said katie peering off into the darkness mrs prescott was manifestly disturbed at the prospect of a daughterinlaw upon a quest she sounds temperamental she said critically yes said katie laughing a little grimly shes temperamental all right they could not say more as ann and wayne were coming toward them across the grass and almost immediately afterward the osborne car again stopped before the house it was mr osborne himself this time bringing the leonards who had been dining with him they had stopped to see mrs prescott katie was not sorry for it turned mrs prescott from ann like the football player who has lost his wind she wanted a little time counted out but she soon found that she was not playing anything so kindly as a game of hard and fast rules it seemed at first that anns ride had done her good she seemed to have relaxed and did not give katie that sense of something smoldering within her katie sat beside her an arm thrown lightly about anns shoulders lightly but guardingly neither of them talked much mrs prescott and mrs leonard were visiting the men talking of some affairs of mr osbornes he was commending the army for minding its own business not butting in and trying to ruin business the way some other departments of the government did the army seemed in high favor with mr osborne suddenly mrs leonard turned to katie she was a large woman poised by the shallow serenity of selfapproval i do feel so sorry for miss osborne she said such a shocking thing has occurred one of the girls at the candy factory you know shes trying so hard to help them has committed suicide mrs prescott uttered an exclamation of horror katie patted the shoulder beside her soothingly understandingly and as if begging for calm even under her light touch she seemed to feel the nerves leap up mr osborne turned to them poor cal shed better let things alone whats the use she cant do anything with people like that its the cause of the suicide thats the disgusting thing said colonel leonard or rather amended his wife the lack of cause but surely protested mrs prescott no girl would take her life without what she thought was cause surely all human beings hold life and death too sacred for that oh do they scoffed mrs leonard not that class i scarcely expect you to believe me i had a hard time believing it myself but she says she committed suicide she left a note for her roommate because she was tired of not having any fun the hand upon anns shoulder grew fairly eloquent and ann seemed trying her hands were tightly clasped in her lap why i dont know said wayne i think thats about one of the best reasons i can think of this is not a jesting matter captain jones said mrs leonard severely far from it said wayne think what it means to a girl like caroline osborne a girl who is trying to do something for humanity to find the people she wants to uplift so trivial so without souls it is hard on cal agreed cals father though perhaps just a trifle harder ventured wayne on the girl who did well what did she do it for he demanded come now captain you cant make out much of a case for her mrs leonards word is just right trivial she said she was tired of things tired tired tired of things she put it tired of walking down the same street tired of hanging her hat on the same kind of a peg now captain if you can put up any defense for a girl who kills herself because shes tired of hanging her hat on a certain kind of peg well he laughed if you can all ive got to say is that youd better leave the army and go in for criminal law why didnt she walk down some other street he resumed as no one broke the pause if its a matter of life and death a person might walk down some other street and ive no doubt said captain prescott that if it were known her life as well as her hat hung upon it she might have had a different kind of peg they laughed oh of course the secret of it is pronounced the colonel she was a neurotic for the first time katie spoke i think its such a fine thing we got hold of that word since weve known about neurotics we can just throw all the emotion and suffering and tragedy of the world in the one heap and leave it to the scientists it lets us out so beautifully doesnt it oh but katie admonished mrs prescott think of it what is the world coming to going forth to meet ones god because one doesnt like the peg for ones hat katie had a feeling of every nerve in anns body leaping up in frenzy god she laughed wildly dont drag him into it do you think he cares turning upon mrs prescott as if she would spring at her do you think for a minute he cares what kind of pegs our hats are on chapter xxi katies memory of what followed was blurred she remembered how relieved she was when anns laugh oh the memory of that laugh was clear enough gave way to sobbing sobbing was easier to deal with she said something about her friends being ill and that they would have to excuse them she almost wanted to laugh or was it cry herself at the way harry prescott was looking from ann to his mother after she got ann in the house she went back and begged somebodys pardon she wasnt sure whose and told colonel leonard that of course he could understand it on the score of anns being a neurotic she was afraid she might have said that rather disagreeably and she believed she told mrs prescott she had to tell mrs prescott something she looked so frightened and hurt and outraged that ann had a form of nervous trouble which made it impossible for her to hear the name of god the hardest was wayne she came to him on the porch after the others had gone they were not long in dispersing wayne she said im sorry to have embarrassed you his short curt laugh did not reveal his mood it was scoffing contemptuous but she could not tell at what it scoffed he had not turned toward her im sorry she repeated ann will be sorry shes so he turned upon her hotly katie quit lying to me i know theres something youre not telling ive suspected it for some time now dont get off any of that nervous trouble talk to me she stood there dumbly it seemed to enrage him why dont you go and look after her what do you mean by leaving her all alone so she went to look after her ann looked like one who needed looking after her eyes were intolerably bright it seemed the heat behind them must put them out she was walking about the room walking as if something were behind her with a lash you see katie she began not pausing in the walking her voice too as though a whip were behind it it was just as i told you it was just as i tried to tell you there are two worlds theres no use trying to put me in yours see what i bring you see what you get for it see what she stood still rocking back and forth as she stood there it was too much for me to hear her talking about god that was a little too much my father was a minister and ann laughed a minister was one thing katie had not thought of even in that moment she was conscious of relief certainly the ministry was respectable but why should it be too much for the daughter of a minister to hear anything about god ann she began quietly i dont want to force anything if you want to be alone ill even take my things and sleep somewhere else but ann dear if you could tell me a little i wouldnt be so much in the dark i could do better for us both ann did not seem to notice what she was saying she was tired of things she was tired of things tired of hanging her hat on the same kind of peg why its awful its awful i tell you to always be hanging your hat on the same kind of peg she was tired of not having any fun oh so tired of not having any fun why you dont care what you do when you get tired of not having any fun then people laugh the people who have all the fun oh they think its so funny the people who dont have to hang their hats on any kind of peg so trivial so whats that nervous word katie youre not like the rest of them why you seem to know just know without knowing but its hard for me suggested katie trying to know and not knowing ann was still walking about the room i was brought up in a little town in indiana you see im going to tell you ive got to be doing something and it may as well be talking now how did i start oh yes i was brought up in a little town in indiana until three years ago that was where i lived were you ever in a little town in indiana katie replied in the negative maybe there are little towns in indiana that are different i dont know maybe there are but this onein this one life was just one long stretch of hanging your hat on exactly the same kind of peg it was so square so flat so dingy oh so dreadful it didnt have anything around it as some towns do a hill or a river or woods around it was something that was just nothing it was just walled in by the nothingness all around it and the people in it were flat and square and dingy and the things around them were just nothing they were walled in too by the nothingness all around them then the most unexpected of all things happened ann smiled katie id like to have seen you in that town im afraid said katie that i would have invented a new kind of peg the smile seemed to have done ann good she sat down grew more natural when i try to tell about my life in that town i suppose it sounds as though i were making a terrible fuss about things when you think of children that havent any homesthat are beaten by drunken fathers starved overworkedbut it was the nothingness if my father only had got drunk katie smiled understandingly katie youve a lot of imagination just try to think what it would mean never to have what you could really call fun katie took a sweep back over her own life full to the brim of fun her imagination did not go far enough to get a real picture of life with the fun left out oh of course said ann there were pleasures my father and the people of his church were like miss osborne they believed it was one of the underlying principles of life only they would call it gods will that all must have pleasure but such godfearing pleasure i think i could have stood it if it hadnt been for the pleasures pleasures with the fun left out suggested kate yes though fun isnt the word for i dont mean just good times i mean i mean you mean the joy of living said katie you mean the loveliness of life yes now your kind of religion the kind of religion your kind of people have doesnt seem to hurt them any katie laughed oddly true it doesnt hurt us much my fathers kind is something so different the love of god seems to have dried him up hes not a human being hes a christian katie thought of her uncle a bishop and all too human a human being she was about to protest then considered that she had never known the kind of christian or human being ann was talking about everything at our church squeaked the windows the organ the deacons shoes my fathers voice the religion squeaked life squeaked ill tell you a story katie that maybe will make you see how it was its about a dog and its easy for you to understand things about dogs some one gave him to me i suppose he was not a fine dog not fullblooded but that didnt matter you know that we dont love dogs for their blood we love them for the way they look out of their eyes and the way they wag their tails i cant tell you what this dog meant to me something to love something that loved me some one to play with a companion a friend something that didnt have anything to do with my fathers church he used to feel so sorry when i had to sit learning bible verses sometimes he would put his two paws up on my lap and try to push the bible away i loved him for that and when at last i could put it away he would dance round me with little yelps of joy he warmed something in me he kept something alive and then one day when i came home from a missionary meeting where i had read a paper telling how cruelly young girls were treated by their parents in india and how there was no joy and love and beauty in their lives i ann hid her face and it was a drawn grayish face she raised after a minute tono was not there i called and called him my father was writing a sermon he let me go on calling i could not understand it tono always came running down the walk wagging his tail and giving his little barks of joy when i came it had made coming home seem different from what it had ever seemed before but that day he was not there watching for me my father let me go on calling for a long time at last he came to the door and said please stop that unseemly noise the dog has been sent away sent away i whispered what do you mean i mean that i have seen fit to dispose of him he answered i was trembling all over what right had you to dispose of him i wanted to know he wasnt your dog the answer was that i was to go up to my room and learn bible verses until the lord chastened my spirit then i said things i would not learn bible verses i would have my dog it ended ann was trembling uncontrollably it ended with the rod being unspared gods forgiveness was invoked with each stroke she was digging her finger nails into her palms katie put her arms around her i wouldnt ann dear it isnt worth while its all over now wouldnt it be better to forget no i want to tell you some day i may try to tell you other things i want this to try to explain them loving dogs you will understand this better than you could some other things the dog had been given away to some one who lived in the country it was because i had played with him the sunday morning before and had been late to sundayschool her voice was dry and hard it was from katie there came the exclamation of protest and contempt no one except one who loves dogs as you do would know what it meant even you cant quite know for tono was all i had he katies arm about her tightened i could have stood it for myself i could have stood my own lonesomeness but what i couldnt stand was thinking about him nights i would wake up and think of him out in the cold homesick maybe hungry not understanding watching and waiting wondering why i didnt come i couldnt keep from thinking about things that tortured me this man was a deacon in my fathers church from the way he prayed i knew he was not one to be good to dogs and then one afternoon i heard the little familiar scratch at the door i rushed to it and there he was shivering but oh so so glad he sprang right into my arms we cried and cried together sitting there on the floor his heart had been almost broken he had grieved suffered he wasnt willing to leave my arms just whimpering the way one does when a dreadful thing is over licking my face you know how they do you know how dear they are now i will tell you what i did holding him in my arms my face buried in his fur i made up my mind the family would be away for at least an hour i would give him the happiest hour i knew how to give him one hour it was all i had the power to give him then because i loved him so much i would end his life katies face whitened i carried out the plan ann went on i gave him the meat we were to have had for supper i had him do all his little tricks i loved him and loved him i do not think any little dog ever had a happier hour and then down at a house in the next block i saw my father and the man he had given tono to the man was coming to our house for supper our time was up i can never explain to any one the way i did it the way i felt as i did it there was no crying there was no faltering it seemed that all at once i understood understood the hardness of life that things are hard that things have got to be done then was when it came to me that youve got to harden yourself that its the only way i filled a tub with water i didnt know any other way to do it tono stood there watching me i took a bucket i took up the dog i hugged him i let him lick my face though i live to be very old katie and suffer very much i can never forget the look in his eyes as i put him in the water and held him to put down the bucket there are things a person goes through that make perfect happiness forever impossible there are hours that stay the face of the soldiers daughter was wet i love you for it ann she whispered i love you for it it was strong ann it was fine i wasnt very strong and fine the minute it was over sobbed ann i fainted they found me there and then i screamed and laughed and said i was going to kill all the dogs in the world i said oh dreadful things they should have understood murmured kate they didnt they said i was wicked they said the evil one had entered into me they said i must pray god to forgive me for having killed one of his creatures me of course it ended in bible verses is it so strange i loathed the bible and every morning i had to hear myself prayed for as a wicked girl who would harm one of gods creatures the almighty was implored not to send me to hell send me there if you want to id say to myself on my knees tonos not in hell anyway ann laughed bitterly so thats why im a sacrilegious blasphemous person who doesnt care much about hearing about god i associate him with thin lips that shut together tightand people who make long prayers and break little dogs hearts and with boots and souls that squeak i cant think of one single thing i ever heard about him that made me like him oh ann dear protested katie shudderingly try not to think such things try not to feel that way you havent heard everything there is to hear about god you havent heard any of it in the right way perhaps not i only know what i have heard and anns face was too white and hard for katie to say more and your mother dear where was she all this time didnt she love you and help she died when i was twelve shed like to have loved me she did some on the sly in a scared kind of way katie sat there contemplating the picture of anns father and mother and ann ann as child of that union i think she died because life frightened her so in a year my father married again she isnt afraid of anything shes a godfearing exemplary woman and she always looks to see if you have any mud on your shoes after a moment ann said quietly i hate her so would i said katie and it brought the ghost of a smile to anns lips perhaps thinking of just how cordially katie would hate her and then after a while you left this town katie suggested as ann seemed held there by something yes after a while i left and that held her again i was fifteen when i freed tono from life she emerged from it it was five years later that you stopped me from freeing myself lots of things were crowded into those five years katie or rather into the last three of them i had to be treated worse than tono was treated before it came to me that i had better be as kind to myself as i had been to my dog only i ann laughed didnt have anybody to give me a last hour but you see it wasnt a last hour after all soothed katie only the last hour of the old hard things things that can never come back cant they come back katie cant they katie shook her head with decision do you think id let them come back why id shut the door in their face sometimes said ann it seems to me theyre lying in wait for me that theyre going to spring out that this is a dream that there isnt any katie jones some nights ive been afraid to go to sleep afraid of waking to find it a dream theres an awful dream i dream sometimes the dream is that this is a dream poor dear murmured katie it will be more real now that weve talked i used to dream a dream katie and i think it was about you only you werent any one thing you were all kinds of different things lovely things you were something somewhere you were the something that was way off beyond the nothingness of centralia the something that didnt squeak suggested katie tremulously something somewhere you were both a waking and a sleeping dream i knew you were there isnt it queer how we do know without knowing my father used to talk about people being called called to the ministry called to the missionary field called to heaven well maybe youre called to other things too maybe said ann with a laugh which sobbed youre even called to chicago the laugh died and the sob lingered only when you get there chicago doesnt seem to know that it had called you my something somewhere was always something i never could catch up with sometimes it was a beautiful country where a river wound through a woods sometimes it was beautiful people laughing and dancing sometimes it was a star sometimes it was a field of flowers all blowing back and forth sometimes it was a voice a wonderful faraway voice sometimes it was a lovely dress oh a wonderful gauzy dress or a hat that was like the blowing field of flowers sometimes this was the loveliest of all it was somebody who loved me but whatever it was it was something i couldnt overtake and you mustnt laugh katie when i tell you that the thing that made me think i could catch up with it was a movingpicture show it came to centralia the first one that had ever been there i heard the people next door talking about it they said there were pictures of things that really happened in the great cities oh of kings and queens and the president and millionaires and automobile races and grand weddings that the pictures went on just like the happenings went on that it was just as if the pictures were alive that it was just like being there oh i was so excited about it i was so excited i could hardly get ready you see ever since tono had died two years before i had kept that idea that things were hard that the thing to do was to be hard i dreamed about things that were lovely the something somewhere things but as far as the real things went i never changed my mind about them you mustnt let them into your heart they just wanted to get in there to hurt you now i forgot all about that these pictures were dreams made real they had caught up with the something somewhere and i was going to see them but i didnt not that day i was so happy that my father suspected something and he got it out of me and said i couldnt go he said that the things that would be pictured would be the wickedness of the world that i was not to see it but i made up my mind that i would see the wickedness of the world ann paused and then said in lower voice and i have and not just in pictures she seemed to be meeting something and she answered it but just the same she made answer defiantly id rather see the wickedness of the world than stay in the nothingness of the world the pictures were to be there a week i thought of nothing else but how i could see them the last day there was a thimblebee i went to the thimblebee said i couldnt stay and went to the pictures katie that movingpicture show was proof proof of the something somewhere and in my heart i made a vow it was a solemn vow that i would find the things that moved in the pictures and there was music such music as i had never heard before even though it came out of a box they had the songs of the grand opera singers and as i listened i tell you i was called i dont care how silly it sounds i was called by the voices that had sung into that box for this was real if the life hadnt been there it couldnt have been caught into the pictures and the box it proved i thought that all the lovely things i had dreamed were true i had only to go and find them people were walking upon those streets then i could walk on those streets and those people were laughing and talking to each other everybody seemed to have friends everybody was happy and all of that really was the pictures were alive alive with the things that there were out beyond the nothingness of centralia the man played something from an opera and showed pictures of beautiful people going into a beautiful place to listen to that very music he said that the very next night in chicago those people would be going into that place to listen to those very voices katie i dont believe youll laugh at me when i tell you that my teeth fairly chattered when first it came to me that i must be one of those people it was something all different from the longing for fun oh it was something big terrible it had to be it was the same feeling of its having to be that i had about tono though probably that feeling would have passed away if it hadnt been for my father he came there and found me and humiliated me and after we got home ann was holding herself tight but after a moment she relaxed to say with an attempted laugh it wasnt all being called part of it was being driven then there was another thing the treasurer of the missionary society came that night with some money eighteen dollars i was to send off the next day it was that money started me out to find my something somewhere oh ann whispered katie drawing back but of course she added you paid it back just as soon as you could i never paid it back if i had eighteen million dollars id never pay it back i like to think of not paying it back katies face hardened i cant understand that no sobbed ann youd have to have lived a long time in nothingness to understand that and some other things too she looked at her strangely theres more coming katie that you wont be able to understand katies face was averted but something in anns voice made her turn to her i think it was wrong ann theres no use in my pretending i dont i cant understand this but maybe i can understand some of the other things better than you think i left at six oclock the next morning ann went back to it when she was calmer and at the last minute i dont think i would have had the courage to go if my father hadnt been snoring so how silly it all sounds and the only reason i got on the train was that it would have taken more courage to go back than to go on katie some time ill tell you all about it how i felt when i got to chicago how it seemed to shriek and roar how i seemed just buried under the noise how i walked around the streets that day frightened almost to death and yet inside the fright just crazy about it and how green i was nothing seemed to matter except going to grand opera i didnt even have sense enough to find a place to stay i thought about it but didnt know how and anyhow the most important thing was finding the things that moved in the pictures and sang in the box i saw a woman go up to a policeman and ask him where something was and he told her so i did that too asked him where you went to hear grand opera and he pointed i was right there by it i heard some people talking about going in to get tickets so i thought i had better get a ticket but they didnt have any they were all gone when i came out i was almost crying then a smiling man outside stepped up to me and said he had tickets and hed let me have one for ten dollars i was so glad he had them ten dollars seemed a good deal but i didnt think much about it then i had my ticket and just two dollars left but that night at the opera i didnt know whether i had two dollars or no dollars or a thousand dollars at first i was frightened because everybody but me had on such beautiful clothes but soon i was too crazy about their clothes to care and then after the music began oh katie suppose youd always dreamed of something and never been able to catch up with it suppose youd not even been able to really dream it but just dream that it was and then suppose it all came no i cant tell you youd have to have lived in centralia and been a ministers daughter my heart sang more beautifully than the singers sang now you have found it now you have found it my heart kept singing when all the other people left i left too in a dream for it had passed into a dream into a beautiful dream that was going to shelter it for me forever i stood around watching the beautiful people getting into their carriages and i couldnt make myself believe that it was in the same world with centralia then after a while it occurred to me that all those people were going home everybody was going home at first i wasnt frightened something inside me was singing over and over the songs of the opera i was too far in my dream to be much frightened then all at once i got oh so tired and cold and so frightened i did not know what to do my dream seemed to have taken wings and flown away all the beautiful laughing people had gone it was just as if i woke up and i was on the strange streets all alone only some noisy men who frightened me i hid in a doorway till those men got by and then i saw a woman coming she was all alone too she had on a dress that rustled and lovely white furs and did not seem at all frightened i stepped out and asked her to please tell me where to go for the night some time ill tell you about her too now ill just tell you that it ended with her taking me home with her to stay all night she made a lot of fun of me and said things to me i didnt understand and swore at me m weather it had been a hot hard day oh they were i was crying then and she took me with her she kept up her queer kind of talk but i was so tired that the minute i was in bed i went to sleep the next morning she told me i had got to go back to the woods i said i would if there were any woods but there werent she laughed and said more queer things she asked me why i had come and i told her first she laughed then she sat there staring at me blinking and what she said was poor little fool poor little greenhorn she asked me what i was going to do and i said work so i could stay there and go to the opera and see beautiful things she asked me what kind of a job i was figuring on and told me there was only one kind would let me in for that i asked her what it was and she said it was her line i asked her if she thought i was fitted for it and she looked at me a look i didnt understand at all and said she guessed the men she worked for would think so i asked her if shed say a good word to them for me and then she turned on me like a tiger and swore and said no she hadnt come to that it was a case of knowing without knowing i was so green that i didnt know and yet after a while i did as i look back on it i appreciate things i couldnt appreciate then thank her for things i didnt know enough to thank her for at the time she was leaving that day for san francisco she gave me ten dollars and told me if i had any sense id take it and go back to prayermeeting she said i might do worse but if i didnt have any sense and she said of course i wouldnt i was to be careful of it until i got a job she told me how to manage and i was to read ads in the newspaper she told me how to try and get in at the telephone office she had been there once she said but it got on her nerves she told me things about girls who worked in chicago awful things but i supposed she was prejudiced the last things she said to me was the opera oh you poor little green kid im afraid i see your finish but i thought she was queer acting because she led that queer kind of a life ann had paused and suddenly she hid her face in her hands as if it was more than she could face katie was smoothing her hair katie as the days went on it was just as hard to believe that the world of the opera was the same world i was working in right there in the same city as it had been the first night to believe it was the same world as centralia i learned two things one was that the something somewhere was there the other that it was not there for me the world was full of things i couldnt understand but i could understand a little better the woman who wore the white furs oh katie you get so tired you get so dead all day long putting suspenders in a box or making daisies or addressing envelopes or trying to remember whether it was apple or custard pie and you dont get tired just because your back aches and your head aches and your hands ache and your feet ache you get tired that kind of tired because the city doesnt care how tired you get i often wondered why i went on why any of them went on i used to think we must be crazy to be going on she was pondering it somberly wistful though perhaps were not crazy perhaps its the call katie what is it that call that thing that makes us keep on even when our something somewhere wont have anything to do with us katie did not reply she had no reply at last i got in the telephone office thats considered a fine place to work theyre like miss osborne they believe it is one of the fundamental principles of life that all must have pleasures but they were like the pleasures of centralia not godfearing exactly but so dutiful they didnt have anything to do with calls the real pleasures were going over the wire it was my business to make the connections that arrange those pleasures a little red light would flash sometimes it would flash straight into my brain and id say number please always with the rising inflection then id get the connection and life would pass through the cords that was the closest i came to it operating the cords that it went through there was a whole city full of it beautiful laughing loving life but it was on the wire just as in centralia it had been in the pictures and in the box and oh i used to get so tired so tight operating the cords for life sometimes when i left my chair the whole world was one big red light and at night they danced dances for me those little red lights she brushed her hand before her eyes as if they were there again and she would push them away katie she suddenly burst forth if you ever do pray if you believe in praying pray sometimes for the girl who goes to chicago to find what you call the joy of living pray for the pilgrims who go to the cities to find their something somewhere and whatever you do katie whatever you do dont ever laugh at the people who kill themselves because theyre tired of not having any fun but wasnt there any fun dear katie asked after a moment ann did not speak but looked at katie strangely yes she said afterwards differently they were silent something seemed to be outlining itself between them something which was meaning to grow there between them there came a time said ann when all of life was not going over the wire and still katie did not speak as if pushed back by that thing shaping itself between them your something somewhere said ann very low doesnt always come in just the way you were looking for it but katie if you get very tired waiting for it dont you believe you might take it most any way it came it was a worn and wistful face she turned to katie suddenly katie brushed away the thing that would grow up between them and laid her cheek upon anns hair poor child she murmured and the tears were upon anns soft brown hair poor weary little pilgrim chapter xxii ann remained in her room all of the next day katie encouraged her to do so wishing to foster the idea of illness it did not need much fostering she had not gone back to those old days without leaving with them most of her newly accumulated vitality but it was weakness rather than nervousness talking to katie seemed to have relieved a pressure it was katie who was nervous it was as if a battery within her had been charged to its uttermost she was in some kind of electric communication with life she was tingling with the things coming to her so charged was she with new big things that it was hard to manage the affairs of her household as old things demanded they be managed that day she told mrs prescott again how sorry she and ann were that ann had given way mrs prescott received it with selfcontained graciousness her one comment was that she trusted when her son decided to marry he would content himself with a wife who had not gone upon a quest katie smiled and agreed that it might get him a more comfortable wife the son himself she tried to avoid that thing which had tried to shape itself between her and ann still remained there a thing without body but vaguely outlined between ann and all other things they had not drawn any nearer to it they let the story rest at the place where all of life had not been going over the wire and katie told herself that she understood that ann was to be judged by the something somewhere she had formed in her heart rather than by whatever it was life had tardily and ungenerously and unwisely brought her that ann might still cling to a something somewhere a thing for which even yet she would keep the heart right was suggested that afternoon when katie told her of captain prescott she had not meant to tell her she tried to think she was doing it in order to know how to meet harry but had to admit finally that she did it for no nobler reason than to see how ann would take it she took it most unexpectedly i am sorry she said simply but i do not care at all for captain prescott i she paused coloring slightly as she said with a little laugh we all like to be liked dont we katie and with me well it meant something just to know i could be liked in that nice kind of way it helped but thats all so i hope he doesnt care very much for me though if he does concluded ann sagely hell get over it hes not the caring sort the words had a familiar sound after a moment she remembered them as what he had said that night of the dont you care girls while she would have been panicstricken at finding ann interested she was more discomfited than relieved at not finding her more impressed to marry into the army ann she said is considered very advantageous ann was lying there with her face pillowed upon her hand she turned her large eyes about which just then there were large circles seriously it would even seem rebukingly upon katie if i ever should marry she said it will be for some other reason than because it is advantageous katie felt both rebuked and startled most of the girls she knew girls who had never worked in factories or restaurants or telephone offices or had never thought of taking their own lives had not scorned to look upon marriages as advantageous nor for that matter had katie herself anns superior attitude toward marriage turned katie to religion as the niece of a bishop she was moved to set ann right on things within a bishops domain and underlying that was an impulse to set her right with herself ann she said if somebody said to you i starve you in the name of katie jones wouldnt you say oh no you dont starve me if you want to but dont tell me you do it in the name of katie jones she doesnt want people starved i could say that said ann because i know you and know you dont want people starved but if id never heard anything about you except that i was to be starved in your name i should think even so you might question didnt it ever occur to you that god had more to do with your something somewhere than he did with things done in his name in centralia why katie how strange you should think of that for i thought of it but i supposed it was the most wicked thought of all how strange it would be said katie if he had more to do with the call than with the godfearing things you were called from for an instant anns face lighted up but it hardened well if he had she said it seems he might have stood by me a little better after i was called katie had no reply for that so she turned to her uncle the bishop well theres one place where youre wrong ann and that is that religion is incompatible with the love of dogs you know my uncle my mothers brother is a bishop i dont know just how well uncle understands god but if he understands him as well as he does dogs then he must be well fitted for his office i dont think in his heart uncle would have any respect for any person no matter how religious or even how much they subscribed who wouldnt appreciate the tragedy of losing ones dog uncle has a splendid dog a great dane theyre real chums he often reads his sermons to caesar he says caesar can stay awake under them longer than some of the congregation i once shocked but i think secretly delighted uncle by saying that he rendered to caesar the things that were caesars and to god what caesar left well one dreadful day someone stole caesar they took him out of town but caesar got away and made a return that has gone down into dog history poor uncle had been all broken up about it for three days he was to preach that morning my heart ached for him as he stood there at his study window looking down the street when it was time to go i knew what he was hoping for the way you go on hoping against hope when your dogs lost and then after uncle had gone and just as i was ready to start myself i heard the great deep bark of mighty caesar you may know i was wild about it and crazy to get the news to uncle i hurried over to church but service had begun but because i was bursting to tell it and because i appreciated something of what it would mean to talk about the goodness of god when you werent feeling that way i wrote a little note and sent it up i suppose the people who saw it passed into the chancel in dignified fashion thought it was something of ecclesiastical weight what it said was hallelujah hes back safe and sound k it was great fun to watch uncle hes very dignified in his official capacity he frowned as it was handed him as if not liking the intrusion into holy routine he did not open it at once but sat there holding it rebukingly me chuckling down in the family pew then he adjusted his glasses and opened it ponderously i wish you could have seen his face one of our friends said he supposed it read will give fifty thousand he quickly recalled his robes and suppressed his grin contenting himself with a beatific expression which must have been very uplifting to the congregation i think i never saw uncle look so spiritual and i know i never heard him preach as feelingly when he came to the place about when sorrow has been upon the heart and seemed more than the heart could bear but when the weight is lifted as the loving father so often does mercifully lift it oh i tell you there were tears in more eyes than uncles i had my suspicions and that night i asked uncle did you preach the sermon you meant to preach this morning and uncle if he werent a bishop i would say he winked at me replied no dear little shark i had meant to preach the one about man yearning for heaven because earth is a vale of tears im just telling you this yarn ann to make you see that religion doesnt necessarily rule out the love of dogs its a nice story and im glad you told me replied ann only my father would say that your uncle had no religion katie laughed a remark which has not gone unremarked certainly he hasnt enough to let it harden his heart as i am beginning to think about things now it seems to me uncle might stand for more vital things than he does but for all that i believe he can love god the more for loving caesar so well they were quiet for a time thinking of anns father and katies uncle the love of god and the love of dogs and the love of man many things then ann said naturally you and i dont look at it the same way i see you were brought up on a pleasant kind of religion the kind that doesnt matter that phrase started the electric batteries within katie and the batteries got so active she had to go for a walk in the course of the walk she stopped at the shops to see wayne she wanted to know if he would let worth go into the country for a week with ann an old servant of theirs a woman who had been friend as well as servant to katies mother lived on a farm about ten miles up the river and it had been planned that worth and katie too if she would go up there for a week or more during the summer it seemed just the thing for ann it would get her away from captain prescott and his mother and from major darrett who was coming in a few days katie believed ann would like to be away from them all for about a week and get her bearings anew and katie herself would like to be alone for a time and get her bearings too and make some plans in one way or other she was going to help ann find her real something somewhere perhaps she would take her to europe but until things settled down as katie vaguely put it she thought it just the thing for ann to have the little trip with worth wayne listened gravely but did not object he was quiet and katie thought not well she suggested that working so steadily during the hot weather was not good for him he laughed shortly and pointed through the open door to the shops where long rows of men were working at forges perspiration streaming down their faces but instead of alluding to them he asked abruptly how is she today tired said katie she didnt sleep well last night something in the way he was looking at her brought to katie acute realization of how much she cared for wayne he was her big brother she had always been his little sister they were not giving to thinking of it that way certainly not speaking of it but the tenderness of the relationship was there consciousness of it came now as she seemed to read in waynes look that she hurt him in withholding her confidence in not having felt it possible to trust even him she broke under that look wayne dear she said unevenly i dont deny there is something to tell id like to tell you if i could if ever i can i will his reply was only to dismiss it with a curt little nod but katie knew that did not necessarily mean that he was feeling curt she was drawn back to the open door from which she could see the long double line of men working steadily at the forges what are those men doing she asked forging one of the parts of a rifle he replied it recalled what the man who mended the boats had said of the saddles that the first war those saddles would see would be the war over the manufacture of them would he go so far as to say the first use for the rifles surely not he must have been speaking figuratively but something in the might of the thing the long lines of men at work on rifles to be used in a possible war made the industrial side of it seem more vital and more interesting than the military phase this was here this was real there was practically no military life at the arsenal not military life in the sense one found it at the cavalry post that had made it seem from a military standpoint uninteresting but here was the real life over in what the women of the quarter vaguely called the shops and dismissed as disposed of by the term suddenly she wondered what all those men thought about god whether either the hard blighting religion of anns father or the aesthetic comfortable religion of her uncle mattered much to them were the things which mattered forging a religion of their own but just what were those things that mattered a young man had entered and was speaking to wayne after a seconds hesitation wayne introduced him to katie as mr ferguson who was helping him he had an open intelligent face this young mechanic he did not seem overwhelmed at being presented to captain jones sister but merely replied pleasantly to her greeting and was turning away but katie was not going to let him get away if she could help it katie was not going to let any one get away who she thought could tell her anything about the things which were perplexing her all those things pressing closer and closer upon her do many of these men go to church she asked he appeared startled katies gown did not suggest a possible tract concealed about it why yes some of them he laughed i dont think the majority of them do then she came right out with it what would you say they look upon as the most important thing in life he looked startled again but in more interested way higher wages and shorter hours he said are you a socialist she demanded it came so unexpectedly and so bluntly that it confused him why katie laughed her brother what do you mean by coming over here and interviewing men on their politics what made you think i was a socialist asked ferguson because you had such a quick answer to such a big question and seemed so sure of yourself im reading a book about socialists they dont seem to think there is a particle of doubt they could put the world to rights and things are so intricate so confused i dont see how they can be so sure theyre saying the final word i dont know that they claim to be saying the final word but they do know they could take away much of the confusion katie was thinking of the story she had heard the night before do you think socialisms going to remove all the suffering from the world reach all the aches and fill all the empty places get right into the inner things that are the matter and bring peace and good will and loving kindness everywhere she had spoken impetuously and paused with an embarrassed laugh the young mechanic was looking at her gravely but his look was less strange than waynes i dont think theyd go that far miss jones but they do know that theres a lot of needless misery they could wipe out theyre out and out materialists arent they everythings economic the economic basis for everything in creation they seem very cocksure that getting that the way they want it would usher in the millennium you said the most important thing in life to these men was higher wages and shorter hours i dont blame them for wanting them i hope they get them but i dont know that i see it as very promising that they regard it as the most important thing in life to do less and get more is not what youd call a spiritual aspiration is it she laughed this is what i mean its not the end is it socialists wouldnt call it the end but its got to be the end until it can become the means yes but if you get in the habit of looking at it as an end will there be anything left for it to be a means to why yes those spiritual aspirations you mention unless by that time the worlds such an economic machine it doesnt want spiritual aspirations well heaven help the working man thats got them in the present economic machine said ferguson a little impatiently she too moved impatiently oh i dont know a thing about it its absurd for me to be talking about it why i dont think its at all absurd only i dont think you see the thing clear to the end and i wish you could talk to somebody who sees farther than i do im new to it myself now theres a man doing a lot of boat repairing up here above the island i wish you could talk to him hed know just what you mean and just how to meet you oh would he said katie whats his name mann alan mann why katie laughed wayne it must be that hes that same mythical creature known as the man who mends the boats yes said katie i fancy hes the very same mythical creature my little boy talks about him wayne explained yes hes the same one ive seen him talking to your little boy and one of the soldiers hes a queer genius in what way is he a queer genius asked katie why i dont know hes always got a way of looking at a thing that you hadnt seen yourself he looked up with a little smile from the tool he was trying to adjust id like to have you tell him you were worrying about socialism hurting spiritual aspirations would he annihilate me no he wouldnt want to annihilate you if he thought you were trying to find out about things hed guide you oh so hes a guide is he is he a spiritual or an economic guide she laughed i think he might combine them he replied laughing too he must be remarkable said kate he is remarkable miss jones gravely replied the admirer of the man who mended the boats i wish you could have heard him talking to a crowd of men last sunday dear me is he a public speaker yes in a way and he writes things katie wanted to ask what things but they were cut short by the entrance of captain prescott it was curious how his entrance did cut them short she smiled to herself wondering what he would have thought of the conversation he followed her to the door and inquired for miss forrest his manner was constrained but his eyes were begging for an explanation he looked unhappy and katie hurried away from him it seemed she could not bear to have any more unhappiness come pressing against her even the unhappiness she was confident would pass away in her mood of that day it seemed to katie that the affairs of the world were too involved for any one to have a solution for them life surged in too fiercely too uncontrollably to be contained within a formula as she continued her walk winding in and out of the wooded paths awe spread its great wings about her at thought of the complexity and the fathomlessness of the relationships of life she had but a little peep into them but that peep held the suggestion of limitlessness because a lonely girl in a barren little town in indiana had dreamed dreams which life would not deliver to her life now was beating in upon katie jones because ann had been foiled in her quest for happiness sobering shadows were falling across the sunny path along which katie had tripped did life thwarted in one place take it out in another because ann could not find joy was it to be that katie could not have peace had anns yearning for love been the breath blowing to flame katies yearning for understanding because ann could not dream her way to realities did it mean that katie must fight her way to them they were such big things such resistless things these wild new things which were sweeping in upon her with the emotion of the world surging in and out like that how could any one claim to have a solution for the whole question of living she seemed passing into a country too big and too dark for her of the sunny paths she needed a guide she grew lonely at thought of how badly she needed her guide she turned for comfort to thought of the things she would do for ann she would pay it back in revealing to ann the beauty of the world she would assume the responsibility of the something somewhere perhaps in fulfilling a dream she would find a key to reality she found pleasure in the vision of ann in the old world cathedrals how wisely they had builded builders of those old cathedrals in expressing religion through beauty at peace in the beauty of form might ann not find an inner beauty she believed anns nature to be an intensely religious one how might anns soul not flower when she at last saw god as a god of beauty thus she soothed herself in building a future for ann sought to appease those surgings of life with promise that ann should at last find the loveliness of life but in the end it led to a terrifying vision a vision of thousands upon thousands of other dreamers of dreams whose soul stuff might be slowly ebbing away in long dreary days of putting suspenders in boxes of thousands of other girls who might be growing faint in operating the wires for life oh she had power to fill anns life but would that have power to still for her the mocking whispers from the dreams which had died slow deaths in all the other barren lives even though she took ann from the crowd to a far green hill of happiness would not katie herself see from that far green hill all the other girls called to life going forth as pilgrims with the lovely lovelonging in their hearts only to find life waiting to seize them for the work of the woman who wore the white furs a sob shook katie the woe of the world seemed surging just beneath her rising so high that it threatened to suck her in but because she was a fighter she mastered the sob and vowed that rather than be sucked in to the woe of the world she would find out about the world certainly she would sit apart no longer she would study she would see she would live life had become a sterner and a bigger thing she would meet it in a sterner and bigger way to understand that was the greatest thing in life that passion to understand grew big within her how could she hope to go laughing through a world which sobbed how turn from life when she saw life suffering why she could not even turn from a little bird which she saw suffering there was a noble wistfulness in her longing to talk again with the man who mended the boats chapter xxiii in temporary relaxation from the stress of that mood she was glad to see her friend major darrett he did not suggest the woe of the world because the big new things had become for the moment at least too much for her there was rest in the shelter of the small familiar things so much of the unknown had been beating against her that she was glad for a little laughing respite in the known he stood for a world she knew how to deal with in that he seemed to offer shelter not that he would be able to do it for long he always roused a particular imp in katie which wanted to be flirtatious she found now with a certain relief that the grave things of life had not exterminated that imp she would scarcely have felt acquainted with herself had it perished and because she was so pleased to find it alive she let it grow very live indeed ann and worth had been gone for five days ann had seemed to like the idea of going she said she would be glad to be alone for a time and rest up as she vaguely put it katie told her that when she came back they would make some plans and she told her she was not to worry about things that everything was going to be all right ann received it with childlike trust she seemed to think that it was all in katies hands to accept with a childs literalness that katie would not let the old things come back that she would shut the door in their face other things were in katies hands that day preparations for a big dinner they were giving that night it was for some cavalry people who were stopping there and in addition to the cavalry officers and their wives there was a staff officer from washington who was valuable to wayne just then katie was anxious that the dinner be a success she was glad major darrett was there he went a long way toward assuring its success and zelda fraser was with the party katie had seen her for a moment that morning and would see her again at night she was stopping with caroline osborne whom she had known at school zelda did not suggest the woe of the world neither did she suggest the dreams of the world it was early in the afternoon and the major and katie were having a conference he was acquainted with the palate of the visiting staff officer and was assuring katie that she was on the way to his good graces they had gone into the library where katie was arranging flowers he offered a suggestion there too he had an intuitive knowledge of such things seemed to be guided by inner promptings as to which bowl should hold the lavender sweet peas and which the pink ones though katie disputed his judgment glad to be on ground where she could dispute with assurance they argued it hotly as if sweet peas were the most vital things in the world it was good to be venting all ones feeling on things so tangible and knowable as sweet peas her dinner safe in the hands of experts katie made herself comfortable and told her friend the major that she wished now to be put in a brilliant mood that a brilliant mood was the one thing the skilled laborers in possession of her house could not furnish he gallantly defied any laborer in the world to be so skilled as to get katie out of a brilliant mood she told him that was silly that she had grown very stupid he challenged her to prove it katie felt very much at home with him not merely at home with him the individual but comfortably at home with the things he represented it gave her a nice homelike feeling to be flirting with him and flirting with him herself she grew interested in all those others who had flirted with him she knew they were legion she seemed to see them off there in the background a lovely group of spoiled darlings she did not suppose many of them were much the worse for having flirted with major darrett suddenly she laughed and told him she regarded him as one of the great educators of the age he wanted to know in what way he was a great educator katie would not tell him there ensued a gay discussion from which she emerged feeling as if she had had a cocktail and looking that way looking at least so he seemed to think from the manner in which he leaned forward regarding her most attractive her cheeks so pink her eyes dancing a little dance of defiance at him and on her lips a mocking little smile more sophisticated than any smile he had ever seen before on katies lips katie of the laughing eyes he had once called her she was leaning back lazily a suggestion of insolence in her assurance as she leaned back that way he marked the lines of her figure as he had never marked them before he had previously thought of katie as a good build for golf now that did not seem to express the whole of it and katie seemed to know it would not express the whole of it and in summarizing katie as having a good build for golf he had not properly appraised katies foot it was thrust out now from her very short skirt as if katie were quite willing he should know it for a lovely foot and her arm which was hanging down from the side of the chair seemed conscious of being something more than a good arm for golf she looked so like a child and yet so lurkingly like a woman it gave him a new sense of katie it blew the warm breath of life over an idea he had had when he came there he had just come from zelda fraser having had luncheon at the osbornes he had once thought zelda stimulating now she did not seem at all stimulating in comparison with katie she was too obvious that lurking something in katies eyes that mysterious smile she had made katie seem subtle if this were to be added to all her other charms katie had always seemed delightfully daring in an innocent sort of way it seemed now she might be capable of being subtle in a sophisticated way he had always thought of katie as romping a distinguished and quite individual form of romping she even had a romping imagination he loved her for her merriness for her open sunniness that had been an impersonal love not very different from the way he might have loved a sister in fact he had more than once wished katie were his little sister instead of waynes he did not wish that now she became too fascinating and too desirable in her mysterious new complexity there was zest in discovering katie after he had known her so long and her eyes and her smile seemed jeering at him for having been such a long while in discovering her he wanted to kiss her that mocking little smile seemed daring him to kiss her and yet he did not dare to it seemed part of katies lovely new complexity that she could invite and forbid at one and the same time now zelda could not have done more than the inviting and so many could invite he rose and stood near her katie you dont mean to marry prescott do you she clapped her hands above her head and laughed like a child immensely tickled about something he laughed too and then asked to be informed what he was laughing at oh youre just laughing because i am laughed katie then may i ask mysterious one what youre laughing at oh im laughing at a tumble i once took twas such a tumble id like to tumble to the tumble you would like it youd love it i hadnt thought said the major that when i asked if you meant to marry prescott i was classifying with the great humorists of all time and i hadnt thought she returned that when i thought prescott meant to marry me i was classifying with the great tumblers of all time suddenly she stopped laughing no i dont mean to marry harry and i can further state with authority that harry doesnt mean to marry me the laughter went from even her eyes thinking perhaps of whom harry did mean to marry but she was not going to let herself become grave if she grew quiet she would know again about the woe of the world surging right underneath the only way not to know it was underneath was to keep merrily dancing away in ones place on top of it she made a curious little gesture of flicking something from her hand and whistled a romping little tune he stood there surveying her it wouldnt do at all for you to marry prescott katie hes a likeable enough fellow but with it all something of a duffer just what kind of man asked katie demurely would you say i had better marry he sat down in a chair nearer her just what kind of man would you like to marry how do you know she asked still demurely that i would like to marry any oh you must have a guide katie you must be guided through this wicked world she bit her lip and turned away when he told her she must have a guide but she turned back and seriously is it a wicked world with that he ventured to pat the hand now lying on the arm of the chair so near him well youll never know it if it is well keep it all from you katie youre safe katie pulled her hand away petulantly if theres anything i dont want to be she said its safe that seemed to amuse him i only meant he laughed safe from the great outer world tell me said katie whats in the great outer world he sat there smiling at her as one would smile at a dear inquisitive child have you made many excursions into the great outer world she asked boldly oh yes he replied lightly ive been something of an explorer all men you know katie are born explorers though for the most part i must say i find our own little world the more attractive then he surprised her katie would you think a man a brute to propose to a girl on the day she was giving an important dinner but right there she pulled herself in no more tumbles thought katie it would seem rather inconsiderate wouldnt it such a man wouldnt seem to have a true sense of values well dinner or no dinner the man i have in mind has a true sense of values he has a true sense of values because he knows katherine wayneworth jones for the most desirable thing in all the world it did surprise her and the surprise grew none of them had thought of major darrett as what they called a marrying man and on the heels of the surprise came a certain sense of triumph katie knew that any of the girls in what he called their little world would be looking upon it as a moment of triumph and there was triumph in gaining what others would regard as triumph how old are you katie he asked she told him twentyfive and im fortyone is that prohibitive she looked at him thinking how lightly the years had touched him how lightly in all probability they would touch him he had distinctly the military bearing he would have that same bearing at sixty and that same charm he was one to whom experience gave the gift of charm more insidiously than youth could give it life would be more possible with him than with any man she knew within the enclosure if one were to go dancing and smiling and flirting through the world major darrett would be the best possible man to go with as she looked at him smiling at her half tenderly and half humorously life with major darrett presented itself as such an attractive thing that there was almost pain in the thought of not being able to take it for deep within her she never questioned not being able to take it but for the moment you see katie he was saying i would be the best possible one for you to be married to because you could go right on having flirtations of course i neednt tell you katie dear that youre a flirt the trouble with your marrying most fellows would be that they wouldnt like it and of course she replied i would be a good one for you to marry because having my own flirtations i wouldnt be in a position to be critical about yours he laughed quite frankly katie leaned back and sat there smiling at him that new baffling smile he found so alluring but do you know katie i think for a long time anyway we could keep busy flirting with each other and we would keep all the busier she said knowing that the minute we stopped flirting with each other one of us would get busy flirting with somebody else he laughed delightedly katie where did you learn it was very fetching to say outrageous things so demurely tell me said katie more seriously why do you want to marry until about an hour ago i wanted to marry oh for the most bromidic of reasons just because in the natural course of events it seemed the next thing for me to do ill even be quite frank and confess i had thought of you in that bromidic version of it had thought of it as eminently suitable also eminently desirable wed like to do the same things wed get on be good fellows together but now i want to marry and i want to marry you because i think youre quite the most fascinating thing in all the world lightly and yet seriously he spoke of things of his own prospects she knew how good they were of where and how they would probably live a pleasant picture it was he could draw it would mean life along the sunny paths and very sunny indeed it seemed they would be if possible at all certainly one would never have to explain any of ones jokes to major darrett for just a moment she let herself drift into it and knowing she was drifting and not knowing it was for just the moment he rose and bent over her chair katie he whispered and there was passion in his voice i think i can make you fall in love with me the little imp in katie took possession and something deeper than the little imp stirred vaguely at sound of that thing in his voice she raised her face so that it was turned up to him you think you could now i wonder oh you wonder do you you exasperating little wretch well just give me a chance but suddenly he was standing at attention his face colorless katie jumped up guiltily and there leaning against the door all huddled down and terrible looking was ann why katie she whispered thickly katie but you told me you promised me that you would shut the door in his face chapter xxiv it took her a number of seconds to get the fact that they must know each other and even then she could get no grip on the situation she was too shaken by having jumped as though she were some vulgar housemaid and why was ann looking like that she looked dreadful huddled up that way as if some one was going to beat her why you cant know each other said katie wildly how could you know each other where would you know each other and if you do know each other turning upon him furiously need we all act like thieves he tried to speak but seemed unable to he had lost command of himself save in so far as standing very straight was concerned she wished ann would stand up it gave her such an awful sense of shame to see ann huddled like that katie ann whispered you told me i never told you id shut the door in major darretts face said katie harshly and what are you talking about what does this all mean he had recovered himself why it merely means katie that we as you surmised at one time knew each other the the acquaintance terminated not pleasantly thats all a slight surprise for the moment no harm done then ann did stand straight it means she said shrilly that if i had never known him pointing at him you would never have found me there she pointed down toward the river oh no no harm done of course no harm done please let us try and keep very quiet said katie coldly it is it is vulgar enough at best let us be as quiet as decent as we can ann crouched down again as though struck then katie laughed bitterly why really its quite as good as a play isnt it its quite a scene im sure it neednt be said he soothingly and relaxing a little i own i was startled for the moment and discomfited but you were quite right well go into no hysterics what i cant understand looking from one to the other is what shes doing here katies head went up shes here ill have you know as my friend just as youre here as my friend she thought ann was going to fall and her heart softened a little suppose you go up to my room ann lie down just just lie down keep quiet why did you come home is something wrong ann whispered that worth had a sore throat she had a chance to come down in an automobile she thought she had better she was sorry she had all right said katie its all right just go lie down ill look after worth and you in a minute ann left the room and katie turned to the major well youre so sensible katie he said hurriedly in feeling the thing to do is make no fuss about things nothing is to be gained but for gods sake katie what is she doing here where did you know her oh you tell first said katie smiling a hard smile you tell where you found her then ill tell where i found her really really he said stiffly i must refuse to discuss such a matter with you i can only repeat she has no business here then pray why have you any business here he flushed angrily but restrained himself and said persuasively why katie shes not one of us shes one of me said katie shes my friend i can only say again he said shortly that she has no business to be as i am to be kept so safe from the wicked world said katie stingingly i presume it is not proper you discuss the matter with me i take it however that she was one of those excursions into the great outer world well he said defiantly and what if she was she was willing to be i guess she wasnt knocked down with a club oh no oh my no that wouldnt be your method and when one is tired of exursions i suppose one is at perfect liberty to abandon them nonsense you cant trump up anything of that sort she wasnt abandoned she left in the night he colored i beg your pardon but as long as were speaking frankly oh pray said katie lets not be overly delicate in this delicate little matter very well then her coming was her own choice her going away was her own choice i can see that i have no great responsibility in the matter why how clever you must be said katie all the while smiling that hard smile to be able to argue it like that he was standing there with folded arms i think i was very decent to her all things considered in view of the nature of the affair i consider that i was very decent katie laughed maybe you were i found her in the very act of committing suicide he paled but quickly recovered himself that was not my affair there must have been something afterward maybe im sure i dont know but you were the beginning werent you suddenly she buried her face in her hands oh i didnt think i didnt think it could get in here its everywhere its everywhere its getting me katie dear katie he murmured dont well get you out of this you wanted to be kind it was just a mistake of yours well fix it up dont cry and he put an arm about her she stood before him with clenched hands eyes blazing dont touch me dont you touch me and she left him in the hall nora stopped her to say there were not enough champagne glasses she made no reply champagne glasses she looked after worth then she went to ann well ann she began her voice high pitched and unsteady this is about the limit isnt it oh katie moaned ann you told me you told me you understood why katie you must have known there was some one oh i knew there was some one all right said katie her voice getting higher and higher her cheeks more and more red only i just hadnt figured you see on its being some one i knew why how under the sun she asked laughing wildly did you ever meet major darrett i ill try to tell you faltered ann miserably i want to i want to make you understand katie ill die if you dont understand she looked so utterly wretched that katie made heroic effort to get herself under control curb that fearful desire to laugh i will try she said quietly as she could i will try why katie ann began does it make so much difference just because you know him it makes all the difference cant you see why it makes it so vulgar ann threw back her head just the same it wasnt vulgar what i felt wasnt vulgar why katie she cried appealingly it was my something somewhere you didnt think that vulgar oh no laughed katie not before i knew it was major darrett but tell me ive got to know now what is it where did you meet him just how bad is it anyhow it must have been desperation led ann to spare neither katie nor herself i met him she said baldly one night as i was standing on the corner waiting for a car he had an automobile he asked me to get in it and i did and that began it katie stepped back from her in horror the outrage she felt stamped all too plainly on her face and you call that not vulgar why it was common it was low then ann turned was it oh i dont know that you need talk i wouldnt say much if i were you i guess i saw the look on his face when i came in dont think for a minute i dont know that look you got it there and let me tell you another thing just let me tell you another thing whatever i did whatever i did i know i never had the look you did when i came in i never had that look of fooling with things katie was white powerless with rage you dare speak to me like that she choked you and all control gone she rushed blindly from the room chapter xxv she had no idea how long she had been walking she was conscious of being glad that there was so big a place for walking that walking was not a preposterous thing to be doing she passed several groups of soldiers they were reassuring they looked so much in the natural order of things and gave no sign of her being out of that order though she knew she was out of it it was dizzying that feeling of having lost herself she had never known it before after she had walked very fast for what seemed a long time she seemed able to gather at least part of her forces back under control that blinding sense of everything being scattered of her being powerless was passing and the first thing sanity brought was the suggestion that ann too might be like that once before ann had been scattered that way oh she understood it now as she had not been able to do then and perhaps ann would have less power to gather herself back she grew frightened she turned toward home walking fast as she could worried to find herself so far away major darrett stepped out from the library to speak to her but she hurried past him up the stairs ann was not in the room where she had left her she looked through the other rooms she called to her then it must be she told herself all the while fear growing larger in her heart that ann too had gone out for a walk worth she asked grotesquely overdoing unconcern wheres miss ann has she gone for a walk why aunt kate she was called away called away whispered katie called where she said she was called away shes gone but shes coming back when did she say dear she pleaded that she would be back i dont know aunt kate she felt awful bad because she had to go she came and kissed me she kissed me and kissed me and said she hated to leave me but that she had to go she kept saying she had to in the hall was nora nora asked katie standing with her back to her what is it about miss forrest she was called away miss kate a telegram i didnt see no boy they must have phoned it said katie sharply yesm i didnt hear the phone but i was busy im so upset miss kate about them champagne glasses weve telephoned over the river never mind the champagne glasses what about miss forrest how did she go when did she go she went in mr osbornes automobile miss osborne sent you some beautiful flowers miss kate oh theyre just lovely oh i dont care anything about flowers you say ann went in the machine yesm she told the chauffeur he brought the flowers that big colored man you know miss kate that she was called away and would he take her to the station and he said sure he would and so they went but miss kate its most five oclock what will we do about those two champagne glasses merciful heavens nora stop talking about them i dont care what you do about them she went down to the library look here she said to the major what is this what have you done wheres ann gone i dont know a thing about it i went over to the office an appointment and when i came back hurried back because i was worried about you i saw her going away in the osborne car and never tried to stop her see here katie why should i stop her best thing you can do is let her go do you know do you know choked katie that she may kill herself he laughed oh i guess not calm down katie she had her wits about her all right i heard her tell the man to drive her to the station she had sense enough to take advantage of the car you see i guess she knows the ropes dont think she has much notion of killing herself oh you dont much you know about it you with your fine noble understanding of life she turned away sobbing what shall i do what shall i do but in a moment she stopped the thing for me to do she said is telephone the osbornes chauffeur which she did yes he had taken the young lady to the station he didnt know where she was going he just pulled in to the station and then pulled right out again she told him there was nothing more to do he didnt believe she bought a ticket he saw her walking out to get a train no he didnt know what train there were two or three trains standing there what can i do katie kept murmuring frantically suddenly her face lighted she sat there thinking for a moment then called her brothers office wayne she was glad to find was not there she asked if she might speak to mr ferguson mr ferguson she said this is this is captain jones sister i want for a very particular a very imperative reason to speak at once to the to your friend that man why the man that mends the boats you know could you get word for him to come here here to my house right away tell him its very oh very important tell him miss jones says she needs him ferguson said it was just quitting time hed go up there on his wheel he thought he could find him he would send him right down she admired the way he controlled what must have been his astonishment the man who mended the boats would come he would know what to do he would help her she would keep as calm as she could until he got there but surely surely ann wouldnt go away and leave her without a word ann couldnt be so cruel as to let her worry like that why of course ann had left a note for her so she looked for the note tossed everything in the room topsyturvey even looked in the closet again she heard nora in the hall nora she said and katies face was white and pleading didnt miss ann say anything about leaving me a note why yes miss kate yes sure she did i was so upset about them champagne glasses well where is it oh hurry nora tell me why its in the desk miss kate she said you was to look in the desk she ran to it with a sob nora how could you let me nora was saying again that she was so worried about the champagne glasses the desk of course would be the last place one would think of looking for a note she found and with trembling fingers smoothed out the note it had been crumpled rather than folded it was brief and so written she could scarcely read it you see katie you cant you simply cant so im going when you come back you wont want me to thats why ive got to go now id tell you only i dont know ill get a train just any train i cant write because for one thing i havent time and for another if i began to say things id begin to cry and then i wouldnt go ive got to keep just this feeling the one i told you about its having to be katie youre not like the rest of your world but it is your world and see what you get when you try to be any different from it oh katie i didnt think id be leaving like this i didnt think id ever say to you there it ended miss kate nora said major darrett wants to know if he may speak to you in the library she went down mechanically now katie he began quietly and authoritatively there are several orders you must give several things you must attend to in relation to your dinner things seem a little disorganized and its getting late and it wont do you know to get these people upset now nora tells me that through some complication or other youre two champagne glasses short katie was staring at him and is that all that matters two champagne glasses short and here a life why what kind of people are we katie he said his voice well controlled were just that kind of people no matter whats at stake no matter what were thinking about things or about each other the thing weve got to do now you know it and youre going to do it is go ahead with this affair im not going to have it why what do you think im made of i wont telephone them call it off i tell you i cant katie you think you cant and yet you know you will i know exactly what youre made of i know what your father was made of i know what your mother was made of i know that no matter what it costs you youll go on as if nothing had occurred now will you telephone prescott or shall i ask him about the glasses and if he cant do anything for you youll have to call up zelda at miss osbornes and tell the girls they cant come unless they each bring a glass ill do it if you want me to theyll think it a great lark you know having to bring their own glasses or getting no champagne yes whispered katie theyll think it a great lark for that matter everythings a great lark she sank to a chair her tears were falling as she said again that everything was a great lark he paid no attention to her but went to the telephone but the tears were interrupted miss kate said nora can you come and look at the table a minute they want to know she dried her eyes as best she could and went and looked at the table she kept on looking at things doing things until she heard the bell if thats some one for me nora she said show him in here and dont interrupt me while hes here she passed into a small room they used as a den he came to her there and when she saw that it was indeed he she broke down something is the matter he asked gently you wanted me you sent for me she raised her head yes i sent for you i need you it was evident she needed some one he would scarcely have known her for katie so white so shaken im glad you sent for me he said simply now wont you tell me what i can do shes gone whispered katie where i dont know i dont know where away on a train some train any train somewhere i dont know where i thought oh youll find her for me wont you you will find her wont you she had stretched out her hands and he took them holding them strongly in both of his dont you want to tell me what you know i cant help you unless you tell me briefly she told him wrenched the heart out of it in a few words you see i failed she concluded looking up at him with swimming eyes the very first thing the very first test i failed i wanted to do so much thought i understood so well oh i was so proud of the way i understood and then just the minute it came up against my life her head went down to her hands and because he was holding them it was upon his hands rather than hers it rested katies head with its gold brown hair all disorderly dont he whispered as she seemed breaking her heart with it why dont you know all the worlds like that dont you know we all can be fine and free until it comes up against our lives i was so hard she sobbed yes i know we are hard when its our lives are touched dont cry katie he spoke her name timidly and lingeringly isnt that what life is just one long thing of trying and failing but going on trying again thats what youll do if you can find her for me but i never can hold up my head again never believe in myself never do anything why i never can laugh again not really laugh if you dont find her for me a curious look passed over his face with those last words well if thats the case he said with a strange little laugh of his own ive got to find her they talked of things he would go to the station he would do what he could if he thought anything to be gained by it he would go on to chicago he had to go in a few days anyhow he explained to see about some work and if it didnt seem a mere wild goose chase he would go that night the change in katie the life which came back to her eyes rewarded him id go with you to the station she said only were giving a big dinner tonight she thought his face darkened oh yes i know but thats the kind of person i am we go on with the dinner no matter whats happening its our way he seemed to be considering it as a curious phenomenon yes i know it is and you cant help that either can you so youre going to be very festive in this house tonight oh very festive in this house tonight some army people are here from washington were going to have a gorgeous dinner and im going to wear a gorgeous gown and drink champagne and try and smile myself into the good graces of a man who can do things for my brother and be oh so clever and festive he looked at her as if by different route he had come again to that thing of pitying her only along this other route the quality of the pity had changed and there was in it now a tender sadness its not so simple a matter for you is it this being free youre of the bound too arent you and youve become conscious of your chains theres all the hope and all the tragedy of it in that he took an impulsive step toward her and smiled at her appealingly a little mistily as he said only please dont tell me youre not going to laugh any more chapter xxvi as a matter of fact katie did laugh a great deal that night at least it passed for laughter and the man who was worth cultivating for wayne seemed to find it most attractive it was evident to them all that katie was getting on famously with him it was well that she was for wayne himself seemed making little headway before dinner katie had told him briefly that ann had come down with worth whose sore throat didnt seem serious after all and then had been called away she said she couldnt talk about it then she would tell him later but though they had a quiet host they had a vivid and a brilliant hostess those who knew katie best mrs prescott in particular kept watching her in wonderment she had never known katie to vie with zelda fraser in saying those daring things katie though so merry had seemed a different type but tonight katie and zelda and major darrett kept things very lively katie was telling her distinguished guest the tale of the champagne glasses just fancy she said here was i giving a dinner for you and it looked as if somebody would have to turn teetotaler or drink out of the bottle after i finally got it straightened out i told zelda she must keep her hand as much as possible on the stem of her glass so it would not be noted she was drinking from gothic architecture and the rest of us from classic and you may have observed blithely observed zelda that keeping my hand on the stem of my glass is an order i am not loathe to obey be it any old architecture they laughed zelda was the daughter of a general and could say very much what she pleased and be laughed at as amusing it came to katie in what large measure they all could do very much as they pleased it was a game they played and great liberty was accorded them in that game so long as they took their liberty in accordance with the prescribed rules of that game but they guarded their own privileges with an intolerance for all those outside their game who would take privileges of their own that labeled a respect for good form was in reality their method of selfdefense she looked at zelda fraser zelda with her bold black eyes her red cheeks which she made still redder and her hair as long as people were wearing hair zelda wore a little more than any one else nothing about her suggested anything so redeeming as a quest for something somewhere no veiled splendor of a dream hovered tenderly over zelda watching her as she bantered with major barrett it grew upon katie as one of the grotesque things of the world that zelda should be within and ann without major barrett had remained it was ann who had gone yet it was ann had dreamed the dream he who had made the excursion despoiling the dream it was ann had been called he who had preyed upon cheated that call yet she had not sent him away she was too much in the game for that she had not seemed to have the power certainly she had not had the wit nor the courage he had remained and taken command she had done as he told her he was smiling approvingly upon her now manifestly proud of the way katie was playing the game seeing it as a thing to win his approval she could with difficulty continue it she was thankful that the dinner itself had drawn to a close later on the porch caroline osborne asked for ann zelda and major darrett and harry prescott were in the group at the time you mean she is not coming back she pursued in response to katies statement that ann had been called away i dont know said katie im afraid not who is she katie zelda asked no one you know zelda turned to prescott you know her yes he said his voice told katie how hard he was finding it just then to play the game like her yes he replied zelda threw back her head in an impertinent way of hers that was called engaging love her he stepped nearer katie as if for protection his smile was a dead smile really zelda said katie in laughing protest i just wondered said zelda if she was going to marry into the army katie saw major darretts smile if she did she said the army would gain something that might do it good major darrett was staring at her speechlessly harry gratefully youre very fond of her said caroline osborne in her sweettoned way very said kate in way less sweet too bad we missed her said zelda especially if she would do us good now cal heres going in for doing good too only shes not trying to do it to the army shes doing it to the working people get the distinction laughed the major i must get hold of some stunt like that said zelda the worlds getting stuntier and stuntier she turned to major darrett whom do you think i could do good to me he said and they strolled laughingly away together a few minutes later katie found herself alone with captain prescott katie he asked pleadingly where has ann gone shes been called away harry shes gone away but wont she be back katie turned away i dont know im afraid not katie he besought wont you help me wont you tell me where i can find her i know somethings the matter i know somethings strange but i want to see her i want to find her i want to see her i want to find her it invaded the chamber in katies heart she would keep inexorably shut she dared not speak but he was waiting and she was forced to speak harry im afraid youll have to forget ann she said unsteadily im afraid youll have to because she could not go on sure if she did she would not be able to go on with the evening she laughed ill tell you what you do she said briskly marry caroline osborne shes going to have heaps of money and will go in for philanthropy twill be quite stunty dont you see even zelda thinks it stunty he stepped back i had thought katie and his voice pierced her armor that you were kind she dared not let in anything so human as a hurt well thats where youre wrong im not kind she said harshly so i see he answered unsteadily but of a sudden the fact that he had been drawn to ann drew her irresistibly to him he had been part of all those wonderful days days of dream and play or waking and wondering she remembered that other night they had stood on the porch speaking of ann the very night she had become ann that fact that he had accepted her as ann cared for her made it impossible to harden her heart against him oh harry she said voice shaking im sorry so sorry its my fault and im sorry i didnt want you to be hurt i didnt want anybody to be hurt some one called to him and he had to turn away she stepped into the shadow and had a moment to herself what did it mean she wondered that one was indeed bound hand and foot and brain and heart and spirit what had she done save prove that she could do nothing ann had been driven away and in her house now were zelda fraser and caroline osborne and major darrett and all those others who were not dreamers of dreams and the dream betrayed she felt one with them for she had turned the dream out of doors with ann the wonderful dream which sheltered the heart of reality dream through which waking had come from which all the long dim paths of wondering had opened dream through which self had called and what was there left a house of hollow laughter was left of pretense stunts of prescribed rules and intolerance with all breakers of rules even though the breakers of rules were dreamers of dreams with a barely repressed sob she remembered what ann had said in her story of her dog i could have stood my own lonesomeness but what i couldnt stand was thinking about him i couldnt keep from thinking things that tortured me it was that gnawed at the heart of it how go to bed that night without knowing that ann had a bed she had loved ann because ann needed her been tender to her because ann was her charge she yearned for her now in fearing for her more sickening than the pain of having failed was the pain of wondering where ann would get her breakfast tears which she had been able to hold back even under the shame of her infidelity came uncontrollably with the simple thought that she might never do anns hair for her again it seemed to katie then that the one thing she could not do was go back to her guests a boy was coming on a bicycle he had a letter for katie she excused herself and went to the little room to read it the same little room where they had been that afternoon it was but a hurried note he had found nothing at the station except that the chicago train was probably there at the time doubtless she had taken it he had taken a chance and wired the train asking her to wire katie immediately that was all he could think of to do he was taking the night train for chicago not that he knew of anything to do there but perhaps she would like to feel there was some one there he would have to go soon anyhow might as well be that night he would be there three or four days he told katie where to address him he would do anything she asked he advised her for the time to remain where she was probably word would come to her there she might be able to do more from there than elsewhere it was not even certain ann had gone to chicago by no means certain and even if she had how find her there if she did not wish to be found at the last i suppose youre very gay at your dinner just now that must be tough business being gay dont let it harden your heart as gayety like that could so easily do and remember youre going on youre not a quitter and its only the quitters stop when they fall down below shyly off in one corner written very lightly as if he scarcely dared write it she found you dont know what a wonderful thing it is to me just to know that you are in the world katie went back to her guests with less gayety but more poise major darrett had remained for a goodnight drink with wayne he came out to katie as she was going up stairs i was proud of you katie he said i take no pride in your approval you made a great hit katie not with myself katie he suddenly demanded what were you up to i cant get the run of it for heavens sake what did you mean you wouldnt understand she murmured wearily for she was indeed so very weary then well im afraid i wouldnt i dont want to be harsh when youve had such a hard day but it looks to me as if you broke the rules what rules our rules you didnt play the game fair katie presenting her here i never would have done that no she said i know you put what you call the rules of life so far above life itself and look here katie whats this about prescott im not going to have him hurt if he doesnt know the situation and has any thought of marrying her why im in honor bound to tell him that fired her oh you are are you well if your honor moves you to that ill have a few things to say about that same honor of yours to our distinguished guest of this evening for instance she laughed he lost color but quickly recovered himself oh come now katie you and i are not going to quarrel no not if you can help it that wouldnt be your way but do you know what i think of the game you play she had gone a little way up the stairs and was standing looking back at him her eyes were shining feverishly i think its a game for cheats he did go colorless at that thats not the sort of thing you can say to a man katie he said in shaking voice a game for cheats she repeated the cheats who cheat with life and then make rules around their cheating and boast about the honor of keeping those rules youd scorn a man who cheated at cards oh youre very virtuous all of you in your scorn of lesser cheats whats cards compared with the divinest thing in life i tell you i played fair he insisted his voice still unsteady why to be sure you did according to the rules laid down by the cheats wayne came upon her upstairs a little later sobbing and sobbingly she told the story her face buried too much of the time for her to see her brothers face too shaken by her own sobs to mark how strange was his breathing wayne did not accuse her of not having played a fair game he said almost nothing at all save at the last and that under his breath well move heaven and earth to get her back his one reproach was oh katie you might have told me chapter xxvii but they did not get her back july had passed and august and most of september and they had not found ann heaven and earth were not so easily moved katie had tried and the man who mended the boats had tried and wayne but to no avail there had come the one letter from her letter seeking to save ann for katie it was a key to ann but no key to her whereabouts save that it was postmarked chicago those last three months had impressed katie with the tragic indefiniteness of the chicago postmark she had spent the greater part of the summer there at a quiet little hotel on the north side where she was nominally one of a party of army women that was the olive branch to her aunt elizabeth on the chaperone question for her own part she had seen too many unchaperoned girls in chicago that summer to care whether she was chaperoned or not her army friends thought katie interested in some work which she did not care to talk about they thought it interesting though foolhardy to let it bring those lines katie was not a beauty they said among themselves and could not afford lines her charm had always been her freshness her buoyancy and her blitheness now if she lost that wayne had been there from time to time it was but a few hours ride from the arsenal and his detail to his individual work gave him considerable liberty he too had more lines in september than he had had in june that they attributed to his strenuousness in his work and thought it to be deplored after all the department might throw him down who knew what it might not do and then what would have been the use for a man who did not have to live on his pay captain jones was looked upon as unnecessarily serious but katie suspected that it was not alone devotion to military science had traced those lines it surprised her a little that they should have come but to katie herself it was so vital and so tragic a thing that it was not difficult to accept the fact of its marking any one who came close to it after that night at the dance there had several times stirred a vague uneasiness calling out the thought that it was a good thing wayne was as she loosely thought it immune but even that uneasiness was lost now in sterner things she had never gone into her reasons for looking upon her brother as immune it was an idea fixed in her mind by her association with his unhappiness with clara knowing how much he had given she thought of him as having given all her sense of the depth of his hurt had unanalyzed associations with finality associations intrenched by waynes growing queerness it could not be said however that that queerness had stood in the way of his doing all he could some of the best suggestions had come from him and katie had reasons for suspecting he had done some searching of his own which he did not report to her she knew that he was worried about her though he understood too well to ask her to give up and turn back to her own life her gratitude to wayne for that very understanding made her regret the more her inability to be frank with him about the man who mended the boats she had had to tell him at first that he was helping but wayne had seemed to think it so strange had appeared so little pleased with the idea that she had not seen it as possible to make a clean breast of it she told him that she had talked with him about ann that was because he had seen her knew more about it than she did and that she had talked with him again the day ann left thinking he might have seen her that wayne had not liked you should have sent for me he said never take outsiders into your confidence in intimate matters like that and what she had not found it possible to try to make clear to him was that the man who mended the boats seemed to her anything but an outsider and if he had not seemed so in those days of early summer he seemed infinitely less so now she talked with him of things of which she could not talk with anyone else in those talks it was all the rest of the people of the world who were the outsiders he had been there several times during the summer katie knew now that he did not mean to spend all his life mending boats he was writing a play it was things in relation to that brought him to chicago katie wanted to know about the play but when she asked he told her rather shortly that he did not believe she would like it he qualified it with saying he did not know that anyone would like it when he was there he went about with her as she looked for ann every day she pursued her search now in this way now in that that search brought her a vision of the city she would have had in no other way it was that vision revealed interpreted by her anxiety for ann brought the sleepless nights and the ceaseless imagery and imaginings which caused her army friends to wish that dear katie would marry before she as they more feelingly than lucidly put it lost out that way she thought sometimes of anns moving picture show showing her the things of which she had dreamed all this things seen in her search had become to katie as a moving picture show it moved before her awake and asleep called to her she would stand outside the stores as the girls were coming out at night stores factories all places where girls worked she watched that way by the hundreds thousands she saw them filling the citys streets as through the long summer one hot day after another drew to a close often she would crowd into the street cars they were crowding into rush with them for the elevated trains or follow them across the river and see them disappear into boardinghouse and roominghouse those hot crowded places waiting to receive them after the hot crowded day sometimes she would go for lunch to the places she saw them going to always searching and as she searched wondering and as she wondered sorrowing she came to know of many things of dates vulgar enough affairs many of them appeared to be but she no longer dismissed them with that she always wondered now if the sordidlooking adventure might not be at heart the divine adventure things which she would at one time have called common and turned from as such she brooded over now as sorry expression of a noble thing and then she would go home to her friends at night and sometimes they would seem the movingpicture show their pleasures and standards the whole of their lives and she sorrowed that where there was setting for loveliness the setting itself should so many times absorb it all and that out on the citys streets that tender fluttering of life for life divine yearning for joy that joy might give again to life should find so many paths to that abyss where joy could be not and where the life of life must go there were days which showed all too brutally that many were called and few were saved thus had she passed the summer and thus it happened that she did not have in september all the freshness and the gladness that had been her charm in may though to the man waiting for her that afternoon she had another and a finer charm life had taken something from her but she had wrested something from life i could have had a job she said and smiled but the smile was soon engulfed and there was a girl who needed it she told me how she was up against it and through some caprice she didnt get it needing it doesnt seem to make a bit of difference if anything it works the other way she had read in the paper that morning that the chorus was to be tried out for a new musical comedy thinking that ann too might have read that in the paper she went she had been seeing something of chorus girls as well as shop girls she went to all the musical comedies and sat far front and kept her glasses on the chorus more than once she had stood near stage doors as they were coming out seeing them so they were not a group of chorus girls they were a number of individuals any one of whom might be ann more than one of whom might be fighting the things ann had fought seeking the things ann had sought it was that about the city that got her it was a city full of individuals none of whom were to be dismissed as just this or exactly that she challenged all groupings those groupings which seemed formed by the accidents of life and so often made for the tragedy of life she was talking to him about chorus girls announcing her discovery that they were just girls in the chorus i was once asked to define army people she laughed and said that they were people who entered the army either martially or maritally now i find that chorus girls are girls who enter the chorus even their vocabularies cant disguise them and if that cant what could though there are different kinds of chorus girls she reflected some wanted to be somewhere else some hope to be somewhere else and some swaggeringly make it plain that they wouldnt be anywhere else if they could id hate to have to say which kind is the most sad katie he said he never spoke her name save in that timid lingering way dont you think youre rather overemphasizing the sadness two girls passed them laughing boisterously perhaps so i suppose i am and yet nothing seems to me sadder than some of the people who would be astonished at suggesting sadness that afternoon they were going to the telephone office katie had been there early in the summer to the central office and all the exchanges but wanted to go again and mann said he would like to go with her and see what the thing looked like the officials were cordial to them at the telephone office seeming pleased to exhibit and explain and it seemed that with their rest rooms and recreation rooms their various things to contribute to comfort and pleasure their pride was justified but when they were in the immense room where several hundred girls were sitting before the boards rest rooms and recreation rooms did not seem to reach they walked behind a long row their guide proudly calling attention to the fact that not one of those girls turned her head to look at them he called it discipline concentration katie looking at the tense faces was thinking of the price paid for that discipline many of the girls were very young some not more than sixteen they preferred taking them young said the guide they were easier to break in if they had never done anything else there was not the shadow of a doubt that they were being broken in so clearly was that demonstrated that katie wondered what there would be left for them to be broken in to after they had been thoroughly broken in to that walking slowly behind them looking at every girl as a possible ann she wondered what they would have left for a something somewhere she remembered the woman who wore the white furs saying it got on her nerves and wondered what kind of nerves they would be it wouldnt get on the thing itself seemed a mammoth nervous system feeding on other nervous systems lesser sacrificed to greater her fancy reached out to all the things that at that instant were going through those cords plans were being made for dinner for motoring that evening for many pleasant restful things many little red lights with many possible invitations were insistently dancing before tired eyes just then they seemed endless those demands of life demands of life before which other demands of life were slowly going down she and mann were alone for the minute and yet she turned to him after following his glance to a girls tense white face what can they do the company i mean one must be fair they pay better than most things pay seem more interested in the girls what more can we ask well what would you think he suggested of asking for a system more interested in conserving nervous systems than in producing millionaires why yes he added in view of the fact that it has to make a few men rich perhaps they are doing all they can i dont doubt that they think they are but if this were a thing that didnt have to produce wealth then it wouldnt need to endanger health dont you think that in this nerveblighting work four or five hours instead of eight would be a pretty good days work for girls just out of short clothes it would seem so sighed katie as she left the room filled with girls answering calls girls looking too worn to respond to any call life might have for them though when a little later they stood in the doorway watching a long line of them passing out into the street it was amazing how ready and how eager they seemed for what life had to offer them they all looked tired but many appeared happy determined that all of life should not be going over the wire it seemed to katie the most wonderful thing she knew of that girls from whom life exacted so much could remain so ready so happily eager for life there was one thing to which she had made up her mind amid the confusion of her thinking and the sadness of her spirit one thing she saw as clear there was something wrong with an arrangement of life which struck that hard at life the very fact that the capacity for life persisted through so much was the more reason for its being a thing to be cherished rather than sacrificed lets walk up this way she was saying walk over the river the bridge is a good place just now katies face was white and tense as some of the faces they had left behind no he said impetuously lets not lets do something jolly she shook her head i have a feeling were going to find her tonight katie was always having that feeling but as she looked then he had not the heart to remind her of the many times it had played her false many girls passed them on the bridge but not ann i can never make up my mind to go she said i always think i ought to wait till the next one comes round the corner a girl who appeared to be thinking deeply passed them turning weary eyes upon them in languid interest i wonder what katie exclaimed what shes thinking about she explained maybe shes come to the end of her string and if she has hundreds of thousands of people about her oh i think its terrible her voice broke the way people are crowded so close together and held so far apart everybodys alone nobody knows for a second his hand closed over hers as it rested on the railing of the bridge as if he would bear some of the hurt for her that hurt she was finding in everything despite the extreme simplicity of her dress she looked out of place standing on that bridge at that hour he was thinking that she had not lost her distinction with her buoyancy her face was quivering katie it made him ask dont you think youd better quit she turned wet eyes upon him reproachfully from you but is any individual worth it oh i suppose no individual is worth much to you she said a little bitterly there was a touch of irony in the tender smile which was his only response they stood there in silence watching men and women come and go solitary and in groups groups tired and groups laughing groups respectable and groups questionable humanity worn humanity as it crossed that bridge she recalled that first night she had talked with him that first time a hot day had seemed to her anything more than mere hot day that night on the mississippi where distant hills were to be seen she remembered how she had looked around the world that night to see if it needed saving it seemed a long time ago since she had not been able to see that the world needed saving that was the night the man who mended the boats told her she had walked sunny paths she looked up at him with a faint smile smiling at the fancy of his being an outsider it seemed on the other hand that all the hopes and fears in all the hearts that were passing them were drawing them together there had been times when she had had a wonderful sense of their silences holding the sum of mans experiences you must go home he was saying decisively home where to my uncles thats where i keep the trunks im not using she laughed and brushed away a tear you know in the army we dont have homes well you have temporary homes he insisted as each moment she seemed to become more worn you know what i mean go back to your brothers hell be ordered from there very soon therell not be a place there for me much longer he did not seem to have reckoned with that his face changed then where will you go katie he asked very low what will you do she shook her head i dont know i dont know where ill go and i dont know what ill do they stood there in silence drawn close by thought of separation shall we walk on she said at last ive lost the feeling that were going to find ann tonight and so still silently they walked on but when after a moment he looked at her it was to see that she was making heroic effort to control the tears katie he murmured what is it were giving up she said and could not say more why no were not its only the method were giving up this way of doing it youve tried this long enough but what else is there just looking just keeping on looking and hoping just the chance what other method is there well find some other he insisted not willing when she looked like that to speak his fears therell be some other way but you cant keep on this way dear there was another silence a different one silence which opened to receive them at the throb in his voice as he spoke that last word he had to go back that night well he asked gently as they neared her hotel ill be down in a couple of days replied katie not steadily and youll be there a little while wont you he asked wistfully before you go you dont know where yes she said turning her eyes upon him for just an instant a little while before i go i dont know where but though she was going she didnt know where though she was giving up seemed conquered through all the uncertainty and the sadness there surged a strange new joy in their hearts as very slowly they walked that final block at the door after a moments full silence she held out her hand and youll be down there mending boats he nodded his eyes going where words had not ventured and youll come and see me she asked shyly you dont mean do you looking away as if with scarcely the courage to say it that im to stop everything no katie he said and his voice was shaking i think you must know i do not mean you are to stop everything as they lingered for a final moment they were alone far out in the sweet wild new places of the spirit and all that man had ever yearned for all joy that had been given and all joy denied seemed as a rich sea fathomless sea swelling just beneath that sweet wild new thing that had fluttered to consciousness in their hearts chapter xxviii the new life in her heart gave her new courage that night to look out at life she faced what before that she had evaded consciously facing perhaps they would not find ann at all perhaps ann had given up as they were giving up perhaps ann was not there to be found it was her fight against that fear had kept her so much in the crowds ann was there she had only to find her leaving the crowds seemed to be admitting that ann was not in them for if she really felt she was in them surely she would not consent to leaving them that idea of anns not being there was as a shadow which had from time to time crept beside her in the crowds she lost it there were so many in the crowds ann too was in the crowds she had only to stay in them and she must find her now she was leaving them and it was he who understood the crowds was telling her to leave them did he think she was not there why had she not had the courage to press it there was so much they should have been talking of in those last blocks and they had talked of nothing but the new warmth flooded katies heart at thought of having talked of nothing what was there to talk about so important as talking of nothing in a new way it drew her back to the crowds the crowds that talked so loudly of many unlovely things in order to still in their hearts that call for the loveliness of talking of nothing it gave her new understanding of ann ann was one who must rest in the wonder of talking of nothing it was for that she had gone down the world had destroyed her for the very thing for which life loved her katie joining with the world she would not have done that tonight tonight in the face of all the world she must have joined with life she wondered if all along it was not the thing for which she had most loved ann this shy new thing in her own heart seemed revealing ann it was kin to her and to katies feeling for her many times she had wondered why she cared so terribly would ask herself as she could hear her friends asking if they knew but does it matter so much as all this she had never been able to make clear to herself why it mattered so much mattered more than anything else mattered none of the reasons presenting themselves on the surface were commensurate to the depth of the feeling tonight she wondered if deep below all else might not lie that thing of anns representing life her failure with ann meaning infidelity to life it turned her to anns letter she had not had the courage to read it for a number of days katie ann had written im writing to try and show you that you were not all wrong that there was something there and im not doing it for myself katie im doing it for you if i can just forget im writing about myself feel instead that im writing about somebody youve cared for believed in somebody who has disappointed and hurt you trying to show you for your sake if i dont mind being either egotistical or terrible for the sake of showing you its not me that matters katie its what you thought of me thats why im writing i never could talk to you right for a long time i couldnt talk at all and then that night i talked most of the night i didnt tell the real things after all and at the last i told you something i knew would hurt you without telling you the things that might keep it from hurting without saving for you the things you had thought you saw i dont know why i did that desperate i suppose because it was all spoiled frantic because i was helpless to keep it from being spoiled and then i said things to you that must show and yet katie as long as im trying to be honest ive got to say again though all differently that i was surprised shocked i suppose at something in the way you looked its just a part of your world that i dont understand its as i told you weve lived in different worlds things some things that seem all right in yours well its just surprising that you should think them all right in your world the way you do things seems to matter so much more than what you do ive gone katie and as far as im concerned its what has to be you see you couldnt fit me in the only thing i can do for you now is to stay gone youll feel badly oh i know that but in the end it wont be as bad as trying to fit me in trying to keep it up and i cant have you doing things for me in another way as youd want to because its hard to explain just what i mean but after ive been ann i couldnt be just somebody you were helping it meant too much to me to be ann to become just a girl youre good to what id rather do want this letter to do is keep for you that idea of ann memory of her so thats why i want to tell you about some things that really were ann i havent any more right to you but i want you to know you have some right to her i told you that i was standing on the corner and that he asked me to get in the automobile and that i did and that that began it it was true it was one way to put it ill try and put it another way it isnt even fair to him putting it that way you know of course that hes not in the habit of asking girls on corners to go with him i think there at the first he was sorry for me i think it was what you would call an impulse and that being sorry for me had more to do with it than anything else and i know i wasnt fair to myself when i put it that way and you werent fair to me when you called it common and low thats what i want to try and show you that it wasnt that it was in the warm weather it had been a hot hard day oh they were all hot hard days i didnt feel well i made mistakes i was scolded for it i quarreled with one of the girls about washing my hands she said she was there before i was and that i took the bowl we said hateful things to each other grew furious about it we were both so tired the day had been so hot out on the street i was so ashamed it seemed that was what life had come to that afternoon i got something that was going over the wire you get so tired you dont care whats going over the wire you arent alive enough to care but i just happened to be let in to this a mans voice talking to the girl he loved i dont remember what he was saying but his voice told that there were such things in the world and girls they were for one glimpse of a beautiful country to one in a desert i dont know perhaps thats why i talked that way to the other poor girl who was tired perhaps thats why i went in the automobile i had to ride a long way on the street car to get where i boarded i had to stand up packed in among a lot of people who were hot and tired too the smell so awful everything so ugly i had to transfer thats where i was when i first saw him standing on the corner waiting for the other car something was the matter it was a long time coming i was so tired katie as i stood there waiting tired of having it all going over the wire he was doing something to his automobile i didnt pay any attention at first then i realized he was just fooling with the automobile and was looking at me and then he took my breath away by stepping up to me and raising his hat i had never had a man raise his hat to me in that way and then he said and his voice was low and like the voices in your world are i hadnt heard them before except on the wire i beg pardon i trust im not offensive but you seem so tired youre waiting for a car it doesnt appear to be coming why not ride with me instead ill take you where you want to go though i wish it was like the voice on the wire and for me that youd let me take you for a ride katie you called him charming you told about the women in your world being in love with him if hes charming to them to you what do you suppose he seemed to me as he stood there smiling at me looking so sorry for me he went on talking he drew a beautiful picture of what we would do we would ride up along the lake there would be a breeze from the lake he said and way up there he knew a place where we could sit out of doors under trees and eat our dinner and listen to beautiful music didnt i think that might be nice didnt i think it might be nice oh katie youd have to know what that day had been what so many days all days had been i looked down the street the car was coming at last packed men hanging on outside everybody looking so hot so dreadful oh you mustnt get in that car he said beautiful things were beckoning to me things i was to be taken to in an automobile i had never been in an automobile it seemed i was being rescued carried away to a land of beautiful things far away from crowded street cars from the heat and the work that make you do things you hate yourself for doing was it so common katie so low what i felt wasnt what i dreamed as we went along that beautiful drive beside the lake for i dreamed that the city of dreadful things was being left behind the fairy prince had come for me he was taking me to the things of dreams things which lately had seemed to slip out beyond even dreams it was just as he had said a little table under a tree a breeze from the lake music the lovely things to eat and the beautiful happy people of course i wasnt dressed as much as they were so we sat at a little table half hidden in one corner oh i thought it was so wonderful and he saw i thought it wonderful and that interested him pleased him maybe it was new to him i think he likes things that are new to him anyhow he was very gentle and lovely to me that night he told me i was beautiful that nothing in the world had ever been so beautiful as my eyes you know how he would say it the different ways he would have of saying it beautifully and i want to say again if it seems beautiful to you why katie i had never had anything going home he kissed me when i went home that night the world was all different the world was too wonderful for even thoughts too beautiful to believe it could be the world i was in the arms of the wonderful new beauty of the world something in my heart which had been crouching down afraid and cold and sad grew warm and live and glad life grew so lovely and as the days went on i think i grew lovely too he said so said love was making me radiant that i was wonderful that i was a child of love those days when i was in the dream folded in the dream days before any of it fell away they were golden days singing days days there are no words for we saw each other often he said business kept him away from chicago much of the time i didnt know he was in the army i suppose now he belonged in some place near there and i think you told me he was not married he said he was but was going to be divorced some day but i didnt seem to care didnt think much about it nothing really mattered except the love then there came a time when i knew i was trying to keep a door shut keep the happiness in and the thoughts out it wasnt that i came to think it was wrong but the awful fear that wanted to get into my heart was that it was not beautiful and it wasnt beautiful because to him it wasnt beautiful it was only what shall i say would there be such a thing as usurping beauty that was the thought the fear i tried and tried to push away i see i cant tell it no matter how much we may want to tell everything no matter how willing we are there are things cant be told so ill just have to say that things happened that forced the door open and i had to know that what to me was oh what shall i say katie was like the prayer at the heart of a dream didnt to him have anything to do with dreams or prayers or beautiful faraway things that speak to you from the stars and having nothing to do with them he seemed to be pushing them away crowding them out hurting them i havent told it at all i cant but katie youre in the army you must admire courage and i want you to take my word for it when i tell you i did what it took courage to do i think youd let me live on in your heart as ann if you knew what i gave up and just for something all dim and distant i had no assurance id ever come near to for oh katie when you love love need it its not so easy to let go whats the closest youve come to it not so easy to turn from the most beautiful thing youve known just because something very far away whispers to you that youre hurting beauty i didnt go back one night my something somewhere called me away and i left the only real thing i had and i didnt go back i dont know maybe im overestimating myself perhaps im just measuring it by the suffering but it seems to me katie that you neednt despise yourself when loneliness cant take you back to the substitutes offered for your something somewhere something in you had been brave something in you has been faithful and what youve actually done doesnt matter much in comparison with that ive been writing most of the day its evening now and im tired i was going to tell more tell you of things that happened afterward tell you why you found me where you did find me but now i dont believe i want to tell those things theyre too awful theyd hurt you haunt you and thats not what i want to do what i want is to make you understand and if the part ive told hasnt done that i think it was to save ann you were going to give up verna you said oh katie how did you know how do you know and then you called to me you werent sick at all were you katie oh i soon guessed that it was the wonderful goodness of your heart not the disease of it caused that attack then those beautiful days began i wanted to talk about what those days meant what you meant what our play our dream meant things i thought that i never said how proud i was you should want to make up those stories about me how i wanted to be the things you said i was and oh katie dear the trouble you got me into by loving to tell those stories telling one to one man and another to another id never known any one full of play like you yet play that is so much more than just play sometimes a picture of centralia would come to me when id hear you telling about my having lived in florence sometimes when i was listening to stories of things you and i had done in italy id see that old place where i used to put suspenders in boxes katie how strange it all was how did it happen that things you made up were things i had dreamed about without really knowing what i was dreaming how wonderful you were katie how good to put me in the things of my dreams rather than the things of my life the world doesnt do that for us it seems a ridiculous thing to be mentioning when i owe you so many things too wonderful to mention but you know i do owe you some money i took what was in my purse i hope i can pay it back im so tired just now it doesnt seem to me i ever can but if i dont dont associate it with my not paying back the missionary money katie do you know how id like to pay you back id like to give you the most beautiful things ive ever dreamed and i hope that some of them at least are waiting somewhere and not very far off for you how i used to love to hear you laugh watch you play your tricks on people so funny and so dear now thats over katie i dont believe its all my fault and i know its not yours its our two worlds you see you couldnt fit me in i used to be afraid it must end like that yet most of the time i felt so secure that was the wonder of you that you could make me so beautifully secure and your brother katie have you told him i dont care if you do only if you tell him anything wont you try and make him understand everything i couldnt bear it to think he might think me oh those things i dont believe you really think me if you dont see me any more you wont think those things its easier to understand when things are all over its easier to forgive people who are not around after whats happened i couldnt be ann if i were with you thats spoiled but if i go i think maybe ann can stay for both our sakes thats what i want twas a lovely dream katie the house by the river the big trees the big flag that waved over us the pretty dresses the lovely way of living the dogs the men who were always so nice to us last night i dreamed you and worth and i were going to a wedding that is it started out to be a wedding then it seemed it was a funeral but you were saying such funny things about the funeral katie then i woke up the letter broke off there chapter xxix the next morning katie did something which it had been in her mind to do for some time she went to centralia it was not that she expected centralia to furnish any information about ann it was hard to say just why she was so certain ann had not gone back to centralia the conviction had something to do with her belief in ann centralia however might be an avenue to something furthermore she wanted to see centralia that was part of her passion for seeing the thing as a whole realizing it and she had a suspicion that if anything remained to forgive ann it would be forgiven after seeing centralia and back of all that lurked the longing to tell anns father what she thought of him katie was in a strange mood that day she had read anns letter many times but had never finished it with that poignantly personal heartache of the night before it was as if she were not worthy that new thing which kept warm in her own heart for she had been hostile to the very thing from which the warmth in her own heart drew the sadness deepened in the thought that the great hosts of the worlds people sheltered joy in their own hearts and hardened those very hearts against all to whom love came less fortunately than it had come to them how could there be hope for the world no matter what it might do about its material affairs while heart closed against heart like that while men and women drew their own portions of joy and shut themselves in with them refusing to see that they were one with all who drew or would draw it seemed the most cruel the most wrong thing of all the world that men and above all women should turn their most unloving face upon the face of love of which things she thought again as she passed various centralias and wondered if there were anns longing for love in all those unlovely places she came at last after crossing a long stretch of nothingness to the town where ann had lived town from which she had gone forth to hear grand opera and find the loveliness of life but as she stepped from the train and approached a group of men lounging at the station it came to her that anns father particularly as ann had not been ann in centralia was a somewhat indefinite person to be inquiring for after a moments consideration she approached the man who looked newest to his profession and asked how many churches there were in centralia thereupon one man beat open retreat and all viewed her with suspicion but the man of her choice was a brave man and ventured to guess that there were four one of his comrades held that there were five a discussion ensued closing with the consensus of opinion in favor of the greater number then katie explained her predicament she wanted to find a man who was a minister in centralia and she didnt know his name reassured they gathered round interestedly was he young or old katie cautiously placed him in the forties or fifties then they guessed and reckoned that it couldnt be either the reverend lewis or that new fellow at the baptist was he would she say he was one to be kind of easy on a fellow or did she think he took his religion pretty hard katie was forced to admit that she feared he took it hard with that they were agreed to a man that it must be the reverend saunders she was thereupon directed to the residence of the reverend saunders right down there was a restaurant with a sign in the window dont pass by but she was to pass by then there was the church said welcome no that was not the reverend saunders church it was the church where she turned to the right she could turn to the left but on the whole it would be better to turn to the right it would all have been quite simple had it not been for the fullness of the directions she took it that the fullness of their directions was in proportion to the emptiness of their lives as she walked slowly along she appreciated what ann had said of the towns being walled in by nothingness the people walled in by nothingness her two blocks on main street showed her centralia as a place of petty righteousness and petty vice there was nothing so large and flexible as the real joys of either righteousness or unrighteousness nor was centralia picturesquely desolate it had not that quality of hopelessness which lures to melancholy new houses were going up the last straw was that centralia was growing and it was on those streets that a lonely little girl with deep brown eyes and soft brown hair had dreamed of a something somewhere as she turned in at the residence of the reverend saunders katie was newly certain that ann had not come back to centralia it seemed the one disappointment in ann she was not prepared to bear would be to find that she had returned to the home of her youth katie had been shown into the parlor she was sitting in a rocking chair which squeaked her smartly shod foot resting on a pale blue rose the pale blue rose being in the carpet the carpet also squeaked or the papers underneath it did on the table beside her was a large and ornate bible an equally splendid album and something called stepping heavenward oh no ann had not come back she knew that before she asked anns father was a tall thin man with small gray eyes thin lips that shut together tight she recalled that and the kind of beard that is unalterably associated with selfrighteousness it was clear he did not know what to make of katie she was wearing a linen suit which had vague suggestions of the world the flesh and the devil she had selected it that morning with considerable care likewise the shoes and the angle of the quill in katies hat stirred in him the same suspicion and aggression which his beard stirred in her thus viewing each other across seas of prejudice separated as it were by all the experiences of the human race they began to speak of ann and of life i am a friend of your daughters was katies opening it startled him stirring something on the borderland of the human then he surveyed katie anew and shut his lips together more tightly it was evidently just what he had expected his daughter to come to and i came said katie to ask if you had any idea where she was that reached even farther into the bordercountry he sat forward his lips relaxed dont you know no i dont know she was living with me and she went away that recalled his own injury he sat back and folded his arms she was living with me and she went away no i know nothing of her whereabouts my daughter saw fit to leave her fathers house under circumstances that bowed his head in shame she has not seen fit to return or to give information of her whereabouts i have tried to serve my god all my days said the reverend saunders i do not know why this should have been visited upon me but his ways are inscrutable his purpose is not revealed no said katie crisply i should say not he expressed his condemnation of the relation of manner to subject by a compression of both eyes and lips that katie supposed was the way he had looked when he told ann her dog had been sent away did you ever wonder she asked with real curiosity how in the world you happened to have such a daughter i have many times taken it up in prayer was his response katie sat there viewing him and looking above his head at the motto god is love she wondered if ann had had to work it it was the suggestion in the motto led her to ask tell me have you really no idea have you never had so much as a suspicion of why ann went away who he asked sharply your daughter her friends call her ann her name said he uncompromisingly is maria katie smiled slightly maria as he uttered it squeaked distressingly be that as it may but have you really no notion of why she went away she was looking at him keenly after a moment his eyes fell or rather lifted under the look she had a good home a godfearing home he said but katie did not let go her look he had to come back to it and he shifted did he have it in him remotely unavowedly to suspect it would seem so for he continued his argument as if meeting something he repeated that she had a good home he enumerated her blessings but when he paused it was to find katie looking at him in just the same way it forced him to an unwilling uneasy what more could a girl want what she wanted said katie passionately was life the word spoken as katie spoke it had suggestion of unholy things but god is life he said suddenly katies eyes blazed god well its my opinion that you know just as little about him as you do about life it was doubtless the most dumbfounded moment of the reverend saunders life his jaw dropped but only to come together the tighter young woman said he i am a servant of god i have served him all my days heaven pity him said katie and rocked and her chair squeaked savagely he rose i cannot permit such language to be used in my house katie gave no heed ill tell you why your daughter left she left because you starved her above your head is a motto the motto says god is love i could almost fancy somebody hung that in this house as a joke you see you dont know anything about love thats why you dont know anything about god or life or ann in this universe of mysterious things katie went on it so happened as you have remarked gods ways are indeed inscrutable that unto you was born a child ordained for love she paused held herself by the mystery of that and as she contemplated the mystery of it her wrath against him fell strangely away telling him what she thought of him suddenly ceased to be the satisfying thing she had anticipated it was all too mysterious it grew so large and so strange that it did not seem a matter the reverend saunders had much to do with it telling him what she thought of him was not the thing interesting her then what interested her was wondering why he was as he was how it had all happened what it all meant her wondering almost drew her to him certainly it gave her a new approach oh isnt it a pity was what katie said next and there was pain and feeling and almost sympathy in her voice as she repeated isnt it a pity he too spoke differently more humanly isnt what a pity that we bungle it so that we dont seem to know anything about each other why i suppose you didnt know you simply didnt have it in you to know that the way she needed to serve god was by laughing and dancing he was both outraged and drawn he neither rebuked nor agreed he waited you see it was this way you were one thing she was another thing and neither of you had any way of getting at the thing that the other was so you just grew more intolerant in the things you were and that i suppose is the way hearts are broken and lives are spoiled her eyes had filled it had drawn her back to her mood of the morning doesnt it seem to you she asked gently of the reverend saunders that its just an awful pity the reverend saunders did not reply but he was not looking at katies quill or katies shoes he was looking at katies wet eyes and katie as they sat there for a moment in silence was not seeing him alone as the reverend saunders she was seeing him as product of something which had begun way back across the centuries seeing far back of the reverend saunders that spirit of intolerance which had shaped him wrung him dry spirit which in the very beginning had lost the meaning of those words which hung above the reverend saunders head it seemed a childish thing to be blaming the reverend saunders for the things the centuries had made him indeed she no longer felt like blaming any one sorrow which comes through seeing leaves small room for blame katie did not know as much about the history of mankind as she now wished she did as she meant to know but there did open to her a glimpse of the havoc wrought by the forerunners of the reverend saunders of all the children of love blighted in the name of a god of love she had risen and as she looked at him again she was sorry for him sterility of the heart seemed a thing for pity rather than scorn im sorry for you she spoke it oh im sorry for us all we all bungle it were all in the grip of dead things arent we do you suppose it will ever be any different and still he looked not at the quill or the shoes but the eyes eyes which seemed sorrowing with all the love sorrows of the centuries young woman he said uncertainly you puzzle me i puzzle myself said katie and wiped her eyes and laughed a little thinking of the scornful exit she had meant to make after telling him what she thought of him she retraced her steps and waited for two hours at the station reconstructing for herself anns girlhood in centralia and thinking larger thoughts of the things which spoiled girlhoods the pity of it all and it seemed that even selfrighteousness was not wholly to blame katie felt a little lonely in losing her scorn of goodness she had so enjoyed hating the godly if even they were to be gently grouped with the wicked as more to be pitied than hated then whom would one hate did knowing seeing spoil hating and was all hating to go when all men saw at the last minute she had a fight with herself to keep from going back and refunding the missionary money the missionary money worried katie she wanted it paid back but she saw that it was not her paying it back would satisfy her she even felt that she had no right to pay it back chapter xxx she returned to chicago to find that her uncle was in town he had left a message asking her to join him for dinner over at his hotel it was pleasant to be dining with her uncle that night the best possible antidote she could think of for anns father was her dear uncle the bishop as she watched him ordering their excellent dinner she wondered what he would think of anns father she could hear him calling centralia a godforsaken spot and anns father a benighted fossil doubtless he would speak of the reverend saunders as a type fast becoming obsolete and the quicker the better she could hear him add but she fancied that the reverend saunderses of the world had yet a long course to run in the centralias of the world she feared that many anns had yet to go down before them at any rate her uncle was not that tonight katie loved him anew for his delightful worldliness though he was not in his best form that night he was on his way out to colorado for the marriage of his son there was no doing anything about it he said with a sigh my office has made me enough the diplomat katherine to know when to quit trying so im going out there fearful trip why its miles from denver to do all i can to respectablize the affair it seemed to me a trifle inconsiderate in view of the effort im making that they could not have waited until next month there are things calling me to denver then now what shall i do there all that time though i may run on to california but it seems my daughterinlaw would have her honeymoon in the mountains while the aspens are just a certain yellow shes fond of so of course with his little shrug katie loved whats my having a month on my hands well uncle dear uncle she laughed hast forgotten the days when nothing mattered so much as having the leaves the right shade of yellow i have not and trust i never will he replied with a touch of asperity but i feel that fred has shown very little consideration for his parents but why uncle im strong for her she sounds to me like just what our family needs he gave her a glance over his glasses that delighted katie too she had long ago learned that when her uncle felt occasion demand he look like a bishop he lowered his chin and looked over his glasses well our family may need something its the first intimation ive had katherine that its in distress but i dont see that a young woman who votes is the crying need of the family shes in great luck returned katie to live in a state where she can vote he held up his hands katie you oh i havent prowled around this town all summer uncle without seeing things that women ought to be voting about he stared at her well katie you you dont mean to take it up do you he looked so unhappy that she laughed oh i dont know uncle what i mean to take up but i herewith serve notice that im going to take something up something besides bridge and army gossip she looked at him reflectively uncle does it ever come home to you that lifes a pretty serious business well i hadnt wanted it to come home to me tonight he sighed plaintively im really most upset about this unfortunate affair i had thought that you katie would be pleasant forgive me she laughed i can see how it must disturb you uncle to hear me express a serious thought he laughed at her delightedly he loved katie youve got the fidgets katie just the fidgets thats whats the matter with the whole lot of you youngsters its becoming an epidemic a sort of spiritual measles though i must say i hadnt expected you to catch it and just a word of warning katie youve always been so unique as a trifler that one rather hates to see you swallowed up in the troop of seriousminded young women i was talking to darrett the other day charming fellow darrett and he held that your charm was in your brilliant smile i told him i hadnt thought so much about the brilliant smile but that i knew a good deal about a certain impish grin katie you have a very disreputable grin you have a way of directing it at me across ponderous drawingrooms that i wish youd stop it gives me a sort of oh i am on to you uncle old boy feeling that is most disconcerting unreverential he looked at her humorously and yet meditatively fondly katie why do you think its so funny why does it make you want to grin you know else you wouldnt read the grin but i dont know nobody else grins at me oh dont you think were a good deal of a joke uncle joke who why us the solemnity with which we take ourselves and the way the world lets us do it he laughed then as one coming back to his lines you have no reverence no neither have you thats why we get on he made an unsuccessful attempt at frowning upon her and surveyed her a little more seriously katie do you know that the things you say sometimes puzzle me theyre queer they burrow theyre so insultingly knowing down at the root of their unknowingness ill think she didnt know how pat that was and then as i consider it ill think yes she did only she didnt know that she knew i remember telling your mother once when you were a little girl that if you were going to sit through service with your head cocked in that knowing fashion i wished shed leave you at home katie laughed and cocked her head at him again just to show she had not forgotten then she fell serious uncle for a long time i only smiled i seemed to know enough to do that do you think you could bear it with christian fortitude if i were to tell you im beginning now to try and figure out what i was smiling at he shook his head twould spoil it he looked at his niece and smiled as he asked katie dear are you becoming world weary katie very smart that night in white gown and black hat appealed to him as distinctly humorous in the role of world weariness no returned katie not world weary just weary of not knowing the world afterward in his room they chatted cheerfully of many things family affairs army and church affairs katie strove to keep to them as merely personal matters but there were no merely personal matters any more all the little things were paths to the big things there was no way of keeping herself detached even the seemingly isolated topic of the recent illness of the bishops wife led full upon the picture of other people she had been seeing that summer who looked ill her uncle was telling of a case he had recently disposed of a rector of his diocese who was guilty of an atheistic book he spoke feelingly of what he called the shallowness of rationalism of the dangers of the age beautifully of that splendid past which the church must conserve he told of some lectures he himself was to deliver on the fallacies of socialism its honeycombing our churches katherine yes and even the army darrett tells me theyve found its spreading among the men nice state of affairs were we to have any sort of industrial war it was hard for katie to keep silence but she felt so sadly the lack of assurance arising from lack of knowledge well give her a little time she would fix that she contented herself with asking if he anticipated an industrial war the bishop made a large gesture and said he hoped not but he felt it a time for the church to throw all her forces to safeguarding the great heritage of the countrys institutions he especially deplored that the church itself did not see it more clearly more unitedly he mentioned fellow bishops who seemed to be actually encouraging inroads upon tradition where did they expect it to lead he demanded perhaps meekly suggested katie they expect it to lead to growth growth snorted the bishop destruction they passed to the sunnier subject of raising money as regards the budget bishop wayneworth was the churchs most valued servant his manner of goodhumored tolerance gave mammon a soothing sense of being understood moving the much maligned god to reach for its check book just to bear the friendly bishop out in his lenient interpretation of a certain text about service rendered in two directions he was telling of a fund he expected to raise at a given time if he did a certain capitalist would duplicate it the bishop became jubilant at the prospect and as they talked there passed before katie as in review the things she had seen that summer passed before her the worn faces of those girls who night after night during the hot summer had come from the stores and factories where the men of whom her uncle was so jubilantly speaking made the money which they were able to subscribe to the church she thought of her uncles church she could not recall having seen many such faces in the pews of that church she thought of ann wondered where ann might be that night while she and her uncle chatted so cheerfully in his pleasant room at his luxurious hotel she tried to think of anything for which her uncle stood which would give her confidence in saying to herself ann will be saved the large sum of money over which he was gloating was to be used for a new cathedral she wondered if the anns of her uncles city would find the world a safer or a sweeter place after that cathedral had been erected she thought of anns world of the opera and world of work was it true as the man who mended the boats would hold that the one made the other possible only to be excluded from it and all the while there swept before her faces faces seen in the crowd faces of those who were not finding what they wanted faces of all those to whom life denied life and then katie thought of a man who had lived long time before a man of whom her uncle spoke lovingly in his sermons as jesus the christ the son of the living god she thought of anns father how far he had gone from a religion of love then came back to her lovable uncle well what of him charm of personality a sense of humor a comfortable view of living for himself and his kind did not seem the final word uncle katie asked quietly do you ever think much about christ in his astonishment the bishop dropped his cigar what a strange man he must have been she murmured kindly explain yourself said he curtly he seemed to think so much about people just people and chiefly people who were down on their luck i dont believe he would have been much good at raising money he had such a queer way of going around where people worked talking with them about their work if he were here now and were to do that i wonder if hed help much in stemming the rising tide of socialism what a blessing it is for our institutions katie concluded that hes not anywhere around the bishops hand shook i had not expected he said that my own niece my favorite niece indeed the favorite member of my family was here to revile me uncle forgive me but isnt it bigger than that thing of being members of the same family hurting each others feelings oh uncle she burst forth no longer able to hold back as you stand sometimes at the altar dont you hear them moaning and sobbing down underneath he looked at her sharply with some alarm oh no she laughed not going crazy just trying to think a little about things but dont you ever hear them uncle i should think they might bother you sometimes really katherine he said stiffly this is most annoying hear whom moaning and sobbing those people the worn out shop girls and broken down men and women and diseased children that your church is built right on top of not the words but the sob behind them moved him to ask gently katie dear what is it whats the trouble her eyes were swimming uncle its the misery of the world its the people who arent where they belong its the lives ruined through blunders its the cruelty the needless cruelty of it all she leaned forward the tears upon her cheeks uncle how can you you have a mind a kind heart but what good are they if you believe the things you say you believe oh you think you believe them but you dont seem to connect them here tonight weve been talking about the forms of the church finances of the church and humanity is in need uncle bodily need and oh the heart need why dont you go and see why youve only to look what are your puny little problems of the church compared with peoples lives and yet you cut off detached save in so far as feeding on them goes claim to be following in the footsteps of a man who followed in their footsteps a man who went about seeing how people lived finding out what troubled them trying she sank back with a sob i didnt mean to but i simply cant understand it cant understand how you can she hid her face those faces they passed and passed he had risen and was walking about the room after a moment he stopped and cleared his throat if i didnt think katherine that something had happened to almost derange you i should not have permitted you to continue these ravings she raised her head defiantly truths people dont want to hear are usually disposed of as ravings now if i may be permitted a word your indictment is not at all new though your heat in making it would indicate you believed yourself to be saying something never said before i know its been said before im more interested in knowing how its been answered you have never seemed sufficiently interested in the affairs of the church katherine for one to think of seriously discussing our charities with you uncle do you know what your charities make me think of he had resumed his chair and cigar no he said coldly i do not know what they make you think of i was attempting to tell you what they were i know what they are the idea that comes to my mind has a rather vulgar oh pray do not hesitate katherine you have not been speaking what i would call delicately your charities are like waving a scented handkerchief over the stockyards or like handing out afterdinner mints to a mob of starving men youre quite the wrong end there as is usual with you agitators he replied comfortably we dont give them mints we give them soup giving them soup even if you did is the mint end why dont you give them jobs he spread out his hands in gesture of despair what a bore a little learning can make of one my dear niece i deeply regret to be compelled to inform you that there arent jobs enough to go around why arent there why the obvious reason would seem katie he replied patiently that there are too many of them wanting them and as usual the obvious reason is not it there are too many of you and me thats the trouble they dont have the soup because they must furnish us the mints it was katie who had risen now and was walking about the room her cheeks were blazing i tell you uncle i feel its a disgrace the way we live taking everything and doing nothing i feel positively cheap about it the army and the church and all the other useless things i do not agree with you that the army is useless and i certainly cannot permit you to say the church is youll not be able to stop other people from saying it he seemed about to make heated reply but instead sank back with an amused smile katie your learning sounds very suspiciously as though it were put on last night i feel like putting up a sign fresh paint keep off well at any rate its not mouldy at college i roomed with a chap who had a way of discovering things getting in a fine glow of discovery over things everybody else had known he would wake me out of a sound sleep to tell me something i had heard the week before and its trying to be waked out of a sound sleep isnt it uncle she flashed back at him it ended with his kindly assuring her that he was glad she had begun to think about the problems of the world that no one knew better than he that there was a social problem and a grave one that men of the church had written some excellent things on the subject he would send her some of them indeed he would be glad to do all in his power to help her to a better understanding of things he was convinced he said soothingly that when she had gone a little farther into them she would see them more sanely chapter xxxi katie was back home or more accurately she was back at waynes quarters where they could perhaps remain for a month or two longer and craving some simple natural thing something that could not make the heart ache she went out that afternoon to play golf the physical kate katie of the sound body was delighted to be back playing golf every little cell sang its song of rejoicing rejoicing in emancipation from the illsmelling crowds return to the open air and the good green earth it seemed a saving thing that they could so rejoice katie was reading the little book on mans evolution which the man who was having much to do with her evolution had it seemed long ago sent her in the package marked danger she had finished the book about women and was just looking through the one on evolution on the day caroline osbornes car had stopped at her door that began a swift series of events leaving small place for reading but when that last day they were together in chicago she asked him about something to read he suggested a return to that book there seemed wisdom and kindness in the suggestion the story of evolution was to the mind what the game of golf was to the body with the life about her pressing in too close there was something freeing and saving in that glimpse of herself as part of all the life there had ever been because the crowds had seemed the all were suffocating her something in that vastness of vision was as fresh air after a stifling room it was not that it did away with the crowds made her think they did not matter they were after all the more vital imperative but she had more space in which to see them was given a chance to understand them rather than be blindly smothered by them for a number of years katie had known that there was such a thing as evolution it had something to do with an important man named darwin he got it up it was the idea that we came from monkeys the monkey was not katies favorite animal and she would have been none too pleased with the idea had it not been that there was something so delicious about solemn people like her aunt elizabeth and proper people like clara having come from them she was willing to stand it herself just because if she came from them they did too she had assumed all along that she believed in darwin and that people who did not believe in him were benighted but the chief reason she had for believing in him was that the church had not believed in him that was through neither malice nor conviction as regards the church but merely because it was exciting to have some one disagreeing with it it had thrilled her as fearless she had always meant to find out more about evolution she had a hazy idea that there was a great deal more to it than just the fact of having come from monkeys but she led such a busy life bridge and things that there was never time and so it remained a thing she believed in and was some day going to find out about now she was furious with herself and with everybody connected with her for having lived so much of her life shut out from the knowledge vision that made life so vast and so splendid it was like having lived all ones life in sight of the sea and being so busy walking around a silly little lake in a park that there was no time to turn ones face seaward she wondered what she would think of a person who said the little toy lake kept her so busy there was never a minute to turn around and take a good look at the sea katie had always loved the great world of living things the fishes and birds all animals all things that grew they had always called to her imagination she used to make up stories about them she saw now that their real story was a thousandfold more wonderful more the story than anything she had been able to invent she would give much to have known it long before she felt that she had missed much there was something humiliating in the thought of having lived ones life without knowing what life was it made one seem such a dead thing now she was on fire to know all about it she smiled as it suggested to her what her uncle had said a few days before of the fresh paint she supposed there was some truth in it that one who was conserving the past must find something raw and ludicrous in her state of mind her passion to fairly devour knowledge would probably bring to many of them the same amused smile it had brought to her uncle but it was surprising how little she minded the smile she was too intent on the things she would devour her glimpse into this actual story of life brought the first purely religious feeling she had ever known it even brought the missionary fervor which as they sat down to rest she exercised upon worth who had been proudly filling the office of caddy she told him that she was going to tell him the most wonderful fairy story there had ever been in the world and the thing that made it most wonderful of all was that while it was just like a fairy story in being wonderful it was every bit true and then she told him a little of the great story of how one thing became another thing how everything grew out of something else how it had been doing that for millions of years how he was what he was then because through all those years one thing had changed grown into something else as she told it it seemed so noble a thing to be telling a child so much purer and more dignified to say nothing of more stimulating than the evasive tales of life employed in the attempt to thwart her childish mind worth was upon her with a hundred questions how did a worm become something that wasnt a worm did it know it was going to do it and why did one worm go one way and in a lot of million years be a little boy and another worm go another way and just never be anything but a worm did she think in another hundred million years that little bird up there would be something else would they be anything else and why she saw that she had let herself in for a whole new world of whys one thing was certain if she were to remain with worth she would have to find out more about evolution her knowledge was pitifully incommensurate to his whys but it was beautiful to her the way his mind reached out to it he was lying on his stomach head propped up on hands in an almost prayerful attitude before an ant hill did she think those little ants knew that they were alive would they ever be anything else he wanted to be told more stories about things becoming other things seemed intoxicated with that idea of the constant becoming but aunt kate he cried mama told me that god made me why so he did worthie that is i suppose he did but he didnt just make you out of nothing he lay there on the grass in silence for a long time looking at the world about him thinking after a while he was singing a little song this was the song once i was a little worm long long ago katie smiled in thinking how scandalized clara would be to have heard the story just told her son story moving him to sing a vulgar song about having been a horrid little worm it would be claras notion of propriety to tell worth that the doctor brought him in his motor car and expect his mind that wonderful plastic little mind of his to be proper enough to rest content with that lucid exposition of the wonder of life the time was near for claras six months of worth to begin katie had promised she would bring him to her wherever she was and clara was in paris and meaning to remain there it meant that worth would spend the winter in paris away from them from time to time as the custom of the city dictated he would be taken for perfunctory little walks in the bois and would be told to run and play if he asked indelicate questions concerning the things of life in the light of this story of the ways of growth the arrangement about worth seemed an unnatural and a brutal thing she did not believe that as a matter of fact clara wanted worth the maternal passion was less strong in clara than the passion for lingerie but she wanted worth with her for six months because that kept him from wayne and katie for six months and she knew that they did want him the poor little fellows summer had not been what katie had planned part of the time he had been with his father and part of the time with her that thing of division again and as neither of them had been happy any of the time worth had had to suffer for it he seemed to have to suffer so much through the fact that grownup people did not know how to manage their lives suddenly he sat up aunt kate he asked whens miss ann coming back i dont know dear well where is she shes been called away well i wish shed come back i like miss ann aunt kate yes dear we all do she tells nice stories too only theyre about fairies that are just fairies not worms and things that are really so do you suppose miss ann knows aunt kate that she used to be a frog katie laughed and tried to elucidate her point about the frog but she wondered what difference it might not have made had ann known that as worth put it she used to be a frog with ann fairy stories would have to be about things not real all anns life it had been so it suddenly seemed that it might have made all the difference in the world had ann known that the things most wonderful were the things that were or rather had the world in which ann lived cared to know real things for precious things the desire for life as the most radiant thing that had ever been upon the earth ann would have found the world a different place had men known life for the majestic thing it was seen that back of what her uncle called the splendid heritage of the countrys institutions was the vastly more splendid heritage of the institution of life letting the former shut them from the latter was being too busy with the toy lake to look out at the sea seeing ann as part of all the life that had ever been upon the earth she became not infinitesimal but newly significant widened outlook brought deepened feeling newly understanding she sat there brooding over ann anew pain in the perfection of her understanding but new courage life had persisted through so much was so triumphant the larger conception lent its glow to the paling belief that ann would persist triumph aunt kate worth burst forth lets take the boat and go up and find the man that mends the boats aunt kate blushed oh no dearie we couldnt do that why we did do it once argued worth i know but we cant do it now i dont see why not no worth didnt see i just want to ask him aunt kate if he knows that he used to live in a tree oh he knows it she laughed he knows everything said worth worthie is that why you like him cause he knows everything or do you like him just because you like him i like him because he knows everything but mostly i like him just because i like him same here breathed aunt kate the man who mended the boats was coming to see her that night perhaps golf and evolution should not grow arrogant after all he had been strange about coming when she talked with him over the phone he had hesitated at the suggestion and finally said with a defiance she could not see the situation called for that he would like to come in chicago he had once said to her theres too much gloom around you now for me to contribute the story of my life but please remember that that was why i didnt tell it she wondered if the story of his life had anything to do with his hesitancy in coming to see her surely he would have no commonplace notions about different spheres though he had mentioned them and with bitterness he was especially hostile to the army had more than once hurt her in his hostility she would not have resented his attacking it as an institution that she would expect from his philosophy but it was a sort of personal contempt for the army and its people she had resented almost as she would a contemptuous attitude toward her own family she had contended that he was unjust that a lack of sympathy with the ends of the army basis of it should not bring him to a prejudiced attitude toward its people she maintained that officers of the army were a higher type than civilians of the same class he had told her almost roughly that he didnt think she knew anything about it and she had replied heatedly that she would like to know why she wouldnt know more about it than he in the end he said he was sorry to have hurt her when there was so much else to hurt her but had not retracted what he had said or even admitted the possibility of mistake it seemed that one of the worst things about classes was that they inevitably meant misunderstanding they bred antagonism and that prejudice people didnt know each other considering it now she wondered though feeling traitorous to him in the wondering if the man who mended the boats might shrink from anything so distinctly social as calling upon her their meetings theretofore had been on a bigger and a sterner basis she had missed a few of the little niceties of consideration a few of those perfunctory and yet curiously vital courtesies to which she had all her life been accustomed as a matter of course from her army men but it had been as if they were merely leaving them behind for things larger and deeper as if their background was the real world rather than world of perfunctory things from him she had a consideration not perfunctory but in the mood of the things they were sharing that sense of sharing big things things real and rude had swept them out of the world of artificial things now did he perhaps hold back in timidity from that world of the trivial things she put it from her disliking herself as of the trivial things in letting it suggest itself at all expecting him to be just like the men she had known would be expecting the sea to behave like that lake in the park that night she put on her most attractive gown a dress sometimes gray and sometimes cloudy blues and greens itself like the sea and finding in katie a more mysterious quality than her openness would usually suggest feeling called upon to make some account to herself for dressing more than occasion would seem to demand she told herself that she must get the poor old thing worn out and get something new but it was not a poor old thing and the last thing katie really wanted was to succeed in getting it worn out as she dressed she was thinking of anns pleasure in clothes there were times when it had seemed a not altogether likeable vanity it was understandable lovable after having been to centralia after knowing so many things were understandable and lovable after knowing she wished she might call across the hall and ask ann to come in and fasten her dress she would like to chat with her about the way she had done her hair all those intimate little things they had countless times talked about so gayly she walked over into anns room room in which ann had taken such pride and pleasure ann had loved the things on the dressingtable she had more than once seen her fairly caressing those pretty ivory things she wondered if ann had anything resembling a dressingtable what she wore how she managed those were the little worries about ann forever haunting her as they would a mother who had a child away from home new vision of the immensity of life could save her from giving destroying place to that sense of the woe of the world but a conception of the wonders of the centuries could not keep out the gnawing fear that ann might not be getting enough to eat there was a complexity in her mood of that night happiness and sadness so close as at times to be indistinguishable the whole of it making for a sense of the depth of life but their evening was constrained katie blamed the dress for part of it vexed with herself for having put it on she had wanted to be attractive not suggest the unattainable and that was what something seemed suggesting he appeared less ill at ease than morose katie herself after having been so happy in his coming was now that he was there uncontrollably depressed they talked of a variety of things in the main the things she had been reading but something had happened to that wonderful thing which had grown warm in their hearts as they walked those last two blocks even the things of which they talked had lost their radiance what did it matter whether the universe was wonderful or not if the wonderful thing in ones own heart was to be denied life from the first it had been as if the things of which they talked were things sweeping them together they were in the grip of the power and the wonder of those things wrung by the tragedy of them exalted by the hope in it all by it all united it was as if the whole sea of experience and emotion suffering and aspiration was driving holding them together so it had been all along but not tonight it was now or at least so it seemed to katie as if those forces had let them go what had been as a great sea surging around their hearts was now just things to talk about it left her desolate and as she grew unhappy she forced her gaiety and that seemed to put him the farther away the two different worlds had sent ann away was it in a way she was unable to cope with likewise to send him away watts passed through the hall she saw him glance out at the soldier loweringly and after that he grew more morose almost sullenly so it seemed foolish to talk of ones being free when held by things one could not even see it was just when she was feeling so lonely and miserable she wished he would go that the telephone rang and central told her that chicago was trying to get her it was in the manner of the old days that she turned to him and asked what he thought it could be the suggestion possibility swept them back to the old basis the old relationship katie grew excited unnerved and he talked to her soothingly while she waited for central to call again they spoke of what it probably was her brother was in chicago katie told him and of course it was he and something about his own affairs perhaps he had news of when he would be ordered away yes without doubt that was it but there was a consciousness of dissembling they were drawn together by the possibility they did not mention drawn together in the very thing of not mentioning it as in those tense moments they tried to talk of other things they were keyed high in the consciousness of not talking of the real thing and in that there was suggestion of the other thing of which they were not talking it was all inexplicably related the excitement the tenseness the waiting the dissembling katie had never been more lovely than as she sat there with her hand on the telephone flushed stirred expectant something stealing back to her eyes something both pleading and triumphant in katies eyes just then the man sitting close beside her at the telephone desk scarcely took his eyes from her face when the bell rang again and her hand shook as it took down the receiver he lay a steadying hand upon her arm at first there was nothing more than a controversy as to who had the line in her impatience she rose he rose too standing beside her heres your party said central at last her party was wayne but something was still the matter on the line she could not get what wayne was trying to tell her as her excitement became more difficult to control the man at her side kept speaking to her touching her soothingly at last she could hear wayne you hear me katie oh yes yes what is it i want to tell you it was swallowed up in a buzzing on the line then centrals voice came clear and crisp your party is trying to tell you that ann is found oh gasped katie and lost all color oh katie that was wayne again oh yes wayne i have found her she is well that is will be well she is all right going to be all right ill write it all tomorrow its all over katie you dont have to worry any more the next instant the telephone was upside down on the table and katie sobbing was in his arms he was holding her close and as her sobs grew more violent he kissed her hair murmured loving things suddenly she raised her head lifting her face to his he kissed her and all the splendor of those eons of life was katies then chapter xxxii captain jones had come down from fort sheridan late that afternoon he had been in chicago for several days as a member of a board assembled up at fort sheridan the work was over and he would return to the arsenal that night but he was not to go until midnight he would have dinner and go to the theater with some of the friends with whom he had been in those last few days he wished it were otherwise he was in no mood for them he would far rather have been alone he had a little time alone in his room before dinner and sat there smoking thinking looking at the specks of men and women moving about in the streets way down there below he was in no humor that night to keep to the everlasting talk about army affairs army grievances and schemes all those things of a world within a world treated as if larger than the whole of the world the last few days had shown him anew how their hold on him was loosening there seemed such a thing as the army habit of mind within their own domain was orderliness discipline efficiency subservience to the collectivity pride in it devotion to it many things of mind and character sadly needed in the chaotic world without but army men lacked perspective in isolation they had lost their sense of proportion of relationships they had not a true vision of themselves as part of a whole they had on the other hand unconsciously fallen into the way of assuming the whole existed for the part that they were larger than the thing they were meant to serve their whole scale was so proportioned their whole sense of adjustment so perverted they lacked flexibility openness allsidesaroundness life in the army disciplined one in many things valuable in life it failed in giving a true sense of the values of life he could not have said why it was those inflated proportions irritated him so they lent an unreality to everything they made for false standards and more and more the thing which mattered to him was reality he tried to pull away from the things that thought would lure him into he had not the courage to let himself think of her tonight he feared he had not increased his popularity in the last few days at a dinner the night before a colonel had put an end to a discussion on war in which several of the younger officers showed dangerous symptoms of hospitality to the civilian point of view with the pious pronouncement war was ordained by god but man pays the war tax he had not been able to resist adding and the colonel had not joined in the laugh he found it wearisome the way the army remained so smug in its assumption that god stood right behind it when worsted on economic grounds and perhaps driven also from survival of the fittest shelter a pompous retreat could always be effected to divinity it was that same colonel who earlier in the evening had thus ended a discussion on the unemployed the poor ye have always with you said the colonel delicately smacking his lips over his champagne and gently turning the conversation to the safer topic of high explosives he turned impatiently from thought of it to the men and women far down below he was always looking now at crowds of men and women always hoping for a familiar figure in those crowds with all the baffling unreality there had been around her she seemed to express reality she made him want it she made him want life made him feel what he was missing realize what he had never had it seemed that if he did not find her he would not find life she too had wanted life her quest had been for life that he knew and he wanted to find her that he might tell her he understood tell her what he had never told any one that all his life he too had dreamed of a something somewhere and he was growing the farther apart from his army friends because he had come to think of them as standing between during the summer he had seen in the mornings when they were going to work in the evenings when they were going home he had many times been upon the streets with the people who worked he could not any longer regard the enlargement of the army its organization and problems as the most vital thing in the world it did not seem to him that what the world wanted was a more deadly rifle his lip curled a little as he looked down at the men and women below and considered how little difference it made to them whether rifles were improved or not and so many things did make difference with them they needed improvements on so many things that to be giving ones life to perfecting instruments of destruction struck him as a sorry vocation it made him feel very distinctly apart he knew of no class of men more isolated from the real war of the world than were the men of the army they were tied up in their own war of competition competition in preparedness for war they were frantically occupied in the creation of a frankenstein they would so perfect destruction as to destroy themselves meanwhile their blood had grown so hot in their war of competition that they were in prime condition for persuading themselves a real war awaited them this hot blood found its way into much talk of hardihood and strenuousness vigor martial virtues the steeps of life the romance of history all calculated to raise the temperature of taxpaying blood so successful was the selfdelusion of the militarist that sanity appeared mollycoddelism their greatest fear was fear of the loss of fear and now they were threatened by colorless economists who were mollycoddelistically making clear that the stern reality was the giant hallucination it seemed rather close to farce that night he was going back katie too had gone for the first time that summer neither of them would be there it seemed giving up loneliness reached out into places vast and barren in the thought that both in the things of the heart and the affairs of men he seemed destined to remain apart he looked far more the dreamer than the man of warfare as he sat there his face which was so finely sensitive as sometimes to be called cold saddened with the light of dreams which know themselves for dreams alone that very first night night when she had been so shy he had felt in her that which he called the real thing which he knew for the great thing which had been for him the thing unattainable and with all her timidity aloofness elusiveness he had felt an inexplicable nearness to her he had found out something about the conditions girls had to meet his face hardened then tightened with pain in the thought of those being the conditions ann was meeting he did not believe those conditions would go on many days longer if every man had to see them in relation to some one he cared for the poor ye have always with you might then prove less authoritative less satisfying as the final word and the other conditions things his sort stood for darrett the whole story he had come to loathe the words chivalry and honor and all the rest of the empty terms that resounded so glibly against false standards something was wrong with the world and he could not see that improving a rifle was going to go very far toward setting it right and there was springing up within him even in his loneliness and gloom a passion to be doing something that would help set it right an older officer with whom he had been talking that day had spoken lovingly of his father under whom he had served spoken of his hardihood and integrity his manliness and soldierliness as he thought of it now it seemed to him that just because he was his fathers son had in him the blood of the soldier he should help fight the real battles of the day the long stern battles of peace his father had served faithfully and well he too would like to serve but yesterdays needs were not todays needs nor were the methods of yesterday desirable even possible for today what could be farther from serving ones own day than rendering to it the dead forms of what had been the real service to a day gone by there came a curious thought that to give up the things of war might be the only way to save the things that war had left him that perhaps he could only transmit his heritage by recasting the form of giving looking out across the miles of the citys roofs hearing the rumble of the city as it came faintly up to him watching the people hurrying to and fro there was something puerile in the argument that men any longer needed war to fill their lives must have the war fear to keep them from softness and degeneration thinking of the problems of that very city it seemed men need not worry greatly about having nothing to fight for no stimulus to manhood men and women those men and women passing back and forth and all the millions of their kind they were what counted the things that mattered to them were the things that mattered their needs the things to fight for so he reflected and drifted brushing now this now that in thought and fancy weary lonely he dreamed a dream dream such as the weary and the lonely have dreamed before will dream again too utterly alone he dreamed he was not alone hearthungry he dreamed of love he dreamed of ann he had dreamed of her before would dream of her again dream of her if for nothing else because he knew she had dreamed of love because she made him know that it was there because unreasoningly she made him hope her face that night at the dance that night in the boat when they had talked almost not at all had seemed to feel no need for talking things remembered blended with things desired until it seemed he could feel her hair brush his face feel her breath upon his cheek her arms about his neck vivid as if given by memories instead of wooed from dreams but the benign dream became torturing vision vision of ann with hands held out to him going down her wonderful eyes fearful with terror it was that which dreaming held for him and it seemed that he he and his kind all of those who stood for the things not real were the thing beating ann down dreams gone and vision mercifully falling away there came a yearning just a simple human yearning to know where she was he felt he could bear anything if only he knew that she was safe the telephone rang he supposed it was some of his friends something about the hour for dining he would not answer could not too sick of it all too sore but it kept ringing and habit in the ascendency he took down the receiver it was not a mans voice it was a womans a faint voice he could scarcely catch it and could with difficulty reply he did not know the voice it was too faint too faraway but a suggestion in it made his own voice and hand unsteady as he said yes what is it is this captain jones the voice was stronger clearer his hand grew more unsteady yes he replied in the best voice he could muster yes this is captain jones who is it please there was a silence tell me please he managed to say is it the voice came faintly back why its ann the keenest joy he had ever known swept through him to be followed by the most piercing fear the voice was so faint so unreal what if it were to die away and he would have no way to get it back it seemed he could not hold it for an instant he was crazed with the sense of powerlessness he felt it must even then be slipping back into the abyss from which it had emerged then he fought got himself under command sent his own voice full and strong over the wire as if to give life to the voice it seemed must fade away ann he said firmly authoritatively listen to me no matter what happens no matter whats the matter ive got something you must hear if were cut off call up again will you do that are you listening yes came anns voice more sure ive got to see you you hear what i say its about katie you care a little something for katie dont you ann it was a sob rather than a voice came back to him then tell me where i can find you she hesitated tell me where youre living or where i can find you now tell me the truth ann if you knew the condition katie was in she gave him an address on a street he did not know would you rather i came there or rather i meet you down town just as you say only i must see you tonight i i cant come down town im sick his hand on the receiver tightened his voice which had been almost harsh in its dominance was different as he said then ill come there right away there was no reply but he felt she was still there and ann he said very low and far from harshly i want to see you too there was a little sob in which he faintly got goodbye he sank to a chair his face was buried in his hands it was several minutes before he moved chapter xxxiii children seemed to spring up from the sidewalk and descend from the roofs as his cab after a long trip through crowded streets with which three months before he would have been totally unfamiliar stopped at the number ann had given all the way over he had been seeing children dirty children palefaced children children munching at things and children looking as though they had never had anything to munch at children playing and children crying it seemed the childrens part of town the men and women of tomorrow were growing up in a part of the city too loathsome for the civilized man and woman of today to set foot in he was too filled with thought of ann the horror of its being where she lived to let the bigger thought of it brush him more than fleetingly but it did occur to him that there was still a frontier and that the men who could bring about smokeless cities and odorless ones would be greater public servants than the men who had achieved smokeless powder riding through that part of town it would scarcely suggest itself to any one that what the country needed was more battleships the children still waited as he rang an inhospitable doorbell as interested in life as if life had been treating them well he had to ring again before a woman came to the door with a cup in her hand which she was wiping on a greasy towel she looked very much as the bell had sounded she let him in to a place which it seemed might not be a bad field for some of the armys boasted experts on sanitation it was a place to make one define civilization as a thing that reduces smell several heads were stuck out of opening doors and with each opening door a wave stole out from an unlovely life captain wayneworth jones u s army dressed for dining at a place where lives are better protected against lives was a strange center for those waves from lives of struggle she the girl thats sick the woman demanded in response to his inquiry for miss forrest he replied that he feared she was ill and was told to go to the third floor and turn to the right it was the second door he hesitated coloring would you be so kind as to tell her i am here i think perhaps she may prefer to see me down here the woman stared then laughed she looked like an evil woman as she laughed but perhaps a laughing saint would look evil with two front teeth gone well we aint got no parlor for the young ladies to see their young men in she said mockingly and if you climbed as many stairs as i did i beg your pardon said he and started up the stairway on the second floor were more waves from lives of struggle the matter would be solemnly taken up in congress if it were soldiers who were housed in the illsmelling place evidently congress did not take women and children and disabled civilians under the protecting wing of its indignation wet clothes were hanging down from the third floor they fanned back and forth the fumes of cabbage and grease he grew sick not at the thing itself but at thought of its being where he was to find ann though the fact that he was to find her made all the rest of it the fact that people lived that way even the fact of her living that way things that mattered but dimly as he looked at the woman in greasy wrapper who was shaking out the wet clothes he had a sudden mocking picture of ann as she had been that night at the dance the womans manner in staring at him as he knocked at anns door infuriated him but when the door was opened by ann he instantly forgot all outside he closed the door and stood leaning against it looking at her for the moment that was all that mattered and in that moment he knew how much it mattered had mattered all along even how ann looked was for the moment of small consequence in comparison with the fact that ann was there but he saw that she was indeed ill worn feverish you are not well were his first words gently spoken she shook her head her eyes brimming over he looked about the room it was evident she had been lying on the bed i want you to lie down he said his voice gentle as a womans to a child you know you dont mind me i come as one of the family he helped her back to the bed smoothed her pillow covered her with the miserable spread ann hid her face in the pillow sobbing he pulled up the one chair the room afforded laid his hand upon her hair and waited his face was white his lips trembling its all over now he murmured at last its all over now she shook her head and sobbed afresh his heart grew cold what did she mean a fear more awful than any which had ever presented itself shot through him but she raised her head and as she looked at him he knew that whatever she meant it was not that what is it about katie she whispered why ann cant you guess what it is about katie didnt you know what katie must suffer in your leaving like that i left so she wouldnt have to suffer well you were all wrong ann you have caused us but as looking into her face he saw what she had suffered he was silenced she was feverish her eyes were large and deep and perilously bright her temples and cheeks cruelly thin but what hurt him most were not the marks of illness and weakness it was the harassed look fear fear that thing so invaluable in building character thought of the needlessness of it wrung from him ann how could you why i thought i was doing right she murmured i thought i was being kind he smiled faintly sadly at the irony and the bitter pity of that but how could you think that he pressed not that it matters now but i dont see how you could she looked at him strangely do you know he nodded then dont you see i left to make it easy for katie he thought of katies summer well your success in that direction was not brilliant he said with his old dryness her eyes looked so hurt that he stroked her hand reassuringly as he would have stroked worths had he hurt him and as he touched her it was a hot hand he touched it struck him as absurd to be quibbling about why she had gone she was there he had found her that was all that mattered he became more and more conscious of how much it mattered he wanted to draw her to him and tell her how much it mattered but he did not dared not and how did you happen to be so unkind as to call me up ann he asked with a faint smile i wanted i wanted to hear about katie and i wanted her eyes had filled her chin was trembling i was lonesome i wanted to hear your voice his heart leaped for the moment he was not able to keep the tenderness from his look and i knew you were there because i saw it in the paper a woman brought back some false hair to be exchanged i sell false hair said ann with a wan little smile and unconsciously touching her own hair and what she wanted exchanged though we dont exchange it was wrapped up in a newspaper and as i looked down at it i happened to see your name wasnt that funny very humorous he replied almost curtly i had been sick all day oh for lots of days but i was trying to keep on i had lost two other places by staying away for being sick and i didnt dare just didnt dare lose this one you dont know how afraid you get how frightened you are when youre afraid youre going to be sick the fear sick fear that fear of sickness can bring that was in her eyes as she talked of it suddenly infuriated him he did not know what or whom he i was furious at but it was on ann it broke he rose overturning his unsteady chair as he did so and seeking command looked from the window which looked down into a squalid court the wretchedness of the court whipped his rage well for gods sake he burst forth what did you do it for of all the unheard of outrageous unpardonable what did you mean turning savagely upon her by selling false hair why i sold false hair said ann a little sullenly so i could live well didnt you know he demanded passionately that you could live with us she shook her head i didnt think i had any right to after what happened he came back to her ann he asked gently havent you a right to if we want you to she looked at him again in that strange way are you sure you know very sure he answered briefly and do you mean to say you would want me anyhow she whispered he turned away that she might not see how badly and in what sense he wanted her his whole sense of fitness his training was against her seeing it then the pause the way she was looking at him when he turned back to her made restraint more and more difficult but suddenly she changed her face darkening as she said smolderingly no im not that weak if i cant live ill die other people make a living other girls get along katie would katie could do it she sat up he could see the blood throbbing in her neck and at her temples she was gripping her hands she looked so frail so helpless but katie is strong ann he said soothingly yes in every way and im not she turned away her face twitching why i seem to be just the kind of a person that has to be taken care of he did not deny it filled with the longing to do it its its humiliating he would at one time have supposed that it would be should be would have held to the idea that every man and woman ought be able to make a living that there was something wrong with them if they couldnt but not after the things he had seen that summer the something wrong was somewhere else and yet you dont know ann was saying brokenly how hard it is you dont know how many things there are she turned to him impetuously i want to tell you then maybe it will go i couldnt tell katie but i dont know i dont know why but i could tell you anything he nodded not cleareyed and took one of her hands and stroked it her cheeks grew more red her eyes glitteringly bright you see its men things like thats what makes it hard for girls he pressed her hand more firmly though his own was shaking katie told you katie must have told you about the first of it she faltered he drew in his breath sharply and held it for an instant and after that she turned upon him passionately do they know does it make a difference he did not get her meaning for an instant and when he did it brought the color to his face he had always been a man of great reserve but ann seemed unconscious this was the reality that realities make he shook his head no you only imagine no i dont imagine they pretend pretend they know he gritted his teeth so those were the things she had had to meet they lie he said briefly bluff and for an instant he covered his eyes with her hand you see after after that she went on i couldnt go back to the telephone office i dont know that i can explain why but it seemed the one thing i couldnt do so oh i did several things was in a store and then a girl got me on the stage in the chorus of daiseymaisey i thought perhaps i could be an actress and that being in the chorus would give me a chance she laughed bitterly there are lots of silly people in the world arent there was her one comment on her mistake that night the last night she told it in convulsive little jerks the manager said something to me he pretended and when he saw how frightened i was and how i loathed him it made him furious and he said things vowed things and he kissed me and oh he was so terrible his face his lips she hid her face rocking back and forth he sat on the bed beside her put his arm around her as he would around katie or worth holding her tenderly protectingly soothingly his own face white biting his lips he vowed things he claimed i knew i couldnt stay with the company i was even afraid to stay until it was over that night i had a chance to run away oh i was so frightened she kept repeating i was so frightened i cant explain it youd have to see him his lips his thick loose awful lips ann he whispered please dear dont talk about it dont think about it but i want it to go away i dont want to be alone with it i want somebody to know i want you to know all right he murmured all right i want to hear his whole body was set for pain he knew must come anns eyes were full of terror that terror that lives after terror the anguish of terror remembered its awful to be alone with awful thoughts she whispered to be shut in with something youre afraid of i know i know he soothed her but youre going to tell me tell me and then youll never be alone with it again ive been afraid so much she went on sobbingly alone so much with things that frightened me that night i was alone all alone and afraid you see i went and went and went just to be getting away and at last i was out in the country and then i was afraid of that i went in something that seemed to be a barn hid in some hay he gripped her arm as if it were more than he could stand his face was colorless i almost went crazy why i think i did go crazy with fear being alone being afraid he looked away from her it seemed unfair to her to let himself see her like that her face distorted unlovely in the memory of it when it came daylight i went to sleep and when i woke up when i woke up she was laughing and sobbing together and it was some time before he could quiet her when i woke up another man was bending over me an old man so old so oh i suppose it was just that he was surprised at finding me there but i thought i hadnt got over the night before so again i went just went just to get away and that was when i saw it was life id have to get away from that there wasnt any place in it for me that it meant being alone afraid that it was just that those thick awful lips that old mans eyes oh no no not that she was fighting it with her hands trying to push it away it took both tenderness and sternness to quiet her so i hurried on she told it in hurried desperate way as if fearful she would not get it all told and would be left alone with it to find a way a place i just wanted to find the way the place before anything else could happen i thought all the people who looked at me knew i thought there was nothing else for me i thought there was something wrong with me and when i remembered what i had wanted i hated hated them i saw water a bridge on the bridge i looked down i was going to but i couldnt because a man was looking up at me i hated him too she paused though ive thought of it since it was a queer look i believe that man knew and wanted to help me but i didnt want to be helped nothing could help i just wanted to get away have it over so i hurried on across your island though i didnt know just looking for a place a way just to have it all over she changed on that relaxed her eyes closed to have it all over she repeated in a whisper she opened her eyes and looked up at him doesnt that ever seem to you a beautiful thing his eyes were wet not any more he whispered not now then again i saw water the other side of the island she went back to it with an effort exhausted i ran i wanted to get there have it all over before anything else could happen i couldnt look but i kept saying to myself it would only be a minute only a minute then it would be all over not so bad as having things happen being alone afraid she shuddered drew back living it realizing it her visioning realizing had gone on beyond her words beyond the events she was shuddering as if the water were actually closing over her but again she was called back by katies voice and that look he felt he should not be seeing went as a faint smile formed on her lips then katie katie calling to me dear katie pretending i didnt want to go i thought it was just something else and oh how i wanted to get it all over she sobbed but i saw it was a girl sick i wasnt able to help going and then well you know katie how she fooled me and saved me she looked up at him again the suggestion of a smile on her colorless lips was there ever anybody in the world so wonderful so funny as katie but at first i couldnt believe in her i thought it must be just something else she stopped looking at him why i think it wasnt till after i met you i felt sure it couldnt be his arm about her tightened he drew her closer to him he was shaken by a deep sob and so she rested lax murmuring about things that had happened sometimes smiling faintly as she recalled them the terror had gone as if as she had known telling it to him had freed her that twisted unlovely look which he had tried not to see loving her too well to wish to see it had gone she was worn but lovely she was resting at peace and so many minutes passed when she would not speak resting rescued and then she would whisper of little things that had happened and smile a little and seem to drift the farther into the harbor of security into which she had come he saw that exhausted protected comforted she was going to fall asleep his heart was all tenderness for her as he held her adoring her sorrowing over her guarding her i havent really slept all summer she murmured at last and after a few minutes her breathing told that sleep had come but when in trying to unfasten her collar he longed to be doing some little thing for her comfort he took his hand from hers she started up in alarm and he had to put it back reassuring her telling her that she was not alone that nothing could ever harm her again an hour passed and in that hour things which he would have believed fixed loosened and fell it was all shaken the whole of his thinking it could never be the same again old things must go new things come watching ann yearning over her sorrowing adoring he saw life as what life had done to her saw it as the thing she had found he watched the curve of her mouth her beautiful bosom rising and falling as she slept the lovely line of her throat the blood throbbing in her throat her long lashes upon her cheek that loveliness beauty that sweetness and tenderness and what it had met she so exquisitely fashioned for love needful of it so perfect so infinitely to be desired and cherished and what she had found he writhed under a picture of that old man bending over her of that other man bully brute thick awful lips snatching at her as a dog at meat and then still another man that first man darrett his friend his sort the man who could so skillfully use the lure of love to rob life as he thought of him his charm cleverness how that too had been pitted against her starved then offered what she would have no way of judging close to her loveliness conscious of her warmth her breath the superb curves of her lovely body thinking of what darrett had found taken what he had left her to there were several minutes when his brain was unpiloted a creaking ship churning a screaming sea and now had it killed it in her taken it if he were to kiss her in the way he hungered to kiss her would it wake nothing more than that sick terror in her wonderful eyes that thought became as a band of hot steel round his throat was it gone how could she be sleeping that way with her hand in his his face so close to her if there remained any of that lifelonging that had been there for darrett to find life grew too cold too gray and misshapen in that thought to see it as life it could not be it was only that she was exhausted and her trust in him at least there was that then he would make her care for him by caring for her caring for her protectingly tenderly surrounding her with that sea of tenderness that was in his heart for her life would come back he would woo it back and no matter how the flame in his own heart might rage he would wait upon the day when he could bring the love light to her eyes without even the shadow of remembering of fear so he yearned over her sorrowing hoping and life was to him two things what life had done to ann what life would be with ann he wanted to let himself touch his lips lightly to her temple so close to him but he would not fearing to wake the fear in her vowing to wait till love could come through a trust that must cast fear forever from the heart passion melted to tenderness the tenderness flooding him in thought of the love he would give her that same night he had her taken to a hospital it was the only way he could think of for caring for her and she was far enough from well to permit it he left her there again asleep and cared for then returned to his hotel and telephoned katie it was past daylight before sleep came to him chapter xxxiv once again katie was donning the dress which had the colors of the sea she was wearing it this time not because she must get the poor old thing worn out but because she had been asked to wear it by request she was saying to herself with a warm smile as she shook out its folds as nora was fastening it for her she saw her own face in the mirror and tried to twist it about in some way it seemed she would have to make some explanation to nora for looking like that it had been a day of golden october sunshine without and within katies heart a day of such sunshine as all her years of sunshine had never brought she had not felt like playing golf or like reading about evolution body and mind were filled with a gladness all their own and she had taken a long walk in and out among the wooded paths of her beautiful island and had been filled with thoughts of many beautiful and wonderful things of the past she had thought and of the future and most of all of the living present the night before and that evening when he was coming to see her again and would have things to tell her he had wanted to tell them then some of the things about himself which he said she must know and which he gave fair warning would hurt her then not tonight she had said and now the happiness was too great filled her too completely and radiantly for her to fear the pain of which she had been warned she was fortified against all pain waynes finding ann seemed to throw the gate to happiness wide open to her giving her not only happiness but the right to it she smiled in thinking how again it was ann who opened a door if ann had never come she would not in this way which had made it all possible have known her man who mended the boats the experience with ann was as a bridge upon which they met it was because of ann they could walk so far along that bridge the adventure and what had come to seem the tragedy of the adventure was over it turned her back to those first days of play the pretending which had led to realizing the fancies which had been paths to realities they would not go on in just that way some other way would shape itself she and wayne would talk of it make some plan for ann she could plan it better after the letter she would have from wayne the next day telling of finding ann it was a new adventure now the great adventure but it was because she had ventured at all that the great adventure was offered her her venturing had led her to the crowds she was not forgetting the crowds she would go back to them it could not be otherwise there was much she wanted to do and so much she wanted to know but she would go back to them happy and because happy wiser and stronger in myriad ways life had beckoned to her promised her as with buoyant step and singing heart she walked sunny paths that golden october afternoon later she had stopped to see mrs prescott and she as she so often did talked of katies mother katie was glad to be talking of her mother and as they also did of her father it brought them very near so close it was as if they could know of the beautiful happiness in their childs heart they talked of things which had happened when katie was a little girl making herself as the little girl so real visualizing her whole life making real and dear those things in which her life had been lived as she thought of it again that night after she was dressed and was waiting hurt did come in the thought of his feeling for the army she must talk to him again about the army make him see that thing in it which was dear to her though could she she did not seem able to tell even herself just what there was in her feeling for the army instead of arguments came pictures pictures and sounds known from babyhood men in uniform her father in uniform upon his horse dress parade the flag the band from reveille to taps things familiar and dear swept before her it would seem to be the picturesque in it which wove the spell but would her throat have tightened those tears be springing to her eyes at a thing no deeper than the picturesque no in what seemed that fantastic setting were things genuine and fine simplicity hospitality friendship comradeship loyalty courage in danger and good humor in petty annoyances those things oh yes together with things less admirable she knew to be there she got out her pictures of her father and mother her father in uniform that gentle little smile on her mothers face she thought of what her mother had endured of what hosts of army women had endured going to outlandish spots of the earth braving danger and doing without cooks she was proud of them proud to be of them she lingered over her fathers picture a soldier perhaps he was of a vanishing order but she hoped it would be long very long before the things to be read in his face vanished from the earth through memories of her father there many times sounded the notes of the bugle now this call now that piercing compelling sounding as motif of his life thing before which all other things must fall away she seemed to hear now the notes of retreat to see the motionless regiment then the evening gun and the band playing the star spangled banner and the flag never touching the ground coming down for the night she answered it in the things it woke in her heart those ideals of service courage fidelity which it had left her she would talk to him to alan absurd she should think it so timidly so close in the big things so strange in some of the little ones about her father and mother to make them real to him would make him see the army differently it hurt her to think of his seeing it as he did hurt her because she knew how it would have hurt them to them it had been the whole of their lives they had not questioned they had served they had given it all they had and that other thing there was to tell her was that too something that would have hurt them she hoped not it seemed she could bear the actual hurt to herself better than thought of the hurt it would have been to them but when the bell rang and she heard his voice asking for her a tumult of happiness crowded all else out she was shyly radiant as she came to him as he looked at her it seemed to pass belief but when he dared and was newly convinced as his arms about her he looked down into her kindling face his own grew purposeful as well as happy more resolute than radiant we will make a life together he said as if answering something that had been in his thoughts we will beat it all down an hour went by and he had not told the story of his life life itself too mysterious too luring too beautiful whenever they came near to it they seemed to hold back as if they would remain as they were then instead they told each other little things about themselves absurd little things drawing near to each other by all those tender little paths of suddenly remembered things and they lingered so as if loving it so it was when katie spoke of her brother that he was swept again into the larger seriousness looking into her tender face his own grew grave you know katie what i told you what i must tell you oh yes said katie there was something wasnt there but she put out her hand as if to show there was nothing that could matter he took the hand and held it but he did not grow less grave katie he asked how much do you really care for the army it startled her stirring a vague fear in her happy heart why i dont know more than i realize i presume she was silent then asked why he did not reply his face had become sober you are thinking she ventured that your feeling for it is going to be hard for me he nodded he was still holding her hand tightly as if to make sure of keeping it you see katie he went on with difficulty i have reason for that feeling what do you mean she asked sharply i have tried not to show you that i knew anything in a personal way about the army her breath was coming quickly her face was strained but after a moment she exclaimed why to be sure you were in the spanish war no said he with a hard laugh i am nothing so glorious as a veteran he felt the hand in his grow cold she drew it away and rose turned away and was picking the leaves from a plant but she found another thing to reach out to well i suppose this she ventured tremulously imploringly you went to west point and were didnt finish no katie he said i never went to west point well then what did you do she demanded sharply he laughed harshly oh i was just one of those fools roped in by a recruiting officer in a gallantlooking white suit you were she faltered in the ranks one of the men the fact that she should be looking like that drove him to add bitterly like watts you know she stood there in silence held the radiance had all fallen from her she was looking at him with something of the woe and reproach of a child for a cherished thing hurt why katie he cried does it matter so i thought it was only when we were in that we were so impossible but she did not take the hands he stretched out she was held it drove him desperate well if thats so if to have been in the army at all is a thing to make you look like that heaven knows he threw in i dont blame you for despising us for fools but i dont know what youll say when i tell you when you tell me what she whispered that i have no honorable discharge to lay at your feet that i left your precious army through the noble gates of a military prison she took a step backward swaying the anguish which mingled with the horror in her face made him cry katie let me tell you let me show you but katie whitefaced was standing erect braced for facing it what for what did you do her voice was quick sharp tenseness made her seem arrogant it roused something ugly in him i knocked down a cur of a lieutenant he said and laughed defiantly you struck an officer i knocked down a man who ought to have been knocked down struck your superior officer katie he cried thats your way of looking at it but let me tell you let me show you but she had turned from him covered her face and before katie there swept again those pictures sounds her fathers voice ringing out over parade ground silent motionless regiment the notes of retreat those bugle notes piercing compelling thing before which all other things must fall away evening gun and lowered flag she lifted colorless face shaking her head katie he cried our life our love our life she raised her hand for silence still shaking her head wont you fight for it he whispered try she kept shaking her head anything else she managed to articulate anything else not this you dont understand cant never would suddenly she cried oh go away for a moment he stood there but her face was locked against appeal colorless unsteady he turned and left her katie put out her hand her father her father in uniform it had been so real it seemed he must be there but he was not there nothing was there nothing at all as the front door closed she started forward but there sounded for her again the notes of the bugle piercing compelling thing before which all other things must fall away taps this time as blown over her fathers grave soldiers heads bowed and tears falling for a fine soldier who would respond to bugle calls no more chapter xxxv paris was in one of her gray moods that january afternoon everything was gray except the humanity emotion never seemed to grow gray in paris from her place by the window in claras apartment katie was looking down into the narrow street the people passing to and fro two men were shaking hands they would stop then begin again they had been doing that for the last five minutes they seemed to find life a very live thing so did the femme de menage and her soldier who also had been standing over there for the last five minutes katie did not want to look longer at the femme de menage and her soldier so she turned her chair a little about and looked more directly at clara clara was in gray mood too only clara differed from the streets in that it was the emotion was gray the robe de chambre was red so were claras eyes its not pleasant katie she was saying having to remain here in paris for these foggy months with all ones friends down on the riviera no said katie grimly lifes hard claras tears flowed afresh ive often thought you were hard katie its because youve never cared youve never suffered katie smiled slightly again looking out the window at the femme and her soldier who were as contented with the seclusion offered by a lamppost as though it were seclusion indeed as she watched them hard did not seem the precise word for something in katies eyes you see katie clara had resumed as if her woe gave her the right to rebuke katie for the lack of woe youve always had everything just the way you wanted it just exactly said katie still looking at the femme de menage your grandfather left you all that money and when you want to do a thing all you have to do is do it what can you know of the real sorrows and hardships of life what indeed responded katie briskly and your heart has never been touched and i dont believe it ever will be clara continued spitefully katie seemed so complacent you have no real feeling youre just like wayne katie laughed at that and looked at clara then laughed again and clara flushed speaking of wayne said katie in offhand fashion hes been made a major she watched clara as she said it there were things katie could be rather brutal about im sure thats very nice said the woman who had divorced wayne yes isnt it and other things are going swimmingly one of those things he used to be always puttering over you may remember clara mentioning from time to time those things he used to be puttering around with has been adopted with a whoop a great fuss is being made over it it looks as though wayne was confronted with something that might be called a future im sure im very glad said clara that somebody is to have something that might be called a future certainly a woman with barely enough to live on isnt in much danger of being confronted with one katie made no apology to herself for the pleasure she took in rubbing it in she remembered too many things too vividly its pretty hard said clara when one has a duty to society and nothing to go on katie was thinking that society must be a very vigorous thing persisting through all the duties people had to it she smiled now in seeing that the thing which had brought her to clara that day was in the nature of a duty to society and that in her case too a duty to society and a personal inclination moved happily together katie was there that afternoon to buy worth so she put it to herself in what clara would have called her characteristically brutal fashion she was sure worth could be had for a price she had that price and she believed the psychological moment was at hand for offering it the reason for its being the psychological moment was that clara wanted to join a party at nice and did not have money enough to buy the clothes which would make her going worth while for there was a man there an american a rich westerner whom claras duty to society moved her to marry that was katies indelicate deduction from claras delicate hints and katie wanted worth it wasnt wholly a matter of either affection or convenience it had to do and in almost passionate sense with something which was at least in the category with such things as duties to society worth seemed to her too fine too real to be reared by a truly feminine woman as clara had been known to call herself claras great idea for worth was that he be well brought up that was claras idea of her duty to society and it was katies notion of her duty to society to save him from being too well brought up the things she had been seeing and suffering in the past year made her feel almost savagely on the subject katie had been there since october clara had magnanimously permitted worth to remain with his aunt kate most of the time with the provision that katie bring him to her as often as she wanted him this was unselfish of clara and cheaper claras alimony was not small but neither were her tastes indeed the latter rose to the proportions of duties to society katie knew it was as such she must treat them in the next half hour she must save the maternal instinct clara was always talking about usually adding that it was a thing which katie of course could not understand by taking it under the sheltering wing of the childs good katie knew just how to reach the emotions which clara had without outraging too much the emotions she persuaded herself she had so she began speaking in a large way of life how hard it was how complicated how they all loved worth and wished to do the best thing for him how she feared it must hurt the childs personality living in that unsettled fashion now under one influence now under another she spoke of claras own future how she had that to think of and how it was hard she be so restricted she drew a vivid picture of what life might be if clara didnt provide for the future she was careful to use no phrase so raw to truly feminine ears as make a good marriage and then rather curtly when it came to it tired of the ingratiating preamble she asked clara what she would think of relinquishing all claim on worth and taking twenty thousand dollars clara tried to look more insulted by the proposition than invited by the sum but katie got a glimmer of that look of greed known to her of old she went on talking she was sure every one would think it beautiful of clara to let worth go to them just because they had a better way of caring for him just because it was for the childs good every one would know how it must hurt her and admire her for the sacrifice and then katie mentioned the fact that the matter could be closed immediately and clara start at once for nice and perhaps that itself would mean something to the future from behind claras handkerchief claras tears were in close relation to claras sense of the fitness of things katie made out that life seemed driving her to this but that it hurt her to think so tragic a thing should be associated with so paltry a sum its my limit said katie shortly take it or leave it amid more sobs katie got that all the jones family were heartless that life was cruel but that she was willing to make any sacrifice for her childs good then ill go down and get him said katie rising claras sobs ceased instantly get who my lawyer i left him down there talking to the concierge katie jones how could you oh she looks like a decent enough woman said katie i dont think it will hurt him any katie you have grown absolutely vulgar and so hard you have no fineness no intuition nothing feminine about you and how dared you bring your lawyer here to me what right had you to assume id do this why i knew you well enough clara to believe you would be willing to do it for your childs good clara looked at her suspiciously and katie hastened to add that she brought him because she wanted to pay ten thousand francs on account and she thought clara might want to get the disagreeable business all settled up at once so she could hurry on to nice before those friends of hers got over to algiers or some place where clara might not be able to go after them clara again looked suspicious but only said it was inconsiderate of katie to expect her to receive a lawyer with her poor eyes in that condition but when katie returned with him claras eyes were a softer red and she managed to extract from the interview the pleasure of showing him that she was suffering as she watched the transaction katie felt a little ashamed of herself not because she was doing it but because she had known so well how to do it but with a grimace she banished her compunctions in the thought of its being for the childs good and hence a duty to society less easy to banish was the hideous thought that she might have been able to get him for less by the time the attorney had gone clara seemed to be looking upon herself as one hallowed by grief she was in the high mood of one set apart by suffering in her eyes was something which she evidently felt to be a look of resignation in her hand something which she certainly felt to be an order for ten thousand francs the combination first amused and then irritated katie it was exasperating to have clara giving herself airs about the grief which was to make such a sorry cut in katies income clara in her mellowed mood spoke of the past why it had all been as it had she was even so purged by suffering as to speak gently of wayne i hope katie yes actually hope that wayne will some time find it possible to care and be happy and when katie thought of how much wayne had cared why he had not been happy it grew more and more difficult to treat clara as one sanctified by sorrow it gave her a fierce new longing for the real the real at all costs a contempt for all that artifice and selfdelusion which made for the things at war with the real she had enough malice to entertain an impulse to strip clara of her complacency take away from her her pleasant cup of sorrow make her take one good look at herself for the woman she was rather than the woman she was flaunting but she had no zest for it what would be the use and after all selfdeception seemed a thing one was entitled to practice if one wished what katie wanted most was to get out into the air chapter xxxvi to get out into the air was the thing she was always wanting in those days or at least for the last two months it had been so at first she had been too wretched to be conscious of needing anything but katie was not built for wretchedness everything in her was fighting now for air what air meant to spirit and body it was in the sense of the spirit that she most of all wanted to get out into the air out into a more spacious country than the world clara suggested out where the air was clear and keen and where there were distances more vast than those which would shut her in for she had looked into a larger country allegiance to the smaller one could not be wholehearted she wondered if it were true she was getting hard something in her did seem hardening at any rate something in her was wanting to fight fight for air fight no matter who must be hurt in the struggle for that bigger country into which she had looked those greater distances more spacious sweeps sometimes she had a sense of being in a close room and nothing in the world was so dreadful to katie as a close room and felt that she had but to open a door and find herself out where the wind would blow upon her face and the door was not bolted it was hers to open if she would there were no real chains there were only dead hands hands which live hands had power to brush away and the room was made close by all those things which they of the dead hands had loved things which they had served things which for them had been out in the open not making the air unbearable in a close room and when she wanted to tell them that she must get out of the room because it was too close for her that she could no longer stay with things which shut out the air it seemed they could not understand for they were dead but they could look at her with love and trust those hands which could have been so easily brushed away as bolts on the door of the room holding the things they had left for her to guard and they were proud and their trusting eyes seemed to say they knew she would not make all their world sorry for them she walked slowly across pont du carrousel watching the people the people going their many ways meeting their many problems wondering if many of them had well loved hands either of life or death as bolts upon the doors which held them from more spacious countries holding them so securely because they could be so easily brushed away it was people people of the crowds who saved her from a sense of isolation her own friends brought for she was always certain that in the crowds was some one else who was wondering longing perhaps a courageous some one who was fighting paris itself had fought was fighting all the time she loved it anew in the new sense of its hurts and its hopes and always it had laughed she felt kinship to it in that seeming so little caring yet so deeply understanding the laughterloving city had paid stern price that its children might laugh it seemed to her sometimes that one could love and hate paris for every known reason but in the end always love for the full measure it gave she stood for a moment looking at the spire of sainte chapelle slender as a fancy yet standing out like a conviction watching the people on the busses the gesticulating crowds blockades of emotion the men on the quai rummaging among the bookstalls for possible treasures left by men who had loved it long before looking at the thanks in stone for yesterdays vision of tomorrow and everywhere cabs as words carrying ideas breathlessly bearing eager people from one vivid point to another in the hurrying highlypitched articulate city it interested her for a time as things that were live always interested katie the citys streets had always been for her as waves which bore her joyously along but after a time perhaps just because she was so live it made her unbearably lonely the things they might do together in paris the things to see to talk about and still filled with her revolt against claras selfdelusions she asked of herself how much the demand of her spirit to soar was prompted by the hunger of her heart to love she could not say she wondered how many of the worlds people would be able to say how many of the spacious countries would have been gained had men been fighting only for their philosophies pushed only by the beating of wings that would soar but did that make the distances less vast less to be desired though visioning be child of desiring was the vision less splendid and was not the desire ennobled her speculations were of such nature as to make her hurry home to see whether there was american mail a certain letter which sometimes came to her was called american mail all the rest of the american mail which reached paris was privileged to be classed with that letter katie had come over in october with her aunt elizabeth who felt the need of recuperation from the bitter blow of her sons marriage katie too felt the need of recuperation she did not say from what but from something that made her intolerant of her aunts form of distress her aunt said that katie was changing growing unsympathetic hard unfeminine she thought it was because she did not marry it would soften her to care for some one was the theory of her aunt elizabeth she had remained in order to be with worth and too because there seemed nothing to go back to mrs prescott had come over to be for a time with a niece who was studying music and she and katie were together now the older woman was beginning to talk of wanting to go back she was getting letters from harry which made her want to see him the letters sounded as though he were in love again and katie was getting letters herself letters to make her want to see the writer thereof they too sounded as if written by one in love with things as regards worth adjusted katie would be free to go with her friend and she was homesick at least that was the noncommittal name she gave to something that was tugging at her heart but go home to what for what her vision had not grown any clearer it was only that the homesickness was growing more acute and that nights mail did not fill her with a yearning to become an expatriate in addition to the american mail there was a letter from ann that evening after worth was asleep and mrs prescott had gone to her room katie reread both letters and a number of others and thought about a number of things wayne had undertaken the supervision of ann in his first letter that unsatisfactory letter in which he gave so few details about finding ann he had said quite highhandedly that he was going to look after things himself i think katie he wrote that with the best of intentions your method was at fault i can see how it all came about but it is not the way to go on it was too unreal the time of makebelieve is over ann is a real person and should work out her life in a real way her own way not following your fancyings she must be helped until she gets stronger and more prepared youve had the thing come too tragically to you to see it just right so im going to step in and i want you to leave things to me so wayne had stepped in and was lending ann the money to study stenography katie had made a wry face over stenography which did not have a dreamlike or an annlike sound but a very waynelike one but had entered no protest at that time she had been too dumbly miserable to enter protest about anything wayne seemed to her curt and rather unfeeling about the whole thing insisting somewhat indelicately she thought on the point that ann be prepared to earn her own living and that there be no more nonsense about her she hoped he was kinder with ann than he sounded in his letters about her ann was in new york wayne had said and katie agreed with him that chicago was not the place for her to start in anew she had gone through too many hard things there and katie was glad for other reasons with wayne in washington she would have no more occasion to be in the middlewest and ann would be too far away in chicago but katie was looking desperately homesick at that thought of having no more occasion to be in the middlewest the man who mended the boats was still out there mending boats and finishing his play which she knew now was to be about the army one reason he had wanted to mend boats there was that he might know some of the men who worked in the shops at the arsenal interested in that relation of labor to militarism for two months katie had heard nothing from him in those first months he too seemed helpless before it seemed to understand that katies feeling was a thing he could not hope to understand much less change then there rose in him the impulse to fight for her against it all stir her to fight katie he wrote in that first letter letter she was rereading that night we have seen two sides of the same thing our two visions experiences have roused in us two very different emotions does that mean it must kill for us what we have said is the biggest emotion experience the greatest joy and brightest hope life has brought us were both bound by it i by the hurt its brought me you by the happiness i by the hate it roused you by the love that lingers round it are we going to make no efforts to set ourselves free are we so much of the past that the institutions of the past and the experiences and prejudices of those institutions can shut us out from the future and from each other katie you have the rich gift of the open mind i dont believe that lastingly theres anything youll shut out as impossible to consider your eyes say it katie say theyll look at everything and just as fairly as they can oh theyre such honest fearless just eyes so wise and so tender and it was i i who love them so brought that awful look of hurt to those wonderful eyes katie i want to spend all of my life keeping that hurt look from those dear eyes youre asked to do a hard thing dear katie its cruel it should be you so hard a thing is asked of asked to look at a thing you see through the feeling of a lifetime as though seeing it for the first time to look at all youve got to push aside things you regarded as fixed i suppose every one has something that to him seems the things unshakable something he finds it terrifying to think of moving all your traditions all your love and loyalty cling round this thing which it seems to you you cant have touched but katie as you read these pages wont you try to think of things not as youve been told they were but just as they seem to you from what you read think of them not in the old grooves but just as it comes in to you as the story of a life youll try to do that for me wont you dear fairminded lovingspirited katie i was a country boy lived on a farm got lonesome thought about things i had nobody to talk to about read things and wanted more things to read part the dreamer and part the great husky fellow wanting life adventure wanting to see things and know things most of all experience things i want to tell you a lot about it sometime i cant let go the idea that there is going to be a sometime just because theres so much to tell if nothing else and katie isnt there something else no way to begin the story of ones life then i went away from home to see the world try my fortune experience adventure that was the call and the very first thing i fell in with that recruiting officer in the white suit i can see just how that fellow looked get every intonation as he drew the glowing picture of life in the army the army sounded good the army was experience adventure with a vengeance a life among men a chance he told me that an intelligent fellow like me would soon be an officer of course i agreed perfectly i was an intelligent fellow impressed with army intelligence in picking me for one why i could see myself as commanderinchief in no time theres the cruelty of it katie the expectation they rouse to get you the contemptuous treatment after theyve got you the difference between the army of the men wanted for the army posters and the army those men find after those posters have done their work remember your telling me about visiting at fort riley when you were quite a youngster the good time you had how gay it was how charming your host was as nearly as i can figure it out i was there at the same time filling the noble office of garbage man now far be it from me believing in the dignity of all labor to despise the office of garbage man i can think of conditions under which i would be quite happy to serve my country in that capacity but having enlisted because of the noble figure of a soldier carrying a flag i grew pretty sore at the damn you weve got you manner in which i was ordered to carry things well not to be too indelicate let us merely say things less attractive than the flag its not having to peel potatoes and wash dishes its seeming to be despised for doing it that stirs in mens hearts the awful soreness that makes them deserters in our regiment men were leaving right along our company had a particularly bad record on desertions our captain a decent fellow was away most of the time and the lieutenant in command was a cur id find a more gentle word for him if i could but i know none such army men talk a great deal about discipline but theres a difference between discipline and bullying this fellow couldnt issue an order without making you feel that difference he had a laugh that was a sneer it wasnt a laugh just a smile a smile that sneered he couldnt pass a crowd of men cutting grass without making their hearts sore i dont say hes the typical army man i dont doubt that there are men high in the army who if all were known would despise him as much as the men in his company did but i do say that if there were not a good many a good deal like him more than fifty thousand young men of america would not have deserted from the united states army in the past twelve years there was a fellow in our company i had been particularly sorry for he wasnt a bad sort at all he was more dazed than anything else didnt understand the army manner the army snobbishness this lieutenant couldnt look at him without making him sullen one day he told him to do a loathsome thing then stood there with that sneering smile watching him do it well he did it all right thats what gets you that powerlessness under what you know for injustice but that night he left i knew he was going he wanted me to go with him i dont know why i didnt i dont blame men for deserting but for my own part it would only be two years more i used to say to myself you got into this youll see it through they caught him brought him back the next day i happened to be there at the time so did our spick and span lieutenant the man who had been caught or boy rather for he was but that was anything but spick and span his clothes were torn and muddy his face dirty and bloody it had been scratched by something he knew what he was in for court martial and imprisonment for desertion we knew what that meant he was a sorry unsoldierly sight gone to pieces unnerved all in his chin was quivering and then the little lieutenant came along starting out for golf he stood in front of him and looked him up and down this boy who had been caught boy who would be imprisoned and as he looked at him he laughed or smiled rather that smile that was a sneer he stood there continuing to smile torturing him with that smile he couldnt do a thing about this boy who was down this fellow who was all in that was when i struck him in the face and knocked him down the penalty for that as i presume i need not tell an army girl is death or such other punishment as a court martial may direct the thing directed in my case was imprisonment at fort leavenworth for five years most of the men in that prison would say give me death id better not say much about it something gets hot in my head when i begin to talk about it if you were with me your cooling hand your steadying eyes i could tell you about it if you were with me i find that a very arresting phrase katie those were black years cruel years years to twist a mans soul they took something from me that will not be mine again i remember your telling how ann said there were things to make perfect happiness forever impossible she was right there are hours that stay i went into the army just an adventurous boy i came from it an embittered man my experience with it made me suspect all of life i was more than unhappy i was sullen i hated and i wanted to get even oh it was a lovely spirit in which i went forth a second time to meet the world i dont know what might not have happened i think i was right in line to become a criminal like so many of the rest of them who have served time at leavenworth i dont suppose the united states has any finer school anywhere than its academy for criminals at fort leavenworth had it not been for a man i met i got a job in a garage i had always been pretty good at mechanical things and knew a little about it and there i met this man and through him came salvation i dont know katie maybe socialism will not save the world i dont see how it can miss it but be that as it may i know it has saved many a mans soul i know it saved mine this fellow an older man with whom i worked talked to me he saw the state i was in won my confidence and got my story and then he began talking to me and gave me books he got me to come to his house instead of the places i was going to saying nothing against the other places but just making his things so much more attractive we used to talk and argue and gradually other things fell away just because there was no room for them you know i had loved books read all i could get but didnt seem to get the right ones well after i had served time breaking clay i didnt care anything about books too sore too dogged too full of hate but the love for the books came back and through the books and through this friend came the splendid saving vision vision of what the world might be world with the army left out with all that the army represented to me vanished from the earth with men not ruling and cursing other men but working together the world for all and all for the world and the thing that saved me was that i saw there was something to work for something to believe in look at think about when old memories of the guard knocking me down with the butt of his gun would tear into my soul and bring me low with the hate they roused and so i began again katie dear that sense of things as they might be that vision taking some of the sting from what i had suffered from things as they were i stopped hating and cursing i began thinking and dreaming there came the desire to know i tore into books like a madman i couldnt go on hating my fellowmen because i was too busy trying to find out about them and so it happened that there were things more interesting to think about than the things i had suffered in the army i was carried out of myself and saved i wish i could talk to some of those other fellows some of those boys who ran away from the army not because they were criminals and cowards but just because they didnt know what to make of things i wish i could talk to some of those men who dug clay with me at fort leavenworth men who went away cursing the government loathing the flag hating all men and who have nothing to take them out of it i wish i could take them up with me to the hilltop and say there dont look at the little pit down below look out look wide katie you arent going to save men by putting them at backbreaking work under brutalized guards you arent going to redeem men by belittling them youre going to save them by making them see and the crime of our whole system of punishments is that it does all in its power not to make them see but to shut them out from seeing in the letters which followed he told her other things things he had done the work he hoped to do what he wanted to do with his life told it with the simplicity of sincerity the fine seriousness untainted with the selfconsciousness called modesty he believed he could work with men things he had already done made him believe he could do more bigger things he wanted to help fight the battles of the people who worked not with any soldier of fortune notion but because he was one of those people because he had suffered as one of those people and believed he saw their way more clearly than the mass of them were seeing it and he wanted to write about men had some reason for believing he could he was hoping that his play would open the way to many other things it looked as though it were going to be put on he told of his feeling for it more than a showing up and a getting even though there is that it will be no prancing steed and clanking saber picture of the army more digging of clay than waving of the flag i see significant things arising from that survival of autocracy in a democracy an interesting study in the bitter things coming out of the relation of the forms and habits of a vanishing order to the aspirations and tendencies of a forming one and in that bending of spirit to form the army codes and standards making for the army habit of mind the army snobbishness and narrowness the things that shape men until a given body of men have particular characteristics particular limitations you said that if you loved them for nothing else you would love army people for their hospitality but in the higher sense of that beautiful word they are the least hospitable of people their latch string of the spirit is not out their minds are tight fixed they have not that openness of spirit and flexibility of mind that make for wider visioning and its not that they havent but why they havent brings one to the vein yes i got the article you sent me written by your army friend eloquent over the splendid things war has done for the human race the great things it has bred in us well if the war virtues arent killed by an armed peace then i dont think we need worry much about ever losing them its the people at war for peace who are going to conserve and utilize for the future the strong and shining things which days of war have left us men who must base their great claim on what has been done in the past are not the men to shape the future or even carry the heritage across the bridge war is now a faithful servant of capitalism its glorious days are over its even a question whether its longer valuable as a servant it may lose its job before its master loses his in any case it goes with capitalism and if the good old war virtues are to be saved out of the wreck its the wreckers will save them which is not what i started out to say this play into which im seeking to get the heart of what ive lived and thought and dreamed is not the impersonal thing this harangue might make it sound i trust its nothing so bloodless as a study of economic forces or picture of the relationship of old things to new its that only as that touches a mans life means something to that life its about the army because this man happens for a time to be in the army its what the army does to him thats the thing though it seems to me a pretty dead thing in these days life itself is a dead thing with you gone from it in the letter she received that night he wrote katie is it going to spoil it for us can it need it we who have come so close have so much are outlived things to push us apart that seems too bitter oh dont think that i dont see the things it would mean giving up the wrench and for what your friends would say at times i wonder how i can ask it hope for it then there lives for me again your wonderful face as it was when you lifted it to me that first time you and i grow bold again i dont say you wouldnt suffer i dont say there wouldnt be hurts big hurts brought by the little things arising from lives differently lived i know there would be times of longing for things gone for the sunny paths for it couldnt be all sunny paths with me katie those years in the dark will always throw their shadow then how dare i loving you laughing splendid you how can i because i believe that you love me remembering that light in your eyes knowing you i dare believe that the hurts would be less than the hurt of being spared those hurts i can hear your friends denouncing me hear their withering arguments and ill own that at times they do wither but katie i just cant seem to stay withered youre such an upsetting person dear katie to both heart and philosophy its not possible to hate a world that katies in world that didnt spoil katie and if there are many of the you oh no other real you but many who awakened can fight as you can fight and love as you can love wouldnt it be a joke on us revolutionists if we were cheated out of our revolution just by the love in the hearts of the katies well nobody would be so happy in that joke as would the defrauded revolutionists you make me wonder katie if perhaps it isnt less the vision than the visioning less the thing seen than that thing of striving to see make me feel the narrowness in scorning the trying to see just because not agreeing with the thing seen sometimes i have a new vision of the world vision of a world visioning of the vision counting less than the visioning those moments of glow bear me to you persuade me that our visions must be visioned together lifes all empty without you the radiance is not there in these days light comes only through dreams and so i dream dreams and see visions dreams of us visions of the years wed meet together and you are not bowed and broken in those visions katie youre very strong and buoyant and always eager for life and always tender no not always tender sometimes fighting telling me i dont know what im talking about its a splendid picture of katie fighting eyes shining cheeks red and then at the very height of her scorn katie happens to think of something funny and she says the something funny in her inimitable way then she laughs and after her laugh shes tender again and says she loves me though still maintaining i didnt know what i was talking about and in the visions there are times when katie is very quiet so still hushed by the wonder of love then katies laughing eyes are deep with mystery katies face seems melted to pure love and from it shines the light that makes life noble in these days of a fathomless loneliness i dare not look long upon that vision do you ever hear a call dear heart a call to a freer country than any country you have known call to a country where the things which bind you could bind no more and if in fancy you sometimes let yourself drift into that other country am i with you there do you ever have a picture of our venturing together into the unknown ways daring suffering rejoicing growing sometimes sunshine and sometimes storm but always open country and everwidening skyline oh katie how splendid it might be she read and reread it dreaming and picturing and at length there settled upon her that stillness that pause before lifes wonder and mystery her eyes were deep the light that makes life noble glorified her tender face she broke from it at last to look for a card they had there giving dates of sailings chapter xxxvii they would get in late that afternoon off on the horizon was a hazy mass which held the united states of america as sometimes the haze of a dream may hold a mighty truth katie and mrs prescott were having a brisk walk on deck they paused and peered off at that mist out of which new york must soon shape itself just off yonders your country katie the older woman was saying soon youll see the flag flying over governors island will it make you thrill it always has replied katie mrs prescott stole a keen look at her seeing that she was not answered they had had some strange talks on that homeward trip talks to stir in the older womans mind vague apprehensions for the daughter of her old friend it did not seem to mrs prescott what she called best that a woman and particularly an unmarried one should be doing as much thinking as katie seemed to be doing she wished katie would not read such strange books she was sure walt whitman for one could not be a good influence what would happen to the world if the women of katies class were to let down the bars she vaguely and uneasily thought it and she was too fond of katie to want her to venture out of shelter well it ought to katie dear i dont know who has the right to thrill to it if you havent doesnt it make you think of those sturdy forefathers of yours who came to it long ago when it was an unknown land and braved dangers for it your people have always fought for it katie there would be no country had not such lives as theirs been given to it katie was peering off at the faint outlines which one moment seemed discernible in the mist and the next seemed but a phantom of the imagination as the truth which is to stand out bold and incontestable may at first suggest itself so faintly through the dream as to be called a phantom of the imagination true she said and fine and equally true and fine that theres just as much to fight for now as there ever was oh yes murmured mrs prescott we must still have the army of course the fightings not in the army said katie to herself rather than to her friend the older woman sighed im afraid i dont understand you katie after a pause she added sadly something seems happening in the world that is driving older people and younger people apart katie turned to her affectionately oh no but more affectionately than convincingly mrs prescott looked at her wistfully so strong so buoyant so fearless and so fine she felt an impulse to keep her though for what from what she would not have been able to say katie dear she said gently i get a glimpse of what you mean in there still being things to fight for you mean new ideas new things i know youre stirred by something i feel your enthusiasm it shines from your face enthusiasm is a splendid thing in the young katie in any of us new things there always are to fight for of course but dear katie the old things those beautiful old things which the generations have left us things fought for tested mellowed by our fathers and mothers and their fathers and mothers arent they a little too precious too hardly won too freighted with memories to be lightly cast aside katie looked at her friends face itself so incontestably the gift of the generations it made vivid her own mothers face and that her own struggle i dont think she said tremulously that you are justified in saying they are lightly cast aside they were silent looking off at the land which was breaking through the mists responding in their different ways to the different things it was saying to them it seems to me mrs prescott began uncertainly that it is not for women particularly women to whom they have come as directly as to you and me to cast them off at all we seem to be in strange days days of change to me katie it seems that the work for the women our women is in preserving those things dear things left to us holding them safe and unharmed through the destroying days of change she had grown more sure of herself in speaking the last came staunchly it seems she added that it would be enough for us to do and the thing for which we are best fitted katie was silent she could not bear to say to her friend her mothers friend that it did not seem to her enough to do or the thing for which she was best fitted she was the less drawn to the idea because of a face she could see down in the steerage face of an immigrant girl who was also turning eager face not to the land for which her forefathers had fought but to that which would be the land of her descendants she had seen her there before face set toward the land into which she was venturing she had become interested in her she seemed so eager and thinking back to the things seen in her search for ann other things she had been reading of late a fear for that girl pity for her more than that sense of responsibility about her grew big in katie it made it seem that there was bigger and more tender work for women than preserving inviolate those things women had left as she drew near the harbor of new york she was more interested in the united states of america as related to that girl than as associated with her own forefathers who had fought for it long before and as it had been for them to fight in the new land it seemed that it was for her not merely to cherish the fact of their having fought not holding that as something apart something setting her apart but to fight herself not under the old standards because they had been their standards but under whatsoever standards best served the fight it even seemed that the one way to keep alive those things they had left her was to let them shape themselves in whatever form the new spirit new demands would shape them mrs prescott was troubled by her silence katie dear she said you come of a long line of fine and virtuous women in these days when everything seems attacked endangered that at least that thing most dear to women most indispensable must be held inviolate and by such as you wherever your ideas may carry you dont let that be touched remember that the safety of the world for women goes if you do it turned katie to ann safety she had found then again she looked down at the immigrant girl beautiful girl that she was and wondered and feared she turned to mrs prescott with a tear on her eyelashes and a smile a little hard about her lips would you say that fine and virtuous women have succeeded in keeping the world a perfectly safe place for women mrs prescott was repelled but katie did not notice she was looking with a passionate sternness off at new york let anything be touched she spoke it with deep feeling i say nothings too precious to be touched if touching it can make things better mrs prescott had gone below katie feared that she had wounded her and was sorry she had not been able to help it the face of that immigrant girl was too tragically eager they were almost in now close to governors island over which the flag was flying it gripped her as it had never done before boy she said to worth perched on a coil of rope beside her theres your country country your people came to a long time ago and fought for and some of them died for and youll grow up worth and youll fight for it not the way they fought it wont need you to fight for it that way they did that and now thats done but there will be lots for you to fight for too harder fights to fight i think than any they fought youll fight to make it a better place for men and women and little children to live in not by firing guns at other men worth but by being as wise and kind and as honest and fair as you know how to be it was her voice moved him it had been vibrant with real passion but after a moment the face of the child of many soldiers clouded but wont i have any gun tall aunt kate he asked wistfully she smiled at the stubborn persistence of militarism im afraid not dear i hope were not going to have so many guns when youre a man but worth if you dont have the gun other little boys will have more to eat there are lots of little boys and girls in the world now havent enough to eat just because there are so many guns wouldnt you rather do without the gun and know that nobody was going hungry i guess so faltered worth striving to be magnanimous but looking wistful but aunt kate he pursued after another silence whats father making guns for if there arent going to be any katies smile was not one worth would be likely to get much from ask father she said rather grimly i think he might find the question interesting worth continued solemn but aunt kate wont there be anybody tall to kill why honey she laughed does it really seem to you such a gloomy world world in which there will be nobody to kill dont worry dear the worlds getting so interesting were going to find lots of things more fun than guns maybe said worth if i dont have a gun youll get me an airship aunt kate maybe so she laughed the man that mends the boats says ill have an airship before i die aunt kate she gave worth a sudden little squeeze curiously jubilant at the possibility of his having an airship before he died and she viewed the city of skyscrapers adoringly tenderly mistily oh worthie she whispered isnt it lovely to be getting home chapter xxxviii she found it difficult to adjust herself to the ann who had luncheon with her the next day the basis of their association had shifted and it had been too unique for it to be a simple matter to appear unconscious of the shifting she had not seen ann since the day they said the cruel things to each other wayne had thought it best that way saying that ann must have no more emotional excitement she had acquiesced the more readily as at the time she was not courting emotional excitement for herself and now the ann sitting across the table from her was not the logical sequence of things experienced in last summers search for ann she was not the sum of her thoughts about ann visioning through her not the expression of the things ann had opened up it was hard indeed to think of her as in any sense related to them at all suggestive of them an ann radiating life rather than sorrowing for it was an ann she did not know just what to do with and there was something disturbing in that rich glow of happiness she did not believe that anns something somewhere could be stenography yet her radiance the deep warm quality of it suggested nothing so much as a something somewhere attained it seemed to katie rather remarkable if the prospect of soon being able to earn her own living could make a girls eyes as wonderful as that there was no mistaking her delight in seeing katie and worth and a sense of the old relationship was there deep and tender sense of it but something had gone from it or been added to it it was not the all in all truth was ann was more at home with her than she was with ann after luncheon they went up to katies room for a little chat katie talked about stenography and soon came to be conscious of that being a vapid thing to be talking about what pretty furs she said in the pause following the collapse of stenography that seemed to mean more yes arent they lovely responded ann with happy enthusiasm they were my christmas present from wayne the way ann said wayne in the old days she had never said it at all led instantly though without her knowing by what path to that strange fear of hers in finding ann so free from fear ann was blushing a little the wayne had slipped out so easily and so prettily he thought i needed them its often so cold here you know why certainly one needs furs said katie firmly as if there could be no question as to that katies great refuge was activity she got up and began taking some dresses from her trunk then just to show herself that she was not afraid that there was nothing to be afraid about she asked lightly what in the world brings wayne up to new york so much ann was affectionately stroking her muff she looked up at katie shyly but with a warm little smile there was a pause which seemed to hover over it before she said softly why katie i think perhaps i bring him up to new york everything in katie seemed to tighten close up she gave her most cobwebby dress a perilous shake and said in flat voice waynes very kind im sure ann did not reply she was still stroking her muff that smile which hovered tenderly over something had not died on her lips it made her mouth her whole face softly lovely it did something else made it difficult for katie to go on pretending with herself though she made a last stand it was a dreadful state of affairs she told herself if ann had been so absurd as to fall in love with wayne wayne just because he had been kind in helping her get a start she followed that desperately oh yes waynes really very kind at heart and then of course hes always been especially interested in you because of me ann looked up at her the look kept deepening sank far down beneath katies shallow pretense well katie ann began with the gentle dignity of one whom life has taken into the fold as long as we seem into this id rather go on wayne said i was to do just as i liked about telling you just as it happened to come up but i think you ought to know he is not interested in just the way you think she paused before it then said softly with a tremulous pride he cares for me katie and wants to marry me he cant do that he cant do that it came quick and sharp quick and sharp as fire answering attack she sat down the sharpness had gone and her voice was shaking as she said you certainly must know ann that he cant do that so they faced each other and the whole of it it was all opened up now its very strange to me katie added hotly that you wouldnt know that it seemed impossible for ann to speak the attack had been too quick and too sharp evidently too unexpected i told him so she finally whispered told and told him so that you would feel this way that it couldnt be he said no that you felt all differently after last summer and i thought so too your letters sounded that way katie covered her eyes for a second it was too much as if the things she was feeling differently about were the things she was losing and when you want to be happy ann went on its not so hard to persuade yourself be persuaded she stopped with a sob i know that was wrung wretchedly from katie and since since i have been happy let myself think it could be it just hasnt seemed it could be any other way so i stopped thinking hadnt been thinking took it for granted again it wrung from katie the this time unexpressed admission that there was nothing much easier than coming to look upon ones happiness as the inevitable and wayne kept saying ann went on sobs back of her words that all human beings are entitled to work out their lives in their own way you believed that he said and i i thought you did too your letters no said katie bitterly what i believed was that i was entitled to work out my life in my own way wayne got his life mixed up with mine the laugh which followed them was more bitter more wretched than the words she had persuaded herself the more easily that she was entitled to work out her life in her own way because she had assumed wayne would be there to stand guard over the things left from other days he was to stay there fixed leaving her free to go she could not have explained why it was that the things she had been thinking did not seem to apply to wayne the thing grew to something monstrous there whirled through her mind a frenzied idea as to what they would do about sending major barrett a wedding announcement other things whirled through her mind as jeers jibes they came a laugh behind them a something somewhere was very commendable while it remained abstract having a fine large understanding about ann had nothing to do with having ann for a sisterinlaw calls were less beautiful when responded to by ones brother this and this tore an ugly wound was what came of helping people in their quests for happiness it was followed by a frantic longing to be with mrs prescott in the shelter of her philosophy hugging tight those things left by the women of other days frightened outraged her impulse was to fly back to those well worn ways of yesterday but that was running away ann was there ann with the radiance gone though for just that moment less stricken than defiant there was something of the cunning of the desperate thing cornered in the sullen flash with which she said you talked a good deal about wanting me to be happy used to think i had a right to be when it was captain prescott it was unanswerable the only answer katie would be prepared to make to it was that she didnt believe all things considered it was a thing she would have said but doubtless people lost nice shades of feeling when they became creatures at bay fighting for life and seemingly one would leave nothing unused i want you to know katie that i paid back that money the missionary money you made me feel that it wasnt right that i that i ought to pay it back i earned the money myself some work there was for me to do at school i wanted to to buy a white dress with it ann was sobbing but i didnt i sent back the money katie was wildly disposed to laugh she did not know why after having worried about it so much anns having paid back the missionary money should seem so irrelevant now but she did not laugh for ann was looking at her as pleadingly as appealingly as worth would have looked after he had been bad and was trying to redeem it by being good with a sob ann hid her face against her muff seeing her thus katie made cumbersome effort to drag things to less delicate less difficult ground ann dear she began i oh im so sorry about this but truly ann you wouldnt be at all happy with wayne ann raised her face and looked at her with something that had a dull semblance to amusement you see katie staggered on wayne hasnt a happy temperament hes morose queer it wouldnt do at all ann because it would make you both wretchedly unhappy she found anns faint smile irritating i ought to know she added sharply for ive lived in the house with him most of my life you may have lived in the house with him katie gently came anns overwhelming response youve never understood him katie openly gasped but some of her anger passed swiftly into a wondering how much truth there might be in the preposterous statement wayne as immune was another idea jeering at her now and that further assumption which had been there all the while though only now consciously recognized that waynes knowing anns story made ann to wayne impossible living in the same house with people did not seem to have a great deal to do with knowing their hearts wayne ann had resumed in voice low and shaken with feeling has the sweetest nature of any one in this world hes been unhappy just because he hadnt found happiness if you could see him with me katie i dont think youd say he had an unhappy nature or worry much about our not being happy katie was silent driven back vanquished less by the words than by the light they had brought to anns face and what she had been wanting had thought she was ready to fight for was happiness for every one of course i know ann said that thats not it that light had all gone from her face it was twisted as by something cruel blighting as she said just above a whisper theres no use pretending we dont know what it is she turned her face away shielding it with her muff it was all there right there between them opened live throbbing all that it had always meant all that generations of thinking and feeling had left around it and to katie held hard it was true all too bitterly true that she came of what mrs prescott called a long line of fine and virtuous women in her misery it seemed that the one thing one need have no fear about was losing the things they had left one but other things had been left her the war virtues the braving and the fighting and the bearing hardihood unflinchingness unwhimperingness those things fought within her as she watched ann shaken with the sobs she was trying to repress well at least she would not play the cowards part with it she brought herself to look it straight in the face and what she saw was that if she could be brave enough to go herself into a more spacious country leaving hurts behind she must not be so cowardly so ignobly inconsistent as to refuse the hurts coming to her through others who would dare through the conflict of many emotions out of much misery she at last wrenched from a sore heart the admission that wayne had as much right to be free as she had that if ann had a right to happiness at all and she had always granted her that she had a right to this it was only that now it was she who must pay a price for it and perhaps some one always paid a price ann ann looked up into katies colorless twitching face i hope you and wayne will be very happy it came steadily and with an attempted smile the next instant she was sobbing but trying at the same time to tell ann that sisters always acted that way when told of their brothers engagements chapter xxxix she did not see her brother until evening katie he demanded sharply have you been disagreeable to ann she shook her head i havent meant to be wayne her face was so wretched that he grew contrite youre not pleased why wayne you can scarcely expect me to be wholly pleased can you but you always seemed to understand so well i he paused in that constraint there so often was between them in things delicately intimate ive never told you katie how fine i thought you were so big about it its not so difficult said kate with a touch of her old smile to be big about people who arent marrying into the family it seemed that he too was not above cornering her you know katie it was your attitude in the beginning that just dont bother calling my attention to that wayne she said sharply please credit me with the intelligence to see it for myself then she went right to the heart of it oh wayne think of major barretts knowing the dull red that came quickly to his face told how bitterly he had thought of it though he only said quietly damn barrett but you cant damn him suppose you were to be stationed at the same place he laughed shortly well that at least is something upon which i can set your fears at rest she looked up quickly what do you mean i mean katie that my army days are over she stared at him i dont understand you it shouldnt be so difficult to comprehend i have resigned my commission wayne she asked slowly what do you mean just what i say that i have resigned my commission that i am out of the army it made it seem that the whole world was whirling round and round and that there was nothing to take hold of but you cant do that why your whole life is there friends traditions work future not my future he said briefly his calm manner made it the more bewildering wayne i dont see how you can in such a light manner give up such a big thing he turned upon her in manner less calm what right have you to say that it is done in a light manner the words had a familiar sound and she recalled them as like something she had said to mrs prescott the day before just the day before when she had been so sure of things and of herself but where is your future then wayne she asked appealingly we know dont we how hard it is for army men to find futures as civilians im going into the forest service katie never could tell why for the moment it should have antagonized infuriated her that way so thats it thats what got a poetic notion and i suppose she laughed scornfully youre going into the ranks what is it they call them rangers starting in at your age with your training to work from the bottom up is that it no he replied coldly that is not it you have missed it about as far as you could i have no such picturesque notion i am doing no such quixotic thing i value my training too highly for that it should be worth too much to them i dont even scorn personal ambition or the use of personal pull so you see im a long way from a heroic figure i know ive a brain that can do a certain type of thing i know im well equipped well so far as the equipment goes my country did it for me and i mean to give it back only ive got to do it in my own way why katie he resumed after a pause i never was more surprised in my life than to find you so out of sympathy with this i knew what most people would think of it but i quite took it for granted that you would understand it seems a little hard replied katie with a tearful laugh to understand the fine things other people do and wayne im so afraid it will lead to disappointment arent you idealizing this forest service remember freds tales of how its almost strangled by politics and you know what that means let us not forget martha matthews it was a relief to be laughing together over a familiar thing martha matthews was the daughter of a congressman from somewhere katie never could remember whether it was texas or wyoming she had been asked to take her up at one time when the army appropriation bill was pending and marthas father did not seem to realize that the country needed additional defense but when martha discovered that army people were perfectly fascinating and so hospitable marthas parent suddenly awakened to the grave dangers confronting his land katie had more than once observed a mysterious relationship between the fact of the army set being fashionable in washington and the fact that the country must be amply protected further remarking that army people were just clever enough to know when to be fascinating no he came back to it in seriousness i dont think i have many illusions i know its far from the perfect thing but i see it as set in the right direction it seems to me that that in itself ought to mean considerable its the best thing i know of for what i have to offer then i want to get out of cities for awhile get ann away from them he paused over that and fell silent osborne offered me a job he came back to it with a laugh seemed to think i was worth a very neat sum a year to his company but that was scarcely my notion in fact i doubt if i would have so much confidence in the forest service if it werent for his hatred of it you can judge a thing pretty well by the character of its enemies then im enough the creature of habit to want to go on in a service im schooled to that thing of the collectivity but ill be happier in a service that despite the weak spots in it is in harmony with the big collectivity rather than hopelessly discordant with it and perhaps it needs some more or less disinterested fellows to help fight for it he added with a touch of embarrassment as if fearing to expose himself he had come close enough to selfbetrayal for katie despite her fear and confusion to feel proud of him as he looked then wayne she asked have you felt this way a long time out of sympathy with the army he did not at once reply thinking of the night he had sat beside ann night when the whole world was shaken and things he had regarded as fixed loosened and fell just how much had been loosening before that some he knew just how much would have more or less insecurely held its place had it not been for that night he was not prepared to say even to himself longer than i knew i think he came back to katie one night last fall i went to a dinner and they drank our toast he repeated it very slowly my country may she always be right but right or wrong my country i used to have the real thrill for that toast that night it almost choked me that right or wrong is a spirit i can thrill to no longer im more interested in getting it right though ill own it terrified me just as it seems to you to feel it slipping from me recently i had occasion to go up to west point and i spent a whole day deliberately trying to get back my old feeling for things the whole business that we know so well and that i used to love so much and in a way i could but as for something gone that day up at the point was one of the saddest of my life i still loved the trappings they still called to me but i knew that for me the spirit was dead oh i have no sensational declarations to make about the army i wouldnt even be prepared to say what i think about disarmament its more complex than most peace advocates seem to see i only know that the armys not the thing for me i cant go on in it simply because my feeling for it is gone he had been speaking slowly and seriously his head was bent now he looked up at her it was at the close of that day day up at west point that i resigned my commission and if you had seen me that night katie i doubt if you would reproach me with doing it lightly the marks of struggle had come back to his face with the story of it they told more than the words forgive me she said in her impetuous way no i didnt know how awful it is wayne that we dont know about each other she was forced to turn away but after a moment controlled herself and turned back to add wayne dear i think youre right im proud of you oh im entitled to no halo he hastened to say its the fellow who would do it without an income might be candidate for that but you would do it without an income wayne she insisted warmly i dont know how can i tell whether i would or not and youll be good to ann he took advantage of her mood to press as though that were the one thing she could do for him you know how much she needs you katie i shall certainly want to be good to ann she murmured though i dont think she needs me much any more something about her went to his heart why katie we all need you she shook her head there were tears but a smile with them not much wayne not now im not indispensable though pray why should one wish to be anything so terrifying as indispensable will you take worth she asked after a little while he goes with you and ann we want him and katie we want you were to go to colorado and fight the water barons he laughed arent you coming with us she shook her head not just now i want to flit round in the east a little first be gay renew my youth she laughed choking a little she drew him to talk of his hopes ill fess up katie he said when warmed to it by her sympathy that i fear i do have rather a poetic notion about it i want to do something something that will count something set in the direction of the future and i like the idea of going back to that old frontier place where i was born and where mother went through so much and where father fought and because of which he died and serving out there now in a way that is just as live just as vital as the way he served then he paused they were both thinking of their father and mother of how they might not have understood of the sadness as well as the triumph there is in change that tug at the heart that must so often come when the new generation sees a little farther down the road than older eyes can see the ache in hearts left behind when children of a new day are called away from places endeared by habit into the incertitude and perhaps the danger of ways unworn life seems too fine a thing katie to spend it making instruments of destruction more deadly its not a very happy thought to think of their being used and its not a very stimulating one to think of their not being in either case it doesnt make one too pleased with ones vocation and life seems a big enough thing he added a little diffidently to try pretty hard to get ones self right with it he did not understand the way katie was looking at him as she replied yes wayne i know that ive been thinking that myself something moved her to ask wayne do you think you would have done it if it had not been for ann i think he replied quietly that possibly that is still another thing i have to thank her for his face and voice gave katie a sharp sense of loneliness that loneliness which came in seeing how poorly she had understood him how little people knew each other they talked of a number of things before he suddenly exclaimed oh katie i must tell you that fellow whats his name mann the mythical being known as the man who mends the boats is a fellow youll have to avoid should you ever see him again which of course is not likely she had turned and was looking out at the lights in the street below yes who do you suppose the scoundrel is im sure i dont know she faltered a military convict attacked an officer served time at leavenworth katie was intent upon the lights down below and what do you suppose he was prying around the island for im sure i have no idea she managed to say going to write a play a play about the army now what do you think of that darrett found out about it oh just the man you see to write a play about the army and some sensationalists here are going to put it on its the most damnable insolence i ever heard of they ought to stop it oh i dont know said katie still absorbed in the cabs down below a man has a right to use his experiences in a play well a fine view hell give of it its the most insufferable impertinence i ever knew of she turned around to ask oddly why wayne why all this heat youre not in the army any more well dont you think im not of it when an upstart like that turns up to rail at it but how do you know hell rail oh hell rail all right i know his type but well see to it that its pretty generally understood its military life as presented by a military convict perhaps you can trust him to make that point clear himself said katie rather dryly the coward the cur she turned upon him hotly look here wayne i dont know why youre so sure you have a right to say that id like to know why i havent attacked an officer without the slightest provocation whatsoever some kind of a hotheaded taking sides with a deserter i believe it was i suppose this remarkable play is to be a glorification of desertion he laughed well said katie with an unsteady laugh perhaps there are worse things to glorify than desertion he stared at her come now katie you know better than that but katie was looking at him strangely wayne she said quietly youre a deserter yourself he flushed but after an instant laughed really katie you have a positive genius for saying preposterous things in which there may occasionally lurk a little truth you are deserting why arent you i call that about as close to rot as an intelligent person could come he replied hotly im resigning my commission its perfectly regular yes being an officer and a gentleman you can resign your commission and have it perfectly regular being that same officer and gentleman you never were mugged treated as a prospective criminal no four thousand posters bearing your picture will now be sent broadcast over the country no fifty dollars is offered lean detectives for your capture youre in no chance of being thrown into prison and have your government do all in its power to wring the manhood out of you oh no an officer and a gentleman you resign your commission and go ahead with your life but youre leaving the army arent you deserting it and why because you dont like the spirit of it and yet though youre too big for it though its time for you to desert youre enough bound by it not to let the light of your intelligence fall for one single second on the question of desertion she had held him he made no reply looking in bewilderment at her red cheeks and blazing eyes suddenly her face quivered wayne she said i dont use the term as a hard name im not using it in just its technical sense our army sense but maynt desertion be a brave thing a fine thing to desert a thing weve gone beyond to have the courage to desert it and walk right off from the dead thing to the live thing oh dont mind my calling you a deserter wayne she added her eyes full of tears for the truth is id like to be a deserter myself but perhaps one deserter is enough for a family and you beat me to it she laughed and turned back to the cabs he wanted to go on with the argument show her what it was in desertion that army men despised make the distinction between deserting and resigning but the truth was he was more interested in the things katie had said than in the things which could be called in refutation and katie puzzled him her heat feeling not only astonished but worried him a little she was standing there now beating a tattoo on the window pane he wondered what she was thinking about the experience as to ann revealed katie to him as having thought about things he would not have dreamed she was thinking about what in the world did she mean by saying shed like to be a deserter herself one of her preposterous sayings but it was true that considerable truth had often lurked at the heart of katies absurd way of talking watching her he was drawn to thought of her attractiveness and that made him wonder whom katie would marry he had always been secretly proud of his sisters popularity it seemed she should make a brilliant marriage live brilliantly it was the thing to which she was adapted katie was unique distinctive secretly unadmittedly he was very ambitious for her and with a little smile he considered that seemingly katie was just shrewd enough to be ambitious for herself she had steered her little bark safely past the place where she would be likely to marry a lieutenant was she heading for a general so he reflected with humor and affection watching katie beat the tattoo on the window thought of what some one had said of her as the army girl suggested something that changed his mood bringing him suddenly to his feet katie he demanded how much did you ever talk to this fellow you dont think do you that he was trying to get you for his army girl or some such rot if i thought that you dont think do you katie that that was what he was trying to work you for katie suddenly raised her hands and pushed back her hair for the minute covering her eyes no wayne she said i dont think that was what he was trying to work me for and unable to bear more she told him that she was very tired and asked him to go chapter xl katie jones was very gay that winter she made her home at her uncles near washington though most of the time she was in washington itself with various cousins and friends there were always people wanting katie especially that winter when she had such unfailing zest for gayety they wondered that she should not be more broken up at her brothers absurd move in quitting the army just at the time the army offered him so much she seemed to take it very easily though katie was not one to take things hard too light of spirit for that and they wondered about his marriage to a girl whom nobody but katie knew anything about katie seemed devoted to her and happy in the marriage why naturally i am pleased she said to a group of army people who were inquiring about waynes bride she is my best friend the girl i care most about major darrett was one of the group some one turned to him and asked if he had met her when she visited katie at the arsenal the summer before he replied that he had had that pleasure and that she was indeed beautiful and very charming katie hated him the more for having to be grateful to him she knew that he was sorry for her and grew more and more gay she could not talk of it so was left to disclaim tragedy in frivolity it was royally disclaimed there were a few serious talks with older army men men who had known her father and who were outraged at waynes leaving the army when he was worth so much to it and it to him in her efforts to make them see she was forced to remember what the man who mended the boats said of their lack of hospitality they were unable to entertain the idea of there being any reason for a mans leaving the army when he was being as well treated in it as wayne was katies explanations only led them to shake their heads and say poor wayne it was impossible to bury certain things in her for those were the things she must use in defending wayne and in defending him especially to her uncle she was forced to know how far those things were from being decently prepared for burial she was never more gay than after one of her defenses of her brother the winter had passed and it was late in april not unlike that may day just the year before when she had first seen her sisterinlaw try as she would she could not keep her thoughts from that day and all that it had opened up she had received a letter from her sisterinlaw that morning it was hard to realize that the writer of that letter was the ann of the year before her thoughts of ann led seductively to the old wonderings which ann had in the beginning opened up she wondered how many of the people with whom things were all wrong people whom good people called bad people were simply people who had been held from their own she wondered how many of those good people would have remained good people had life baffled them as it had some of the bad people the people whom circumstances had made good people were so sure of themselves she had observed that it was from those who had never sailed stormy waters came the quickest and harshest judgments on bad seamanship in heavy seas ann had met helen and did not seem to know just what to think about her shes nice katie she wrote but i dont understand her very well she has so many strange ideas about things wayne thinks you and she would get on famously she doesnt seem afraid of anything and wants to do such a lot of things to the world im afraid im selfish im so happy in my own life its all so wonderful that i cant get as excited about the world as helen does and yet ann would not have found the world the place she had found it were it the place helen would have it but ann had found joy and peace safety and was too happy in her own life to get excited about the world and thought helen a little queer that was anns type and that was why there were anns ann was radiant about the mountains and their life in them helen said it about right katie theyre hard on the hair and the skin but good for the soul they would be for the summer in one of the most beautiful mountain towns of colorado and wanted katie to come and bring worth wayne had consented to leave him for a time with katie at their uncles that katie knew for a concession received for staying in new york with ann until after her marriage she believed she would go she was so tired of zelda fraser that she would like to meet helen and she would like the mountains perhaps they would do something for her soul if she had not danced it quite away she was getting very wretched about having to be so happy all the time she was on her way to zeldas that afternoon zelda having asked her to come in for a cup of tea and a talk a whiff of some new scandal she supposed that was the basis of most of zeldas talks though possibly she had some things to tell about harry prescotts approaching marriage to caroline osborne katie had been asked to be a bridesmaid at that wedding while we have known each other but a short time caroline had written in her too sweet way i feel close to you katie because it was through you harry and i came together then whom would we want as much as you and as it is to be something of an army wedding may i not have you whom harry calls the most bully army girl he ever knew mrs prescott had also written katie the glad news saying she was happy believing caroline would make harry a good wife katie was disposed to believe that she would and was emphatically disposed to believe that mr osborne would make harry a good fatherinlaw katies knowledge of army finances led her to appreciate the value of the right fatherinlaw for an officer and gentleman who must subsist upon his pay but she had made an excuse about the wedding in no mood to be a bridesmaid especially to a bride who would enter the bonds of matrimony on the banks of the mississippi just opposite a certain place where boats were mended she walked on very fast toward zeldas trying to occupy the whole of her mind with planning a new gown but zelda had more tender news to break that day than that of a new scandal katie she approached it in zeldas own delicate fashion what would you think of major darrett and me joyriding through life together i approve of it said katie with curious heartiness some joyride dont you think i can fancy laughed katie that it might be hard to beat i think she added that hes just the one for you to marry and i further think zelda that youre just the one for him to marry zelda looked at her keenly no slam on either party on the contrary a sort of doubleacting approval she turned it with a laugh then as long as your approval has a back action so to speak i cop you out right now katie for a bridesmaid dont said katie quickly no zelda im not suitable why not oh too old and worn she laughed bridesmaids should be buds showing up the fullblowness of the bride dont you think it so you hastened to get me come now katie you know very well why i want you why wouldnt i want you anyhow she exposed it father wants you father thinks youre so nice and respectable katie and so for that matter she added does my chosen joyrider im not so sure of his being particularly impressed with my respectability replied katie hes always been quite dippy about you katie i dont know how i ever got him zelda spoke feelingly of the approaching nuptials of her old school friend cals considerable of a prissy but take it from me harry prescott will see that all fathers money doesnt pour into homes for the friendless so theres something accomplished heaven help the poor fellow who must live on his pay sighed zelda piously major darrett too was to be congratulated on his fatherinlaw just the fatherinlaw for a man ambitious to become military attache it was nice katie told herself as she walked away to know of so many weddings she insisted upon asserting to herself that she was glad all her friends were getting on so famously though if zelda persisted she would have to go west earlier than she had planned she could not regard anns sisterinlaw as suitable person for attendant at major darretts wedding that would be a little too much like playing the clown at a masked ball the image was suggested by seeing one of those grotesque figures across the street he was advertising some approaching festivity with the clown was a monkey he put the monkey down on the sidewalk and it danced obediently in just the place where it was put down suddenly it seemed to katie that she was for all the world like that monkey dancing obediently in the place where she was put down not asking about the before or after just dutifully being gay that monkey did not know the great story about monkeys doubtless he was even too degraded by clowns to yearn for a tree he only danced at the end of the string the clown held all else shut out she shutting out the before and after was that pathetically festive little monkey and society was the clown holding the string the whole of it advertising the tawdry thing the clown called life only she knew that there were trees she had danced frantically in seeking to forget them but the string pulled by the clown fretted her more and more she could not make clear to herself why it had seemed that if wayne were to be free she could not be it was as if all the things she had worked out for herself had been appropriated by her brother everybody could not go into more spacious countries there were some who must stay behind and make it right for the deserters waynes marrying ann had turned her back to familiar paths it had terrified her there seemed too much involved too little certainty as to where one would find ones self if one left the wellknown ways she had been put in the position of the one hurt just when she had been steeled to bring the hurt it gave her a new sense of the hurts uncertainty as to the right to deal them and probably no monkey would dance more obediently than the monkey who had run away and been frightened at a glimpse of the vastness of the forest she would have to remain and explain wayne because she felt responsible about wayne it was her venturings had found what had led wayne to venture and in the end go how could she outrage the army as long as wayne had done so so it had seemed to katie in her hurt and bewilderment and the bewilderment came chiefly because of the hurt it appalled her to find it did hurt like that but it was spring and she knew that there were trees she paused and watched a gardener removing some debris that had covered a flower bed it was spring and there were new shoots and this gardener was wise and tender in taking the old things away that the new shoots might have air katie could see them there and tender green of them as he lifted the old things away that the growing things might come through the gardener did not seem to feel he was cruel in taking the dead things away as a good gardener he would scout the idea of its being unkind to take them away just because they had been there so long what did that matter the wise gardener would scornfully demand when there were growing things underneath pushing their way to the light and if he were given to philosophizing he might say that the kindest thing even to the dead things was to let the new things come through thus life would be kept and all the life that had ever been upon the earth perpetuated vindicated glorified it seemed to katie that what life needed was a saner gardener not a gardener who would smother new shoots with a lot of dead things telling how shoots should go she drew a deep breath lifted her face to the sky and knew knew that she herself had power to push through the dead things seeking to smother her knew that if she but pushed on they must fall away because it was life was pushing them away she walked on slowly breathing deep and swinging along in the april twilight she had a sense of having already set her face toward a more spacious country and of knowing that it had been inevitable all the time that she should go the delay had been but the moments panic her life itself mattered more than what any group of people thought about her life spring and new life upon the earth it was that life itself not the philosophy men had formulated for or against it was pushing the dead things away it was not even arrested by the fear of displacing something she had held herself back for so long that in the very admission that she longed to see him there was joy approaching the sweetness of seeing him a long time she walked in the april twilight knowing that it was spring and that there was new life upon the earth harry prescott would be married within two weeks it seemed nothing was so important as that she witness that ceremony dear harry prescott who would be married on the banks of the mississippi close by a certain place where boats were mended chapter xli it was hard for katie to contain her delight in waynes generosity when she found he had left his launch with captain prescott now wasnt that just sweet of father she exulted to worth as they walked together down to the little boat house worth was more dispassionate y es but why wouldnt he aunt kate where would he take it well but its just so nice dearie that its here you going out in it he demanded katie looked around some soldiers and some golfers in the distance but like the day ann had come upon the island no one within immediate range watts says shes running like a bird aunt kate somebody was out this morning and somebodys going again this afternoon maybe she wont be here for them to take you going to take it aunt kate he pressed excitedly well i dont just know worth she looked up the river she could see a part of the little island where she had once pulled in to ask about the underlying principles of life but not being able to see the other side of it how could she be sure whether a launch ride was what she wanted or not father says we mustnt go in it alone aunt kate shall i see if we can get watts n o thats not exactly the idea said aunt kate stepping into the launch goin aunt kate why i dont know i thought id just sit in it a little while so worth joined her for the delightful pastime of just sitting in it for a little while id rather like to find out whether its in good condition she turned to worth appealing it seems we ought to be able to tell father whether theyre taking good care of it doesnt it worth i guess ill go and get watts i dont know why but i dont seem able to get up a great deal of enthusiasm for that idea her fingers were upon the steering wheel longingly eyes too were longing suddenly she started the engine well just run round the head of the island she said so they started up the river the river as blue and lovely as it had been that day a year before when she had cheated it and had begun to see that life was cheating her worth she asked what is there on the other side of that little island why aunt kate why on the other side of it is the man that mends the boats oh that so funny i never thought of that but i suppose she began again he wouldnt be very likely to be there mending boats now why yes aunt kate he might be you heard anything about him worth yes sir watts says he has cut him out he says hes on to him that must be a bitter blow said aunt kate watts getting on to one and cutting one out watts say anything about whether he was still mending boats she asked in the offhand manner people adopt for vital things why i guess he is cause he made a speech last week oh there was a whole lot of men and he just sowed seeds of discontentment such a busy little sower murmured aunt kate lovingly she knew that he was there or at least had been there the week before for just as she was leaving her uncles she had received a note from him they had not been writing to each other since the brief letter she had sent him the day after receiving the announcement of her brothers engagement this note had been written to tell her no special thing simply because he said after trying his best for a number of weeks he was not longer able to keep from writing he wrote because he couldnt help it he had determined to love her too well to urge her to do what knowing it all she evidently felt could not hold happiness for her but the utter desolation of life without her had crumbled the foundation of that determination in the note he said that his boatmending days were about over they would not have lasted that long only he had had no heart for other things but the letter gave katie heart for other things its unmistakable wretchedness made her superbly radiant why worthie she exclaimed just see here heres the very place where we landed that other time oh yes aunt kate its still here she smiled he could not have done better had he been trying now i wonder if i could make that landing again i was proud of the way i did that before i dont suppose i could do it again that baited him oh yes i guess you could aunt kate you just try it she demonstrated her skill and then they once more enjoyed the delightful pastime of just sitting in the launch katies eyes were misty her lips trembled to a tender smile as she finally turned to him worth dear will you do something for your aunt kate sure i will aunt kate suddenly he guessed it want me to get the man that mends the boats she nodded ill try and get him for you aunt kate try pretty hard worthie he started but turned back whatll i tell him aunt kate the smile had lingered and the eyes were wonderfully soft just then tell him im here again and want to find out some more about the underlying principles of life the now what is it aunt kate well just say life she laughed tremulously lifell do she found it hard to keep from crying there had been too much it had been too long it was not with clear vision she looked over at the big house where harry prescotts wedding feast would be served on the morrow it seemed that about half of her life had passed before worth came back alone pretense fell away didnt you get him why aunt kate theres another man there but dont you feel so bad aunt kate he hastened we will get him cause that other man is going to tell him oh he then he is here oh yes hes here hes just over at the shop i see said aunt kate very much engaged with something she appeared to think was trying to get in her eye but worth she asked when she had blinked the gnat away what did you tell this other man why i just told him told him you was here and wanted the other man that mended the boats the first man the big man i said he knows who i mean i should hope so she murmured but what did you tell him i wanted to see him for she asked suddenly apprehensive worth had sat down and begun upon a raft why i just told him told him you had come to find out some more about life worth told that to a strange man but i guess he didnt know what i meant aunt kate hes one of those awful dumb folks that talk mostly in foreign languages i think hes some kind of a french pole or something she breathed deeper oh well perhaps ones confidences would be safe with a french pole so he knows you want him aunt kate but he dont know just what you want him for yes thats quite as well i think said aunt kate the other half of her life had almost passed when again there were footsteps very hurried footsteps these were it was not the french pole though some one who did not seem at home with the english tongue some one who stood there looking at her as if he too wanted to cry worth was the selfpossessed member of the party hello there he said its been a long time since we saw you aint it it seems to me to have been a yes a long time replied the man who mended the boats never taking his eyes from katie saying nothing more he pulled in her boat secured it held out his hand to help her out forgot to let go the hand when her feet were upon firm earth acted worth thought as though he thought somebody was going to hurt her a steamboat was coming down the river and worth a much interested worth the man who mended the boats did not seem to find his surroundings all he could ask i want to show you this island he began its really quite a remarkable island you know ive been wanting to show it to you theres a stone over here quite quite an astonishing stone and a flower queer really an astounding flower i dont believe you ever saw one like it pooh said worth starting on ahead i bet ive seen one like it say ill tell you what ill bet you ill bet you two dollars and a quarter you cant get that raft done before we get back well ill just bet you two dollars and a half that i can its a go and aunt kate and the man who mended the boats were off to find the astonishing stone and the astounding flower worth calling after them now you try to keep him aunt kate keep him as long as you can it was after she had succeeded in keeping him long enough for considerable headway to have been made in raftconstruction that he exclaimed katie will you do something for me her eyes were asking what there could be that she would not do for him then laugh katie oh if you could know how ive longed to hear you laugh again she did laugh but a sob overtook the laugh then laughed again and ran away from the sob but the laugh was sweeter for the sob you will laugh katie wont you he asked with an anxiety that touched deep things why therell be days and days when i shant do anything else then her laughing eyes grew serious though just a little differently i think ive heard the world sobbing you know but a world that is sobbing needs katies laughing he drew her to him with something not unlike a sob i need it i know there was a wonderful sense of saving herself in knowing again that the world was sobbing what she could have borne no longer was drowning the worlds sobs in the worlds hollow laughter katie he cried after more time had elapsed without finding either the astonishing stone or the astounding flower heres a little sunny path i want you to walk in it laughingly he pushed her over into the narrow strip of sunshine where there was just room for katies feet but katie shook her head what do i care about sunny paths if i must walk them alone and laughing too but with a deepening light in her eyes she held out her hand to him but it was such a narrow sunny path there was not room for two so katie made room for him by stepping part way out of the sunshine herself smiling but eyes speaking for the depth of the meaning she said id rather be only half in the sunshine than be be what katie he whispered be without you katie he asked passionately you mean that if walking together we cant always be all in the sunshine the thing that matters said katie is walking together over roads where there might be no sunshine rough steep roads perhaps whatever kind of roads they may be said katie with the steadiness and the fervor of a devotee repeating a prayer they stood there as shadows lengthened across sunny paths thinking of the years behind and the years ahead now speaking of what they would do now folded in exquisite silences and after the fashion of happy lovers who must hover around calamities averted he exclaimed suppose ann had never come it sent her heart out in a great tenderness to ann ann out in her mountains and happy nor was the tenderness less warm in the thought that ann would join with wayne and the others in deploring ann who was within now would katie knew grieve over her going without but that was only because ann did not wholly understand everything the matter with everybody was just that they did not wholly understand she grew tender toward all the world there rose before her vision of a possible day when all would understand when none would wish another ill or work another harm when war and oppression and greed must cease not because the laws forbade them but because mens hearts gave them no place i see it she whispered unconsciously her face was touched with the fine light of visioning see what dear katie take me in the world when love has saved it she remembered their old dispute and her arms went about his neck as she told him again why tis love must save the world he held her face in his two hands as if he could not look deeply enough and as he looked into her eyes a nobler light was in his own as it has saved us he whispered they grew very still hushed by the wonder of it in their two hearts there seemed love enough to redeem the world
