introduction the discovery and subsequent publication of two manuscripts left in the possession of my grandfather has led to a considerable amount of speculation as to their authenticity and authorship the manuscripts consisted of one made in my grandfathers hand and taken down from the mysterious captain bastable whom he met on rowe island in the early years of this century and another apparently written by bastable himself which was left with my grandfather when he visited china searching for the man who had become he was told a nomad of the timestreams these very slightly edited texts were published by me as the warlord of the air and the land leviathan and i was certain that it was the last i should ever know of bastables adventures when i remarked in a concluding note to the land leviathan that i hoped una persson would some day pay me a visit i was being ironic i did not believe that i should ever meet the famous chrononaut as luck would have it i began to receive visits from her very shortly after i had prepared the land leviathan she seemed glad to have me to talk to and gave me permission to use much of what she told me about her experiences in our own and others timestreams on the matter of oswald bastable however she was incommunicative and i learned very quickly not to pump her most of my references to him in other books were highly speculative in the late spring of shortly after i had finished a novel and was resting from the consequent exhaustion which had left my private life in ruins and my judgment considerably weakened i had a visit from mrs persson at my flat in london i was in no mood to see another human being but she had heard from somewhere that i was in distress and had come to ask if there was anything she could do for me i said that there was nothing time and rest would deal with my problems she acknowledged this and with a small smile added but eventually you will need to work i suppose i said something selfpitying about never being able to work again and she did not attempt to dissuade me from the notion however she said if you do ever happen to feel the urge ill be in touch curiosity caught me what are you talking about i have a story for you she said i have plenty of stories i told her but no will to do anything with them is it about jherek carnelian or the duke of queens she shook her head not this time everything seems pointless i said she patted me on the arm you should go away for a bit travel perhaps and when you come back to london ill have the story waiting she promised i was touched by her kindness and her wish to be of use and i thanked her as it happened a friend fell ill in los angeles and i decided to visit him i stayed far longer in the united states than i had originally planned and eventually after a short stay in paris settled in england for a while in the spring of as una persson had predicted i was of course ready to work and as she had promised she turned up one evening dressed in her usual slightly oldfashioned clothes of a military cut we enjoyed a drink and some general talk and i heard gossip from the end of time a period that has always fascinated me mrs persson is a seasoned timetraveler and usually knows what and what not to tell for incautious words can have an enormous effect either on the timestreams themselves or on that rarity like herself the chrononaut who can travel through them more or less at will she has always told me that so long as people regard my stories as fiction and as long as they are fashioned to be read as fiction then neither of us should be victims of the morphail effect which is times sometimesradical method of readjusting itself the morphail effect is manifested most evidently in the fact that for most timetravelers only forward movement through time is possible backward movement or movement between the various alternative planes is impossible for anyone save those few who make up the famous guild of temporal adventurers i knew that bastable had become a member of this guild but did not know how he had been recruited unless it had been in the valley of the dawn by mrs persson herself i have brought you something she said she settled herself in her armchair and reached down for a black document case they are not complete but they are the best i can do the rest you will have to fill in from what i tell you and from your own perfectly good imagination it was a bundle of manuscript i recognized the hand at once it was bastables good god i was astonished hes turning into a novelist not exactly these are fresh memoirs that are all hes read the others and is perfectly satisfied with what youve done with them he was extremely fond of your grandfather and says that he would be quite glad to continue the tradition with you particularly he says since youve had rather better success in getting his stories published she laughed the manuscript was a sizable one i weighed it in my hand so he was never able to find his own period again or return to the life he so desperately wanted thats not for me to say youll notice from the manuscript that theres little explanation as to how he came to the particular alternative timestream he describes suffice to say he returned to teku benga crossed into yet another continuum and found his way to the airshipyards at benares this time he was reconciled to what had happened and being an experienced airshipman claimed slight amnesia and a loss of papers eventually he got himself a mates certificate though it was impossible for him without impeccable credentials to find a berth with any of the major lines i smiled and hes still haunted by angst i suppose to a degree he has many lives on his conscience he knows only worlds at war but we of the guild understand what a responsibility we carry and i think membership has helped him and ill never meet him its unlikely this stream would probably reject him turn him into that poor creature your grandfather described flung this way and that through time with no control whatsoever over his destiny he has that in common with most of us i remarked she was amused i see youre still not completely over your selfpity moorcock i smiled and apologized im very excited by this i held up the manuscript bastable presumably wants it published as soon as possible why perhaps its mere vanity you know how people become once they see their names in print poor we both laughed at this he trusts you too she continued he knows that you did not tamper with his work and also that he has been of some use to you in your researches as have you mrs persson im glad we enjoy what you do you find my speculations funny i said that too we leave it to your rather strange imagination to produce the necessary obfuscations i looked at the manuscript i was surprised to notice a few peculiar correspondences and coincidences when compared with my grandfathers first manuscript yet bastable appeared not to make some of the connections the reader might make i remarked on it to mrs persson our minds can hold only so much she said as ive mentioned before sometimes we do suffer from genuine amnesia or at least a kind of blocking out of much of our memory it is one of the ways in which we are sometimes able to enter timestreams not open to the general run of chrononauts time makes you forget i said ironically exactly as someone who affects anarchism i said im curious about the references here to kerenskys russia could it be that she stopped me i cant tell you any more until you have read the manuscript a world in which the bolshevik revolution did not take place he hints at it in the other story i had often wondered what the russian empire would have been like in such circumstances for one of my other abiding interests is in the soviet union and its literature which was so badly stifled under stalin you must read what bastable has written then ask me some questions ill answer where i can it is up to you he says how much shape you give it as a professional writer but he trusts you to preserve the basic spirit of the memoir i shall do my best and here for better or worse is oswald bastables third memoir i have done as little work on it as possible and present it to the reader pretty much as i received it as to its authenticity that is for you to judge michael moorcock three chimneys yorkshire england june part one an english airshipmans adventures in the great war of the manner of my dying it was i think my fifth day at sea when the revelation came just as at some stage of his existence a man can reach a particular decision about how to lead his life so can he come to a similar decision about how to encounter death he can face the grim simple truth of his dying or he can prefer to lose himself in some pleasant fantasy some dream of heaven or of salvation and so face his end almost with pleasure on my sixth day at sea it was obvious that i was to die and it was then that i chose to accept the illusion rather than the reality i had lain all morning at the bottom of the dugout my face was pressed against wet steaming wood the tropical sun throbbed down on the back of my unprotected head and blistered my withered flesh the slow drumming of my heart filled my ears and counter pointed the occasional slap of a wave against the side of the boat all i could think was that i had been spared one kind of death in order to die alone out here on the ocean and i was grateful for that it was much better than the death i had left behind then i heard the cry of the seabird and i smiled a little to myself i knew that the illusion was beginning there was no possibility that i was in sight of land and therefore i could not really have heard a bird i had had many similar auditory hallucinations in recent days i began to sink into what i knew must be my final coma but the cry grew more insistent i rolled over and blinked in the white glare of the sun i felt the boat rock crazily with the movement of my thin body painfully i raised my head and peered through a shifting haze of silver and blue and saw my latest vision it was a very fine one more prosaic than some but more detailed too i had conjured up an island an island rising at least a thousand feet out of the water and about ten miles long and four miles wide a monstrous pile of volcanic basalt limestone and coral with deep green patches of foliage on its flanks i sank back into the dugout squeezing my eyes shut and congratulating myself on the power of my own imagination the hallucinations improved as any hopes of surviving vanished i knew it was time to give myself up to madness to pretend that the island was real and so die a pathetic rather than a dignified death i chuckled the sound was a dry death rattle again the seabird screamed why rot slowly and painfully for perhaps another thirty hours when i could die now in a comforting dream of having been saved at the last moment with the remains of my strength i crawled to the stern and grasped the starting cord of the outboard weakly i jerked at it nothing happened doggedly i tried again and again and all the while i kept my eyes on the island waiting to see if it would shimmer and disappear before i could make use of it i had seen so many visions in the past few days i had seen milkwhite angels with crystal cups of pure water drifting just out of my reach i had seen bloodred devils with fiery pitchforks piercing my skin i had seen enemy airships which popped like bubbles just as they were about to release their bombs on me i had seen orangesailed schooners as tall as the empire state building i had seen schools of tiny black whales i had seen rosecolored coral atolls on which lounged beautiful young women whose faces turned into the faces of japanese soldiers as i came closer and who then slid beneath the waves where i was sure they were trying to capsize my boat but this mirage retained its clarity no matter how hard i stared and it was so much more detailed than the others the engine fired after the tenth attempt to start it there was hardly any fuel left the screw squealed rasped and began to turn the water foamed the boat moved reluctantly across a flat sea of burnished steel beneath a swollen and throbbing disc of fire which was the sun my enemy i straightened up squatting like a desiccated old toad on the floor of the boat whimpering as i gripped the tiller for its touch sent shards of fire through my hand and into my body still the hallucination did not waver it even appeared to grow larger as i approached it i completely forgot my pain as i allowed myself to be deceived by this splendid mirage i steered under brooding gray cliffs which fell sheer into the sea i came to the lower slopes of the island and saw palms their trunks bowed as if in prayer swaying over sharp rocks washed by white surf there was even a brown crab scuttling across a rock there was weed and lichen of several varieties seabirds diving in the shallows and darting upwards with shining fish in their long beaks perhaps the island was real after all but then i had rounded a coral outcrop and at once discovered the final confirmation of my complete madness for here was a high concrete wall a harbor wall encrusted above the water line with barnacles and coral and tiny plants it had been built to follow the natural curve of a small bay and over the top of the wall i saw the roofs and upper stories of houses which might have belonged to a town on any part of the english coast and as a superb last touch there was a flagpole at which flew a torn and weatherstained union jack my fantasy was complete i had created an english fishing port in the middle of the indian ocean i smiled again the movement caused the blistered skin of my lips to crack still more i ignored the discomfort now all i had to do was enter the harbor step off onto what i believed to be dry land and drown it was a fine way to die i gave another hoarse mad chuckle full of selfadmiration and i abandoned myself to the world of my mind guiding my boat round the wall i found the harbor mouth it was partly blocked by the wreck of a steamer rustred funnels and masts rose above the surface the water was unclouded and as i passed i could see the rest of the sunken ship leaning on the pink coral with multicolored fish swimming in and out of its hatches and portholes the name was still visible on her side jeddah manila now i saw the little town quite clearly the buildings were in that rather spare victorian or edwardian neoclassical style and had a distinctly rundown look about them they seemed deserted and some were obviously boarded up could i not perhaps create a few inhabitants before i died even a laskar or two would be better than nothing for i now realized that i had built a typical outpost of empire these were colonial buildings not english ones and there were square largely undecorated native buildings mixed in with them on the quay stood various sheds and offices the largest of these bore the faded slogan welland rock phosphate company a nice touch of mine behind the town stood something resembling a small and pitted version of the eiffel tower a battered airship mooring mast even better out from the middle of the quay stretched a stone mole it had been built for enginedriven cargo ships but there were only a few rather seedy looking native fishing dhows moored there now they looked hardly seaworthy i headed towards the mole croaking out the words of the song i had not sung for the past two days rule britannia britannia rules the waves britons never never shall be married to a mermiad at the bottom of the deep blue sea as if invoked by my chant malays and chinese materialized on the quayside some of them began to run along the jetty their brown and yellow bodies gleaming in the sunshine their thin arms gesticulating they wore loincloths or sarongs of various colors and wide coolie hats of woven palmleaves shaded their faces i even heard their voices babbling in excitement as they approached i laughed as the boat bumped against the weedgrown jetty i tried to stand up to address these wonderful creatures of my imagination i felt godlike i suppose and to talk to them was the least after all that i could do i opened my mouth i spread my arms my friends and my starved body collapsed under me i fell backwards into the dugout striking my shoulder on the empty petrol can which had contained my water there came a few words shouted in pidgin english and a brown figure in patched white shorts jumped into the canoe which rocked violently jolting the last tatters of sense from my skull white teeth grinned you okay now sar i cant be i said jolly good sar red darkness came i had set off to sail over a thousand miles to australia in an open boat i had barely managed to make two hundred and most of that in the wrong direction the date was may rd i had been at sea for about a hundred and fifty hours it was three months since the destruction of singapore by the third fleet of the imperial japanese aerial navy the destruction of singapore it had been a utopia of sorts which the japanese destroyed designed as a model for other great settlements which would in the future spring up throughout the east singapores white graceful skyscrapers her systems of shining monorails her complex of smoothlyrun airparks had been lovingly laid out as an example to our empires duskier citizens of the benefits which british rule would eventually bring them and singapore was burning i am probably the last european to have witnessed her destruction after serving on the portuguese aerial freighter palmerin for a couple of months i took several berths for single voyages usually filling in for sick men or men on leave until i found myself in rangoon without any chance of a job i ran out of money in rangoon and was willing to begin any kind of employment even considered enlisting as a private in the army when i was told by one of my bar acquaintances of a mates position which had become vacant the night before chap was killed in a fight in sharis house he said nodding down the street the skipper started the fight hes not offering good money but it could get you somewhere better than rangoon eh indeed hes just over there want to meet him i agreed and that was how i came eventually to singapore though not in the ship on which i had signed a greasy greek merchantman the andreas papadakis from some disgusting cypriot port trading in any marginally lucrative cargo which more fastidious captains would reject had originally been bound for bangkok when her engines had given out during an electrical storm which also affected our wireless telephone we had drifted for two days trying to make repairs aloft and losing two of our crew in the process by the time the old windbag began to sag badly in the middle and drift towards the ground the papadakis was not much suited to rough weather of any kind and could not be relied upon in even a minor crisis the gondola cables and our steering cables both were badly in need of repair and we should have waited our moment and come down over water if we hoped for any chance of landing without serious damage but by now the captain was drunk on retsina and refused to listen to my advice while the rest of the crew a mixed bunch of cutthroats from most parts of the adriatic were in a panic i did my best to persuade the captain to let go our remaining gas but he told me he knew best the result was that we had begun to drop rapidly as we neared the coast of the malay peninsula the andreas papadakis groaning and complaining the whole time and threatening to come apart at the seams she shivered and trembled in every section as the captain stared blearily through the forward ports and began it seemed to me to argue in greek with the powers of fate on whom he blamed the entire disaster it was as if he thought he could talk or soothe his way out of the inevitable fact i kept my hands on the wheel praying to sight a lake or at least a river but we were heading over dense jungle i remember a mass of waving green branches an appalling screech of metal and wood as they met a blow to my ribs which knocked me backwards into the arms of the captain who must have died muttering some wretched cypriot remonstration he saved my life as it happened by cushioning my own fall and breaking his back i came to once or twice while i was being pulled from the wreckage but only really regained my senses when i woke up in st marys hospital changi singapore i had a few broken bones which were mending some minor internal injuries which had been tended to and i would soon be recovered thanks to the airshipmens distress fund which had paid for my medical treatment and the period during which i would recuperate i had been lucky there were only two other survivors five more had died in one of the native hospitals to which they had been taken while i rested somewhat relieved not to be worrying about work and glad to be in singapore where there was every chance of finding decent employment i began to read about the tensions growing between several of the great powers japan was disputing territory with russia the russians even though they were now a republic had almost as much imperial determination as the japs however we knew nothing of the war until the night of february nd the night of the attack by japans third fleet the night when a british dream of utopia was destroyed perhaps forever we were trying to escape what was left of the colony an ambulance ship was moored to an improvised mast and the vessel all but filled the blackened ruined grounds of st marys a huge airship silhouetted against a sky which was ruby red with the flames of a thousand fires the scene was surreal i think of it today as the flight from sodom and gomorrah but in noahs ark tiny figures of patients and staff rushed panicstricken into the vessels swollen belly while everywhere overhead moved monstrous implacable japanese flying ironclads they had come suddenly mindless beasts of the upper regions to seed singapore with their incendiary spawn our resistance had been impotent far away a few searchlight beams wandered about the sky sometimes showing a dense cloud of smoke from which could be glimpsed a section of one of the vast aerial menowar then the three remaining antiaircraft guns would boom and send up shells which either missed or exploded harmlessly against the side of the attacking craft there were several of our monoplanes still buzzing through the blackness at speeds of over four hundred miles an hour firing uselessly into hulls stronger than steel they were picked off by tracer bullets shrieking from armored gungondolas i saw a hover gyro whirl like a frightened humming bird out of the flames and then it too was struck by magnesium bullets and went spinning into the flaming chaos below our ship was not the latest type few hospital ships ever were the cigarshaped hull protecting the gasbags was of strong boronfiberglass but the twotiered gondola below was more vulnerable this gondola contained crew and passenger accommodation engines fuel and ballast tanks and into it we were packing as many human beings as we could i of course almost fully recovered was helping the doctors and medical staff without much hope of the ships being able to get away i helped carry stretchers up one of the two folding staircases lowered from the bowels of the ship this in itself was a hard enough task for the vessel was insecurely anchored and it swayed and strained at the dozen or so steel cables holding it to the ground the last terrified patient was packed in and the last nurses carrying bundles of blankets and medical supplies hurried aboard while airmen unpegged the gangways so they could be folded back into the ship the stairs began to bounce like a cakewalk at a fair as with the riggers i managed to climb into the ship losing my footing several times shaken so much i felt my body would fall to pieces suddenly several incendiary bombs struck the hospital at once the darkness exploded with shouting flame more bombs burst in the grounds but incredibly none hit the airship direct for a moment i was blinded by brilliant silver light and a wave of intense heat struck my face and hands from somewhere above i heard the captain shout let slip even before the gangway was fully raised i clutched and found a handrail dropped the box i had been carrying and desperately tried to grope my way up the few final rungs before i should be crushed by the automatically closing steps my vision returned quickly and i saw the cables lashing as if in fury at having to release their grip on the ship and then i stood on the embarkation platform itself and my immediate danger was past the crash not much later i sighted the large conglomeration of tightly crowded together buildings which was the port of surabaya a busy city of mixed european and malayan architecture it was one of the few big ports to survive the decline of conventional shipping in favor of the airgoing cargo vessels its harbor was still crammed with steamers and the whole place looked unnaturally peaceful in the early morning light i felt an irrational surge of jealousy a desire that surabaya too might oneday experience what singapore had experienced what right had this dirty ugly port to survive when a mighty monument to a humane and idealistic empire had perished in flames i pushed these dreadful ideas from my head in a few more moments we should be crashing into the sea without power of any kind the ship was going to have great difficulty in landing short of the harbor itself the whole vessel suddenly shuddered and i called for the staff to stand by as some patients began to moan questions or whimper in fear the ship turned and began to drift in a clumsy barely controlled maneuver and i lost sight of the town altogether i saw only a stream launch surging over the waves and turning to follow us leaving a white scar in the sea there came a peculiar creaking and groaning from overhead as if some unusual strain had been placed on the gasbags and the hull containing them we began to drop a wailing went up from the patients then and we did our best to reassure them that everything was in order and that soon they would be in safe hospital beds in surabaya i saw the sea shoot up to meet us and then retreat again we began to move in a series of shuddering leaps as if riding a gigantic switchback somewhere a whole collection of crockery smashed to the deck and it was all i could do to hold myself upright by the safety rail and then to my horror i saw the roofs of the city below our gondola was almost scraping the highest of the buildings as we sped over them we had missed the sea altogether and were traveling rapidly inland the captain had left his decision until it was too late i heard the intercom buzz and then came the first officers strained tones a sudden strong following wind had blown up just as we were about to descend and this had completely thrown out everyones calculations the captain intended to try to take the ship right across the island and land in the sea near djogjakarta which was the nearest town we were likely to reach considering the present direction of the wind however a lot of gas had already been valved out and we might not be able to gain enough height in that event we must be prepared for a crashlanding on the ground i well knew what that would mean the ship was considerably overburdened if she fell from the sky to the land there was every chance we should all be killed a patient wakened from sedation by the first officers voice screamed in alarm a nurse hurried to soothe him the ship shivered and her nose came up sharply so that the deck tilted at a steep angle then the nose dipped and a few objects not secured began to slide down towards the bow i jammed my foot against the rail through the ports i saw a dutch flying boat follow us as if trying to make out the reason for our change of plan then perhaps despairing of us it turned back towards the sea surabaya was behind us below us now lay a wide expanse of neat rice paddies rows of tamarind trees and fields of tall sugar cane we were so low that i could make out the heads of peasants looking up at us as our shadow moved across their fields then i was thrown against the rail as a fresh gust of wind caught the ship and slewed round again revealing the kapok plantations on the slopes of javas grim volcanic hillsides i thought we were bound to crash into the hills for they were rising steeply and were beginning to turn into the gray flanks of mountains from some of these drifted wisps of yellowish white smoke instinctively i braced myself but we just managed to cross the first line of mountains and ahead i could see denser clouds of pale gray smoke coiling and boiling like a tangle of lazy serpents the ship jerked her nose up again and we ascended a few feet the damaged tail planes caused us to make a crazy zigzag over the landscape and i could see our elongated shadow moving erratically below then our motion steadied but it seemed inevitable to me that we must soon crash into one of the many semiactive volcanoes which dominated javas interior i was unprepared for the next lurch and i lost my grip on the rail as we started to go up rapidly clambering to my feet i saw that the ship had released her water ballast it sprayed like a sudden rainstorm over the dusty slopes of the mountains perhaps after all we would make the sea on the other side but a few moments later the captains voice came through the loudspeakers it was calm enough under the circumstances it told us that we were going to have to lighten the ship as much as possible we were to make ready all nonessential materials and the crew would collect them from us in a couple of minutes frantically we stumbled about the ward gathering up everything which could be thrown overboard eventually we had handed to the airshipmen a great pile of books food medical supplies clothing bedding oxygen cylinders and more all went overboard and the ship rose barely enough to clear the next range of mountains i wondered if the captain would ask for volunteers to jump from the ship next we were by this time flying over a bleak and barren wasteland of cold lava ridges with not so much as a clump of palms to break our descent should we crash the tension in the wards had increased again and those patients not still asleep were talking in high panicky voices some of the questions were difficult to answer among the nonessential materials taken from us had been the bodies of those who had died in transit but even this act of desperate callousness had bought us very little time the intercom crackled again the first officer began to speak please ready yourselves for oh god the next moment i saw the gray mountainside rushing towards us and before we fully realized it we were engulfed in clouds of whitewhite smoke and our keel was making a frightful screaming sound as it scraped the sides of the cliff the screams of the patients joined the scream of the ship itself i heard a monstrous creaking noise and then i was flung away from the rail and felt myself sliding towards the bunks the vessel bounced and juddered seemed to gain height for a moment and then came down with a horrifying crack which sent the bunks crashing loose from their moorings i had the impression of waving arms and legs of terrified faces i heard trays of instruments clattering and saw bodies flying about like rag dolls a great wail filled my ears and then the ship rolled went up again and came down for the last time in a flailing mass of bodies i was flung towards the starboard side i saw my head rushing towards a fiberglass strut near the observation ports i tried to put out my hands to stop the impact but the bodies and objects on top of me trapped them there came the final crash of impact and i remember being filled with an almost cheerful sense of relief that i had been killed and the ordeal was over at last prisoners i think i must have awakened briefly once and heard peculiar squeaky voices babbling from somewhere far away and i realized that the hydrogen was escaping and thus causing the speakers to talk in highpitched tones deciding that i was alive and sure to be rescued i fell back into unconsciousness when i next awoke i tried to move but could not i thought that perhaps my back was broken for there was little sensation save for the impression that something heavy was pressing down on me because of this pressure i found it very difficult to breathe in deeply enough to shout for the help that i was sure must be near for i could hear people moving about quite close by the voices were no longer squeaky but they were not familiar either i listened carefully the voices were shouting some variant of malay difficult for me to understand i thought at first that the local peasantry the sulphur gatherers who work the volcanoes had come to rescue us i could smell the acrid smoke and it made breathing even harder my next attempt to cry out failed then i heard more shouts and the shouts were followed by sharp reports which i did recognize gun shots with a feeling of terrible impotence i tried to move my head to see what was happening the shouting stopped there was stillness then a thin hysterical scream another shot silence a malay voice giving rapid savage commands painfully at last i managed to turn my head and peer out of a jumble of twisted struts and wreckage i saw bodies impaled on jagged shards of fiberglass and beyond them a pall of smoke through which dim figures moved as the smoke cleared i saw bright flashes of green red and yellow silk these malays were not sulphurgatherers that were certain then i saw them clearly they were clad in the familiar style of malay bandits and pirates from koto raja to timor they wore richly colored sarongs and embroidered jackets on their heads were pitjis turbans or wide coolie hats there were sandals of painted leather on their brown feet and their bodies were crossed with bandoliers of cartridges at their belts hung bolstered revolvers knives and parangs and they had rifles in their hands i saw one come towards me a look of cruel hatred frozen on his features i dropped my head and shut my eyes hearing him poke about in the wreckage above me i heard a shot close to my face and thought he had fired at me but the bullet landed in a corpse lying on top of me he moved away i looked up again the bandits were herding the survivors down the mountain through the smoke i could see nurses in smudged torn white uniforms doctors still dressed in medical overalls or in shirtsleeves airshipmen in sky blue staggering ahead of their captors but there were no patients among them i watched in dazed despair until the smoke swallowed them up then slowly as it dawned on me what had happened to my companions pain began to flood through my body i strained to twist myself round and see what pinned me in the wreckage one of the relatively light bunks had fallen on top of me and in the bunk was the body of a child its dead face the eyes wide open stared into mine i shuddered and tried to lift the bunk clear it moved slightly the childs head rolled i turned reached out with bleeding hands and grasped a broken strut in front of me pulling myself desperately from under the bunk until i was free and my breathing was easier but my legs were still numb and i could not stand i leaned forward and got a hold on another strut using that to pull my body a few more inches over the wreckage then i think i fainted for a few minutes it took me a long time to pull myself over the struts and the broken slabs of hull and the corpses until i lay on the outer areas of the wreckage on hard stone for all i was bruised and bleeding i had no bones broken the bodies of those who had died had saved me from the worst of the impact gradually the feeling came back to my legs and i was able to stand gritting my teeth against the pain i looked around me i was standing by the main wreckage of the ship on a mountain coated with streamers of yellow sulphur dust everywhere were bodies crumpled broken bodies of men women and children of patients in nightgowns and pajamas of wounded soldiers in tattered uniforms of airship officers and crewmen of nurses orderlies and doctors nearly two thousand bodies and not one of them stirred as the wind moved the slow smoke over them and the yellow dust swirled and shreds of fabric fluttered amongst the crumpled ruins of the giant airship without hope i wandered through the piles of dead two thousand human beings who had sought to escape death in the fires of singapore only to find it on the barren windswept rocks of an unknown javanese hillside i sighed and sat down picking up a crushed packet of cigarettes i had seen i opened the packet and took out one of the flattened cigarettes lighting it and trying to think but it was no good my brain refused to function i looked about me jagged holes gaped in the airships hull most of the gasbags had been ripped open and the helium lost the wreckage covered a vast area of the mountainside there was nowhere i looked which was not littered with it and over it all moved thick ribbons of smoke from the volcano the smoke stroked the broken bones of the ship the smashed gondolas and the ruined engine nacelles like the phantoms of the dead welcoming others into their ranks i got up and put out the cigarette with a stained scratched boot i coughed on the fumes and i shivered with reaction and with cold the slope was probably a thousand feet above sea level it was not surprising that the overloaded ship had crashed numbly i continued my search for survivors but at the end of two hours i had found only corpses what was still more horrifying was that many had actually survived the crash as i searched i found little girls and boys who had been shot through the head or had their throats cut young and old women butchered by parangs men who had been decapitated the bandits had been through the survivors systematically killing all those who for one reason or another had been unable or unwilling to walk as the horror increased i was suddenly seized by nausea and stood with one hand leaning on a rock while i vomited again and again until all that came out of me were dry retching coughs then i walked back to the main wreckage and found a blanket and a plastic container of water i stripped off my useless lifejacket and wrapped myself in the blanket stumbling up the mountainside until i was clear of the corpses then i slept i awoke before dawn and i was shivering from somewhere below came a chilling howl which at first i mistook for that of a human being then i realized that the howl came from a wild dog hunting in the forest at the foot of the mountain as dawn broke i went back to the wreck by now i had worked out roughly what had happened plainly the crash had been witnessed by one of the many rebel gangs who normally occupied these heights and from time to time would raid the dutch towns and farmsteads below inspired by the support of both the japanese and their more sophisticated nationalist countrymen these rebels had recently grown bolder and had come to offer a serious threat to the colonists whether they called themselves bandits pirates or nationalists all hated the whites in general and the dutch in particular they had captured the survivors probably as hostages or possibly to deliver to their japanese friends in return for more guns or supplies possibly they might just want to take pleasure in killing them slowly i couldnt be sure but i did know that if they found me i should suffer the same fate and none of the prospects were pleasant there had been few weapons aboard the hospital ship and for all i was inclined to arm myself i did not bother to hunt among the dead for a gun the rebels would probably have found any there were instead i rescued another plastic container of water a box of rather stale sandwiches discovered a kitbag of medical supplies which i shouldered and then thoughtfully for i knew i might sooner or later find myself in thick jungle tugged a parang from the body of one of the very nurses who had restored me to health at changi i stumbled away from the broken hulk of the aircraft going down the mountain my eyes stung and my throat felt clogged with sulphur i was still moving as if in a trance moving as it were from one dream and into another nothing had seemed completely real since the first ships of the japanese air fleet had been sighted in the skies over singapore yet for all that i went warily through the drifting smoke i had no wish to be plunged into the nightmare of capture by the malay bandits at last i emerged into hot sunshine saw blue calm sky above me and the rich variegated greens of a forest below i looked about for signs of the bandits and their captives but i could see nothing beyond the forest was a faint line in the sky it was the horizon of the sea the airship had almost succeeded in crossing the island and would have done if the wind had not driven it against what i now saw was the highest mountain in the region i would try for the ships destination of djogjakarta and pray that the city was still in dutch hands my best bet would be to cross the intervening land to the sea and then follow the beach more or less westward until i got to the town or with luck find a road on which i could get a lift there was no point in trying to do anything for the captured survivors myself once in djogjakarta i could tell the authorities what had happened and hope that dutch hovergyros would go out with soldiers and save the people and so i began my journey to the sea it took three days first through the thick jungle and out on to the plains until i came to the paddy fields which i had to wade through making wide detours around villages in case the local peasants were as was often the case in league with the bandits it was an exhausting trip and i was halfstarved by the time i saw the beach ahead not an hours march away in some relief i began to wade through the last paddy my ruined boots dragged at the clinging mud and then i stopped hearing a familiar sound in the distance it was the drone of an airships engines i looked up and located the source a silver flash in the sky tears came into my eyes and my shoulders slumped as i realized my struggle was over i was delivered i started to yell and wave though it was unlikely that the crew could even see me at that height let alone distinguish me for a shipwrecked englishman but the ship was coming down it did seem to be looking for me perhaps a rescue ship from surabaya i cursed myself for not staying near the wreck where i might have been seen earlier up to my waist in water surrounded by the neat rows of rice plants i waved my parang and yelled still louder then i saw the motif on the ships hull and instantly i had plunged up to my neck among the plants pulling them over my head the ship bore the red disc of the sun blazoned on its flanks it was a vessel of the imperial japanese air fleet for a few moments the ship circled the area and then flew off towards the mountains i waited until it had disappeared before daring to emerge from the water i had become a timid creature in the past twentyfour hours more warily than ever i crept to the seashore until at last i lay exhausted in the shadow of the rock on a warm beach of black volcanic sand against which beat the heavy white surf of the indian ocean the presence of the scout ship over java was ominous it meant that japan felt strong enough to ignore dutch neutrality it could even mean that japan or the bandits who served her had taken the island i wondered if there was now any point in my trying to reach djogjakarta i knew that the japanese were not kind to their captives the sound of the surf seemed to grow louder and louder and more and more restful until soon the questions ceased to plague me as i stretched out on the soft sand and let my weary brain and body sink into sleep the price of fishing boats at noon on the next day i saw the fishing village it was a somewhat ramshackle collection of log and wattle huts of various sizes all the huts were thatched with palm leaves and some had been raised on stilts the dugouts moored to rickety wooden jetties built out into the shallows were primitive and hardly looked seaworthy tall palms whose curving trunks and wide leaves appeared to offer greater shelter than the houses themselves shaded the huts i shrank back behind a hillock and deliberated for a few moments there was a chance that the villagers were in league with either the japanese or the bandits or both yet for all i was desperate to get to safety i was tired of hiding i was dreadfully hungry and had reached a point where i did not much care who those villagers were or to whom they felt loyalty just as long as they fed me something and let me lie down out of the glare of the sun i made my decision and plodded forward i thought i knew the kind of white man these people would be most prepared to tolerate and feed i had reached the center of the village before they began to emerge first the adult men then the women and the children they glowered at me i smiled back holding up my pack medicine i said desperately trying to recall my vocabulary they all looked to me as if they could use what i had to offer a few villagers emerged from the general crowd these all carried old guns parangs and knives which in spite of their age looked pretty serviceable medicine i said again there was a stirring from the back of the crowd i heard words in an unfamiliar dialect i prayed that some of them spoke malay and that they would give me a chance to talk to them before they killed me there was no question that my presence was resented an older man pushed his way through the armed villagers he had bright cunning eyes and a calculating frown he looked at my bag and uttered a couple of words in his dialect i replied in malay this had to be the headman for he was far better dressed than his fellows in a yellow and red silk sarong there were sandals on his feet belanda he said dutch i shook my head inggeris i was not sure if he saw any difference between a dutchman and an englishman but his brow cleared a little he nodded i have medicine carefully i enunciated the malay words for his dialect was not one with which i was familiar i can help your sick why do you come like this without a boat or a car or a flying machine i was on a ship i pointed out to sea it caught fire i swam here i wish to go to to bali if you want me to cure your sick you must pay me a slow smile crossed his lips this made sense to him i had come to bargain now he looked at me almost in relief we have little money he said the dutch do not pay us for our fish now that the orang djepang war against them he pointed up the coast towards djogjakarta they fight i disguised my despair so now there was no point in trying to reach the town i would have to think of another plan we have rice said the headman we have fish but no money i decided to continue with my original idea if it worked i would be a little better off i want a boat i will cure what sickness i can but you must give me one of the boats with the engines the headmans eyes narrowed the boats were their most valuable possessions he sniffed and he frowned and he pursed his lips then he nodded you will stay with us until ten men fall ill and are cured and five women and five male children he said lowering his eyes i guessed that he was trying to hide any hint in his eyes that he might be getting the best of the bargain five men i said ten men i spread my hands i agree and that was how i came to spend more weeks than i had planned in a remote and faintly hostile little javanese fishing village for the headman of course had tricked me the menproved disappointingly healthy and the women and children seemed constantly sick of minor complaints so that with my limited medical knowledge i treated many more people than had been called for in the original bargain but i never seemed in sight of making up the male quota the headman had realized at once that he was on to a good thing and it was soon evident that even when the men did fall sick they did not report to me but stuck to their usual methods of cure at least two died while i was there they were prepared to forego any attention from me so that i should continue treating the women and children for all that i was scarcely angry the routine was an anodyne to my weary brain and i lost myself in it my awareness of any reality beyond the confines of the village grew steadily more vague chaos had come again to the outside world but the daytoday life of the village was the model of simple order and i might have lived my life there if the outside world had not at last intruded looking back i understand that it was inevitable but i was surprised when it happened one morning i saw a cloud of dust in the distance it seemed that the sand of the beach was being disturbed but i could not distinguish the cause of the disturbance then as the dust cloud came closer i realized what it meant and i ran to hide in the doorway of a hut the tires of military cars big square utilitarian things with heavyduty steam turbines driving their massive wheels threw up the dust and the military cars were crammed with japanese soldiers almost certainly they had conquered the whole island by now and as certainly had heard some rumor of my presence in the village they were coming to investigate it was at this point that i decided to sail for australia there was nowhere else to go although i had failed to fulfill my original bargain with the headman i still had the moral right to do what i did for i had dealt fairly enough with the villagers and i would leave what there was of my medical kit behind for them taking only a petrol can full of water i crept down to the shore using a jetty as cover then i waded to one of the outboards and began to untie it all the villagers were watching the oncoming cars and it was my only chance to escape i started to push the boat slowly towards the open sea while the villagers ran about in excitement at the arrival of their new masters i was lucky a current soon caught the dugout and carried it more rapidly away from the shore at last the villagers saw me realized what was happening just as the japanese cars drew up in the village square i was now some distance out and having trouble trying to climb into the dugout without upsetting it the villagers began to gesticulate and point towards me with a heave i managed to get into the wildly rocking boat and tried to get the battered outboard going it fired after only three false starts i adjusted the tiller and headed for the open sea noticing with satisfaction that there was two spare cans of fuel stowed amidships i heard pistol shots then rifle shots then a machine gun started up and bullets buzzed about my ears and struck the water all around me i kept changing course and at one point did a complete circle and headed in the opposite direction to darwin my proposed destination hoping that this would confuse them when they came to radio their headquarters and instruct them to send out airships and patrol boats to look for me the gunfire stopped for a moment i looked back and saw the tiny figures of the villagers they seemed to be kneeling before the japanese then the machine gun started up again but this time it did not fire out to sea a few hours later i began to think that the chances of pursuit had disappeared i had sighted only one airship in the distance and soon it would be night i had been lucky as i chugged out over the smooth and blazing mirror of the ocean congratulating myself and with my thoughts increasingly turning to abstractions i did not realize that the japanese patrols must have been searching waters where i might logically be it seems that i had already lost my bearings in more senses than one as the burning days and the cold nights passed i began to realize that i had no chance at all of reaching australia and i started to indulge in debates with my starving thirsty self on the nature of life the nature of death and the nature of what seemed to me a continuing struggle between chaos and order with the former tending to come off rather better in the long run and it was this babbling and foolish wretch once a practical and pragmatic soldier in a more orderly world who eventually sighted rowe island and decided reasonably that it was nothing more than a splendidly detailed illusion the mysterious dempsey rowe island was discovered in by the british explorer richard rowe in it was found to contain formations of almost pure calcium and in the island was annexed by great britain that year the first settlers arrived and by they had obtained a concession from the mother country to work the phosphate deposits from being uninhabited before it had by the first third of this century achieved a population of more than two thousand mainly malay and chinese miners who had come there to work for the welland rock phosphate company which was the islands sole industrial concern rowe island lies or lay in the indian ocean miles south east of java head and miles north east of the keeling islands it is miles from the ruins of singapore and miles from what is left of fremantle western australia its european population used to number a hundred or so the official representative and his staff the manager and administrative staff of the welland rock phosphate company various private residents there for their health a young lieutenant commanding the small garrison of ghoorkas some restaurant shop and hotelkeepers various missionaries and the airpark and dock officials when i arrived most of these of course had already gone and neither airships nor steamers came to collect the islands only export the settlement had a mosque a buddhist temple a catholic church a methodist chapel and a mission hospital run by the church of england the hospital was staffed by a group of young pakistani nursing nuns under the direction of a layman dr hira a singhalese the hospitals missionary and his wife had departed for australia soon after the destruction of singapore it was in this hospital that i woke up and slowly realized rowe island was not after all a hallucination i was sore and my body stung all over but i no longer felt thirsty merely hungry i lay between the rather rough linen sheets of what was evidently a white hospital bed the walls were white and there was an ivory crucifix on the wall a few tropical flowers stuck in a pot on the ledge by the partially opened window i felt the urge to scratch but discovered both hands were bandaged i moved and my joints throbbed i tried to sit upright but fell back wearily it was still hard to believe i was safe after all i had survived a little while later the door opened and in came a shy beautiful pakistani girl in a creamcolored nuns habit she nodded and smiled gravely at me standing aside to admit a very tall very thin singhalese whose gangling frame was draped in an elegant white suit around his neck was a stethoscope on which the fingers of his right hand seemed to be playing a tune his long handsome face stared rather sardonically at me he glanced at the watch on his bony wrist not bad almost exactly on time my first attempt at speaking was not very successful my second was better you i said or me both of us he took a silver case from his pocket and opened it offering the cigarettes to me i showed him my bandaged hands he smiled apologetically the nurse will light it for you if you want one not now thanks he lit a cigarette for himself well youre on the mend im glad to say we put you in this room because your shouting kept the other patients awake youre an airshipman are you i am i said i was on an airship which crashed i told him my name and what had happened to me i asked where i was im dr hira this is st charles hospital rowe island he smiled ironically i can see youve never heard of rowe island few have perhaps thats why the war hasnt touched us directly nobody passes this way either by air or by sea in a few more months i wouldnt be surprised if were the last outpost of civilization on the globe he drew heavily on his cigarette and glanced out of the window at the harbor the pakistani nurse got extra pillows and helped me sit up if you can call this civilization said hira are you hungry very good hira patted the shy nun on the shoulder fetch the patient some soup my dear when the nurse had gone closing the door behind her i gestured with my bandaged hands i thought this whole bloody place was a mirage at first hira shrugged maybe it is a pretty rundown dream though you survived singapore eh its hard to believe it really happened i said it happened we heard so theres some communication with the outside world the mine people took all the decent equipment when they left it was the news of singapore that caused the evacuation a needless panic as it turned out i see so theres no way of contacting say darwin weve a radio which occasionally works handcranked thing and those dhows are the only means of leaving the island no ships of any kind not any more mr bastable the mine people scuttled our only steamer with some idea of stopping the island being used as a base for enemy shipping hira pointed out of the window of the harbor where the rusting superstructure of the wreck could still be seen so im stuck here unless the radio can be made to work you said it was handcranked havent you any proper power no more fuel we use oillamps for lighting now when is there a chance of my getting a message to darwin that depends on the state of the radio and the state of shawcross the operator ill ask someone to go up to the airpark tomorrow and see if shawcross is sober enough to work the radio thats about the best i can do eager to get back into the fray eh i looked suspiciously at him trying to detect irony in a face which now regarded me blandly ive a duty i said theyll need experienced airmen after all im sure they will i must be off on my rounds now see you soon mr bastable hira raised the stethoscope in a kind of salute and left the room i sank back into the bed and sighed an old radio and a drunken operator i was pessimistic about my immediate chances of leaving rowe island a week went by and every day i grew stronger i was making splendid recovery from what had been a very serious case of exposure but i also grew more and more impatient and plagued doctor hira with questions about the radio and the condition of the operator the news initially brought back to the hospital had been bad shortly after id arrived shawcross had gone up on the mountain somewhere he had taken a chinese girl and a case of gin with him and he couldnt be found about ten days after i had awakened from my coma i stood by the window wearing a rather ridiculous hospital dressing gown which was too short for me talking to hira who had come in to give me the latest lack of news about shawcross in the harbor there was a lot of confusion and noise since dawn groups of halfstarved malays had been moving along the jetty packing their possessions into one of the fishing dhows apparently my appearance on rowe island had started something they had realized that the mining company would not be back for a long while and they had decided to try to make it to java in spite of their having been warned of atrocities committed on their countrymen by the japanese i felt sorry for those malays the boat would probably sink before they got more than a few miles out miserably i looked back into the room at hira the government should be helping these people flying in supplies or something i wish that damned operator would turn up i think the government has a lot of problems at the moment hira was sitting on my bed fiddling with his stethoscope he spoke almost with satisfaction i dont know when well see shawcross he often goes to earth like this hes probably hiding out in one of the mines i could have a try at working the radio myself i said it would be better than this im well enough to go out now if you could find me a suit perhaps i think we can discover something in your size but shawcross has locked his office up always does he likes to be indispensable it keeps his credit good at the hotel which hotel olmeijers the royal airpark hotel on the edge of the airpark it used to be the biggest now its the only one olmeijer carries on running it from sentiment i think ill take a stroll out there anyway i was curious to have a look at the island why not said hira get to know the place after all you could be here for some time he seemed amused as i dressed in my borrowed suit hira took my place by the window from the harbor came a babble of voices as the malays readied the ship for the sea he shook his head theyll drown themselves for certain wont anybody stop them i pulled on my jacket the linen suit was a surprisingly good fit as was the white shirt hira had lent me isnt there some sort of governor here you mentioned someone brigadier l g a nesbit is the official representative and has been since hira shrugged hes eightyseven and has been senile for at least ten years i think thats why he decided to stay when the big exodus was on his staff now consists of a valet as old as himself and a bengali secretary who spends his whole time making endless inventories and who hasnt apparently left his office since the war began there is of course young lieutenant allsop who commands our local military i dont think allsop will be sorry to see a few of his troubles going the malays are a problem eh i tried on one of the panama hats lying on the bed it was a good fit too hira gestured wearily there are a thousand malays and chinese here at least the malays are in the main moslems and the chinese are chiefly buddhists or christians they are when they have nothing better to do highly critical of each others ways of life and they have nothing better to do their work went when the mine closed and now theyre living off the land and sea as best they can poor bastards i said hira gave a peculiar smile i wonder if youll say that when they tarn on the whites they will you know quite soon presently they hate each other more than they hate europeans but it will take just one excuse for them to begin a general massacre well all go then technically you see the sisters and myself are regarded as europeans and youre prepared to stay until that happens should i go back to ceylon and care for our japanese conquerors you could go to australia or even england there must be need of doctors everywhere i should have made it plain hira opened the door for me i have a couple of principles one of them is that i refuse to work for europeans its the reason i came to rowe island in the first place until the evacuation this hospital was for colored people only mr bastable as i left the hospital i adjusted my hat and paused to watch the dhow easing its way past the wreck of the steamer every inch of its deck was covered with brownskinned men women and children it brought back the terrible image of the doomed hospital ship and i could hardly bear to think what would become of them all slowly i started to walk along the weedgrown quay beside deserted hotels offices and warehouses outside which were parked the useless cars lorries and buses a few disconsolate malays were dragging their bundles back down the jetty having failed to squeeze themselves aboard the boat the lucky ones i thought i reached a corner and turned into a narrow silent side street lined with gray and brown featureless workers houses and a few boardedup shops the street rose quite steeply and i realized how weak i still was for i had to labor the last few paces until i reached a small square dominated by a battered statue of edward viii which somewhat incongruously decorated a driedup ornamental fountain the concrete bowl of the fountain was full of empty bottles torn newspapers and other less savory refuse there were a few chinese children playing around it while their mothers sat blankfaced in their doorways staring into space gratefully i sat on the edge of the fountains bowl ignoring the smell which came from it and smiling at the undernourished children they at once stopped playing and looked warily up at me tso sun i said gravely using cantonese good morning not one of them replied a bit nonplussed i wished i had something to offer them some sweets perhaps for money was worthless on rowe island i removed my hat and wiped my forehead it was growing very hot and i had become wary of the sun i had better get on to the hotel while i could then i heard the sound of hoof beats and turned in astonishment to see a rider enter the square he looked distinctly out of place as he sat stiffbacked and arrogant in the saddle of his wellgroomed cob a tall fairhaired englishman of about thirty he wore a gleaming white coat and jodhpurs with his military insignia on the jacket his boots belt shoulder strap and holster were as highly polished as the badge on his solar tope he saw me at once but pretended that he hadnt he stroked his blond moustache with his baton and brought his horse to a halt on the other side of the square i looked around at the empty silent windows wondering what he could be doing here get these children out of the way sergeant his voice was sharp commanding at this order six crisply turned out little ghoorkas led by a sergeant emerged from another side street and waved the children back with their rifles their bayonets were fixed they wore dark green uniforms with scarlet facings and they had their long curved knives at their belts the women needed no warnings but dragged the children inside and slammed their doors now i was the only civilian in the square whats going on here lieutenant asked the lieutenant turned cold blue eyes on me i would suggest sir that you get away from here at once its a police matter there could be trouble there seemed to be no point in arguing i humored him instead thank you lieutenant i walked across the square but remained in the shadows of a side street peering curiously at what was going on now the young officer dismounted and ordered his sergeant to enter one of the houses the ghoorkas rushed in and the lieutenant followed behind i watched in puzzlement not knowing what to make of the scene at all there was dead silence in the square for a little while then a horrible babble of screams and yells issued from the house i heard a woman shouting in cantonese there were a couple of shots and then the raised voice of the officer giving a series of orders another scream a mans this time then out into the street poured a score of coolies they were staggering and screwing their eyes up against the sunlight every one of them was dazed and scared stiff there came another shot from inside the house and then more shouting the coolies outside began to scatter some rushing into nearby doorways others running off down towards the harbor a further series of commands came from the officer and then a terrible wailing the sound of flesh being struck presumably with rifle butts appalled i was about to step forward when a panicstricken coolie burst from the house hesitated glanced around wildly holding a bleeding hand and then ran in my direction i stepped aside to let him pass and he fled around a corner and vanished but i had seen his pupils the man had been drugged now i understood the soldiers were raiding some sort of local opium den hearing a moan i reentered the square and saw that one of the opium smokers had fallen to the flagstones he had been stabbed badly with a bayonet in his shoulder i knelt beside him tore back his shirt and did my best to stop the flow of blood while he stared at me in terror small moans escaping his lips boots tramped from the house good god man what are you doing i looked up to see the lieutenant striding from the house he looked pretty pleased with himself this chaps been stabbed by one of your soldiers i said harshly im trying to help him was there any need to the lieutenant glanced contemptuously at the coolie doubtless he tried to kill someone crazed by opium they all are his own people will look after him were trying to teach them a lesson after all with strips of the mans shirt i bandaged up the wound as best i could he tried to speak and then fainted helplessly i tried to lift him but it was impossible now the ghoorkas emerged holding three terrified chinese in black and red smocks two men and a woman all badly bruised and probably the proprietors of the den the lieutenants baton stabbed in their direction he raised his head and spoke to the empty windows and doors now no more opium you savvy opium bad these people bad go to prison we lock up long time savvy angrily he tapped his riding boot with his baton he glared at me and opened his mouth to speak im going to try to get this chap to the hospital i said can somebody give me a hand the officer took the reins of his horse and looked from me to his soldiers who held their miserable prisoners much more firmly than was necessary one of your men i began the lieutenant remounted i told you sir his own people will look after him you obviously dont understand the conditions on this island theres a dreadful opium problem its increasing daily they grow the poppies rather than food i what else have the bastards got to live for allsop a tired drawl came from the shadowy doorway of the raided house an english voice lt allsop turned in his saddle and shook his baton at the unseen speaker you stay out of this youre lucky we didnt arrest you too a figure emerged into the sunlight dressed in a dirty faded european suit and a frayed native shirt he was barefooted unshaven emaciated and plainly under the influence of opium i knew the signs well enough for i had once been slave to the drugs consolations i could not make out his age but the voice was of quite a young man from the upper middle class id have thought youd be ashamed allsops face was full of disgust who are you to deny them their only pleasure allsop drawled the newcomer reasonably let them alone for gods sake lt allsop wheeled his trim cob about and shouted an order to his men all right quick march he trotted away without answering the decrepit englishman i watched them go the ghoorkas dragging their frightened prisoners back the way they had come the englishman shrugged and turned to reenter the house just a minute i called i must try to get this chap to the hospital hes halfdead could you give me a hand the man leaned wearily against the doorframe hed be better off with his ancestors believe me a moment ago you were defending these people not defending them old boy im a fatalist you see i told allsop to let them alone and i tell you the same whats the point hell die soon enough but he left the doorway and shuffled into the square blinking in the sunshine who are you anyway im an airshipman i got here a week or so ago ah the shipwrecked mariner they were talking about you up at the hotel all right ill help you with him for what its worth the opiumdrunk englishman was no stronger than i was but together we managed to carry the coolie down the street and along the quay until we reached the hospital after a couple of nuns had been called and had taken the wounded man away i stood panting in the lobby staring curiously at my helper thanks he smiled slowly think nothing of it nothing at all cheerio he raised his hand in a sort of ironic salute and then went out he had gone before dr hira came down the stairs into the lobby who was that chap i asked hira describing the wretched englishman hira recognized the description he fiddled with his stethoscope a castaway like yourself he arrived in the airship which came to take off the mine people he chose to stay on rowe island i dont know why it meant they could take one more passenger so they didnt argue they call him the captain sometimes up at the hotel supposed to have been the commander of a merchant airship which crashed in china before the war a bit of a mystery allsop doesnt like him hira laughed softly no allsop wouldnt captain dempsey lets the side down eh allsops for the europeans keeping up appearances at all costs allsop certainly works hard i wiped a spot of blood off my sleeve i dont think he ever sleeps his wife left with the mine people you know hira glanced at his watch well its almost lunchtime fish and rice as usual but ive managed to get a couple of bottles of beer if youd no thanks i said i think ill head up to the hotel again dead man the port where i was staying was the only real town on the island it was called new birmingham its buildings were clustered close together near the waterfront and were several stories high as they wandered up the slopes they drew apart as if fastidious of each others squalor and grew smaller until the houses near the top were little more than isolated shanties erected in shallow hollows in the hillside above the shanty district the hill leveled out for a while and became a small plateau on which the airpark had been built olmeijers hotel stood on the edge of the airpark which was now overgrown and desolate i wondered if young lt allsop would have approved of the hotel for it had certainly made an attempt to keep up appearances its big gilt sign was brightly polished and its splendid wooden gothic exteriors had recently been given a fresh coat of white paint it looked out of place in its surroundings the rusting airship mast erected in its center dominated the airpark to one side of the park was a single airship hangar its gray paint peeling and beside it a pole at which drooped a torn and filthy windsock near the pole stood like the skeletons of large unearthly insects the remains of two hover gyros which had been stripped of most of their essential parts on the other side of the hangar was the shell of a light monoplane probably the property of some longgone sportsman which had been similarly dismembered the island seemed to be populated by a variety of wrecks i thought it seemed to be feeding off corpses including as in allsops case the corpses of dead ideas after a glance towards the abandoned administration and control buildings to assure myself that they were uninhabited i made for the hotel pushing open a pair of welloiled double doors i walked into the lobby it was clean scrubbed polished and cool a malay houseboy was operating the cords of a big punka attached to the ceiling it fanned air into my face as i entered i was grateful for this after the heat outside but amused by the fresh incongruity i nodded to the malay who didnt seem to notice me and seeing no one at the desk strolled into the adjacent bar in the shady gloom were two men one sat in his shirtsleeves behind the bar reading a book while the other sat drinking a gin fizz in the far corner near french windows opening onto a verandah beyond the windows i could see the airpark and beyond the airpark the slopes of the mountain covered in thick forest as i seated myself on a stool by the bar the man behind it put down his book and looked at me in some surprise he was very fat and his big red face was beaded with sweat his rolled up sleeves revealed a variety of tattoos of the more restrained kind there were several gold rings on his thick fingers he spoke in a deep guttural accent what can i do for you i began apologetically im afraid i brought no money so the fat mans face broke into a broad smile ja no money thats too bad he shook with laughter for a moment now what will you drink ill put it on the slate eh very good of you ill have a brandy i introduced myself are you the hotels proprietor ja i am olmeijer certainly he seemed inordinately proud of the fact he took a large ledger from under the counter selected a fresh page and entered my name at the top your account he said when things are better you can pay me he turned to take down a bottle of cognac youve a chap called shawcross staying here i believe i said shawcross certainly he put a large brandy on the bar twenty cents on the slate he made an entry in the ledger and replaced it out of sight it was good brandy perhaps it tasted even better for being the first drink i had had since singapore i savored it but shawcross said olmeijer with a wink and a jerk of his thumb has gone up the mountain and youve no idea when hell be back i heard one of the wicker chairs scrape on the polished floor then footsteps approached me i turned it was the man who had been sitting near the window he held his empty glass in his hand shawcross will be back when the gin he borrowed from mr olmeijer runs out he was a thin heavily tanned man in his fifties wearing a khaki bush shirt and white shorts he had a small graying moustache and his blue eyes seemed to have a permanent hint of ironic humor in them my names greaves he said as he joined me at the bar you must be the airship chap they found in the dugout singapore eh must have been awful greaves told me hed been left behind to protect the interests of the welland rock phosphate company while the rest of the white employees went back to england or australia he was keen to hear about the attack on singapore briefly for the memory was still hard to bear i told him what had happened i still cant believe it i concluded there was a peace treaty he smiled bitterly and sipped his drink everyone had a peace treaty didnt they wed abolished war hadnt we but human nature being what it is he looked up at the rows of bottles in front of him bloody japs i knew theyd start something sooner or later greedy bastards the japanese would not have blown up their own began olmeijer greaves interrupted him with a sharp laugh i dont know how that city got blown up but it was the excuse everybody needed to start scrapping he tilted his glass to his lips i suppose well never know how it happened or who did it but thats not the point theyd have been fighting by now even if it hadnt happened i wish you were right i recognized the new voice and turned to see dempsey walking wearily into the bar he nodded to greaves and me and placed a dirty hand on the counter large scotch please olmeijer the dutchman didnt seem pleased to see his latest customer but he poured the drink and carefully wrote the cost down in his ledger there was an embarrassed pause for all he had interrupted our conversation dempsey apparently wasnt prepared to amplify his remark afternoon dempsey i said he smiled faintly and rubbed at his unshaven chin hello bastable moving in i was looking for shawcross he took a long pull at his drink theres a lot of people looking for shawcross he said mysteriously what do you mean he shook his head nothing another drink bastable said greaves have this one on me and then as if with a slight effort you dempsey thanks dempsey finished his drink and put his glass back on the bar olmeijer poured another gin another brandy and another scotch greaves took a case of cheroots from his shirt pocket and offered them around olmeijer and dempsey accepted but i refused what did you mean just then greaves asked dempsey you dont care about all this surely i thought you were the chap so full of oriental fatalism dempsey turned away for a moment his dead eyes had seemed to burn with a terrible misery he took his glass to a nearby table and sat down thats me he said but greaves wouldnt let it go you werent in japan when the bombing started were you dempsey shook his head no china i noticed that his hands were shaking as he lifted his glass to his mouth and he seemed to be muttering something under his breath i thought i heard the words god forgive me he finished the drink quickly got up and shambled towards the door thanks greaves see you later his wasted body disappeared through the doors and i saw him begin to climb the flight of wooden stairs which led up from the lobby greaves raised his eyebrows in a quizzical look he shrugged i think dempsey has become what we used to call an island case we had a few of them going native in the old days or taking up opium like him the stuffs killing him of course and he knows it hell be dead within six months i shouldnt wonder id have given him longer than that i said feelingly ive known opium smokers who live to a ripe old age greaves drew on his cheroot its not just the opium is it i mean theres such a thing as a will to die you know that as well as i do i nodded soberly i had encountered my own share of such desires i wonder what did it greaves mused a woman perhaps he was an airshipman you know perhaps he lost his ship or deserted her or something olmeijer grunted and looked up from his book hes just a weak man just weak thats all could be i got up i think ill head back now mind if i come up tomorrow id like to be here when shawcross returns see you tomorrow greaves lifted his hand in a salute i wish you the best of luck bastable that night i dined on fish and fruit with hira i told him about my conversation at the hotel and my second encounter with dempsey his earlier remark had aroused my curiosity and i asked hira if he knew anything at all of dempseys reasons for coming to the island hira could add little about the opium eater all i know is that he was in better condition when he arrived than he is now i dont have much to do with the european community as you may have noticed he looked sardonically at me englishmen often start acting strangely when theyve been out east a few years maybe they feel guilty about exploiting us eh i refused to rise to this and we completed our meal in relative silence after dinner we sat back in our chairs and smoked discussing the health of the coolie i had found hira told me he was recovering reasonably quickly i was just about to go up to bed when the door opened suddenly and a nun rushed into hiras room doctor quickly it is shawcross her face was full of anxiety he has been attacked i think he is dying we hurried downstairs to the little entrance hall of the hospital in the light from the oil lamp i saw olmeijer and greaves standing there their faces were pale and tense and they were staring helplessly down at something which lay on an improvised stretcher they had placed on the floor they must have carried it all the way from the hotel hira crouched down and inspected the man on the stretcher my god he said greaves addressed me he was dumped on the steps of the hotel about an hour ago i think some chinaman objected to his wife or maybe his daughter running off with shawcross i dont know grimly he wiped his face with his handkerchief this couldnt have happened before the bloody war i gagged as i got a good look at the battered mess of flesh on the stretcher poor devil hira straightened up and looked significantly at me there was no hope for shawcross he turned to greaves and olmeijer can you take the stretcher up to the ward please i followed as the two men picked up the stretcher and staggered as they climbed the short flight of steps to the ward with the nurses i helped get him onto the bed but it was plain that virtually every bone in his body had been broken he was scarcely recognizable as a human being they had taken their time in beating him up and he couldnt last long hira began to fill a hypodermic the beaten mans eyes opened and he saw us his lips moved i bent to listen bloody chinks bloody woman done for me found us in the mine the sheets oh god the bloody clubs hira gave him a hefty injection cocaine he said to me its about all we have now i looked at the next bed and saw the coolie i had rescued staring at shawcross with an expression of quiet satisfaction this couldnt be some sort of retaliation could it i asked hira who knows hira looked down at the australian as the mans eyes glazed and closed again greaves put his fist to his lips and cleared his throat i wonder if somebody ought to tell nesbit he looked at shawcross and pursed his lips therell be hell to pay when allsop hears about this hira seemed almost amused it could mean the end thoughtfully olmeijer rubbed at his neck need allsop be told the man has been attacked i said a couple of hours or so and it will be murder he cant last the night if allsop goes on the rampage old boy we all stand a chance of being murdered greaves pointed out allsop will anger the malays and chinese so much theyre bound to turn on us these arent the old days what do you think a dozen bloody ghoorkas can do against a thousand coolies there was a glint of malice in hiras eyes so you dont want me to report this to the official representative gentlemen better not said greaves well all keep mum eh i watched the nurse cleaning the blood from shawcrosss body the cocaine had knocked him out completely i walked to the door of the ward and lit a cigarette watching the mosquitoes and the moths fluttering around the oil lamp in the lobby from beyond the open door came the sound of the sea striking the stones of the quay it no longer seemed peaceful instead the silence had become ominous as the other three men joined me i inclined my head very well i said ill say nothing next morning new birmingham was deathly quiet i walked through empty streets i felt a thousand pairs of eyes watched me as i made my way up to the airpark i did not call in at the hotel there was no point now in hoping to see shawcross there he had died in the night at the hospital i carried on past it and stood by one of the ruined hover gyros kicking at a broken rotor which lay on the weedgrown concrete beside the machine from the forest behind me came the sounds of dawn at this hour some of the nocturnal animals were still about and the diurnal inhabitants were beginning to wake hornbills cockatoos fairy bluebirds and doves fluttered among the trees filling the air with song and with color they seemed to be celebrating something perhaps the end of the human occupation of the island the air was rich with the stink of the forest of animal spoor and rotting tree trunks i heard the chatter of gibbons and saw tiny shrews skipping along branches heavy with dew on the wail of the hangar the beady eyes of lizards regarded me coldly as if i had no business to be there i turned towards what had been the main control building where the murdered man had locked up his wireless apparatus before going off on what was to prove his final orgy the whole building had been sealed before the airship personnel had left the windows on all three stories had been covered by steel shutters and it would take special tools and a lot of hard work to get even one of them down all the doors were locked and barred and i could see where various attempts to open them had failed i walked round and round the concrete building pushing uselessly at the shutters and rattling the handles of the doors the chirring sounds from the forest seemed to mock my helplessness and at length i stopped by a door which had evidently been in recent use tried the handle once more then leaned against the frame looking back across the deserted park with its broken bones of flying machines and its rusting mast at the spruce hotel beyond the sun glinted on olmeijers gilded sign royal airpark hotel it said the islands best a little later someone came out through the french windows leading from the bar and stood on the verandah then they saw me and began to walk slowly through the tall grass towards me i recognized the figure and i frowned what could he want the message it was dempsey of course he had shaved and put on a suit slightly cleaner than the one he had worn on the previous day but he wore the same tattered native shirt underneath it by the pupils of his eyes i saw he had not yet had his first pipe of opium he shuffled towards me coughing on the comparatively cold air of the early morning i heard about shawcross he said he crossed the cracked concrete and stood looking at me i offered him a cigarette which he accepted fumbling it from my case and trembling slightly as i lit it for him you knew the chinese were after shawcross didnt you i said thats what you meant yesterday when you said a lot of people were looking for him yesterday i dont remember he puffed on the cigarette drawing the smoke deep into his lungs you might have saved him dempsey if youd warned someone at the time he straightened up a little and he seemed amused as he glanced towards the forest on the other hand i might have done everyone else more harm its a bit of a luxury a social conscience isnt it bastable he felt in his pocket i came to give you this i found it on the steps he held out a yale key must have fallen from shawcrosss pocket when they dumped him i hesitated before accepting the key then i turned and tried it in the lock the wards clicked back and the door swung open the interior smelled of stale liquor and burnt rubber all thats left of shawcross is his stink said dempsey now youre going to try to wireless for help i suppose ill try i said if i can get through to darwin ill ask them to reroute the first available airship to pick me up and anyone else who wants to leave the island better tell them its an emergency dempsey waved his hand in the general direction of the town make no bones about it there are half a dozen excuses for an uprising now allsop finding out about shawcross will be just one more the chinese are in a mood to slaughter all the malays and if the whites interfere theyll probably get together and kill us first its true a ghost of a smile appeared on his lips i know im in rather closer touch with the natives than most after all shawcross was just a beginning i nodded all right ill tell darwin you know how to work the wireless ive had some training dempsey followed me into the gloomy interior of the office it was a filthy litter of empty beer cans bottles and bits of broken wireless equipment he pulled back the shutters and light came through the dusty windows i saw what could only be the wireless set in one corner and i picked my way across the floor towards it dempsey showed me the pedals underneath the bench i sat down and put my feet on them they turned slowly at first and then more easily dempsey inspected the set seems to be warming up he said he began to fiddle with the dials there was a faint crackle from the phones he picked them up and listened shaking his head valve trouble probably youd better let me have a go i rose and dempsey sat down in the chair after a while he found a screwdriver and took part of the casing off the set its the valves all right he said there should be a box of spares behind you on the other bench could you bring it over i found the box and placed it beside him as he continued to work did you learn about radios on airships i asked him he tightened his mouth and went on with the job how did you happen to turn up here i said my curiosity overcoming my tact none of your bloody business bastable there that should do it he screwed in the last valve and began pedaling but then he fell back in the chair coughing too bloody weak he said youd better do the pumping if you wouldnt mind he lapsed into another fit of coughing as he got up and i replaced him while i pedaled he twisted the dials again until we heard a faint voice coming through the earphones dempsey settled the headset over his ears and adjusted the microphone hello darwin this is rowe island over he turned a knob he flipped a toggle switch and spoke impatiently into the mike no im sorry i dont know our bloody call sign our operators been killed as a matter of fact no were not a military base this is rowe island in the indian ocean and the civilian population is in danger while i continued to pedal the generator dempsey told darwin our situation there was some confusion a wait of nearly twenty minutes while the operator checked with his superiors some more confusion over the location of the island and then at last dempsey leaned back and sighed thank you darwin as he stripped off the headset he glanced down at me youre lucky theyll have one of their patrol ships over here in a day or two if it hasnt been shot down youd better tell the others to pack their bags and be ready im very grateful dempsey i said i dont think id have had a chance of getting through if it hadnt been for you the problems with the wireless had exhausted him he got up and began to rummage around in the office until he found an almost full bottle of rum he opened it took a long drink and then offered it to me i accepted the bottle and sipped the rum gasping it was raw stuff i handed it back and watched with a certain amount of respect as he finished it we left the office and began to walk across the airpark as we approached the mast he paused and looked up through the girders the passenger lift was at the top of the mast presumably left there by the last hasty group to go aboard the ship when it had taken the bulk of the europeans off the island this wont be any good he said nobody to work it even if it was in decent condition the ship will have to come right down its going to be a problem everybody will have to muck in will you help me if im conscious i heard you commanded an airship once i said then i regretted my curiosity for a peculiar look of pained amusement came over his face yes yes i did for a very short time i dropped it let me get you a drink i said olmeijer was in his usual spot at the bar reading his book greaves was not there the dutchman looked up and nodded to us he made no mention of the previous nights business and i didnt bring it up i told him that we had managed to get through to darwin and that they were sending an airship he seemed unimpressed i think he enjoyed his role as the last hotelier on the island he would rather have customers who couldnt pay than no customers at all dempsey and i took our drinks to one of the tables near the window youve been a great help dempsey i said cynically he stared at me over the rim of his glass am i helping i may be doing you a disservice do you really want to go back to all that i think its my duty duty to support the last vestiges of a discredited imperialism it was the first time i had heard him utter anything like a political opinion i was surprised he sounded like a bit of a red i thought i could think of no answer which wouldnt have been impolite he downed the rest of his scotch and stared out over the airpark speaking as if to himself its all a question of power and rarely a question of justice he looked sharply at me dont patronize me bastable i dont need your kindness thanks if you knew he broke off another i watched dempsey walk unsteadily to the bar and then get fresh drinks he brought them back almost reluctantly im sorry i said its just well you seem to have a lot on your mind i thought a sympathetic ear there was a very strange look in his eyes now sympathetic i wonder how sympathetic you would stay if i told you what was really on my mind theres a war on bastable i heard you speculating yesterday about how it started i know how the war started i know who started it too it was a bloody accident i restrained my exclamation of astonishment and waited to hear more but dempsey leaned back in the wicker chair and closed his eyes his lips moving as he spoke to himself i went to get him another drink but he was already asleep when i returned i let him sleep and joined olmeijer at the bar shortly afterwards greaves came in he looked tired as if he had not been to bed since i had seen him give me a triple gin olmeijer quickly morning bastable i dont advise you to go back through the town alone theres a lot of trouble big gangs of malays and chinese fighting each other arson rape and bloody murder all over the place has allsop found out about not yet but pretty well everyone else knows hell hear soon the chinese managed to steal a malaysian boat last night and buggered off with it probably poor shawcrosss murderers making their getaway the malays roughed up some chinese families the chinese retaliated i think were in very hot water this time i told him about the wireless message to darwin and the probability of a ship coming he looked more than relieved youd better send one of your chaps into new brum olmeijer tell him to let everyone know to get up here as fast as possible grumbling olmeijer rolled off to find a servant greaves walked round to the other side of the bar i think another drink is called for on the house bastable i nodded dempsey i saw that dempsey had woken up and was making for the door he shook his head and said with a tight crooked smile ive some business in town cheerio its dangerous i said ill be all right hope to see you later bastable we watched him leave poor bastard said greaves he shuddered and downed his gin hopes of salvation allsop came up to the hotel in the afternoon and asked suspiciously after shawcross we said that we had heard hed had some sort of accident he didnt believe us of course but he had his hands full in the town and couldnt wait to question us further hed escorted some clergymen to the hotel and some chinese nuns from the catholic mission they sat huddled in the far corner of the bar and didnt talk much to us nesbits secretary a roundfaced anxious bengali had come with allsop and he remained almost constantly by the window looking out as if he expected the airship to arrive at any minute i asked allsop about dempsey and the soldier glowered at me muttering that dempsey had been seen with some of the chinese rebels and might find himself in real trouble with the authorities if he wasnt careful i also learned that hira had decided to stay on at the hospital along with most of his nuns by that evening a few more people had drifted up including two irish priests who joined the others in the corner olmeijer seemed delighted to have so many new guests and rushed around seeing that rooms were prepared for them even i received a room on the second floor allsop returned looking tired and angry his normally neat uniform was dusty and he had a bruise over his right eye he seemed to be blaming greaves and me for his problems and wouldnt speak to us at all on this second visit he had brought us three of his twelveman army for protection the rest were remaining in the town to keep order though from the noise below there was precious little of that and to protect the official representatives residence for brigadier nesbit it emerged had elected to stay along with his valet allsop rode back a little later he was alone and as stiffbacked as ever as he guided his horse down the hill and disappeared into the darkness and the cacophony below i dont believe he was seen alive again by midnight the ladies and gentlemen of the cloth had all gone to bed and greaves olmeijer and myself were in our usual places at the bar while the little bengali paced back and forth beside the windows even greaves seemed a trifle nervous and once he expressed the belief that we might not quite last out then he too went to bed and the bengali followed him olmeijer had his big account book open on the bar and for a while seemed cheerfully engrossed in his arithmetic before closing the book with a crash nodding goodnight to me and heaving his huge bulk away to his own quarters now save for the ghoorkas on guard outside i was the only one up i felt exhausted but not particularly sleepy i decided to go outside and see if i could detect any activity in the town as i entered the lobby i heard voices by the main entrance i peered out but the oil lamp wasnt bright enough to show me anything i opened the door one of the ghoorka guards was shouting at a man i could dimly see in the moonlight the ghoorka gestured with his bayoneted rifle and the man turned away for a moment i saw his face in the faint glow from the lamp in the lobby i pushed past the soldier and hurried outside dempsey is that you he looked back his shoulders were bowed and his jacket had been ripped his face was deathly pale his eyelids almost closed hello bastable the speech was slurred the voice of a cretin thought this was my hotel it is i went towards him and took a limp arm come inside the ghoorka made no attempt to stop us as i took dempsey into olmeijers the man was staggering and shivering a dry retching noise came from his throat he was gripping something tightly in his right hand there was no point in questioning him and i did my best to get him up the stairs and along the passage to his room the door was unlocked i halfcarried dempsey in let him sit on the bed while i lit the oil lamp the light revealed a room which was surprisingly neat the bed was made up and there was no litter in fact the room was completely impersonal i got dempsey onto the bed and he stretched out with a sigh the shivering came in brief spasms now he blinked and looked up at me as i took his pulse thank you very much bastable he said i thought i might have a word with you youre in bad shape i said better sleep if you can theyre looting down there he said killing each other perhaps its something in the air he coughed and then started to choke i got him upright and tried to pry the packet he held from his fingers but he reacted angrily with surprising strength he pulled his hand away i can look after myself now old man there were tears in his eyes as he sank back onto the pillow im just tired sick and tired dempsey youre killing yourself let me i hope youre right bastable its taking too bloody long though i wish id had the guts to do it properly i stood up telling him that i would call back later to see how he was he closed his eyes and seemed to fall asleep i had that feeling of impotence common to many who have themselves experienced the relief of drug addiction i knew only too well that there was little i could do for the poor tormented wretch he could only help himself and dempsey seemed genuinely haunted perhaps by a special insight into things as they really were perhaps by something in himself some aspect of his own character which he could not reconcile with his moral outlook for it was becoming increasingly clear that dempsey in spite of his denials had a very moral outlook and that he didnt think much of himself i went to my own room along the passage and took off my jacket and trousers i lay down on the bed in the darkness listening to the insects hurling themselves against the woven wire of the window screens moonlight flooded the room soon i fell into a light sleep i woke up suddenly my door was creaking as it slowly opened and i looked around for a weapon thinking that the coolies had attacked the hotelwhile i slept then with a sigh of relief i saw that it was dempsey he was leaning almost nonchalantly on the door handle his face was as pale as ever but he seemed to have recovered his strength sorry to disturb you bastable do you need help i got up and pulled on my trousers perhaps i do there isnt a lot of time now he smiled not practical help though his eyes were glazed and dreamy and i realized that he had taken some kind of stimulant to offset the effects of the opium i hated to think what was happening both to his mind and his body he sat down heavily on my bed im fine he spoke as if to reassure himself i just thought id drop in for a chat you wanted a chat eh earlier i sat down in the wicker armchair beside the bed why not i said as cheerfully as i could i told you theres no need to patronize me ive come to make a sort of confession i dont know why it should be you bastable possibly its just because well youre one of the victims singapore and everything its over i said and it certainly couldnt have been anything to do with you the war is ceaseless the most we can hope for are occasional moments of tranquility in the midst of the conflict i quote lobkowitz his drugged eyes shone for a second with an ironic light you read him too i didnt think you were another red bastable im not neither for that matter is lobkowitz its a matter of opinion besides i speak from a great deal of experience as a soldier i have been a soldier but i have come to the conclusion that the human race is constantly in a state of tension that those tensions make us what we are and that they will often lead to wars the greater our ingenuity at inventing weapons the worse the wars become oh indeed i agree with that last statement he sighed but dont you believe its possible for people to acknowledge the tensions and yet make harmony from those tensions just as music is made my experience would have it otherwise my hope of course is another thing but i see little point in such a debate when the world is currently in such an appalling state this frightful armageddon will probably not be over until the last aerial manowar falls from the skies you really see it as armageddon i could not tell him what i knew that i had already passed through three alternative versions of our world and in each seen the most hideous destruction of civilization that i myself felt responsibility for at least one of those great wars i merely shrugged perhaps not perhaps there will be peace the russians and the japanese have always been at loggerheads what i cant understand is how britain failed to stop it and why the japs turned on us with such ferocity i know why he said i patted his arm do you know or is it the opium telling you ive been fond of opium in my time dempsey my appearance was once not too different from yours can you believe that i thought there was something but why i took part in a crime i said a very wicked crime and then i paused then i became lost but youre not lost now im lost now but ive decided to make the best of things ive become a good airshipman i love airships there is nothing like being at the helm of one i know he said of course i know but ill never go aloft again something happened an accident a small wretched laugh came out of his throat you could call it that he fumbled in his pocket and took something out placing it on the bed beside him it was a syringe this stuff makes you want to talk unlike the opium from his other pocket he took a handful of ampoules and placed them neatly beside the syringe i got up i cant let you his eyes were full of pain cant you the words had intense significance they silenced me i sat down again with a shrug he put his hand over the syringe and the ampoules and stared at me grimly youve no choice ive no choice our choices are all gone bastable for my own part one way or another im going to kill myself you can take that for granted and id rather you let me do it this way i know the state of mind youre in old man i was in it once and without wishing to make a stupid comparison i feel ive had as much reason as anyone on earth to want to do it but you see me alive ive gone beyond suicide well i havent yet he hesitated i wanted to talk to you bastable then talk i cant without this stuff once again i shrugged but i knew what it was to have an unbearable weight on ones conscience take a little then i suggested just a little and talk but dont try to kill yourself at least until you have confided in me he shuddered confided what a word you sound like a priest just a fellowsufferer youre a bit of a prig bastable i smiled so ive been told by others yet youre a decent sort and you dont judge people much only yourself am i right im afraid you probably are you dont hold with socialism do you with my brand at any rate whats your brand well kropotkin called it anarchism but the words come to mean something very different in the public mind you dont blow things up then again he began to shake he tried to speak but no words came i had accidentally struck a nerve i moved towards him im sorry old man i didnt mean he drew away from me get out he said for gods sake leave me alone i felt very foolish dempsey believe me i meant nothing serious i was being facetious get out it was almost a shout a plea get out bastable the ships coming save yourself if you can im not going to let you kill yourself i grabbed up some of the ampoules i want to listen dempsey he fell back on the bed his head hit the wall he groaned his body fell sideways he had passed out i checked his pulse and his breathing and then i went to look for help i recalled that there was a missionary doctor now in the hotel as i reached the ground floor and headed to the bar where i would find olmeijer i heard people near the windows begin to mutter then to talk excitedly a beam of bright light suddenly broke the darkness outside olmeijer saw it he seemed disappointed when i reached him he muttered its the ship its coming in he was going to lose all his customers i told him to send someone to look after dempsey and then i ran from the hotel towards the park my intention was to guide the ship to her mast to my astonishment there were already uniformed men on the ground i rushed towards one they must have parachuted from the ship thank god youve come i said the nearest figure turned i looked into the expressionless face of a captain in the imperial japanese army go back inside he said tell them that if anyone attempts to leave the building it will be bombed to rubble lost hopes we were never to discover how the japanese had found us either they had traced the wireless messages or they had trailed and destroyed the rescue ship the fact was there was nothing we could do against them soon olmeijers place was full of small soldiers in offwhite uniforms their politeness to their prisoners contrasting with the long bayonets fixed on their rifles the officer had a grim selfcontrolled manner but occasionally it seemed to me an expression of straightforward hatred crossed his face when he looked at us we stood with our baggage in the middle of the floor the women were sent aboard first the japs had managed to get the mast working and had winched the ship to ground level it was a large modern ship i was surprised that they had felt they could spare it merely to pick up a few civilians but i guessed that it had already been patrolling the area when its captain had been alerted to our presence greaves was closer to the windows than i he turned to me my god theyve fired the town he pointed addressing the officer you damned barbarians why did you have to do that barbarians the japanese captain smiled sardonically i am amused you should think that of us englishman after what you did to us we did nothing whatever happened was a mistake it suits you to blame us the captain dismissed this however we have not set fire to the buildings its your own workers a riot of some kind i gather theyre on their way en masse it was credible thinking that they might get free of the island aboard a ship the coolies could have persuaded themselves that it was possible to capture the vessel and sail it to freedom dont worry continued the jap we intend to protect you as well as ourselves his voice pleasant and yet sharp had a degree of contempt in it i saw that greaves was upset by the exchange greaves blustered a little but he could not argue with the mans logic we had far more to fear from the coolies immediately at any rate than from the japanese it was possible to smell the smoke from where we stood and traces of red firelight were reflected in the windows and mirrors of olmeijers the dutchman had given up his despair and was now offering to serve drinks to his new customers i think he had half a hope that rowe island was to be occupied and that he would be allowed to continue to run the hotel the soldiers motioned him to join us at the center of the floor he sat down on one of his own tables i thought he might be going to cry i am dutch he told the officer i am a private hotelier a civilian you cannot just remove me from the place i have spent most of my life building we have orders to arrest all europeans said the japanese and you are most definitely european sir we have nothing against the dutch however if you were to be realistic you would understand that your country is an ally of britain and that it is only a matter of days before you are involved in this war but we are not involved today not as far as i know essentially our mission is to evacuate you from the island and what will happen to us asked greaves still in an aggressive mood you will be interned for the duration of hostilities were not spies neither were those you interned in your south african war youll recall that was entirely different the reasons were complex our reasons are also complex you are foreign belligerents potentially dangerous to our war effort my god and you infer that we are hypocritical you will not deny sir that this is effectively a military base its a mining concern but very useful as a fuelling station we shall be leaving troops behind a garrison this is conquered territory when you go outside you will see that the japanese flag now flies over the airfield then why remove us is it usual practice it has become so you will be interned at the european civilian prisonerofwar camp on rishiri where the hell is rishiri its a small island off the coast of hokkaido said one of the irish priests hokkaido was the large island north of honshu japans main island quite a pretty place as i recollect we did some missionary work there a few years ago the japanese captain smiled youll have to concentrate on europeans now father but you will have plenty of time to make converts im sure greaves fell silent he finished the last of his gin fizz with the air of a man who was not likely to see another again for many years with the women gone the older men were next to be taken from the room the japanese were by no means cruel to us those who were too weak to move easily were helped by soldiers who even carried bundles and suitcases for their prisoners shouldering their rifles in order to do so there was no point in trying to resist them and they knew it the ships guns could have destroyed olmeijers in seconds and we had so many other people to consider a few minutes later the japanese captain went outside and then returned to issue commands to his men the rifles were unshouldered and they ran into the night leaving only one man to guard us we heard shouts then shots a terrible scream which rose and fell then rose again the scream of a mob the coolies olmeijer waddled towards the window we all followed him the guard did not attempt to stop us he stood by the door looking back in some trepidation the red firelight silhouetted the malays and chinese now trying to rush the airship which was defended by a line of welldisciplined japanese soldiers the coolies were badly armed though one or two had rifles and pistols for the most part the best weapons they had been able to muster were parangs and large picks and hammers panic anger and hatred drove them against the riflefire not a bullet was wasted they continued to fall until the corpses of the dead and wounded hampered the advance of those who still lived they appeared to have some sort of rough organization however because they now fell back their efforts were being directed by a figure in a crumpled european suit armed with a pistol i recognized him as he disappeared with the surviving coolies into the darkness how dempsey had managed to leave the hotel in the condition in which id last seen him i didnt know but there he was capering like a maniac trying to help the coolies in their desperate attack they came in from two sides now trying to divide the japanese fire this time two or three soldiers were hit they retreated in order until they were closer to the ship greaves whispered to me this would be our chance to get out of here rush the guard and get into the bush eh i considered this between the japanese and the surviving coolies wed have no chance i said there isnt any food to speak of either youve no guts bastable perhaps but ive a great deal of experience i told him theres quite likely to be an exchange of civilian prisoners of war we could all be in england in a matter of weeks but what if were not my view is that well be better off with the japs for the moment if were going to escape lets escape from somewhere closer to russian territory greaves was disgusted youre not exactly impetuous are you bastable i suppose not i had seen too much of warfare and destruction in three worlds to place much value on romantic impulsive schemes i preferred to bide my time i let greaves think what he liked and noticed that without my agreement he made no attempt to get free of olmeijers the firing outside continued but was more spasmodic below in the town the flames were rising higher firelight was reflected on the white hull of the japanese ship as it swayed slowly at its mast dempsey must have made full use of his stimulants from time to time i saw him sometimes with a pistol sometimes with a parang leaping here and there amongst the shrubs and trees surrounding the airpark he was demented for what obscure perhaps sentimental reasons he had leagued himself with the coolies i could not fathom perhaps he saw hope in turning them against the japanese and saving the europeans but i doubted it in his ragged jacket and trousers he was distinguished from the rabble largely by the fact that he was evidently in control he had been trained in the navy and his old instincts for leadership were coming out the japanese had also identified him and their fire was concentrated against him he was courting their bullets to me it seemed he wanted them to kill him he had been talking of suicide and perhaps this was in his eyes a more positive way of dying nonetheless he showed courage and i could only admire the way he harried the japs sending in coolies from every direction sometimes at once sometimes from a single angle his eyes glittered filled with flames there was a strange cold grin on his lips and for a moment i was consumed by an enormous sense of comradeship for him it was as if i looked at some other incarnation of myself in those dreadful days before i had learned to live with the guilt the pain and the hopelessness of my own situation then dempsey rushed for the ship all the remaining coolies at his back he hacked down two soldiers before they could defend themselves he fenced with the parang warding off bayonets and bullets he took another two of the japanese and had actually reached the gangway into the gondola when both arms lifted as if to some bloodgreedy battlegod he dropped i saw his body lying spreadeagled on the gangway it twitched for a moment or two i didnt know if a bullet had struck him or if the stimulants had caused a stroke the captain sword in hand ran up to the body and turned it over instructing two of his men to drag it inside i heard one of the soldiers utter his name dempsey and i wondered how on earth they could know him with dempsey down the coolies were quickly scattered the captain returned to olmeijers and ordered the rest of us aboard the ship i asked him hows the white man is he shot did he collapse but the captain refused to answer greaves said look here captain you could tell us if dempseys alive or dead the japanese drew in his breath and looked hard at greaves you have certain rights as a civilian prisoner of war captain dempsey also has certain rights however i am not obliged to answer enquiries as to the fate of another prisoner you inhuman devil its not a question of rights but simple decency the japanese captain gestured with his sword and gave a command in his own tongue the guards began to march us out as we left i heard him say if we were not a civilized people none of you would be alive now and captain dempsey would have been torn to pieces by my men the captain seemed mad perhaps he did not enjoy his trade many soldiers did not when real warfare developed i wondered what crime dempsey had committed to make him so loathed by those who believed him guilty of it it was almost certain anyway that he had paid the price of the crime with his life i regretted very much that he had not had time to tell me his own story an hour later we were aloft leaving the remnants of rowe island and its population behind through a small porthole i could see the flames spreading through the town they had even caught some of the foliage small figures ran about in the inferno it was still possible to hear shots as the japanese continued to defend their newly conquered territory our quarters were crowded but not intolerable dempsey was not amongst us everyone assumed he had been killed it was dawn by the time we had gained our cruising altitude most of us were silent dozing to the steady drumming of the engines i suppose we were all wondering what would become of us once we reached the civilian camp on rishiri if the war continued as i had known other wars to continue then it might be years before we were free i realized with no particular dismay that i might even die of old age before this particular conflict were resolved i was almost relieved that in no way was my fate any longer in my own hands part two neither master nor slave the camp on rishiri the civilian prisonerofwar camp was well organized and clean the food was simple and adequate and our treatment was by no means harsh there was a permanent red cross supervisor and a representative of the swiss government who had elected at the invitation of the japanese to act as a sort of umpire there were civilians of most nationalities here and those belonging to neutral countries were efficiently repatriated so long as they could prove their identity and place of origin there were a good many angry poles bohemians and latvians present for instance technically they were russian citizens but vociferously denied their loyalty to any land save their own since poles and czechs were fighting in russian armies there was not a great deal of weight to their protestations i found the mixture of races fascinating and made the most of my imprisonment to learn as much as i could about the world in which i had found myself here was a future in which obean had not existed yet it contained many of the inventions familiar to me in that future where i had originally encountered general o t shaw it seemed that whether they were the work of an individual genius or a variety of hardworking scientists the airships and the sub aquatic boats the electrical wonders the wireless telegraph and so on would nonetheless come into existence at some time in this world britains empire was even larger than in my own certain mainland territories in south and central america were hers as were some parts of what i had known as the southern united states these had been regained it appeared during the american civil war when britain had leant positive support to the confederacy in return for control over coastal regions with the victory of the confederacy it had suited everyone i learned to retain this contact the lands had been leased from the csa for a period of a hundred years this meant that in thirty years time the confederacy would reclaim them i was curious as to whether slavery continued to flourish and learned to my surprise that not only did it not but that economically it had suited everyone to see a strong black middle class emerging in america there was greater racial equality than in my own day north and south were virtually autonomous and these smaller units seemed to have produced greater coherence rather than less although america was not quite so rich in industry not quite so powerful a military nation she seemed in many other ways to have benefited from the truce which had followed the civil war and allowed both sides to recover and begin to trade france on the other hand was no longer a great power she had never recovered from the francoprussian wars germany now controlled much of the old french empire and the french themselves seemed content enough in the main without the responsibilities of their colonies germany had become a close ally of britain although not bound to join in the current conflict she formed part of an alliance with the scandinavian countries a very powerful trading pact which suited everyone austriahungary moldered on a romantic decaying empire constantly in debt constantly being helped out by richer nations the only new great power of any significance was the ottoman empire which had expanded significantly into africa and the middle east to form a strong islamic union greece i learned was all but nonexistent most of her people were now moslems and to all intents and purposes turkish the japanese empire controlled large areas of what had been china and her inroads along borders of the russian empire had been the chief reason for the present struggle i learned why the japanese attacked british targets with far greater ferocity than they attacked others they believed that britain had deliberately started the war with a raid on hiroshima i was reminded of my own part my own guilt in a similar raid when i had sailed aboard the flagship of general shaw if i had known only one world i might have thought that history was repeating itself but i knew that it was human nature which lay at the root of history and that no matter where i found myself i was bound to discover superficial similarities expressing and exemplifying that nature it was human idealism and human impatience and human despair which continued to produce these terrible wars human virtues and vices mixed and confused in individuals created what we called history yet i could see no way in which the vicious circle of aspiration and desperation might ever be broken we were all victims of our own imagination this i had realized in all my strange journeys across what mrs persson calls the multiverse the very thing which makes us human which produces the best is also the thing which will make us behave worse than the maddest wild beast could ever behave we live through example and emulation which can turn into envy if circumstances create for us misfortunes that is all i have come to believe and i am not entirely sure i believe that but i am reconciled to human nature if not to human folly and that is what my own particular misfortunes have achieved for me olmeijer was soon in his element once again he somehow managed to get himself put in charge of the camp shop and ran it with all the grandeur of a chef de la maison at the ritz greaves joined a group of english and australian merchant seamen who had been captured at the fall of shanghai they spent most of their time choosing sides for rugby football games and talking about home i supposed that this was how they managed to avoid thinking too much about the truth of their situation but i could only stand halfanhour or so of their schoolboy stuff i knew very well that not long before my first visit to teku benga i might well have joined in with some enthusiasm i had changed beyond redemption i would never be quite the same as that idealistic and naive young army officer who had first led his men into the mountains in search of the bandit sharan kang i felt indeed like a cross between rip van winkle and the flying dutchman with a touch of the wandering jew besides i sometimes felt that i had lived for as long as the human race had existed quite soon after arriving at the camp i myself fell in with a mixed bag of civilian airshipmen the survivors of a variety of wrecks some had been accidentally shot down others had been rescued by japanese patrols some had simply been lost in the general chaos and wandered into japanese hands i learned that all merchant airships now moved in convoys these days protected by military vessels it was about a week later that harry birchington attached himself to me he was a thinfaced angular man with an awkward unspontaneous way of moving a flat forehead and cheekbones and a reddish discoloration under the eyes of the sort i often identify with a certain mental imbalance he approached me as i came out of olmeijers hut he regarded me he said as a fellow intellectual someone who had a bit more education than most of these riffraff since there were a number of clergymen and academics amongst the prisoners in our compound alone as well as a couple of journalists i did not find his remarks particularly flattering he wore a khaki shirt and a striped tie gray flannel trousers and no matter what the temperature would often have on a tweed sportsjacket with leather patches on the elbows he was a bore he was in fact the camp bore every army unit has one every airship crew has one and every office and factory in the world doubtless has one however birchington was ill admit a bit above the average he drew me across the compound to the wire fence corner leaning against one of the struts of the fence was a short moody slav in a dirty peasant shirt i had seen him before his name was makhno and he was from the ukraine for bizarre idealistic reasons of his own he had elected to make his way to tokyo in the cause of international brotherhood he was an anarchist i gathered of the old kropotkin school and i thought then like most anarchists would rather talk than anything else he was a likeable enough fellow who having failed to convert the camp kept his own counsel birchington introduced us this chaps not too good with the english he said i talk a spot of rooshian but im having trouble getting through to him we were talking about money youre trying to buy something i asked no no money international finance and that aha i exchanged glances with the ukrainian who raised a sardonic eyebrow now im a socialist right continued birchington have been all my life you might ask what we mean by the word socialism and youd be correct in doing so because socialism can mean many different things to many different people he went on in this vein doubtless word for word repeating himself for the nth time there are some people who never appear to realize to what degree they have this habit i have come to believe that it has the effect on them of a soothing lullaby sung to them it has a completely opposite effect of course on anyone attempting to listen to them the anarchist makhno was not bothering to listen it was obvious that he could understand many of the words but that he had instinctively recognized birchingtons type now this chap birchington stabbed an unhealthy finger in makhnos direction would also call himself a socialist i suppose the term would be anarchosocialist that is to say he believes in the brotherhood of man the emancipation of the working classes of the world and so on and so forth he comes after all from a socalled socialist country though what its doing with an emperor still there for all hes got no real power i dont know and hes against his own government the russian government said makhno i am against all governments including the socalled ukrainian rada which is only a puppet of the central government in petersburg just so said birchington dismissing this so youre a socialist and youre against socialists am i right or wrong kerenskys duma is socialist in name only said makhno in deep slavic tones in name only exactly my own point not proper socialists just tories under another name right politicians said makhno laconically thats where youre wrong old chap just because theyre not real socialists doesnt mean that real socialists cant make good politicians i was already trying to extricate myself from this but birchington held on to my arm hang on a minute old man i want you to umpire this one now what do we mean by this word politics of ours see im an engineer by profession and i like to think a pretty good one and to me politics is just a matter of getting the engineering right if you have a machine which functions properly without much attention then its obviously a good machine thats what politics should be about and if the machine has simple working parts which any layman can understand then its as it were your democratic machine am i right or am i wrong crazy said makhno and scratched his nose what youre not right or wrong youre crazy this amused me and makhno could tell but birchington was baffled sane id say he said very sane indeed like a good machine thats sane isnt it whats more sane than a properly functioning steam turbine for instance rationalist nonsense pronounced makhno and rolled the r in that ironic way only slavs have and what about your own romantic twaddle birchington wanted to know blow everything up and start again eh no worse a solution than yours but this is not what i argued its what it comes down to old chap thats your anarchism for you boom and he laughed as one who had never known humor although i felt sorry for makhno i had had quite enough of this with a murmur of vague apology i began to move away to where some of my acquaintances were standing smoking their pipes and talking airship talk which at that moment was preferable to anything birchington had to offer birchington stopped me hang on just a sec old man what i want you to tell me is this without government who makes the decisions the individual said makhno i shrugged given the hypothesis as its put i said our ukrainian friend is absolutely right who else could make a decision just for himself by consensus said makhno ha birchington was triumphant ha and whats that but democratic socialism which is exactly what i believe in i thought you believed in machines couldnt resist this jab birchington missed my small irony as he had missed all makhnos a democratic socialist machine he said as if to a child that is not anarchism said makhno stubbornly but he was not trying to convince birchington if anything he was trying to drive him away i can see some of my pals want a word i said to birchington i winked at makhno and made off but birchington pursued me youre an airshipman by all accounts as are these fellows dont you believe in using the best machinery the engines least likely to let you down the control systems which will work as simply as possible airships arent countries i said unfortunately an unsuspecting second officer from the destroyed duchess of salford heard me without noticing birchington they can be he said like small countries i mean everyone has to learn to get on together i left him to birchington when he realized what he had let himself in for a look of patent dismay crossed his young face i waved at him behind birchingtons back and sauntered off it was to be one of my easier escapes from the bore of rishiri the fact that i was a prisoner and beginning like many others to fret a great deal was bad enough it was purgatory but birchington was making it hell i am still surprised that nobody murdered him he became impossible to avoid at first we tried joshing him to get rid of him and then laughing at him then downright rudeness but it was useless to try to insult him or alter him in his course we would sometimes offend him but he would either laugh it offer if hurt return in a few minutes and i had everyones sympathy because he continued no matter what i said or did to claim me as his closest friend i think that must be why when greaves approached me with his halfbaked escape plan i agreed to join in against all common sense he and his fellow rugger enthusiasts meant to go under the wire at night and try to capture one of the two japanese motortorpedoboats which had recently anchored in rishiris tiny harbor from there greaves and co intended to try for the russian mainland which had not fallen to the japs there had been a number of attempted escapes of course but all of them had been unsuccessful our guards were vigilant there were two small scouting airships keeping the tiny island under surveillance there were searchlights dogs and the whole paraphernalia of a prison moreover the island was used as a fuelling station for raids against russia so it usually had several large airships at mast near the harbor it was true as greaves argued that no military aerial vessels were in evidence at that moment but i was not sure that as he put it this was the best chance of getting clear well ever have i did believe that there was a small chance of escape as well as a fair chance of being killed or wounded but i argued to myself that even if i were wounded i should spend time in the hospital away from birchington very well greaves i said you can count me in good man he patted my shoulder that night we assembled in twos and threes at olmeijers shop the dutchman was not in evidence he would have been too portly to squeeze himself into the tunnel greaves and his rugger chums had been digging it was usual to meet in the hut in the evening to play table tennis or the variety of board games supplied by the red cross we had only occasional trouble from the guards who were inclined to look in on us at random because they did not check our numbers we stood a fair chance of all getting down the tunnel before they suspected anything a few of the airshipmen had elected to stay behind to cover us greaves was to go first and i was to go last one by one the men disappeared into the earth and it was as i was about to follow them that i realized fate was almost certainly singling me out for unusual punishment birchington walked through the door of the hut i was halfway down i think i remember smiling at him weakly my lord old man what are you up to he asked then he brightened an escape eh good show a secret is it shant breath a word i take it anyone can join in urn i said actually greaves my pal greaves eh his idea jolly good thats all right with me old man i trust greaves implicitly and hed want me along one of the airshipmen near the window hissed that a couple of guards were on their way i ducked into the tunnel and began to wriggle along it there was no time to argue with birchington i heard his voice behind me make way for a little un i knew that he had joined me in the tunnel before the light vanished as the airshipmen above replaced the floorboards i seemed to crawl for eternity with birchington muttering and apologizing constantly bumping into my feet criticizing what he called the poor engineering job of the tunnel he wondered why they hadnt thought of asking him for his expert help we emerged into sweetsmelling darkness behind us were the wire and the lights of the camp we were close to the earth road which wound down to the harbor greaves and the merchant seamen were whispering and gesticulating in the darkness just as if they were still choosing sides for a game birchington said in a voice which seemed unnaturally loud even for him whats the problem need a volunteer greaves came up to me urgently good god man why did you tell him i didnt he found out just as the guards were on their way i thought you could do with an extra chap said birchington so i volunteered dont forget im an expert engineer i heard someone curse and murmur shoot the blighter birchington of course was oblivious greaves sighed wed better start getting down to the harbor if were separated he was interrupted by the unmistakable sounds of airship engines high overhead damn that complicates things the sound of the engines grew louder and louder and it was evident that the ships were coming in lower we began to duck and weave through the shrubs and trees at the side of the road heading for the harbor then suddenly there was light behind us and gunfire the steady pounding of artillery a dying scream as a bomb descended some distance from the camp up the road came several trucks full of soldiers as well as a couple of armored cars and some motorbicycles the firing continued until i realized that the ships were attacking something whizzed past me just above my head it felt like a oneman glider these ingenious devices were far more manageable than parachutes in landing troops it seemed there was a raid on and we had become caught in the middle of it greaves and his lads decided not to vary from their plan well use the confusion he said birchington called i say steady on perhaps we should wait and see what no time shouted greaves we dont know what this is all about lets get to that boat but suppose shut up birchington i said i was prepared to follow greaves lead i felt i had little choice now wait cried the engineer lets just stop and think for a minute if we keep our heads youre about to lose yours to a samurai sword called greaves now for gods sake shut up birchington either stay where you are or come with us quietly quietly i wonder what you mean to say when you say his droning voice was a greater source of fear than any bombs or bullets we all put on an excellent burst of speed by now machineguns were going both from the ground and from the rear i have never prayed before for another human beings death but i prayed that night that somebody would take birchington directly between the eyes and save us the japanese were all making for the camp as a result we were lucky they werent looking for escaped prisoners just yet even when we were spotted we were taken for enemy soldiers we were shot at but we were not pursued we reached the outskirts of the town getting through the streets unobserved was going to be the difficult part again we were lucky in that whatever was going on behind us was diverting all troops all attention it was birchington crying i say you fellows wait for me that brought us the greatest danger a small detachment of japanese infantry heard his voice and immediately began to fire along the alley we had entered greaves went down together with a couple of others i kneeled beside greaves i tested his pulse he had been shot in the back of the head and was quite dead another chap was dead also but the survivor was only slightly wounded he got his arm over my shoulder and we continued to make for the harbor by this time we were fairly hysterical and were yelling wildly at birchington as japanese soldiers opened fire again behind us shut up you damned fool greaves is dead dead he should have been more careful shut up birchington we got to the quayside and went straight into the water as planned swimming for the nearest boat a white and red blur in the misty electric light from the harbor i heard birchington behind me i say you chaps i say didnt your realize i couldnt swim this intelligence seemed to lend me greater energy supporting the wounded man i swam slowly towards the mtb some of the seamen were already climbing its sides i was relieved to hear no further gunshots perhaps we had managed to surprise them after all by the time i eventually got to the mtb a rope ladder had been thrown down for me i lifted the wounded man on to it holding it while he ascended i think i could still hear birchingtons dreadful cries from the harbor i say chaps hang on a minute can somebody send a boat to fetch me i hardened my heart at that moment i must admit i didnt give a fig for birchingtons life by the time i reached the deck i was gasping with exhaustion i looked around me expecting to see captured japanese sailors instead i saw the white uniforms of russian navy personnel a young lieutenant his cap on the side of his head his tunic unbuttoned a revolver and a saber in his hands saluted me with his sword welcome aboard sir he said in perfect english he grinned at me with that wild careless grin which only russians have we both appear to have had the same idea he said i am lieutenant pyatnitski at your service we took this boat only twenty minutes before you arrived and the airships back there russian we are rescuing the prisoners i hope at this very moment youre using an awful lot of stuff for a few prisoners i said while the prisoners are on the island said pyatnitski pragmatically we cannot bomb the fuelling station one of the english seamen said poor bloody greaves he died for absolutely nothing i leaned on the rail from the quayside i could still hear birchingtons awful voice pleading and desperate the wailing of a frightened child back in service if someone had told me before i ever entered the temple of teku benga that i should one day be glad to join the russian service i should not only have laughed at them i should if they had persisted probably have punched them on the nose in those days russia was the greatest menace to our frontiers in india there was often the threat of open war for it was wellknown that they had territorial ambitions in afghanistan if nowhere else the fact that the japanese empire and the russian empire had clashed over which parts of southeast asia and china came under their control was probably fortunate for the british the war might well have taken a different turn with japan and britain as allies if russian ambitions had not in this world been diverted towards the crumbling remains of the chinese empire a great deal of the reason for this of course was kerensky himself the old president of russia was anxious to keep the friendship of europe and america and this meant that he had become extremely cautious about offending us russia needed to import a great many manufactured goods even now and she needed markets for her agricultural produce moreover she required as much foreign investment as she could get and was especially interested in attracting british and american capital she had taken huge steps forward since the successful and almost bloodless revolution of which had occurred at a time when another war between russia and japan was brewing her brand of humanist socialism had produced almost universal literacy and her medical facilities were amongst the best in the world she had produced a thriving and liberal middle class and it was very rare these days to encounter the kind of poverty for which russia when i was a boy was famous ah in all even amongst the most conservative people there was no doubt that russia and her dominions were much improved for kerensky and his socialists whatever the historical reasons there was nothing dishonorable in joining the russians against our common enemy when sub aquatic liner took us first to vladivostok and then by airship to khabarovsk i wondered how long it would be before i could begin doing something again the imprisonment alone had left me frustrated when news came through that any british citizens with airship experience were needed for the aerial arm of the russian volunteer fleet and that whitehall was actively encouraging us to join up i put my name down immediately and as did most of the chaps i was with those few of us like myself with military experience were given the choice of serving on armed merchantmen flying in convoys or on the escorting aerial frigates and cruisers themselves i elected to join the frigates i had no particular urge to kill my fellow men but something in me felt it wanted to take something less than a passive role through the rest of this particular war i have learned from my experiences that the politicians of any one country against any other can manufacture hatred and racial antagonism so i was no longer the patriot i had been personally however and i know now that this was an infantile impulse i felt that i had been put to a great deal of trouble by the japanese and i might as well fight them as anyone else i also i must admit rather hoped there would not be too much conflict i wanted to fly good fast ships and here at last was my chance we had a twoweek training program in and around samara in which we learned the specifics of the russian ships which were mainly built and equipped according to the designs of the great engineer sikorski and at that time were amongst the most modern in the world then we were assigned to various ships to get general experience i joined the aerial cruiser vassarion belinsky she was a fine easily handled ship sailing out of the great lermontov airpark a few miles to the north of odessa that marvelous cosmopolitan seaport from which have come so many fine russianspeaking poets novelists painters and intellectuals i had a few days leave in odessa before we sailed and i enjoyed those days to the full being on the black sea the port was relatively untouched by the war and there was more merchant shipping in her harbors than there was naval her streets were crowded with people of every color and nation she smelled of spices of the food of the five continents and there was a merry carefree quality about her even in wartime which seemed to me to exemplify the very best of the slavic soul odessa has a large jewish population and so is full of music intelligent commercial enterprise and romance i fell in love with her immediately i know of no other city quite like her and often wish that i could have spent longer exploring her winding streets her avenues and promenades her resorts and watering places she is not strictly speaking a russian city she is ukrainian and the ukrainians will insist that the goatbeards are interlopers that kiev capital of the ukraine is the true center of slavic culture that the muscovites are upstarts parvenus johnnycomelatelies tyrants imperialists thieves carpetbaggers and almost anything else of the kind you care to think of it is true that the central government of moscow has most power over the ukraine but there is a spirit about odessa which i think denies any of its denizens allegations in odessa i learned a great deal about the progress of the war on land the japanese had made many early gains but were now being beaten back by russian and british infantry indeed they had held less territory than before the war they were still pretty powerful in the air and at sea and were masters of strategy but all in all we were optimistic about the way the conflict was turning for the dutch and portuguese were also on out side and although their navies were not large they were extremely capable it is certain that the war would have been as good as over if it had not been for russias domestic problems these tended amongst odessas population to be a more important topic than the war itself perhaps because of the war there was a threat of revolution in several parts of the ussr indeed whole parts of the ukraine were currently in the hands of large armies calling themselves free cossacks many of them deserters from various cavalry regiments i gathered that they were intense slavophils opposed to kerenskys europeanisation of their lands were nationalists in that they argued for the independence of all territories currently making up the russian empire bohemia moravia poland finland latvia estonia bulgaria and so on their policies and demands seemed vague though socialistic in terminology even when i heard them discussed from all aspects but if it was possible to argue forever about the interpretation of their ideology all agreed to a degree of fascination with the leading personality amongst the revolutionists the mysterious man known popularly as the steel tsar he was believed to have come originally from georgia and his real name was thought to be josef vissarionovich djugashvili an expriest with a record of messianism he was known as the steel tsar because he tended to wear an ancient metal helmet covering most of his face there were many explanations of this some thought him disfigured in battle others thought that his features had been hideously deformed since birth he was supposed to have a withered arm be a hunchback have artificial legs and to be not a human being at all but some sort of automaton because of the atmosphere surrounding djugashvili i myself became quite as curious about him as the natives i followed the news of the free cossacks as eagerly as i followed news of the british airship battles in the skies of the pacific in odessa i met one of the chaps with whom i had been imprisoned he was about to join a british merchantman he told me that birchington too was working for the russians but he wasnt sure where some sort of engineering job i gather olmeijer was in yalta managing a stateowned hotel the worst news however concerned dempsey i heard he jumped it before we ever got to japan seemed so scared of what theyd do to him that wounded as he was he preferred to dive out god knows why they hated him so do you have any idea bastable i shook my head but again i experienced that peculiar frisson a sort of recognition as if somewhere within me i actually knew what dempsey had done my experience of odessa was as intense as it was brief and i missed it when i left for the airpark on the train as if i had lived there for years the vassarion belinsky was a joy she used liquid ballast which could like her gas be heated or cooled to alter her weight and her ascent acceleration was if we needed it rocketlike in its speed she had a topspeed of mph but could be pushed quite a bit faster than that with a good wind behind her she could turn and dive like a porpoise and there was almost nothing you couldnt do with her all the crew except me was russian captain l v leonov was a thoroughly experienced airshipman with an excellent grasp of english my own russian was naturally limited but enough to receive and convey the appropriate orders england had for many years maintained herself as successfully in the air as she had on the sea so that most airshipmen tended to use english as their first language while aloft as we left lermontov airpark on a cool sunny dawn gaining height through a slow gentle curve which revealed more and more of the steppe through our observation ports captain leonov broke open his orders on the control deck and standing with his back to our helmsman informed his officers of the belinskys mission i was not the only one both surprised and disappointed it seemed that we were victims of a typical piece of muscovite bureaucratic muddle and there i was with absolutely nothing i could do about it leonovs heavy russian face was sober and his voice sonorous as he began to read the orders with typical russian courtesy he spoke english for my benefit we are to proceed at all fastest speed to yekaterinaslav which is currently sustaining heavy attack from rebel forces we are to join other ships under the command of air admiral krassnov he pinched his eyebrows together it was obvious that he had no taste for the commission which would involve him in giving orders which would inevitably lead to the death of other russians everyone was agitated by the news they had been expecting to defend their country against the japanese instead they were assigned to domestic policing duties of a kind which all the officers found distasteful and demeaning i did not really mind missing a scrap with the japanese but i was bitterly sorry that i was unlikely to see any real aerial action i had joined the service out of a mixture of desperation and boredom i appeared to be doomed to a continuation of those circumstances moreover i should sooner or later have blood on my hands and it would be the blood of people i had absolutely nothing against i had no idea of the issues socialists are always quarrelling amongst themselves because of the strong element of messianism in their creeds and i could see little difference between kerenskys brand or djugashvilis my only consolation was that at least i might have the opportunity of observing the steel tsar at first hand pilniak a nd lieutenant of about my own age with huge brown eyes and a rather girlish face grasped my uniformed shoulder and laughed well mr bastable youre going to see some cossacks eh a bit of the reality most europeans miss he dropped his voice and became sympathetic does that bother you the steel tsar rather than the mikado not a bit i said after all i thought wickedly i had originally been trained to fight russians but i have never been able to find consolation in cynicism for long and this lasted a few seconds perhaps well find out if hes human or not pilniak became serious hes human and hes cruel this whole thing is essentially mediaeval in its overtones for all they claim to be socialists and nationalists they want to put the clock back to the days of ivan the terrible they could destroy russia and everything the revolution achieved there have even been instances of pogroms in one or two of the towns theyve taken and god alone knows whats going on in the rural districts they should be stopped as quickly as possible but theyre gaining popular support all the time war brings out these basic feelings they are not always controllable our newspapers beat the drum of slavophilia of nationalism in an effort to stir up patriotic feeling against the japanese and this happens you seem to speak as if this uprising was inevitable i think it was kerensky promised us heaven on earth many years ago and now we find that not only have we not made heaven but also we are threatened with hell in the form of invasion this war will leave many scars mr bastable our country will not be the same when it is over the steel tsar is a genuine threat what he represents mr bastable is a genuine threat cossack revolutionists yekaterinaslav was soon below us and it was obvious that the city was undergoing attack we could see smoke and flames everywhere little groups of figures running hither and yonder in the suburbs the occasional boom of cannon fire or the tiny snapping noises of rifleshots yekaterinaslav was an old russianstyle city with many of its buildings made of wood tall houses with elaborately carved decoration the familiar oniondomes of churches spires steeples several brickbuilt apartment blocks and shops near the center on the nearby dnieper river most of the boats were burning or had been sunk occasionally a ship its paddles foaming the water would go by the city and sometimes it would loose off a shell or two evidently these were naval ships commandeered by the revolutionists pilniak knew yekaterinaslav pretty well he stood beside me naming streets and squares some distance from the city amongst demolished farmhouses and ruined fields we saw the main cossack camp a mixture of all kinds of tents and temporary shacks including more than one railway carriage for the main railway line ran to yekaterinaslav and much of its stock had been captured thats it said pilniak in some excitement the free cossack host impressive you must admit he raised binoculars to his eyes most of their heavy artillery is further down the line along with their armored vehicles theyre saving up the cavalry for the final charge there must be ten thousand horses down there not much good against airships i said they look a pretty unruly mob to me wait until you see them fight then youll know what cavalry tactics are all about as a matter of fact it did my heart good to hear someone talking in those terms the last time i had heard people discussing cavalry tactics had been in the mess in my own world of you talk as if youre on their side i said he paused lowering his glasses then he said seriously everything free in the russian heart is represented by our cossacks every yearning we have is symbolized by their way of life they are cruel they are often illiterate and they are certainly unsophisticated by petersburg standards but they are they are the cossacks the central government should never have imposed conscription they would have volunteered in time but they wanted to show that they were making their own decisions not petersburgs this rebellion came about as the result of conscription i had not heard this mentioned in odessa it is one reason there are many traditionally the cossacks have enjoyed a certain amount of autonomy when the tsars tried to take it away they always found themselves in trouble they have large communities we call them hosts which elect their own officers their own leader the ataman and are very touchy mr bastable about these things apparently i said so in destroying this rebellion you feel you are in some way destroying your own sense of freedom of romance i think so said pilniak he shrugged but we have our orders huh i sighed i did not envy him his dilemma the cossacks had sighted the ship there was some sporadic artillery fire from the ground a few rifle shots but luckily they had little or no antiaircraft weaponry the poor devils would be sitting ducks for our bombs the ship was turning slowly heading for the airpark on the southern side of the city here we were to rendezvous with the other ships of the volunteer fleet pilniak continued to peer through his binoculars looks as if theyre missing he said they know they havent much time now theyre going to try to take the city entirely with cavalry its not the first time theyve done it but they have covering fire to some extent and some armored battle cars whos defending yekaterinaslav i asked i think we dropped some infantry a couple of days ago and theres some artillery too as you can see they were only sent to hold out until we arrived if im not mistaken now we could see the airpark there were already halfadozen goodsized ships tethered at mast those are troopcarriers he said pointing to the largest by the way theyre sitting in the air id say they still had most of their chaps on board even as he spoke the captain came on deck behind us and saluted us gentlemen we have our wireless orders we approached him he was mopping his brow with a large brown handkerchief he seemed to be barely in control of his own agitation we are to proceed in squadron with three other ships let by the afanasi turchaninov and there we shall release our bombs on the rebel camp before they can move their horses out he was plainly sickened by the statement whatever the cossacks had done however cruel they were however insane in their ambitions they did not deserve to die in such a manner his announcement was greeted with silence throughout the control deck the captain cleared his throat gentlemen we are at war those soldiers down there are just as much enemies of russia as the japanese they could be said to be a worse enemy for they are traitors turning against their country in her hour of greatest need he spoke with no real authority it would not have mattered a great deal if the horsemen were japanese it still seemed appallingly unsporting to do what we were about to do i felt that fate had once again trapped me in a moral situation over which i had no control some of my fellow officers were beginning to murmur and scowl pilniak saluted captain leonov sir are we to place bombs directly on the cossacks those are our orders could we not simply bomb around them sir said another young officer give them a fright those are not our orders kostomarov but sir we are airshipmen we we are servants of the state insisted the captain and the state demands we bomb the cossacks he turned his back on us drop to two hundred feet height coxswain two hundred feet sir the grumbling continued until the captain whirled round his face red with anger to your posts gentlemen bombardiers look to your levers grimly we did as we were instructed from the masts which were now behind us there floated up three other ships two positioned themselves on our port and starboard while the leader went ahead of us there was a funereal atmosphere about the whole operation as he gave his orders the captains voice was low and bleak the wireless began to buzz our operator lifted his instrument it is the flagship sir he told the captain the captain came to the equipment and began to listen he nodded once or twice and then gave fresh orders to the helmsman he seemed almost cheerful gentlemen he said the cossacks are already charging our job will now be to try to break them up the task was hardly congenial but anything had begun to seem better than bombing a camp at least it would be a moving target the black ships i very much doubt moorcock that you will ever know the experience of confronting a cossack battlecharge or indeed that you will ever witness it from the control deck of a sophisticated aerial cruiser led by admiral krassnovs flagship we raced lower and lower to the ground to give specific accuracy to our aerial torpedoes as we approached we were barely fifty feet up and ahead of us was a mountain of black dust in which were silhouetted the massed forms of men and horses this at least felt more like a fair fight standing on the bridge peering forward captain leonov issued the command let go volley number one levers were depressed and from their tubes in the bow of the gondola aerial torpedoes buzzed towards the yelling cossack host the torpedoes made a highpitched noise as their stubby wings sliced the air and then a deepthroated boom sounded as they entered the cossack ranks yet for all they were inevitably deadly the torpedoes hardly seemed to make a scrap of difference to the momentum of the charge next as the riders passed below us we released our bombs lifting to about a hundred and fifty feet as we did so and then dipping down again to fire off another volley of torpedoes the ship creaked to the helmsmans rapid turning and returning of the wheel to the height coxswains sure hand on his valvecontrols ive never flown in a tighter ship and as we do our bloody work i prayed for the chance of a real engagement with ships of equal maneuverability the cossacks split ranks as we came down on them again and at first it seemed they were in panic then i realized they were tactical breaks to move out of our direct line of fire they showed enormously disciplined horsemanship now i understood what pilniak had been talking about and admiring such courage and skill i felt even less pleased with myself for what i was involved in on a wireless order from the flagship we released the last of our bombs and went rapidly aloft now we could see the results of our attack dead and dying men and horses were strewn everywhere the ground was pitted with craters scattered with red flesh and broken bones it was sickening pilniak had tears in his eyes i blame that staretz for this the mad priest djugashvili hes not a socialist hes a lunatic nihilist throwing away those poor lads lives its common enough to transfer ones own guilt onto an easy villain but i was bound to agree with him about the socalled steel tsar not for the first time however i wished that the airship had never been conceived its capacity for destruction was horrifying on the bridge captain leonov was pale and silent he gave his orders in quiet tense russian whenever my eyes met those of one of my fellow airshipmen it seemed we shared the same thoughts this could be the beginning of civil war there is no kind more distressing no kind which so rapidly describes the pointlessness of human killing human i have been fated for a reason i cannot comprehend or for no reason at all to witness the worst examples of insane warfare and having to listen to the most ridiculous explanations as to its necessity from otherwise perfectly rational people i have long since become weary moorcock of the debate if i appear to you to be in a more reconciled mood than when your grandfather first met me it is because i have learned that no individual is responsible for war that we are all at the same time individually responsible for the ills of the human condition in learning this and i am about to tell you how i learned it i learned a certain tolerance for myself and for others which i had never previously possessed we had not managed to halt the cossack charge even though we had weakened it as we returned to the airpark i saw the second stage of our strategy on the outskirts of the city the larger troop carriers were releasing their cargo each soldier fell from the great gondolas on his own thin wings in rough formation the airborne infantry began to glide towards the earth guiding themselves on pairs of silken sails to the ground where they reformed folded their wings into their packs and marched towards the trenches already prepared for them next on large parachutes artillery pieces were landed and moved efficiently to their positions as the cossack host approached the suburbs it was met by a sudden burst of fire i heard rifles and machineguns the boom of howitzers and field guns pilniak said to me i wish i was down there with them i merely wished that i were nowhere near yekaterinaslav does the steel tsar lead his own charges i asked perhaps i was hoping that the man had at least died for his folly they say he does pilniak grimaced but who can be sure hes quite an old man i gather i wonder how a georgian priest became a cossack ataman i said doesnt that seem strange to you hes been in this part of the world for years a cossack is a kind of person not a member of a race as such they elect their leaders as i told you he must have courage and he must have a powerful personality also i suspect he has the knack of appealing to peoples pride the central government has humiliated the cossacks who know that if they had not supported the revolution it would have collapsed the revolution started where our old uprisings always used to start here in the south on the borderlands it could have degenerated into pogroms and civil slaughter but the cossacks had been mistreated by the tsar used badly in the war against japan so they sided with the socialists and helped establish the first effective parliament our duma which in turn caused tsar nicholas to abdicate it was cossacks who seated kerensky in the presidential chair it was cossacks who put his picture in place of the tsars you and your icons i began but pilniak was in full impassioned stride naturally the cossacks feel humiliated by kerensky they gave him the power in return for their own autonomy they see him as betraying them as attacking their freedoms on that day in october when he stood before the duma and the representatives of all the cossack hosts he spoke of eternal liberty for the cossacks now he appears to be making exactly the same mistakes tsar nicholas made and is paying the price you seem confused in your loyalties i said im loyal to our socialist ideals kerensky is old perhaps he takes poor advice i dont know i looked back at the carnage astonished that those wild atavistic horsemen could have so much influence on the course of modern history if it was true that they had only demanded their own freedom rather than political power as such then it was not surprising that they felt betrayed by those they had supported there were many peoples who had shared their experience throughout history djugashvili promises them their old liberties back said pilniak bitterly and the only freedom he actually brings is the freedom of death hes still a peasant priest at heart they curse russia they have something which the russian people find hard to resist hope i said dryly once yes but now our country has almost universal literacy a free medical service which is the envy of the world our living standards are higher than most we are prosperous why should they need a staretz they expected heaven you said so yourself your socialist duma appears to have provided them only with earth a familiar reality however improved pilniak nodded we slavs have always hoped for more but until kerensky we achieved far less what could the steel tsar do for us remove personal responsibility i said pilniak laughed we have never been fond of that you anglosaxons have the lions share eh i failed to take his point seeing this pilniak added kindly we are still ruled in some ways by our church we are a people more cursed by religion and its manifestations and assumptions than any other the steel tsar with his messianic socialism offers us religion again perhaps you english have never had quite the same need for god we have known despair and conquest too often to ignore him altogether he shrugged old habits mr bastable religion is the panacea for defeat we have a great tendency to rationalize our despair in mystical and utopian terms i began to understand him and your cossacks are prepared to kill to achieve that dream rather than accept kerenskys philosophy of compromise they are to be fair also prepared to die for the dream he said they are children they are old believers in that sense not long ago all russians were children if djugashvili has his way theyll become children again kerenskys mistake has always been that he has refused to become a patriarch or as you said an icon he smiled though hes come close in his time petersburg socialism seems cold to the likes of our cossacks who would rather worship personalities than embrace ideas i shared his irony you make them sound like americans we all have it in us mr bastable particularly in times of stress the cruisers were nearing the masts now and making ready to anchor captain leonov reminded us of our duties and we returned to our posts on the bridge we were never to dock as the sun began to sink over the steppe filling the landscape with that soft russian twilight pilniak pointed with alarm to the east ships sir he shouted to the captain about ten of them they were moving in rapidly mediumsized warships black from crown to gondola without insignia or markings of any kind and as they flew they fired we had only our light guns and no bombs or torpedoes left before attacking us these ships had evidently waited until we had spent our main firepower one of the other cruisers received a terrific bombardment so heavy that it was knocked sideways in the air the moment before its mooring cables linked with the mast it made an attempt to come up nosefirst but explosive shells struck hull and gondola with enormous force one or two of its guns went off and were answered by an even fiercer barrage they must have hit fuel supplies for fire burst out in the starboard stern of her gondola she was holed too and jerking like a harpooned whale as she dropped towards the buildings of the airpark fell against a mast scraped down it and collapsed uselessly on the ground ground crew ran rapidly towards her preparing to fight the fire and save her complement if they could hastily captain leonov ordered our gunners to their various positions about the gondola whose ships are they i shouted to pilniak he shook his head i dont know but theyre evidently not japanese theyre fighting for the cossacks captain leonov was at the wireless equipment conferring with krassnovs flagship which we could see was receiving a heavy bombardment the black ships appeared to single out one of our vessels at a time he spoke rapidly in russian da da ya panimayu then two thousand feet height coxswain full speed minimum margin this means we were going to have to hang on to our heads and stomachs as the ship began to shoot upwards we clung to the handrails as we climbed we also turned to bring our larger recoilless thirtypounders to bear on the black ships below it was a beautiful piece of airmanship and it was rewarded almost immediately as we scored two good hits on one of the leading enemy craft though my head was swimming i was elated this was what i had joined the service for two enemy ships split away from the fleet and began to come up towards us but without the speed the efficiency or the sheer skill of the vassarion belinsky we had little else at that point but our superior airmanship for we were outgunned and outnumbered we continued to rise but at a slower rate still firing down on the two black ships which swam upwards implacable and deadly like sharks moving in for the kill we reached the clouds forward at halfspeed captain leonov instructed the helmsman he was very calm now and there was a peculiar little smile on his face evidently he preferred this kind of fighting no matter how dangerous to the sort we had first been forced to take part in cut engines ordered the captain we were now drifting partially hidden by the clouds inaudible to our enemies are we going to engage them sir pilniak wanted to know leonov pursed his lips i think we might have to lieutenant pilniak but i want to get us as much advantage as possible turn the main vanes two points to port helmsman the ship began to come about slowly another two points said the captain his eyes were cold and hard as he peered into the cloud another point we had almost made a complete turn engines active said leonov full speed ahead our diesels shrieked into life as we plunged into the open sky again it was a gray limbo with clouds below us and the darkening heavens above we might well find ourselves fighting at night using our searchlights to seek out antagonists it would be a game of hideandseek which could last until dawn or even longer captain leonov was plainly preparing for this attempting to buy time by now our surviving sister ships would have attempted the same tactics we had little choice for we were all but helpless in any kind of direct engagement cut engines again we were drifting waiting for a sight of the black ships a wind was striking our outer cables making them sing stars had begun to appear overhead pilniak shivered its as if the worlds ceased to exist he murmured then we spotted them below and about halfamile ahead they had seen us as well and were coming up rapidly engines full again our diesels screamed three points starboard hard helmsman we swung so that we faced the black ships sideon fire all guns we offered them a broadside which was in my view a masterpiece of gunnery sending a stream of shells in a vector towards both ships which were sailing virtually sidebyside we hit one badly evidently damaging its engines because it began to turn in the wind virtually out of control we had no explosive shells and the enemy hulls could resist everything but a closerange total hit from our guns so we were concentrating on their engines and their controlvanes it was the best we could do the second ship began to go to cover in the lower clouds and now we could see that it was in wirelesstelephone contact with its companions for as the wounded ship withdrew two more started to ascend we could see nothing of our own sisterships and had to assume that they had taken evasive action or had been brought down the gondola shook violently and i nearly lost my footing as our hull received at least one direct hit rapid descent height coxswain ordered our captain we fell through the skies like a stone until we were actually below the enemy craft slowing it seemed to me just before we struck the ground full speed astern we raced backwards over a deserted steppe the city and the cossacks were nowhere to be seen captain leonov had chosen his own area of battle the black ships were in hot pursuit attempting to imitate our tactics one of the ships did not pull up in time she hit the ground with a massive thump her gondola and all aboard her must have been smashed to fragments she began to bump upwards again and we could see that she had left a great deal of debris behind she was nothing but a drifting hulk leonov seized his chance well use her for cover get behind her if you can helmsman forward halfspeed one point to port just as we swam in beside the ruined ship her companions guns began to go off they hit the hulk and shells burst all over her but we received only minor concussion we moved up over her all our cannon going at once and again we managed to damage vanes and engines on the nearest warship it was getting dark searchlights suddenly came on blinding us as we stood on the bridge captain leonov gave the order to switch on our own electrics it would make us visible to the enemy but at least we would not be entirely blinded give them another broadside said captain leonov quietly our guns sought the source of the searchlights and we saw the last black ship begin to retreat upwards perhaps trying to lure us into pursuit captain leonov smiled a grim experienced smile and shook his head halfspeed ascent engines slow astern we climbed away from our enemy into the clouds again our captains superb tactics mightily impressed me pilniak was elated in spite of himself thats showing them what real air fightings all about he said he clapped me on the shoulder what do you think mr bastable i was not naturally capable of the same display of emotion as the russian but i turned grinning and shook him by the hand ive never seen anything like it i said the black ship had extinguished her searchlights and had vanished we must wait until morning now i think said captain leonov thank you gentlemen you are an excellent crew the halfmoon was now visible seemingly huge in the sky again the captain gave the order to stop all engines the russians were cheering and hugging one another absolutely delighted by what could only be considered a victory against almost impossible odds it was an hour or two later as we rested and debated the mornings moves as our operator attempted to get wireless instructions from yekaterinaslav and then when that failed from kharkov that the ship was suddenly shaken by an almighty thump at first we thought we had been hit but the ship was moving strangely in the air and had not descended a fraction if anything we had gained a little height we were asking ourselves what had happened when captain leonov came racing from his cabin glaring upwards it was as if he alone knew what had happened id never have believed it he said theyre better than i guessed what is it sir i asked an old tactic mr bastable theyve been following us all along using nothing but their steering gear to keep track of us drifting as weve drifted but whats happened sir grappling clamps mr bastable theyre sitting on our crown their gondola to our hull like a huge damned parasite were captured he grimaced i think its more in the nature of a forced marriage mr bastable he shook his head his fingers stroking his mouth my fault its the one tactic i didnt anticipate if they get through our inspection hatches he began to issue more commands in russian rifles and pistols were broken out of our tiny arsenal and a gun put into every hand everyone to the inspection hatches cried pilniak prepare to repel boarders i had never heard that phrase used before above us the enemy ships engines were shrilling now as we were borne forward all engines full astern said the captain he turned to me it could rip them and us apart but we have no choice i fear the ship began to shake as if it was undergoing a gigantic fit through the quivering companionways we raced for the inspection hatches listening carefully through the general row and hearing noises from inside the hull which could only be men climbing slowly down towards us to fire upwards into the inspection tunnels risked a gasescape and the possibility of being incapacitated by the fumes fewer than half our riggers were issued with breathing equipment for the vassarion belinsky had never expected to be captured by boarders were going to have to shoot when they emerge said pilniak it will be our only chance i held my revolver at my side four of five armed riggers with rifles stood immediately behind me in the narrow passage as the ship shuddered and wailed in her efforts to free herself from our captors pilniak said it was a daring move of theirs who could have guessed theyd try it theyre as likely to destroy their own ship as they are ours i said pilniak offered me one of his wild russian grins exactly he said the hatch cover had begun to open we readied our firearms a question of attitudes in the dim moonlight entering from the overhead ports it was impossible to identify the figures that first broke through in russian pilniak ordered them to throw down their arms or we should open fire then we noticed that they were waving a piece of bed sheet on a stick a white flag they wished to parley pilniak was disconcerted he told the invaders to hold their position while he sent for orders one of the riggers ran back along the passage towards the control deck the men in the hatches appeared to be amused and made some cryptic jokes which i failed to understand and which pilniak it seemed to me refused to hear it was pretty obvious to me however that none of us wanted to fight in those close confines few could survive i think captain leonov had realized this for he returned with the rigger pilniak told him what was going on he nodded and then addressed the man holding the white flag you know that this is an impossible situation for both of us is your leader amongst you a small stocky man pushed forward and gave captain leonov a mock military salute i represent these people he said you are the leader we have no leaders you are their spokesman then i think so i am captain leonov commander of this vessel i am nestor makhno speaking for the anarchist cause i was astonished before i could check myself i uttered his name makhno it was the man with whom i had been imprisoned in japan i had never expected to see him again i had no idea that he knew anything at all about airships he recognized me and smiled good evening mr bastable you are once more a prisoner it seems you are not much less of one i remarked he smiled it was a quiet sardonic smile almost gentle he wore an old elaborate cossack coat with a great deal of green and gold frogging an astrakhan hat pulled onto the side of his head a peasant shirt belted at the waist baggy trousers and high riding boots he looked the picture of the romantic cossack of fiction and i had halfanidea that he deliberately cultivated this appearance there was even a cossack sword at his side and one hand toyed with the butt of an automatic pistol stuck into his silverstudded belt you serve the rebel djugashvili i take it said our captain are you trying to talk peace terms ive given that up said makhno it doesnt appear to work you mention peace and everyone tries to shoot you or jail you i do not as it happens serve anyone save those who elect me but we have agreed to give djugashvili our help during this campaign we do not support his ideology only the spirit of the revolution and the spirit of the true cossack we are anarchists we refuse to acknowledge government or despots of any description youd not agree the steel tsar was a despot i said makhno acknowledged my remark with a short bow i would agree absolutely we believe neither in masters nor in slaves mr bastable merely in chaos said pilniak with a sneer anarchy means no government not disorder makhno dismissed pilniaks remarks as those of a naive child and it has nothing whatsoever to do with djugashvilis idiotic socalled socialism we do not support him as i told you we support the spirit of the uprising captain leonov was confused by this information then how do we negotiate what do you want makhno said you are our prisoners we want no bloodshed we would rather have your ship in one piece captain leonov became stern i will not surrender my ship you have little choice said makhno he looked to the outer ports we all followed his gaze on flexible steel ladders dangling from the black ship armed men were clambering down towards our engine nacelles in a few moments your engines will be out of action captain even as he spoke one of our screws stopped turning one by one the other engines stopped from outside in the chill wind came the sound of cheering the captain put his hands in his pockets and spread his legs what now he asked stoically you will admit that you are completely in our power i will admit that you are an expert pirate come now captain this is not piracy we are at war and we have won this particular engagement you are a bandit and you have seized a vessel representing the government of the union of slavic republics that is an act of piracy of rebellion of treason we are indeed at war captain makhno you will recall the enemy i think it is japan a war between authoritarian governments not a war between peoples insisted makhno what sort of socialist are you captain leonov scowled i am not a socialist at all i am a loyal russian well i am not a loyal russian i am an anarchist and as my birthplace seems important to you a ukrainian we oppose all governments and in particular the central government of petersburg in the name of the people captain leonov we demand that you surrender your ship leonov was in a dreadful position he did not wish to waste the lives of his crew and he could not in conscience hand over his command you are a democrat i take it said makhno of course then put it to your men said the anarchist simply do they wish to live or die very well said leonov i will ask them he turned to us gentlemen airshipmen well fight said pilniak if they win let them scrub our blood from the decks not one of us protested makhno accepted this indeed he seemed to have expected nothing else i will give you a chance to debate your position he said he began to move back towards the hatches you cannot escape now we are already carrying you to our headquarters if any of you wishes to join our cause we shall be happy to accept you as brothers captain leonov did not order us to fire we watched as the anarchists retreated pulling the hatches closed behind them it was then that i realized we had been subject to a diversion while we had parleyed we had not given attention to what had been going on outside the ship i think leonov understood this too it was obvious as we returned to the control deck that he did not hold a very good opinion of himself at that moment as an aerial tactician he had no equal as a negotiator he was by no means as successful it seemed that makhno had achieved checkmate without losing a single life on either side helplessly we watched the stars and the clouds go by around us as with engines straining the anarchist airship bore us steadily towards its base on the control deck captain leonov was sending a wireless message through to kharkov attempting to receive instructions and to give some idea of our position eventually after several attempts the operator turned to him they have cut our antennae sir we can neither send nor receive leonov nodded he looked at pilniak and myself well gentlemen have you any suggestions makhno has us completely in his power i said unless we attempt to reach his ship through our inspection hatches we have no way of stopping him leonov bent his head as if in thought when he looked up he was in control of himself i think we can all get some sleep he said i regret that i did not anticipate this particular problem gentlemen and that we have no orders to cover it i think i had better say here and now that i release you from my command it was a strange almost oriental thing to say again it gave me a better insight into the russian temperament than i had a few months before i respected captain leonovs attitude however he was a man of honor who believed that he had failed in his duty he was not giving us carte blanche to act individually as we thought best in a sense i had been extraordinarily impressed by the exchange between makhno and leonov both appeared for all that they seemed to be in conflict to have at root the same sense of duty to those they led once leonov had been proven in his own eyes incompetent he no longer felt that he had any right to command at all i had the feeling that makhno and perhaps many of the cossack atamans took the same view unlike so many politicians or military leaders they made no attempt to justify their mistakes to cling to power for them power held enormous responsibility and was merely invested in them temporarily i was learning i think one or two things about the fundamental issues surrounding russian politics something that was not normally put into words by any side by any observer these issues were at once simpler and more complex than i had once supposed pilniak was saluting thank you sir he said i had no choice but to salute as well leonov returned the salute and then went slowly back to his cabin a notion suddenly came into my head good god pilniak he doesnt intend to shoot himself i hope pilniak watched the departing captain i doubt it mr bastable that too would be cowardly he will resume command should we ask him when there is something to command in the meanwhile he releases us so that we may take whatever actions we think will help us best as individuals to survive we are a primitive people mr bastable in some ways rather like red indians eh in a way if our warleaders fail us they resign immediately unless we insist they continue that is true democratic socialism isnt it im no politician i told him i dont really understand the difference between one ism and another im a simple soldier as ive said more than once i returned with pilniak to our tiny cabin with its two bunks one on top of each other we slept fitfully both of us having merely removed our jackets and trousers by dawn we were up taking coffee in the mess captain leonov was absent a few minutes later he joined us you will be interested to learn he said that we appear to have reached the bandits camp we all rushed out of the mess and up to the observation ports the ship was dropping close to the ground trailing mooring ropes had been dropped from the hull even as we watched we saw a mass of cossack horsemen racing towards the ropes one by one at least halfadozen riders seized them in triumph the cossacks dragged our ship back to their headquarters while makhnos black battle cruiser let go its grapples and drifted some yards off to fly beside us we saw anarchists waving to us from their own gondola i was almost tempted to wave back there was no mistaking makhnos feat he was a very clever man and plainly no fiery charlatan i could make no sense of his politics but i continued to keep a high opinion of his intelligence slowly ignominiously the whooping cossacks hauled our ship to the ground these were evidently not the same men who had attacked yekaterinaslav but it was equally evident that they knew what we had done during the cossack charge i got a better look at them now in the main they were small men swarthy heavily bearded dressed in a mixture of clothing much of it fairly ragged all were festooned with weapons with bandoliers with daggers and swords all rode wonderfully they were plainly rogues but were not by any means mere bandits soon our keel was bumping along the ground as the ship was tied to wooden stakes set for that purpose into the ground on the outskirts of a small onestreet town which seemed to have been taken over piecemeal by the rebels we stood there looking out at the cossacks while they grinned and gesticulated at us they did not seem to be threatening our lives they were overjoyed with the capture of a central government ship and seemed to bear us very little malice i mentioned this to pilniak i agree he said its true they dont hate us but thats the last thing which will stop a cossack from killing you if he so feels like it i realized that we were in somewhat greater danger than i had originally thought the cossacks did not accept the usual conventions concerning a captured enemy and it was questionable now whether or not we should experience the next days dawn captain leonov remained in his cabin as we stared out at our captors the tension in the gondola began to grow overhead we could hear men climbing over our hull laughing and exchanging jokes with the cossacks on the ground eventually pilniak looked at me and the other officers and he said lets get this over with shall we we all agreed pilniak gave the order to lower our gangways and as the side of the gondola opened out we marched in good order down the steps towards the cossacks we had expected everything but the cheer which went up the cossacks are the first to acknowledge nerve when it is displayed as we displayed it perhaps pilniak had known this only captain leonov refused to leave the ship and we accepted his decision pilniak and i were in the forefront as we left the gangway he approached the nearest cossack and saluted lieutenant li pilniak of the volunteer air fleet the cossack said something in a dialect which defeated my imperfect russian he pushed his military cap back on his forehead by way of returning the salute then he made his horse walk backwards in order to clear a space for us waving us on towards the village still rather nervous of what the cossacks might decide on a whim to do we began to walk in doublefile towards the rebel headquarters pilniak was smiling as he spoke and i returned the smile chin up old man is this what the british call showing the flag im not quite sure i said its been a long while since i had occasion to do it the cossacks some mounted some on foot were crowding in on us they were pretty filthy and many of them were evidently drunk ive never smelled so much vodka some of them appeared to have dowsed themselves in the stuff they offered us catcalls and insults as we walked between their lines and we were almost at the first buildings of the village when the press became so tight that we could no longer move it was then that one of our riggers near the rear must have struck out at a cossack and a fight between the two began our carefully maintained front threatened to crack i think we probably would have been torn to pieces if from our right a horsedrawn machinegun cart had not suddenly parted the ranks one man drove the little cart while another discharged a revolver into the air shouting to the cossacks to desist the man with the revolver was nestor makhno back lads he cried to his men weve no grudge against those who misguidedly serve the state only against the state itself he smiled down at me good morning captain bastable so you decided to join us eh i made no reply to this we are heading for your camp i said we accept that we are your prisoners wheres the commander in his cabin sulking no doubt makhno shouted something in dialect to the cossacks and once more the ranks fell back enabling us to continue on through the street until makhnos cart stopped in front of a large schoolhouse which flew the rebel flag a yellow cross on a red field he invited pilniak and myself to join him and told the rest of our chaps that they could get food and rest at a nearby church we were reluctant to part from the crew and fellow officers but we had little choice makhno jumped from the cart and limping slightly escorted us into the schoolhouse here in the main classroom several cossack chiefs awaited us they were dressed far more extravagantly than their men in elaborately embroidered shirts and kaftans with a great deal of silver and gold about their persons and decorating their weapons the strangest sight however was the man who sat at the top of the classroom where the teacher would normally be he lounged forward on the desk his face completely covered by a helmet which had been forged to represent a fierce mustachioed human face only the eyes were alive and these seemed to me to be both mad and malevolent the man was not tall but he was bulky wearing a simple gray moujik shirt gray baggy trousers tucked into black boots he had no weapons no insignia on his costume and one of his arms seemed thinner than the other i knew that we must be confronting the steel tsar himself the rebel leader djugashvili the voice was muffled and metallic from within the helm the english renegade bastable weve heard of you the tones were coarse aggressive the man seemed to me to be both insane and drunk is it good sport then killing honest cossacks i am an officer in the volunteer air service i told him the metal mask lifted to offer me a direct stare what are you then some sort of mercenary i refused to explain my position he leaned back in his chair heavy with his own sense of power you joined to fight the japs is that it more or less i said well youll be pleased to learn that the japs are almost beaten i am pleased id be glad to see an end to the war to all wars youre a pacifist djugashvili began to laugh from within the helm it was a hideous sound for a pacifist my friend youve a lot of blood on your hands two thousand of my lads died at yekaterinaslav but we took the city and destroyed the air fleet you sent against us what dyou say to that if the war with japan is almost over i said then your triumph will be shortlived you must know that i know nothing of the sort he signaled to one of his men who went to a sidedoor opened it and called through moments later i saw harry birchington emerge the bore of rishiri camp back again as large as life hello bastable old man he said i knew there must be some decent socialists in russia and ive found the best youre working with these people certainly very glad to put my talents at their disposal the familiar selfcongratulatory drone was already beginning to grate after seconds mr birchington keeps our airships running said the steel tsar and hes been very helpful in other areas nice of you to say so sir birchington gave a peculiar twisted smile half pride and half embarrassment good morning mr bastable i recognized the warm ironic voice immediately i looked towards the door to see mrs una persson standing there she had crossed bandoliers of bullets over her black military coat a smith and wesson revolver on her hip a fur hat pulled to one side of her face she was as beautiful as ever with her oval face and clear gray eyes i bowed mrs persson i had not seen her for some time since together we had inhabited the world of the black attila her eyes held that look of special recognition which one traveler between the planes reserves for another youve come to join our army i take it she said significantly i trusted her completely and took her hint at once much to pilniaks astonishment i nodded my intention all along i said djugashvili seemed unsurprised we have many wellwishers abroad people who know how much we have suffered under kerensky but what of your companion pilniak drew himself up and brought his heels together with a click i should like to join my fellow prisoners he said the steel tsar shrugged the metal glinted and seemed to be reflected in his eyes very well he signed to one of his men dispose of him with makhno suddenly interposed dispose what are you suggesting comrade djugashvili waved his hand we have too many mouths to feed as it is comrade if we let these survive they are prisoners of war captured fairly send them back to kharkov all i wanted was their ship let them go pilniak looked from one to the other he had never expected to be the subject of a moral argument between two bandits i am responsible for all decisions said djugashvili i will choose whether i captured them makhno was cold and angry his voice dropped but as the tone lowered it carried increased authority and i will not agree to their murder it is not murder we are sweeping up the rubbish of history you are planning to kill honest men they attack socialism we must live by example and offer example to others said makhno it is the only way you are a fool djugashvili rose and brought his sound hand down on the desk why feed them why send them back so they can fight against us again some will fight against us but others will understand the nature of our cause and tell their comrades makhno folded his arms across his chest it is always so if we are brutal then it gives them a further excuse for brutality by god djugashvili these are simple enough arguments what do you want bloodsacrifices how can you claim to represent enlightenment and liberty you have already been responsible for the slaughter of jews the destruction of peasant villages the torturing of innocent farmers i agreed to bring my ships to you because you promised that these things were accidental that they had stopped they have not stopped you are proving to me as you stand there that they will never stop you are a fraud an authoritarian hypocrite the voice within the helm grew louder and louder as makhnos became quieter ill have you shot makhno your anarchist notions are a mere fantasy people are cruel greedy ruthless they must be educated to holiness and they must be punished if they fail he was breathing heavily it is what all russians understand it is what cossacks understand you have no claim as a cossack said makhno with a faint sneer i withdraw my help i shall inform the people i represent and ask them if they wish to withdraw also he began to turn away the steel tsar became placatory nonsense makhno we share the same cause send the prisoners to kharkov if you wish what do you think mrs persson una persson said i think it would show the central government that the cossacks have mercy that they are not bandits that their grievances are justified it would be a good thing to do she seemed to have considerable influence over him for he nodded and agreed with her makhno did not seem completely satisfied but he was evidently thinking of the safety of pilniak and the rest he drew a deep breath and inclined his head i shall assume charge of the prisoners he said as he left with makhno pilniak called back over his shoulder i wish you luck with your new masters bastable i only knew that my loyalty was to mrs persson and that i had faith in her judgment when makhno had disappeared djugashvili began to laugh what a silly childish business was it worth an argument over the lives of a few goatbeards mrs persson and i exchanged glances in the meanwhile harry birchington echoed the steel tsars laughter neither seemed possessed of what i should have called a natural sense of humor is it true the japanese are almost beaten i asked mrs persson certainly she said a matter of days they have already begun to talk armistice terms then these people are doomed i said there is no way that the cossacks can resist the whole might of the russian aerial navy birchington had heard me thats where youre wrong old man he said thats where youre very wrong indeed i thought i heard mrs persson sigh secret weapons later when the cossack chieftains had returned to their men the steel tsar stretched and suggested that we all dine in the rooms upstairs i had not had a chance to speak privately to mrs persson and indeed had been cornered by birchington who had told me how he had been picked up during the raid on rishiri and dumped in kharkov because he had made the mistake of telling people he was an engineer and they had needed engineers in the railway works at kharkov he had left the city soon afterwards and had been on a train which had been captured by rebels the rebels had brought him to djugashvili and the revolutionist had taken a liking to him hes got real imagination old man unlike the imbeciles in london and shanghai who wouldnt give me a chance all i needed was a bit of faith and some financial support you wouldnt believe the inventions ive got in my brain old man big ideas important ideas ideas old man which will shake the world i found myself nodding almost asleep the steel tsar old man is giving me an enormous opportunity to build stuff for him which will help him win the revolution and then well have real socialism everything properly managed like a welloiled machine everyone will be a happy dog youll see and all it will take is birchington im the key factor old man im going to be remembered in history the chief says so the chief he indicated djugashvili we followed the steel tsar upstairs he had mrs persson on his arm and was walking rather heavily as if drunk he turned back to me i had not realized you were friends you will be able to help birchington in his work i hope certainly he will said mrs persson wont you mr bastable of course i tried to sound as enthusiastic as possible but the prospect of even another five minutes in birchingtons company was more at that moment than i could contemplate the room above was fairly bare but a long table had been laid with wholesome ukrainian food including a bowl of red borscht on every place djugashvili seated himself at the top of the table with mrs persson on his right and birchington on his left i sat next to mrs persson a few moments later nestor makhno stepped into the room it was obvious that he was a reluctant guest he had another man with him whom i recognized i began to wonder if mrs persson had not arranged all of this the other man was dempsey whom i had thought killed on his way to a japanese prison he was pale and thin and seemed ill possibly the drugs had begun to poison his system when he saw me he gave a crooked smile and came forward lurching a trifle though he was not obviously drunk hello bastable very good to see you come along for the final battle eh what armageddon bastable havent they told you the steel tsar began to laugh that strange laugh of his nonsense you exaggerate captain dempsey professor marek assures us that everything is much safer now after all you took part in an experiment dempsey sat down and began to stare at his borscht he made no attempt at all to eat it nestor makhno seated himself across from me he seemed puzzled by me perhaps surprised by the alacrity with which i had joined the other side its a prisoners reunion eh he said did you know comrade djugashvili that four of the people at this table have been prisoners of the japanese so i gather the steel tsar was opening a small plate in his helmet to expose a mouth pitted with pockmarks now i was prepared to believe the rumor that it was vanity which caused him to wear the ferocious mask he began to feed himself with small careful movements he looked at makhno did you deliver the prisoners to kharkov not personally they are on their way in padded railway carriages lined with silk no doubt they were sent in a cattletrain we requisitioned makhno knew the steel tsar was baiting him he stroked his neat moustache and kept his eyes on his plate for so cunning a tactician you are lilylivered as a warrior continued djugashvili it would seem to me comrade that there is even a chance you are weakening our endeavors we are fighting against the central government said makhno obstinately we are not fighting for you comrade i made that plain when we brought in our ships you brought your ships because you know you are not strong enough to fight alone your ridiculous notions of honor are inappropriate at this time our notions are never inappropriate said makhno we simply refuse to rationalize murder if we have to kill we kill in selfdefense and we continue to name it for what it is we dont dress it up with fancy pseudoscientific words the people like those words it makes them feel secure said mrs persson sardonically as if to an intimate friend i wondered if she knew makhno it was even possible that he was a colleague there was something out of the ordinary about the anarchist although the logic of his politics was beyond me i was impressed by his recognition of fundamental principles which so many idealists seem to forget as soon as their ideals are rationalized in the language of political creeds he carried within him a sort of selfcontrol which did not deny passion and which i thought was almost wholly conscious in contrast to djugashvili who relied on doctrine and masks for his authority djugashvili continued to dig at makhno your kind of individualism is an arrogant crime against society he said but worse than that it never succeeds what good is revolution when it fails makhno rose from the table it is proving impossible to enjoy my food he said he bowed to the rest of us and apologized ill return to my ship there was a light of triumph in the steel tsars eyes as if he had deliberately engineered makhnos departure goading him until he had no choice but to leave makhno looked enquiringly at dempsey who shook his head slightly and reached for his vodka the anarchist left the room djugashvili seemed to be smiling behind his mask dempsey was frowning slightly to himself as makhno went out birchington began to babble about rational socialism or some such thing and for once he broke a sense of tension which nonetheless remained in the air a few moments later there came the sound of several pistol shots from outside there were footfalls on the stairs and then makhno reappeared his left arm was wounded in his right hand was his revolver he waved it at djugashvili but he was not threatening assassination eh youll find at least two of your men shot i know your methods djugashvili he paused reholstering his empty pistol the black ships leave their moorings tonight then he was gone djugashvili had halfrisen from his place the light from the oil lamps making it seem that his metal mask constantly changed expression the cold eyes were full of unpleasant passion we dont need him he was attacking our cause from within we have science on our side now tomorrow i intend to display birchingtons first invention to our men birchington seemed taken by surprise well chief i think you might find its not quite it will be ready in the morning said the chief dempsey had taken an interest in this aspect of the conversation though he had hardly moved when makhno had reappeared and made his declaration una persson merely looked thoughtfully from face to face djugashvili walked towards the door and called down the stairs bring the professor up mrs persson and dempsey both appeared to know what was going on but i was completely at sea djugashvili waited by the door until a small man with graying hair and round spectacles arrived he seemed almost as unhealthy as dempsey there seemed to be something wrong with his skin and his eyes were watering terribly so that he dabbed at them constantly with a red handkerchief professor marek you already know captain dempsey you have met mr birchington una persson captain bastable the professor blinked in our general direction and waved his handkerchief by way of greeting your bombs are ready eh and birchingtons invention is prepared djugashvili was swaggering back to his place sit down professor have some vodka its very good polish professor marek rubbed at his cheek with the handkerchief it appeared to me that some of his skin flaked away what sort of bombs are these i asked the professor more from politeness than anything the same as i dropped on hiroshima said dempsey with sudden vehemence arent they professor marek the bombs which are supposed to have started the war i said in surprise one bomb dempsey lifted a finger mrs persson put a gentle hand on his arm one bomb wasnt it mrs persson you shouldnt that was experimental said professor marek we could not have predicted suddenly i was filled with that same frisson that same terrifying resonance i had already experienced to a slighter degree in dempseys company i felt that i stared into a distorting mirror which reflected my own guilt in a small voice i asked the professor what sort of bomb was it that you caused to be dropped on hiroshima marek sniffed and dabbed at his eyes he spoke almost casually a nuclear fission bomb of course he said a mechanical man for several hours thereafter as i sat in stunned silence we were forced to listen to djugashvilis boastings and diatribes he made us drink with him he poured glass after glass of vodka into that little aperture which revealed his lips and he spoke of conquest he planned to conquer russia the whole of the slav world both east and west would eventually succumb to the justice of world revolution that revolution appeared to be little more than djugashvilis attempts to control as much of the globe as possible like so many fanatics he drew a picture of the world which was far different to the one most of us saw at once simplified and changed into something which reflected his own needs his own fears we were probably bored and terrified together all of us save birchington who hung on the steel tsars every word and professor marek who scarcely understood anything both captain dempsey and mrs persson seemed to be waiting something out as if they knew all this as if they had anticipated the evening i kept looking across at dempsey who scarcely lifted his eyes from the table but continued steadily to down vodka after vodka how many bombs are ready professor i heard djugashvili ask i gave him more attention four said marek all of about the same strength i have their measure now and you are able to produce more of course with mr birchingtons help the yekaterinaslav laboratories had everything we needed as i told you they would we were lucky to find the stuff una persson said i thought yekaterinaslav was retaken djugashvili dismissed this so it was but we got what we wanted the whole attack was in order to supply professor marek with certain materials he needed at yekaterinaslav they were working along similar lines to the professor i felt sick and i felt weary i wanted to leap from my chair and beg them to stop talking so easily about those hellbombs i of all people knew what sort of effect they could have they could destroy entire cities as if they had hardly existed but because of a look from mrs persson i held my peace dempsey said drunkenly youd better hurry up and use em djugashvili or the central government will be here to claim its materials back theres a huge force on its way as you know certainly i shall use them soon it only needs one ship after all thats why i could dispense with makhno so readily we have a ship your ship captain bastable the vassarion belinsky thats her name yes captain leonov is still aboard he was aboard since he refused to leave we were forced to dispose of him he has been liquidated you killed him djugashvili shrugged if you like again it was all but impossible for me not to display my feelings but i knew it was important to mrs persson that i seemed to be in agreement with the steel tsar so i held my tongue you will command the belinsky djugashvili told me you have been promoted to commander congratulations i ignored this before i could speak dempsey was on his feet leaning heavily upon the table i demand that privilege he said i am the more experienced airshipman after all i dropped the first bomb he spoke urgently bastable can help me youve developed a taste for massmurder i asked in a quiet voice oh yes he seemed completely mad at that moment and his eyes were merry with a demons light oh yes bastable quite a taste for it quite a taste djugashvili said we must demonstrate our power to the central government the first bomb will be dropped on makhnos camp what a splendid idea said mrs persson it was much later when djugashvili decided to go to bed having ordered us to be at headquarters the next morning we watched him lumber from the room all unchecked ego and ruthless power dempsey had collapsed over the table birchington and professor marek were still deep in conversation about some technical point or other mrs persson asked me to give her a hand getting dempsey back to the house we were to share he was very drunk and mumbling to himself when i took him under the shoulders i was surprised at how light he was he laughed at some bitter joke he had made he was very close to madness i said as much to mrs persson after we had put dempsey to bed and sat together drinking coffee in the tiny parlor it was a pleasant house i wondered what welltodo peasants had been killed or evicted in order to provide us with so much comparative luxury poor dempsey is as good as mad she agreed his judgment has been destroyed and he has managed to keep himself going on a mixture of guilt and cynicism its a familiar enough combination i think he feels he must pay some kind of price for what he did what do you think think i was very tired im pretty much beyond rational thought myself im beginning to suspect you of engineering this whole affair especially the meeting with dempsey how is it possible he carries the identical burden to the one i carry under what circumstances could he have dropped a nuclear fission bomb on hiroshima similar circumstances to your own hes a socialist he became idealistically involved with chinese nationalists trying to get foreigners out of their country at that time professor marek was also working for the chinese socialists they were the only people desperate enough to believe that he could develop such a bomb other countries are working on the idea of course including the refining of uranium thats what was going on at yekaterinaslav like you they had no idea of the power of the crude bomb they made they intended only to drop it on the airship yards this is too much i held my head in my hands it is madness it isnt possible they dropped it and destroyed the entire city dempseys vessel was his own with a london registration it was all the japanese needed if there had not been a delay in the detonation of course nothing of the ship would have survived as it was they found the wreckage dempsey had been picked up before that most of the crew was dead but the japanese took a couple of prisoners it was their excuse everyone was preparing for war anyway the japanese decided that the british government had committed an act of war and so struck first it explains everything including their ferocity exactly millions of people killed i groaned both dempsey and i have that on our conscience no wonder the poor man is the way he is you were both catalysts no more than that do you still not realize what you are seeing no individual can claim so much personal guilt we are all guilty of supporting the circumstances the selfdeceptions and the misconceptions which lead to war every lie we tell ourselves makes something like the destruction of hiroshima all the more likely more than one man has destroyed hiroshima in more than one world over and over again the circumstances are often different but the people die just the same and some men feel that they carry the whole weight of responsibility we are all victims mr bastable just as in other ways we are all aggressors at root we are victims of the comforting lies we tell ourselves of our willingness to have leaders religions of our wish to shift responsibility onto others whether it be politicians gods or creatures from other planets you sound like makhno i said i have much in common with nestor makhno youre an anarchist i dont believe in governments or religions if thats what you mean somehow mrs perssons revelations had relieved me i had clarity when i had up to now been confused i no longer felt a victim of fate though in a sense of course i regained one as much a victim if not more of one as captain dempsey we should get some sleep said mrs persson we have to witness birchingtons display tomorrow why are you going along with all this i asked her she put a finger to her lips trust me she said i do i was smiling but i want no more innocent blood on my hands she finished her coffee captain bastable if all goes well we should have completed our task here by tomorrow then you and i shall leave leave where to a base you are being invited to join the league of temporal adventurers mrs persson i am trying to get home back to my own time my own world captain bastable you must reconcile yourself to the fact that you will never know that particular form of security again once you have experienced what you have experienced your own time will simply not allow you to remain but be assured that the league offers some sort of substitute you will be somewhat more in control of your own fate than hitherto that would also mean a great deal to me i said in the meanwhile she told me please continue to follow my lead this is a very complicated business indeed captain bastable a circle must be completed a job must be done in the morning we assembled outside the school in a large quadrangle at the back cossacks were coming and going everywhere the entire camp was busy with the noise of horses and soldiers guns and armored vehicles in the distance an armored train went by loaded with men and armaments everyone knew that yekaterinaslav had been recaptured that the japanese were suing for peace and that central government troops were on their way to the cossack headquarters djugashvili reassured his atamans this attack will be easily resisted and very shortly now moscow will be at our mercy one ataman splendid in black and silver tugged at his huge gray beard and grumbled the airships will destroy us they are cowards we cant get at them cossack courage is useless against them we shall use our own science a far better science to deal with the threat of airships djugashvili reassured him the steel mask glinted as he raised his eyes towards the sun you will see within a week we shall be riding through the streets of petersburg if petersburg still exists the ataman became nervous by god hetman i hope you use no devils magic i am a good christian we fight for god and socialism said djugashvili changing his tack and for the freedom of the cossack host god had put an instrument into our hands which will ensure that freedom for all time and which will enable us as socialists to do his work again i was forced to make sure that my incredulity did not appear on my features i had to avoid mrs perssons sardonic eye for god and socialism she said we will destroy all who stand against us the cossack was mollified and went back to get his pony he rode away to join his men mrs persson murmured to me in english it is in the nature of any good despot that he will say to those he needs anything they wish to hear only when he does not need them does he say what he really thinks and sometimes even then he doesnt bother the secret of becoming a great tyrant lies in an early ability to be all things to all men you sound as if youd trained him yourself i said she made no reply to this djugashvili had heard her speaking and turned his intense stare on her where is dempsey he asked is he fit to take command of the ship of course i had seen dempsey that morning i was pretty certain that he was sustaining himself on drugs he had however been absolutely determined to captain the vassarion belinsky he had asked us to go ahead of him saying he would join us shortly djugashvili turned his back on us rubbing at his steel helmet as if it were a real face i wondered if he had slept in it he had better be in control of himself he said threateningly ah mr birchington birchington had appeared walking ahead of several cossacks who were carrying something on their shoulders it was wrapped in a mixture of canvas and sacking and was about twice as long as a tall man birchington seemed ill at ease good morning chief i hope so do i mr birchington is it ready oh there are no major problems good this will do our morale a lot of good have you heard the news enemy scouts have already been sighted in the air to the south and west but believe me mr birchington i know what impresses cossacks birchington ordered the men to lower the thing to the ground they planted it upright it looked like a huge corpse swathed in unsanitary winding clothes let captain bastable and mrs persson see it i can tell theyre curious djugashvilis joviality was sinister birchington began to tug at the canvas and sacking the thing was made of metal which was obvious as he stripped away the coverings we saw that it was a gigantic figure of a man in cossack costume cast in steel there is a steel tsar to strike terror into the hearts of our enemies cried djugashvili what do you think neither mrs persson nor i spoke the face was the identical face to the one on djugashvilis own mask birchington had produced a model of the cossack hetman more than double lifesize the whole scene seemed increasingly bizarre to me what do you think its splendid said mrs persson i nodded enthusiastically it was the best i could muster well show him to our troops in a moment said djugashvili he will lead them into battle and while our cossacks fight the central government you will fly the ship to makhnos camp and drop the first bomb birchington seemed unusually silent and not nearly as full of himself as usual he ordered the men to pick up the metal statue and carry it towards the main cossack camp djugashvili was elated come along he said to us dempsey arrived he had had a shave and was wearing an airshipmans uniform the clothes seemed far too big for him he was haggard but he walked steadily and seemed to have lost the attitude of despair i had begun to identify with him he even winked at me morning bastable ready for going aloft were all ready said mrs persson professor marek now joined the party as we walked along behind the chief marek was shaking his head too soon he mumbled far too soon none of us had any idea what he meant he seemed halfmad and still very ill we ignored him we reached the outskirts of the town the cossack host was assembling rank upon rank of horsemen stretching almost as far as the eye could see armored vehicles and field guns were also drawn up a platform had been erected in front of them and beside that a dais djugashvili mounted the dais and saluted his troops birchington supervised the men as they pushed the heavy metal figure to its feet free cossacks cried djugashvili your blood has been spilled in the holy cause of liberty and socialism the central government has sent its might against us and all the power of its science has been brought to bear on us yet we are not defeated now we have our own science our own miracles behold he made a grandiose gesture with his arm in the direction of the metal man here is a tsar made truly of steel an impregnable battleleader worthy of the free cossacks he murmured to birchington set him in motion birchington reached up to the figures waist and depressed a lever suddenly the steel creature came to life with awkward spastic movements it reached to its belt and began to draw the huge saber which had evidently been designed as a match for the mechanical mans size with a screech the saber cleared its scabbard the cossacks were impressed djugashvili evidently knew them well as the mechanical man raised the saber over its head the cossacks began to cheer they drew their own swords and waved them they made their horses rear the noise of their approval was deafening slowly the mechanical monster turned its head as if listening it inclined its gaze to stare down on birchington it lifted its head evidently birchington had previously designed all these movements it walked forward a few paces towards the huge gathering of horsemen it stopped the saber still raised again they cheered mrs persson put her lips close to my ear they love icons they would rather have statues than real people it has been their undoing over the centuries dempsey had begun to laugh and only grew silent when mrs persson signed to him to stop i for my part found the whole scene nightmarish the mechanical steel tsar began to wave its saber over its head as if in imitation of the cossacks it moved forward again then one knee bent i think birchington had meant this series of movements to show the mechanical creatures supplication to its master djugashvili but the motion was halted the knee jerked a couple of times there was a squeak and a clash of metal it began to turn but the leg dragged it swayed djugashvili maintained his posture but he was angry set the thing to rights birchington or youre finished birchington ran towards his mechanical man reaching up for the lever at the waist the thing seemed to sense him and completed its turn swiftly the swordarm began to descend birchington shouted oh no this isnt supposed to happen then the saber had sliced him from crown to breastbone blood flew everywhere suddenly the cossacks were silent birchingtons body fell to the black earth with a grinding of cogs and wheels the mechanical man began to topple it crashed onto its creators corpse i heard professor marek behind me i said it was too soon he didnt give himself enough time i could hear the wind sighing over the steppe and then came the dry dreadful sound of djugashvilis laughter well well mr birchington how neat he addressed the bewildered cossack host the traitor birchington is the first to die beneath the vengeful sword of the steel tsar this spy for the central government was trying to sabotage our war effort we are revenged brothers freedom poor birchington said mrs persson what a dreadful lesson what a final one said dempsey he moved away djugashvili spoke to us professor marek revive the mechanical man if you can get it back to the laboratories too soon said marek he signed to the soldiers to lift the creature onto their shoulders once again captain dempsey are the bombs aboard theyre aboard said dempsey then get to your first target be quick captain dempsey i want to witness no more disloyalty i looked up at the sky i pointed you had better concern yourself with immediate problems i said there were troopships on their way even as we stared the first gliding infantry began to leave the craft and drift towards us firing as they came a kind of revolution professor marek hurried aboard just as we were about to go aloft on the familiar control deck of the vassarion belinsky i stood between captain dempsey and mrs persson staring through the observation ports as the ship rose swiftly into the air we had a ramshackle crew of halftrained cossacks some of whom were deserters from the volunteer air fleet as dempsey had said to me theyre good enough for this work bastable never fear through the ports we could witness the first battles between cossacks and central government troops the expert riflemen of the steppe were picking off the gliding infantry even as they left their ships they fell like stricken butterflies wed better let them get on with it said dempsey carelessly all right height coxswain put us up to five thousand feet moderate ascent helmsman northbynorth west if you please halfspeed mr bastable all at once he had become a capable airship commander everything he had been before he had helped in an appalling crime of massmurder in the name of an idealistic principle but why had he agreed to bomb makhnos camp had cynicism like a cancer corroded him completely dempseys hands were hardly shaking at all as he stood on the bridge his arms folded across his chest watching the ground fall away our ship still flew russian colors so we were not attacked indeed dempsey made the wireless operator send a message offering to join the battle we were told to return to odessa for fresh armaments and to report on our condition the last thing i saw were the first aerial torpedoes buzzing down upon the cossack riders i turned away from the observation ports dempsey i said are you really going to drop another of those hellbombs are you going to kill makhno and all his people dempsey turned his sad selfmocking eyes on me of course but of course he is said a voice behind me it was djugashvili flanked by a couple of wellarmed cossacks he had not trusted any of us the steel tsar laughed within his mask i want to see makhnos end for myself but your men i said they are leaderless it seems that the entire volunteer fleet is going against them they have birchingtons giant its down there somewhere giving them strength giving them hope its a useless icon they need nothing else besides captain bastable those chaps have pretty much served their turn they are an anachronism their attitudes hamper the course of scientific socialism i could feel the blood drain from my features you are sacrificing those men they trusted you absolutely you gave them the rhetoric and the goals to make them fight they will not surrender they could all be killed for what for history he said he seemed impatient with me as if i was asking childishly naive questions for the future mrs persson interrupted us the idea of the future she said will gradually come to replace the idea of god the two conceptions however will be all but identical in the manner in which they are selfcontradictory and therefore confusing to their worshippers by remaining confused and therefore weakened their priests more easily manipulate the worshippers or whatever those priests call themselves since the priests are often as confused as those they pretend to lead they will become angry if their rationales are in any way questioned they will kill the questioners in the meantime she was speaking rapidly in english djugashvili strode up to the bridge and stood beside dempsey raising his withered arm to silence her youll be our first admiral captain dempsey you will be a hero of socialism never fear there are hundreds thousands of disaffected people in moscow and petersburg alone theyll rise up to join us after our demonstration of what scientific socialism can achieve dempsey leaned forward checking various instruments threequarter speed mr bastable threequarter speed i conveyed the order to the engineers you will lead our airships to petersburg djugashvili continued you are a brave fine man captain dempsey you will be rewarded with every honor we all knew that this was his method of cajoling what he needed from people we all knew that as soon as dempsey had served his turn he too could be liquidated in the name of the future thank you sir said dempsey he looked towards professor marek who sat jotting down calculations on a pad of paper djugashvili clapped dempsey on the back i know how to show my gratitude captain oh indeed sir dempsey gave a further instruction to the helmsman the skies were gray today and vast a little rain began to spot the observation ports we heard it drumming on our hull grey light filled the bridge increasing dempseys pallor and emphasizing the unhealthy peeling skin of professor marek the ship seemed like a ship of the dead already to me dempsey detected a change in the forward starboard engine he cocked his head to one side like any good airship captain he was listening all the time an airships running depends as much on the ears as on the eyes something wrong mr bastable could you go and check the nacelle very good i left the control cabin and to my surprise found that mrs persson had followed me how much further to makhnos camp i asked her as we walked along the companionway there was cloud all around us now about halfanhour we have to disarm those bombs captain bastable what its the whole point of this we disarm them theyre dropped and they prove useless it is why weve been going along with djugashvili up to now however we hadnt expected him to join us aboard the ship i was enlightened i know very little about bombs i said especially this kind i know a great deal about them come well go to the bomb bay this way it isnt guarded she opened a hatch door and let me into semidarkness we descended a steel ladder i could hear the familiar creaking of the bombracks and at last saw four crudelymade cases of roughly standard size lettered in old slavic and decorated with peculiar designs of the kind i had seen on cossack weapons were these the bombs which could threaten the destruction of the entire world mrs persson said the detonating devices are in the noses we have to unscrew them with her legs straddling the bombflaps she reached for a large wrench use this she said below i could see a little daylight from time to time as the flaps gave slightly i had the feeling that we could as easily fall through the flaps as the bombs and began to tread very carefully as i strove to remove the nose of the first bomb we had not been working more than five minutes before we heard voices from the gallery above us theres no need for that it was dempsey sounding like the wrath of god theres no need for that at all leave my bombs alone dempsey una persson became agitated are you really crazy this was what we agreed we should do it was your plan mrs persson not mine you surely arent going to help djugashvili dempsey was pointing a large revolver at us move away he said dempsey i had never seen mrs persson so obviously frightened you cant makhno those bombs must be detonated said dempsey nothing else will do but we intend to prove they cant work it will prove nothing mrs persson continued to persevere with the nose of the bomb dempsey ordered his men towards us mrs persson seemed almost to be crying as she struggled i must admit that i gave up quietly i handed my wrench to the first cossack to approach me he put a pack into my hands as if in exchange i did not know what it was the bomb bays were full of cossacks now completely surrounding us youre interfering with my plan said dempsey coldly and i have the right not you to decide what to do with these you have no right no more than anyone you assume too much guilt captain dempsey mrs persson struggled as the cossacks held her forcing her to drop the spanner and you assume too much responsibility he said i have the right and what about you captain bastable she said havent you an equal right not here i said i looked up at dempsey i didnt know what he planned to do but i now respected his judgment completely and i agree with captain dempsey mrs persson he has the right together with professor marek dempsey bowed slightly my words seemed to cheer him he raised an eyebrow mrs persson she shrugged very well captain dempsey but if you kill makhno that will be my responsibility i think and mine if i havent attempted to stop you i interrupted is this the moment for moral discussions i asked those packs contain gliding apparatus said dempsey he rubbed at his sunken eyes his voice became suddenly weary youll use them to escape where is the steel tsar asked mrs persson he has the real power on this ship not any longer said dempsey where is he safe dempsey turned away ill say goodbye to you both its unlikely well ever meet again goodbye dempsey i said and i added and good luck he was laughing as he climbed back up the steel ladder towards his control deck thank you bastable thank you very much the gliding apparatus was strapped onto us and we were pushed roughly through the bombflaps seconds later the wings opened out and we were drifting slowly down towards the barren steppe there was no sign of human life anywhere below us we looked back the airship was making good speed away from us heading north east we landed rather bumpily on coarse turf i hurt my ankle slightly but had no serious injury as i was helping mrs persson remove her apparatus i was suddenly bathed in brilliant light as if the sun had emerged unexpectedly from behind the clouds mrs persson flung herself down and i followed suit without quite understanding why moments later the ground began to shake as a huge echoing boom began to sound throughout the world we both recognized it for what it was of course dempsey had exploded the bombs in the air over the steppe we saw a massive column of smoke just as ash began to fall like rain across the landscape mrs persson said the fool i knew hed try it i thought id convinced him but he outguessed me after all his guilt was too great but it was completely unnecessary i understand why he wanted to do it this way i said she was impatient understand so do i but whats that got to do with it this is another loss i still do not know what she meant she was crying i made some attempt to comfort her but una persson is not an easy woman to comfort she recovered herself as she began to walk stolidly across the steppe her back to the bomb cloud the wind blew against our faces she said the bomb its inventor the despot prepared to use it and the despots servants are all gone now but while that syndrome continues to exist so will that particular circle continue id hoped to break it to make a different circle can that circle ever be broken i asked her its what im trying to find out she said a day and a half later we were discovered by some of nestor makhnos horsemen we were weary and depressed and the news that makhno had gained concessions from the central government of territory in which to conduct his anarchist experiment only slightly cheered us that evening during an openair celebration beneath the masts of makhnos black cruisers i became quite drunk and asked mrs persson did dempsey really die for nothing i suppose not but what good is a martyr captain bastable while people believe in the magic power of personalities rather than the human fallibility of individuals they will never be free but dempsey wished only to make amends he said it was his right and it was his right nestor makhno leaned forward he was even drunker i think than me we are all guilty we are all innocent only when we accept responsibility for our own actions are we free and only then will the world be safe for us all dempsey had an oldfashioned sense of honor he destroyed himself because of it he saved many lives it is true but mrs perssons plan might have saved more while we compete with ourselves in that way while we compete with each other blame one another for our misfortunes there will always be the chance of conflicts such as the one which is now over makhnos words meant something to me but then so had dempseys actions at last i was relieved of that terrible lack of faith in myself of that awful bewilderment and as mrs persson told me later was ready to become a conscious traveler between the worlds to join that strange body of people known as the league of temporal adventurers i felt that what had begun in the temple of teku benga was now finished a new phase in my life was beginning perhaps a more positive phase time as they say will tell moorcock i have learned only one thing in all my adventures that despots are all pretty much the same but there are many different kinds of victims i hope this manuscript reaches you and that you will be able to publish it i have a feeling it is the last you will ever receive from me the time for reviewing my past is over now i look forward if thats the appropriate word to life in the eternal present captain oswald bastable airshipman somewhere in the lower devonian editors afterword and that as best i can present it is the final story of oswald bastable as many readers will already know the steel tsar djugashvili sounds remarkably like the man of steel that wellknown expriest the georgian who chose for himself the name of josef stalin but then it is not uncommon in all the worlds of the multiverse for the same kind of personalities to emerge in roughly similar roles what is usually more interesting is when through altered circumstances they appear in very different roles although i expect further visits from mrs persson i gather that there will be no more special news of bastable now that he has joined the famous league i am glad however to learn that he has found himself at last found some sort of direction and is reconciled both to his crime and his loss of home michael moorcock yorkshire june michael moorcock michael
