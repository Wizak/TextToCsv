arrangement with houghton mifflin company the authorized publishers of the works of those authors eighth reader brother and sister i the home coming tom was to arrive early in the afternoon and there was another fluttering heart besides maggies when it was late enough for the sound of the gig wheels to be expected for if mrs tulliver had a strong feeling it was fondness for her boy at last the sound came that quick light bowling of the gig wheels there he is my sweet lad mrs tulliver stood with her arms open maggie jumped first on one leg and then on the other while tom descended from the gig and said with masculine reticence as to the tender emotions hallo yap what are you there nevertheless he submitted to be kissed willingly enough though maggie hung on his neck in rather a strangling fashion while his blue eyes wandered toward the croft and the lambs and the river where he promised himself he would begin to fish the first thing tomorrow morning he was one of those lads that grow everywhere in england and at twelve or thirteen years of age look as much alike as goslings a lad with a physiognomy in which it seems impossible to discern anything but the generic character of boyhood maggie said tom confidentially taking her into a corner as soon as his mother was gone out to examine his box and the warm parlor had taken off the chill he had felt from the long drive you dont know what ive got in my pockets nodding his head up and down as a means of rousing her sense of mystery no said maggie how stodgy they look tom is it marbles or cobnuts maggies heart sank a little because tom always said it was no good playing with her at those games she played so badly marbles no ive swopped all my marbles with the little fellows and cobnuts are no fun you silly only when the nuts are green but see here he drew something half out of his righthand pocket what is it said maggie in a whisper i can see nothing but a bit of yellow why its a new guess maggie oh i cant guess tom said maggie impatiently dont be a spitfire else i wont tell you said tom thrusting his hand back into his pocket and looking determined no tom said maggie imploringly laying hold of the arm that was held stiffly in the pocket im not cross tom it was only because i cant bear guessing please be good to me illustration the home coming toms arm slowly relaxed and he said well then its a new fish line two new ones one for you maggie all to yourself i wouldnt go halves in the toffee and gingerbread on purpose to save the money and gibson and spouncer fought with me because i wouldnt and heres hooks see here i say wont we go and fish tomorrow down by the round pool and you shall catch your own fish maggie and put the worms on and everything wont it be fun maggies answer was to throw her arms around toms neck and hug him and hold her cheek against his without speaking while he slowly unwound some of the line saying after a pause wasnt i a good brother now to buy you a line all to yourself you know i neednt have bought it if i hadnt liked yes very very good i do love you tom tom had put the line back in his pocket and was looking at the hooks one by one before he spoke again and the fellows fought me because i wouldnt give in about the toffee oh dear i wish they wouldnt fight at your school tom didnt it hurt you hurt me no said tom putting up the hooks again taking out a large pocketknife and slowly opening the largest blade which he looked at meditatively as he rubbed his finger along it then he added i gave spouncer a black eye i know thats what he got by wanting to leather me i wasnt going to go halves because anybody leathered me oh how brave you are tom i think youre like samson if there came a lion roaring at me i think youd fight him wouldnt you tom how can a lion come roaring at you you silly thing theres no lions only in the shows no but if we were in the lion countries i mean in africa where its very hot the lions eat people there i can show it to you in the book where i read it well i should get a gun and shoot him but if you hadnt got a gun we might have gone out you know not thinking just as we go fishing and then a great lion might run toward us roaring and we couldnt get away from him what should you do tom tom paused and at last turned away contemptuously saying but the lion isnt coming whats the use of talking but i like to fancy how it would be said maggie following him just think what you would do tom oh dont bother maggie youre such a silly i shall go and see my rabbits ii the falling out maggies heart began to flutter with fear she dared not tell the sad truth at once but she walked after tom in trembling silence as he went out thinking how she could tell him the news so as to soften at once his sorrow and his anger for maggie dreaded toms anger of all things it was quite a different anger from her own tom she said timidly when they were out of doors how much money did you give for your rabbits two half crowns and a sixpence said tom i think ive got a great deal more than that in my steel purse upstairs ill ask mother to give it to you what for said tom i dont want your money you silly thing ive got a great deal more money than you because im a boy i always have half sovereigns and sovereigns for my christmas boxes because i shall be a man and you only have fiveshilling pieces because youre only a girl well but tom if mother would let me give you two half crowns and a sixpence out of my purse to put into your pocket and spend you know and buy some more rabbits with it more rabbits i dont want any more oh but tom theyre all dead tom stopped immediately in his walk and turned round toward maggie you forgot to feed em then and harry forgot he said his color heightening for a moment but soon subsiding ill pitch into harry ill have him turned away and i dont love you maggie you shant go fishing with me tomorrow i told you to go and see the rabbits every day he walked on again yes but i forgot and i couldnt help it indeed tom im so very sorry said maggie while the tears rushed fast youre a naughty girl said tom severely and im sorry i bought you the fish line i dont love you oh tom its very cruel sobbed maggie id forgive you if you forgot anything i wouldnt mind what you did id forgive you and love you yes youre a silly but i never do forget things i dont oh please forgive me tom my heart will break said maggie shaking with sobs clinging to toms arm and laying her wet cheek on his shoulder tom shook her off and stopped again saying in a peremptory tone now maggie you just listen arent i a good brother to you yeyees sobbed maggie her chin rising and falling convulsedly didnt i think about your fish line all this quarter and mean to buy it and saved my money o purpose and wouldnt go halves in the toffee and spouncer fought me because i wouldnt yeyees and i lololove you so tom but youre a naughty girl last holidays you licked the paint off my lozenge box and the holidays before that you let the boat drag my fish line down when id set you to watch it and you pushed your head through my kite all for nothing but i didnt mean said maggie i couldnt help it yes you could said tom if youd minded what you were doing and youre a naughty girl and you shant go fishing with me tomorrow with this terrible conclusion tom ran away from maggie toward the mill maggie stood motionless except for her sobs for a minute or two then she turned round and ran into the house and up to her attic where she sat on the floor and laid her head against the wormeaten shelf with a crushing sense of misery tom was come home and she had thought how happy she should be and now he was cruel to her what use was anything if tom didnt love her oh he was very cruel hadnt she wanted to give him the money and said how very sorry she was she had never been naughty to tom had never meant to be naughty to him oh he is cruel maggie sobbed aloud finding a wretched pleasure in the hollow resonance that came through the long empty space of the attic she was too miserable to be angry iii the making up maggie soon thought she had been hours in the attic and it must be tea time and they were all having their tea and not thinking of her well then she would stay up there and starve herself hide herself behind the tub and stay there all night and then they would all be frightened and tom would be sorry thus maggie thought as she crept behind the tub but presently she began to cry again at the idea that they didnt mind her being there tom had been too much interested in going the round of the premises to think of maggie and the effect his anger had produced on her he meant to punish her and that business having been performed he occupied himself with other matters like a practical person but when he had been called in to tea his father said why wheres the little wench and mrs tulliver almost at the same moment said wheres your little sister both of them having supposed that maggie and tom had been together all the afternoon i dont know said tom he didnt want to tell of maggie though he was angry with her for tom tulliver was a lad of honor what hasnt she been playing with you all this while said the father shed been thinking of nothing but your coming home i havent seen her this two hours says tom commencing on the plum cake goodness heart shes got drowned exclaimed mrs tulliver rising from her seat and running to the window how could you let her do so she added as became a fearful woman accusing she didnt know whom of she didnt know what nay nay shes none drowned said mr tulliver youve been naughty to her i doubt tom im sure i havent father said tom indignantly i think shes in the house perhaps up in that attic said mrs tulliver asinging and talking to herself and forgetting all about mealtimes you go and fetch her down tom said mr tulliver rather sharply his perspicacity or his fatherly fondness for maggie making him suspect that the lad had been hard upon the little un else she would never have left his side and be good to her do you hear else ill let you know better tom never disobeyed his father for mr tulliver was a peremptory man but he went out rather sullenly carrying his piece of plum cake and not intending to reprieve maggies punishment which was no more than she deserved tom was only thirteen and had no decided views in grammar and arithmetic regarding them for the most part as open questions but he was particularly clear and positive on one point namely that he would punish everybody who deserved it why he wouldnt have minded being punished himself if he deserved it but then he never did deserve it it was toms step then that maggie heard on the stairs when her need of love had triumphed over her pride and she was going down with her swollen eyes and disheveled hair to beg for pity at least her father would stroke her head and say never mind my wench but she knew toms step and her heart began to beat violently with the sudden shock of hope he only stood still at the top of the stairs and said maggie youre to come down but she rushed to him and clung round his neck sobbing o tom please forgive me i cant bear it i will always be good always remember things do love me please dear tom maggie and tom were still very much like young animals and so she could rub her cheek against his and kiss his ear in a random sobbing way and there were tender fibers in the lad that had been used to answer to maggies fondling so that he behaved with a weakness quite inconsistent with his resolution to punish her as much as she deserved he actually began to kiss her in return and say dont cry then magsie here eat a bit o cake maggies sobs began to subside and she put out her mouth for the cake and bit a piece and then tom bit a piece just for company and they ate together and rubbed each others cheeks and brows and noses together while they ate with a humiliating resemblance to two friendly ponies come along magsie and have tea said tom at last when there was no more cake except what was downstairs so ended the sorrows of this day footnote footnote from the mill on the floss by george eliot my last day at salem house i pass over all that happened at school until the anniversary of my birthday came round in march the great remembrance by which that time is marked in my mind seems to have swallowed up all lesser recollections and to exist alone it is even difficult for me to believe there was a gap of full two months between my return to salem house and the arrival of that birthday i can only understand that the fact was so because i know it must have been so otherwise i should feel convinced there was no interval and that the one occasion trod upon the others heels how well i recollect the kind of day it was i smell the fog that hung about the place i see the hoarfrost ghostly through it i feel my rimy hair fall clammy on my cheek i look along the dim perspective of the schoolroom with a spluttering candle here and there to light up the foggy morning and the breath of the boys wreathing and smoking in the raw cold as they blow upon their fingers and tap their feet upon the floor it was after breakfast and we had been summoned in from the playground when mr sharp entered and said david copperfield is to go into the parlor i expected a hamper from home and brightened at the order some of the boys about me put in their claim not to be forgotten in the distribution of the good things as i got out of my seat with great alacrity dont hurry david said mr sharp theres time enough my boy dont hurry i might have been surprised by the feeling tone in which he spoke if i had given it a thought but i gave it none until afterward i hurried away to the parlor and there i found mr creakle sitting at his breakfast with the cane and newspaper before him and mrs creakle with an opened letter in her hand but no hamper david copperfield said mrs creakle leading me to a sofa and sitting down beside me i want to speak to you very particularly i have something to tell you my child mr creakle at whom of course i looked shook his head without looking at me and stopped up a sigh with a very large piece of buttered toast you are too young to know how the world changes every day said mrs creakle and how the people in it pass away but we all have to learn it david some of us when we are young some of us when we are old some of us at all times of our lives i looked at her earnestly when you came away from home at the end of the vacation said mrs creakle after a pause were they all well after another pause was your mamma well i trembled without distinctly knowing why and still looked at her earnestly making no attempt to answer because said she i grieve to tell you that i hear this morning your mamma is very ill a mist rose between mrs creakle and me and her figure seemed to move in it for an instant then i felt the burning tears run down my face and it was steady again she is very dangerously ill she added i knew all now she is dead there was no need to tell me so i had already broken out into a desolate cry and felt an orphan in the wide world she was very kind to me she kept me there all day and left me alone sometimes and i cried and wore myself to sleep and awoke and cried again when i could cry no more i began to think and then the oppression on my breast was heaviest and my grief a dull pain that there was no ease for and yet my thoughts were idle not intent on the calamity that weighed upon my heart but idly loitering near it i thought of our house shut up and hushed i thought of the little baby who mrs creakle said had been pining away for some time and who they believed would die too i thought of my fathers grave in the churchyard by our house and of my mother lying there beneath the tree i knew so well i stood upon a chair when i was left alone and looked into the glass to see how red my eyes were and how sorrowful my face i considered after some hours were gone if my tears were really hard to flow now as they seemed to be what in connection with my loss it would affect me most to think of when i drew near home for i was going home to the funeral i am sensible of having felt that a dignity attached to me among the rest of the boys and that i was important in my affliction if ever child were stricken with sincere grief i was but i remembered that this importance was a kind of satisfaction to me when i walked in the playground that afternoon while the boys were in school when i saw them glancing at me out of the windows as they went up to their classes i felt distinguished and looked more melancholy and walked slower when school was over and they came out and spoke to me i felt it rather good in myself not to be proud to any of them and to take exactly the same notice of them all as before i was to go home next night not by the mail but by the heavy night coach which was called the farmer and was principally used by country people traveling short intermediate distances upon the road we had no story telling that evening and traddles insisted on lending me his pillow i dont know what good he thought it would do me for i had one of my own but it was all he had to lend poor fellow except a sheet of letter paper full of skeletons and that he gave me at parting as a soother of my sorrows and a contribution to my peace of mind i left salem house upon the morrow afternoon i little thought then that i left it never to return we traveled very slowly all night and did not get into yarmouth before nine or ten oclock in the morning i looked out for mr barkis but he was not there and instead of him a fat shortwinded merrylooking little old man in black with rusty little bunches of ribbons at the knees of his breeches black stockings and a broadbrimmed hat came puffing up to the coach window and said master copperfield yes sir will you come with me young sir if you please he said opening the door and i shall have the pleasure of taking you home footnote footnote from david copperfield by charles dickens expression the two stories which you have just read were written by two of the greatest masters of fiction in english literature talk with your teacher about george eliot and charles dickens and learn all that you can about their works which of these two stories do you prefer why reread the conversation on pages and imagine yourself to be tom or maggie and speak just as he or she did read the conversation on pages and in the same way reread other portions that you like particularly well in what respect does the second story differ most strongly from the first select the most striking passage and read it with expression sad feeling the departure from miss pinkertons i one sunshiny morning in june there drove up to the great iron gate of miss pinkertons academy for young ladies on chiswick mall a large family coach with two fat horses in blazing harness driven by a fat coachman in a threecornered hat and wig at the rate of four miles an hour a black servant who reposed on the box beside the fat coachman uncurled his bandy legs as soon as the equipage drew up opposite miss pinkertons shining brass plate and as he pulled the bell at least a score of young heads were seen peering out of the narrow windows of the stately old brick house nay the acute observer might have recognized the little red nose of goodnatured miss jemima pinkerton herself rising over some geranium pots in the window of that ladys own drawing room it is mrs sedleys coach sister said miss jemima sambo the black servant has just rung the bell and the coachman has a new red waistcoat have you completed all the necessary preparations incident to miss sedleys departure asked miss pinkerton that majestic lady the friend of the famous literary man dr johnson the author of the great dixonary of the english language called commonly the great lexicographer the girls were up at four this morning packing her trunks sister answered miss jemima we have made her a bowpot say a bouquet sister jemima tis more genteel well a booky as big almost as a haystack i have put up two bottles of the gillyflower water for mrs sedley and the receipt for making it is in amelias box and i trust miss jemima you have made a copy of miss sedleys account that is it is it very good ninetythree pounds four shillings be kind enough to address it to john sedley esquire and to seal this billet which i have written to his lady ii in miss jemimas eyes an autograph letter of her sister miss pinkerton was an object of as deep veneration as would have been a letter from a sovereign only when her pupils quitted the establishment or when they were about to be married and once when poor miss birch died of the scarlet fever was miss pinkerton known to write personally to the parents of her pupils in the present instance miss pinkertons billet was to the following effect the mall chiswick june madam after her six years residence at the mall i have the honor and happiness of presenting miss amelia sedley to her parents as a young lady not unworthy to occupy a fitting position in their polished and refined circle those virtues which characterize the young english gentlewomen those accomplishments which become her birth and station will not be found wanting in the amiable miss sedley whose industry and obedience have endeared her to her instructors and whose delightful sweetness of temper has charmed her aged and her youthful companions in music dancing in orthography in every variety of embroidery and needlework she will be found to have realized her friends fondest wishes in geography there is still much to be desired and a careful and undeviating use of the backboard for four hours daily during the next three years is recommended as necessary to the acquirement of that dignified deportment and carriage so requisite for every young lady of fashion in the principles of religion and morality miss sedley will be found worthy of an establishment which has been honored by the presence of the great lexicographer and the patronage of the admirable mrs chapone in leaving them all miss amelia carries with her the hearts of her companions and the affectionate regards of her mistress who has the honor to subscribe herself madam your most obliged humble servant barbara pinkerton ps miss sharp accompanies miss sedley it is particularly requested that miss sharps stay in russell square may not exceed ten days the family of distinction with whom she is engaged as governess desire to avail themselves of her services as soon as possible this letter completed miss pinkerton proceeded to write her own name and miss sedleys in the flyleaf of a johnsons dictionary the interesting work which she invariably presented to her scholars on their departure from the mall on the cover was inserted a copy of lines addressed to a young lady on quitting miss pinkertons school at the mall by the late revered dr samuel johnson in fact the lexicographers name was always on the lips of this majestic woman and a visit he had paid to her was the cause of her reputation and her fortune being commanded by her elder sister to get the dixonary from the cupboard miss jemima had extracted two copies of the book from the receptacle in question when miss pinkerton had finished the inscription in the first jemima with rather a dubious and timid air handed her the second for whom is this miss jemima said miss pinkerton with awful coldness for becky sharp answered jemima trembling very much and blushing over her withered face and neck as she turned her back on her sister for becky sharp shes going too miss jemima exclaimed miss pinkerton in the largest capitals are you in your senses replace the dixonary in the closet and never venture to take such a liberty in future with an unusual display of courage miss jemima mildly protested well sister its only two and ninepence and poor becky will be miserable if she doesnt get one send miss sedley instantly to me was miss pinkertons only answer and venturing not to say another word poor jemima trotted off exceedingly flurried and nervous while the two pupils miss sedley and miss sharp were making final preparations for their departure for miss sedleys home iii well then the flowers and the presents and the trunks and the bonnet boxes of miss sedley having been arranged by mr sambo in the carriage together with a very small and weatherbeaten old cowskin trunk with miss sharps card neatly nailed upon it which was delivered by sambo with a grin and packed by the coachman with a corresponding sneer the hour for parting came and the grief of that moment was considerably lessened by the admirable discourse which miss pinkerton addressed to her pupil not that the parting speech caused amelia to philosophize or that it armed her in any way with a calmness the result of argument but it was intolerably dull and having the fear of her schoolmistress greatly before her eyes miss sedley did not venture in her presence to give way to any ablutions of private grief a seed cake and a bottle of wine were produced in the drawing room as on the solemn occasions of the visits of parents and these refreshments being partaken of miss sedley was at liberty to depart youll go in and say goodby to miss pinkerton becky said miss jemima to that young lady of whom nobody took any notice and who was coming downstairs with her own bandbox i suppose i must said miss sharp calmly and much to the wonder of miss jemima and the latter having knocked at the door and receiving permission to come in miss sharp advanced in a very unconcerned manner and said in french and with a perfect accent mademoiselle je viens vous faire mes adieux miss pinkerton did not understand french as we know she only directed those who did biting her lips and throwing up her venerable and romannosed head she said miss sharp i wish you a good morning as she spoke she waved one hand both by way of adieu and to give miss sharp an opportunity of shaking one of the fingers of the hand which was left out for that purpose miss sharp only folded her own hands with a very frigid smile and bow and quite declined to accept the proffered honor on which miss pinkerton tossed up her turban more indignantly than ever in fact it was a little battle between the young lady and the old one and the latter was worsted come away becky said miss jemima pulling the young woman away in great alarm and the drawing room door closed upon her forever illustration the parting then came the struggle and parting below words refuse to tell it all the servants were there in the hall all the dear friends all the young ladies even the dancing master who had just arrived and there was such a scuffling and hugging and kissing and crying with the hysterical yoops of miss schwartz the parlor boarder as no pen can depict and as the tender heart would feign pass over the embracing was finished they parted that is miss sedley parted from her friends miss sharp had demurely entered the carriage some minutes before nobody cried for leaving her sambo of the bandy legs slammed the carriage door on his young weeping mistress he sprang up behind the carriage stop cried miss jemima rushing to the gate with a parcel its some sandwiches my dear she called to amelia you may be hungry you know and becky becky sharp heres a book for you that my sister that is i johnsons dixonary you know you mustnt leave us without that goodby drive on coachman god bless you goodby then the kind creature retreated into the garden overcome with emotion but lo and just as the coach drove off miss sharp suddenly put her pale face out of the window and flung the book back into the garden flung it far and fast watching it fall at the feet of astonished miss jemima then sank back in the carriage exclaiming so much for the dixonary and thank god im out of chiswick the shock of such an act almost caused jemima to faint with terror well i never she began what an audacious she gasped emotion prevented her from completing either sentence the carriage rolled away the great gates were closed the bell rang for the dancing lesson the world is before the two young ladies and so farewell to chiswick mall footnotes footnote from vanity fair by william makepeace thackeray footnote madam i have come to tell you goodby expression by many able critics thackeray is regarded as a greater novelist than either dickens or george eliot compare this extract from one of his best works with the two selections which precede it which of the three stories is the most interesting to you which sounds the best when read aloud which is the most humorous which is the most pathetic reread the three selections very carefully now tell what you observe about the style of each in what respects is the style of the third story different from that of either of the others reread miss pinkertons letter what peculiarities do you observe in it select and reread the most humorous passage in this last story two gems from browning i incident of the french camp in the small kingdom of bavaria on the south bank of the danube river there is a famous old city called ratisbon it is not a very large city but its history can be traced far back to the time when the romans had a military camp there which they used as an outpost against the german barbarians at one time it ranked among the most flourishing towns of germany it is now of little commercial importance a quaint and quiet old place with a fine cathedral and many notable buildings which testify to its former greatness during the earlier years of the nineteenth century napoleon bonaparte emperor of the french was engaged in bitter warfare with austria and indeed with nearly the whole of europe in april the austrian army under grand duke charles was intrenched in ratisbon and the neighboring towns there it was attacked by the french army commanded by napoleon himself and led by the brave marshal lannes duke of montebello the battle raged first on this side of the city then on that and for several days no one could tell which of the combatants would be victorious at length napoleon decided to end the matter by storming the city and if possible driving the archduke from his stronghold he therefore sent marshal lannes forward to direct the battle while he watched the conflict and gave commands from a distance for a long time the issue seemed doubtful and not even napoleon could guess what the result would be late in the day however french valor prevailed the austrians were routed and marshal lannes forced his way into the city it was at this time that the incident described so touchingly in the following poem by robert browning is supposed to have taken place we do not know nor does any one know whether the story has any foundation in fact it illustrates however the spirit of bravery and selfsacrifice that prevailed among the soldiers of napoleon and such an incident might indeed have happened not only at ratisbon but at almost any place where the emperors presence urged his troops to victory for such was napoleons magic influence and such was the love which he inspired among all his followers that thousands of young men were ready cheerfully to give their lives for the promotion of his selfish ambition the poem which is now regarded as one of the classics of our language was first published in in a small volume entitled dramatic lyrics the same volume contained the wellknown rime of the pied piper of hamelin robert browning was at that time a young man of thirty and most of the poems which afterwards made him famous were still unwritten brownings poem you know we french stormed ratisbon a mile or so away on a little mound napoleon stood on our storming day with neck outthrust you fancy how legs wide arms locked behind as if to balance the prone brow oppressive with its mind just as perhaps he mused my plans that soar to earth may fall let once my army leader lannes waver at yonder wall out twixt the battery smokes there flew a rider bound on bound full galloping nor bridle drew until he reached the mound then off there flung in smiling joy and held himself erect by just his horses mane a boy you hardly could suspect so tight he kept his lips compressed scarce any blood came through you looked twice ere you saw his breast was all but shot in two

back read correctly well thats prime now did you ever all right if he got drowned i should not wonder in what respects do these two poems differ from your favorite poems by longfellow or tennyson do you think there is much music in them the discovery of america it was on friday morning the th of october that columbus first beheld the new world as the day dawned he saw before him a level island several leagues in extent and covered with trees like a continual orchard though apparently uncultivated it was populous for the inhabitants were seen issuing from all parts of the woods and running to the shore they stood gazing at the ships and appeared by their attitudes and gestures to be lost in astonishment columbus made signal for the ships to cast anchor and the boats to be manned and armed he entered his own boat richly attired in scarlet and holding the royal standard while martin alonzo pinzon and his brother put off in company in their boats each with a banner of the enterprise emblazoned with a green cross having on either side the letters f and y the initials of the castilian monarchs fernando and ysabel surmounted by crowns as he approached the shore columbus who was disposed for all kinds of agreeable impressions was delighted with the purity and suavity of the atmosphere the crystal transparency of the sea and the extraordinary beauty of the vegetation he beheld also fruits of an unknown kind upon the trees which overhung the shores on landing he threw himself on his knees kissed the earth and returned thanks to god with tears of joy his example was followed by the rest whose hearts indeed overflowed with the same feelings of gratitude columbus then rising drew his sword displayed the royal standard and assembling round him the two captains and the rest who had landed he took solemn possession in the name of the castilian sovereigns giving the island the name of san salvador having complied with the requisite forms and ceremonies he called upon all present to take the oath of obedience to him as admiral and viceroy representing the persons of the sovereigns the feelings of the crew now burst forth in the most extravagant transports they had recently considered themselves devoted men hurrying forward to destruction they now looked upon themselves as favorites of fortune and gave themselves up to the most unbounded joy they thronged around the admiral with overflowing zeal some embracing him others kissing his hands those who had been most mutinous and turbulent during the voyage were now most devoted and enthusiastic some begged favors of him as if he had already wealth and honors in his gift many abject spirits who had outraged him by their insolence now crouched at his feet begging pardon for all the trouble they had caused him and promising the blindest obedience for the future the natives of the island when at the dawn of day they had beheld the ships hovering on their coast had supposed them monsters which had issued from the deep during the night they had crowded to the beach and watched their movements with awful anxiety their veering about apparently without effort and the shifting and furling of their sails resembling huge wings filled them with astonishment when they beheld their boats approach the shore and a number of strange beings clad in glittering steel or raiment of various colors landing upon the beach they fled in affright to the woods finding however that there was no attempt to pursue or molest them they gradually recovered from their terror and approached the spaniards with great awe frequently prostrating themselves on the earth and making signs of adoration during the ceremonies of taking possession they remained gazing in timid admiration at the complexion the beards the shining armor and splendid dress of the spaniards the admiral particularly attracted their attention from his commanding height his air of authority his dress of scarlet and the deference which was paid him by his companions all which pointed him out to be the commander when they had still further recovered from their fears they approached the spaniards touched their beards and examined their hands and faces admiring their whiteness columbus was pleased with their gentleness and confiding simplicity and soon won them by his kindly bearing they now supposed that the ships had sailed out of the crystal firmament which bounded their horizon or had descended from above on their ample wings and that these marvelous beings were inhabitants of the skies the natives of the island were no less objects of curiosity to the spaniards differing as they did from any race of men they had ever seen their appearance gave no promise of either wealth or civilization for they were entirely naked and painted with a variety of colors with some it was confined merely to a part of the face the nose or around the eyes with others it extended to the whole body and gave them a wild and fantastic appearance their complexion was of a tawny or copper hue and they were entirely destitute of beards their hair was not crisped like the recently discovered tribes of the african coast under the same latitude but straight and coarse partly cut short above the ears but some locks were left long behind and falling upon their shoulders their features though obscured and disfigured by paint were agreeable they had lofty foreheads and remarkably fine eyes they were of moderate stature and well shaped as columbus supposed himself to have landed on an island at the extremity of india he called the natives by the general name of indians which was universally adopted before the true nature of his discovery was known and has since been extended to all the aboriginals of the new world the islanders were friendly and gentle their only arms were lances hardened at the end by fire or pointed with a flint or the teeth or bone of a fish there was no iron to be seen nor did they appear acquainted with its properties for when a drawn sword was presented to them they unguardedly took it by the edge columbus distributed among them colored caps glass beads hawks bells and other trifles such as the portuguese were accustomed to trade with among the nations of the gold coast of africa they received them eagerly hung the beads round their necks and were wonderfully pleased with their finery and with the sound of the bells the spaniards remained all day on shore refreshing themselves after their anxious voyage amid the beautiful groves of the island and returned on board late in the evening delighted with all they had seen the island where columbus had thus for the first time set his foot upon the new world was called by the natives guanahane it still retains the name of san salvador which he gave to it though called by the english cat island footnote footnote from the life and voyages of christopher columbus by washington irving the glove and the lions king francis was a hearty king and loved a royal sport and one day as his lions fought sat looking on the court the nobles filled the benches with the ladies in their pride and mong them sat the count de lorge with one for whom he sighed and truly twas a gallant thing to see that crowning show valor and love and a king above and the royal beasts below ramped and roared the lions with horrid laughing jaws they bit they glared gave blows like beams a wind went with their paws with wallowing might and stifled roar they rolled on one another till all the pit with sand and mane was in a thundrous smother the bloody foam above the bars came whisking through the air said francis then faith gentlemen were better here than there illustration the glove and the lions de lorges love oerheard the king a beauteous lively dame with smiling lips and sharp bright eyes which always seemed the same she thought the count my lover is brave as brave can be he surely would do wondrous things to show his love of me king ladies lovers all look on the occasion is divine ill drop my glove to prove his love great glory will be mine she dropped her glove to prove his love then looked at him and smiled he bowed and in a moment leaped among the lions wild his leap was quick return was quick he has regained his place then threw the glove but not with love right in the ladys face well done cried francis bravely done and he rose from where he sat no love quoth he but vanity sets love a task like that footnote footnote by leigh hunt an english essayist and poet expression read this poem silently trying to understand fully the circumstances of the story the time the place the character of the leading actors then read aloud each stanza with feeling and expression st francis the gentle seven hundred years ago francis the gentlest of the saints was born in assisi the quaint umbrian town among the rocks and for twenty years and more he cherished but one thought and one desire and one hope and these were that he might lead the beautiful and holy and sorrowful life which our master lived on earth and that in every way he might resemble him in the purity and loveliness of his humanity not to men alone but to all living things on earth and air and water was st francis most gracious and loving they were all his little brothers and sisters and he forgot them not still less scorned or slighted them but spoke to them often and blessed them and in return they showed him great love and sought to be of his fellowship he bade his companions keep plots of ground for their little sisters the flowers and to these lovely and speechless creatures he spoke with no great fear that they would not understand his words and all this was a marvelous thing in a cruel time when human life was accounted of slight worth by fierce barons and ruffling marauders for the bees he set honey and wine in the winter lest they should feel the nip of the cold too keenly and bread for the birds that they all but especially my brother lark should have joy of christmastide and at rieti a brood of redbreasts were the guests of the house and raided the tables while the brethren were at meals and when a youth gave st francis the turtledoves he had snared the saint had nests made for them and there they laid their eggs and hatched them and fed from the hands of the brethren out of affection a fisherman once gave him a great tench but he put it back into the clear water of the lake bidding it love god and the fish played about the boat till st francis blessed it and bade it go why dost thou torment my little brothers the lambs he asked of a shepherd carrying them bound thus and hanging from a staff so that they cry piteously and in exchange for the lambs he gave the shepherd his cloak and at another time seeing amid a flock of goats one white lamb feeding he was concerned that he had nothing but his brown robe to offer for it for it reminded him of our lord among the pharisees but a merchant came up and paid for it and gave it him and he took it with him to the city and preached about it so that the hearts of those hearing him were melted afterwards the lamb was left in the care of a convent of holy women and to the saints great delight these wove him a gown of the lambs innocent wool fain would i tell of the coneys that took refuge in the folds of his habit and of the swifts which flew screaming in their glee while he was preaching but now it is time to speak of the sermon which he preached to a great multitude of birds in a field by the roadside when he was on his way to bevagno down from the trees flew the birds to hear him and they nestled in the grassy bosom of the field and listened till he had done and these were the words he spoke to them little birds little sisters mine much are you holden to god your creator and at all times and in every place you ought to praise him freedom he has given you to fly everywhere and raiment he has given you double and threefold more than this he preserved your kind in the ark so that your race might not come to an end still more do you owe him for the element of air which he has made your portion over and above you sow not neither do you reap but god feeds you and gives you streams and springs for your thirst the mountains he gives you and the valleys for your refuge and the tall trees wherein to build your nests and because you cannot sew or spin god takes thought to clothe you you and your little ones it must be then that your creator loves you much since he has granted you so many benefits be on your guard then against the sin of ingratitude and strive always to give god praise and when the saint ceased speaking the birds made such signs as they might by spreading their wings and opening their beaks to show their love and pleasure and when he had blessed them with the sign of the cross they sprang up and singing songs of unspeakable sweetness away they streamed in a great cross to the four quarters of heaven footnote footnote by william canton an english journalist and poet the sermon of st francis up soared the lark into the air a shaft of song a winged prayer as if a soul released from pain were flying back to heaven again st francis heard it was to him an emblem of the seraphim the upward motion of the fire the light the heat the hearts desire around assisis convent gate the birds gods poor who cannot wait from moor and mere and darksome wood came flocking for their dole of food o brother birds st francis said ye come to me and ask for bread but not with bread alone today shall ye be fed and sent away ye shall be fed ye happy birds with manna of celestial words not mine though mine they seem to be not mine though they be spoken through me oh doubly are ye bound to praise the great creator in your lays he giveth you your plumes of down your crimson hoods your cloaks of brown he giveth you your wings to fly and breathe a purer air on high and careth for you everywhere who for yourselves so little care with flutter of swift wings and songs together rose the feathered throngs and singing scattered far apart deep peace was in st francis heart he knew not if the brotherhood his homily had understood he only knew that to one ear the meaning of his words was clear footnote footnote by henry w longfellow expression talk with your teacher about the life work and influence of st francis refer to cyclopedias for information read aloud the prose version of his sermon to the birds the poetical version compare the two versions what is said in one that is not said in the other in the woods years ago when quite a youth i was rambling in the woods one day with my brothers gathering black birch and wintergreens as we lay upon the ground gazing vaguely up into the trees i caught sight of a bird the like of which i had never before seen or heard of it was the blue yellowbacked warbler which i have found since but to my young fancy it seemed like some fairy bird so curiously marked was it and so new and unexpected i saw it a moment as the flickering leaves parted noted the white spot on its wing and it was gone it was a revelation it was the first intimation i had had that the woods we knew so well held birds that we knew not at all were our eyes and ears so dull did we pass by the beautiful things in nature without seeing them had we been blind then there were the robin the bluejay the yellowbird and others familiar to every one but who ever dreamed that there were still others that not even the hunters saw and whose names few had ever heard the surprise that awaits every close observer of birds the thrill of delight that accompanies it and the feeling of fresh eager inquiry that follows can hardly be awakened by any other pursuit there is a fascination about it quite overpowering it fits so well with other things with fishing hunting farming walking camping out with all that takes one to the fields and the woods one may go blackberrying and make some rare discovery or while driving his cow to pasture hear a new song or make a new observation secrets lurk on all sides there is news in every bush expectation is ever on tiptoe what no man ever saw may the next moment be revealed to you what a new interest this gives to the woods how you long to explore every nook and corner of them one must taste it to understand the lookeron sees nothing to make such a fuss about only a little glimpse of feathers and a halfmusical note or two why all this ado it is not the mere knowledge of birds that you get but a new interest in the fields and woods the air the sunshine the healing fragrance and coolness and the getting away from the worry of life yesterday was an october day of rare brightness and warmth i spent the most of it in a wild wooded gorge of rock creek a tree which stood upon the bank had dropped some of its fruit in the water as i stood there halfleg deep a wood duck came flying down the creek presently it returned flying up then it came back again and sweeping low around a bend prepared to alight in a still dark reach in the creek which was hidden from my view as i passed that way about half an hour afterward the duck started up uttering its wild alarm note in the stillness i could hear the whistle of its wings and the splash of the water when it took flight near by i saw where a raccoon had come down to the water for fresh clams leaving its long sharp track in the mud and sand before i had passed this hidden stretch of water a pair of strange thrushes flew up from the ground and perched on a low branch who can tell how much this duck this footprint on the sand and these strange thrushes from the far north enhanced the interest and charm of the autumn woods birds cannot be learned satisfactorily from books the satisfaction is in learning them from nature one must have an original experience with the birds the books are only the guide the invitation but let me say in the same breath that the books can by no manner of means be dispensed with in the beginning one finds it very difficult to identify a bird in any verbal description first find your bird observe its ways its song its calls its flight its haunts then compare with your book in this way the feathered kingdom may soon be conquered footnote footnote by john burroughs an american writer on nature expression this and the selection which follows are fine examples of descriptive writing read them so that your hearers will understand every statement clearly and without special effort on their part talk about the various objects that are mentioned and tell what you have learned about them from other sources bees and flowers fancy yourself to be in a pretty country garden on a hot summers morning perhaps you have been walking or reading or playing but it is getting too hot now to do anything so you have chosen the shadiest nook under the walnut tree close to some pretty flower bed as you lie there you notice a gentle buzzing near you and you see that on the flower bed close by several bees are working busily among the flowers they do not seem to mind the heat nor do they wish to rest and they fly so lightly and look so happy over their work that it is pleasant to watch them that great bumblebee takes it leisurely enough as she goes lumbering along poking her head into the larkspurs she remains so long in each that you might almost think she had fallen asleep the brown hivebee on the other hand moves busily and quickly among the stocks sweet peas and mignonette she is evidently out on active duty and means to get all she can from each flower so as to carry a good load back to the hive in some blossoms she does not stay a moment but draws her head back almost as soon as she has popped it in as if to say no honey there but over other flowers she lingers a little and then scrambles out again with her drop of honey and goes off to seek more let us watch her a little more closely there are many different plants growing in the flower bed but curiously enough she does not go first to one kind and then to another but keeps to one the whole time now she flies away rouse yourself to follow her and you will see she takes her way back to the hive we all know why she makes so many journeys between the garden and the hive and that she is collecting drops of nectar from the flowers and carrying it to the hive to be stored up in the honeycomb for the winters food when she comes back again to the garden we will follow her in her work among the flowers and see what she is doing for them in return for their gifts to her no doubt you have already learned that plants can make better and stronger seeds when they can get the pollen dust from other plants but i am sure that you will be very much surprised to hear that the colors the scent and the curious shapes of the flowers are all so many baits to attract insects and for what reason in order that the insects may come and carry the pollen dust from one plant to another so far as we know it is entirely for this purpose that the plants form honey in different parts of the flower this food they prepare for the insects and then they have all sorts of contrivances to entice the little creatures to come and get it the plants hang out gaycolored signs as much as to say come to me and i will give you honey if you will bring me pollen dust in exchange if you watch the different kinds of grasses sedges and rushes which have such tiny flowers that you can scarcely see them you will find that no insects visit them neither will you ever find bees buzzing round oak trees elms or birches but on the pretty and sweetsmelling apple blossoms you will find bees wasps and other insects the reason of this is that grasses sedges rushes and oak trees have a great deal of pollen dust as the wind blows them to and fro it wafts the dust from one flower to another and so these plants do not need to give out honey or to have gaudy or sweetscented flowers to attract insects but the brilliant poppy the largeflowered hollyhock the flaunting dandelion and the bright blue forgetmenot all these are visited by insects which easily catch sight of them and hasten to sip their honey we must not forget what the fragrance of the flowers can do have you ever noticed the delicious odor which comes from beds of mignonette mint or sweet alyssum these plants have found another way of attracting the insects they have no need of bright colors for their fragrance is quite as true and certain a guide you will be surprised if you once begin to count them up how many dulllooking flowers are sweetscented while some gaudy flowers have little or no scent still we find some flowers like the beautiful lily the lovely rose and the delicate hyacinth which have color and fragrance and graceful shapes all combined but there are still other ways by which flowers secure the visits of insects have you not observed that different flowers open and close at different times the daisy receives its name days eye because it opens at sunrise and closes at sunset while the evening primrose spreads out its flowers just as the daisy is going to bed what do you think is the reason of this if you go near a bed of evening primroses just when the sun is setting you will soon be able to guess they will then give out such a sweet odor that you will not doubt for a moment that they are calling the evening moths to come and visit them the daisy however opens by day and is therefore visited by day insects again some flowers close whenever rain is coming look at the daisies when a storm is threatening as the sky grows dark and heavy you will see them shrink and close till the sun shines again they do this because in the center of the flower there is a drop of honey which would be spoiled if it were washed by the rain and now you will see why the cupshaped flowers so often droop their heads think of the snowdrop the lilyofthevalley and a host of others how pretty they look with their bells hanging so modestly from the slender stalk they are bending down to protect the honey within their cups we are gradually learning that everything which a plant does has its meaning if we can only find it out and when we are aware of this a flower garden may become a new world to us if we open our eyes to all that is going on in it and so we learn that even among insects and flowers those who do most for others receive most in return the bee and the flower do not reason about the matter they only live their little lives as nature guides them helping and improving each other i have been able to tell you but very little about the hidden work that is going on around us and you must not for a moment imagine that we have fully explored the fairy land of nature but at least we have passed through the gates and have learned that there is a world of wonder which we may visit if we will and it lies quite close to us hidden in every dewdrop and gust of wind in every brook and valley in every little plant and animal footnote footnote from the fairy land of nature by arabella b buckley expression make a list of all

wake to the sound of the song of the stream and the tempests shall cease and there shall be peace from the fairest of fountains and farthest of mountains from the stillness of snow came the stream in its flow down the slopes where the rocks are gray through the vales where the flowers are fair where the sunlight flashed where the shadows lay like stories that cloud a face of care the river ran on and on and on day and night and night and day going and going and never gone longing to flow to the far away staying and staying and never still going and staying as if one will said beautiful river go to the sea and another will whispered stay with me and the river made answer soft and low i go and stay i stay and go but what is the song i said at last to the passing river that never passed and

and read it aloud war and peace i war as the mother of valor and civilization we still hear war extolled at times as the mother of valor and the prime agency in the worlds advancement by it we are told civilization has spread and nations have been created slavery has been abolished and the american union preserved it is even held that without war human progress would have been impossible the answer men were at first savages who preyed upon each other like wild beasts and so they developed a physical courage which they shared with the brutes moral courage was unknown to them war was almost their sole occupation peace existed only for short periods that tribes might regain strength to resume the sacred duty of killing each other advancement in civilization was impossible while war reigned only as wars became less frequent and long intervals of peace supervened could civilization the mother of true heroism take root civilization has advanced just as war has receded until in our day peace has become the rule and war the exception arbitration of international disputes grows more and more in favor successive generations of men now live and die without seeing war and instead of the army and navy furnishing the only careers worthy of gentlemen it is with difficulty that civilized nations can today obtain a sufficient supply of either officers or men in the past mans only method for removing obstacles and attaining desired ends was to use brute courage the advance of civilization has developed moral courage we use more beneficent means than men did of old britain in the eighteenth century used force to prevent american independence in more recent times she graciously grants canada the rights denied america the united states also receives an award of the powers against china and finding it in excess of her expenditures in the spirit of newer time returns ten million dollars won by this act of justice china devotes the sum to the education of chinese students in the republics universities the greatest force is no longer that of brutal war but the supreme force of gentlemen and generosity the golden rule the pen is rapidly superseding the sword arbitration is banishing war more than five hundred international disputes have already been peacefully settled civilization not barbarism is the mother of true heroism our lately departed poet and disciple of peace richard watson gilder has left us the answer to the false idea that brute force employed against our fellows ranks with heroic moral courage exerted to save or serve them twas said when roll of drum and battles roar shall cease upon the earth oh then no more the deed the race of heroes in the land but scarce that word was breathed when one small hand lifted victorious oer a giant wrong that had its victims crushed through ages long some woman set her pale and quivering face firm as a rock against a mans disgrace a little child suffered in silence lest his savage pain should wound a mothers breast some quiet scholar flung his gauntlet down and risked in truths great name the synods frown a civic hero in the calm realm of laws did that which suddenly drew a worlds applause and one to the pest his lithe young body gave that he a thousand thousand lives might save on the field of carnage men lose all human instincts in the struggle to protect themselves the true heroism inspired by moral courage prompts firemen policemen sailors miners and others to volunteer and risk their lives to save the lives of their fellowmen such heroism is now of everyday occurrence in our age there is no more reason for permitting war between civilized nations than for relaxing the reign of law within nations which compels men to submit their personal disputes to peaceful courts and never dreams that by so doing they will be made less heroic when war ceases the sense of human brotherhood will be strengthened and heroism will no longer mean to kill but only to serve or save our fellows footnote footnote by andrew carnegie a scottishamerican manufacturer and philanthropist ii friendship among nations let us suppose that four centuries ago some farseeing prophet dared to predict to the duchies composing the kingdom of france that the day would come when they would no longer make war upon each other let us suppose him saying you will have many disputes to settle interests to contend for difficulties to resolve but do you know what you will select instead of armed men instead of cavalry and infantry of cannon lances pikes and swords you will select instead of all this destructive array a small box of wood which you will term a ballotbox and from what shall issue what an assembly an assembly in which you shall all live an assembly which shall be as it were the soul of all a supreme and popular council which shall decide judge resolve everything which shall say to each here terminates your right there commences your duty lay down your arms and in that day you will all have one common thought common interests a common destiny you will embrace each other and recognize each other as children of the same blood and of the same race that day you shall no longer be hostile tribes you will be a people you will be no longer merely burgundy normandy brittany provence you will be france you will no longer make appeals to war you will do so to civilization if at that period i speak of some one had uttered these words all men would have cried out what a dreamer what a dream how little this pretended prophet is acquainted with the human heart yet time has gone on and on and we find that this dream has been realized well then at this moment we who are assembled here say to france to england to spain to italy to russia a day will come when from your hands also the arms they have grasped shall fall a day will come when war shall appear as impossible and will be as impossible between paris and london between st petersburg and berlin as it is now between rouen and amiens between boston and philadelphia a day will come when you france you russia you italy you england you germany all of you nations of the continent shall without losing your distinctive qualities and your glorious individuality be blended into a superior unity and shall constitute an european fraternity just as normandy brittany burgundy lorraine have been blended into france a day will come when the only battle field shall be the market open to commerce and the mind open to new ideas a day will come when bullets and shells shall be replaced by votes by the universal suffrage of nations by the arbitration of a great sovereign senate nor is it necessary for four hundred years to pass away for that day to come we live in a period in which a year often suffices to do the work of a century suppose that the people of europe instead of mistrusting each other entertaining jealousy of each other hating each other become fast friends suppose they say that before they are french or english or german they are men and that if nations form countries human kind forms a family suppose that the enormous sums spent in maintaining armies should be spent in acts of mutual confidence suppose that the millions that are lavished on hatred were bestowed on love given to peace instead of war given to labor to intelligence to industry to commerce to navigation to agriculture to science to art if this enormous sum were expended in this manner know you what would happen the face of the world would be changed isthmuses would be cut through railroads would cover the continents the merchant navy of the globe would be increased a hundredfold there would be nowhere barren plains nor moors nor marshes cities would be found where now there are only deserts asia would be rescued to civilization africa would be rescued to man abundance would gush forth on every side from every vein of the earth at the touch of man like the living stream from the rock beneath the rod of moses

in those good old days of simplicity and sunshine a passion for cleanliness was the leading principle in domestic economy and the universal test of an able housewife the front door was never opened except for marriages funerals new years day the festival of st nicholas or some such great occasion it was ornamented with a gorgeous brass knocker which was curiously wrought sometimes in the device of a dog and sometimes in that of a lions head and daily burnished with such religious zeal that it was often worn out by the very precautions taken for its preservation the whole house was constantly in a state of inundation under the discipline of mops and brooms and scrubbing brushes and the good housewives of those days were a kind of amphibious animal delighting exceedingly to be dabbling in water insomuch that an historian of the day gravely tells us that many of his townswomen grew to have webbed fingers like unto ducks the grand parlor was the sanctum sanctorum where the passion for cleaning was indulged without control no one was permitted to enter this sacred apartment except the mistress and her confidential maid who visited it once a week for the purpose of giving it a thorough cleaning on these occasions they always took the precaution of leaving their shoes at the door and entering devoutly in their stocking feet after scrubbing the floor sprinkling it with fine white sand which was curiously stroked with a broom into angles and curves and rhomboids after washing the windows rubbing and polishing the furniture and putting a new branch of evergreens in the fireplace the windows were again closed to keep out the flies and the room was kept carefully locked until the revolution of time brought round the weekly cleaning day as to the family they always entered in at the gate and generally lived in the kitchen to have seen a numerous household assembled round the fire one would have imagined that he was transported to those happy days of primeval simplicity which float before our imaginations like golden visions the fireplaces were of a truly patriarchal magnitude where the whole family old and young master and servant black and white nay even the very cat and dog enjoyed a community of privilege and had each a right to a corner here the old burgher would sit in perfect silence puffing his pipe looking in the fire with halfshut eyes and thinking of nothing for hours together the good wife on the opposite side would employ herself diligently in spinning yarn or knitting stockings the young folks would crowd around the hearth listening with breathless attention to some old crone of a negro who was the oracle of the family and who perched like a raven in a corner of the chimney would croak forth for a long winter afternoon a string of incredible stories about new england witches grisly ghosts and bloody encounters among indians in those happy days fashionable parties were generally confined to the higher classes or noblesse that is to say such as kept their own cows and drove their own wagons the company usually assembled at three oclock and went away about six unless it was in winter time when the fashionable hours were a little earlier that the ladies might reach home before dark the tea table was crowned with a huge earthen dish well stored with slices of fat pork fried brown cut up into morsels and swimming in gravy the company seated round the genial board evinced their dexterity in launching their forks at the fattest pieces in this mighty dish in much the same manner that sailors harpoon porpoises at sea or our indians spear salmon in the lakes sometimes the table was graced with immense apple pies or saucers full of preserved peaches and pears but it was always sure to boast an enormous dish of balls of sweetened dough fried in hogs fat and called doughnuts or olykoeks a delicious kind of cake at present little known in this city except in genuine dutch families the tea was served out of a majestic delft teapot ornamented with paintings of fat little dutch shepherds and shepherdesses tending pigs with boats sailing in the air and houses built in the clouds and sundry other ingenious dutch fancies the beaux distinguished themselves by their adroitness in replenishing this pot from a huge copper teakettle to sweeten the beverage a lump of sugar was laid beside each cup and the company alternately nibbled and sipped with great decorum until an improvement was introduced by a shrewd and economic old lady which was to suspend by a string from the ceiling a large lump directly over the tea table so that it could be swung from mouth to mouth at these primitive tea parties the utmost propriety and dignity prevailed no flirting nor coquetting no romping of young ladies no selfsatisfied struttings of wealthy gentlemen with their brains in their pockets nor amusing conceits and monkey divertisements of smart young gentlemen with no brains at all on the contrary the young ladies seated themselves demurely in their rushbottomed chairs and knit their own woolen stockings nor ever opened their lips excepting to say yah mynheer or yah yah vrouw to any question that was asked them

red logs before us beat the frost line back with tropic heat and ever when a louder blast shook beam and rafter as it passed the merrier up its roaring draft the great throat of the chimney laughed the house dog on his paws outspread laid to the fire his drowsy head the cats dark silhouette on the wall a couchant tigers seemed to fall and for the winter fireside meet between the andirons straddling feet the mug of cider simmered slow and apples sputtered in a row and close at hand the basket stood with nuts from brown octobers woods what matter how the night behaved what matter how the north wind raved blow high blow low not all its snow could quench our hearthfires ruddy glow illustration a winter evening in old new england the oldfashioned thanksgiving i do not know but it is that old new england holiday of thanksgiving which for one of new england birth has most of home associations tied up with it and most of gleeful memories i know that they are very present ones we all knew when it was coming we all loved turkey not turkey on the map for which we cared very little after we had once bounded it by the black sea on the east and by something else on the other sides but basted turkey brown turkey stuffed turkey here was richness we had scored off the days until we were sure to a recitation mark when it was due well into the end of november when winds would be blowing from the northwest with great piles of dry leaves all down the sides of the street and in the angles of pasture walls i cannot for my life conceive why any one should upset the old order of things by marking it down a fortnight earlier a man in the country wants his crops well in and housed before he is ready to gush out with a round outspoken thanksgiving but everybody knows who knows anything about it that the purple tops and the cowhorn turnips are nine times in ten left out till the latter days of november and husking not half over we all knew as i said when it was coming we had a stock of empty flour barrels on townhill stuffed with leaves and a big pole set in the ground and a battered tar barrel with its bung chopped out to put on top of the pole it was all to beat the last years bonfire and it did the country wagoners had made their little stoppages at the back door we knew what was to come of that and if the old cook a monstrous fine woman who weighed two hundred if she weighed a pound was brusque and wouldnt have us round we knew what was to come of that too such pies as hers demanded thoughtful consideration not very large and baked in scalloped tins and with such a relishy flavor to them as on my honor i do not recognize in any pies of this generation the sermon on that thanksgiving and we all heard it was long we boys were prepared for that too but we couldnt treat a thanksgiving sermon as we would an ordinary one we couldnt doze there was too much ahead it seemed to me that the preacher made rather a merit of holding us in check with that basted turkey in waiting at last though it came to an end and i believe dick and i both joined in the doxology all that followed is to me now a cloud of misty and joyful expectation until we took our places a score or more of cousins and kinsfolk and the turkey and celery and cranberries and what nots were all in place did dick whisper to me as we went in get next to me old fellow i cannot say i have a half recollection that he did but bless me what did anybody care for what dick said and the old gentleman who bowed his head and said grace there is no forgetting him and the little goldenhaired one who sat at his left his pet his idol who lisped the thanksgiving after him shall i forget her and the games of forfeit afterwards at evening that brought her curls near to me these fifty years she has been gone from sight and is dust what an awful tide of thanksgivings has drifted by since she bowed her golden locks and clasped her hand and murmured our father we thank thee for this and for all thy bounties who else well troops of cousins good bad and indifferent no man is accountable for his cousins i think or if he is the law should be changed if a man cant speak honestly of cousinhood to the third or fourth degree what can he speak honestly of didnt i see little floy who wore peagreen silk make a saucy grimace when i made a false cut at that rolypoly turkey drumstick and landed it on the tablecloth there was that scamp tom too who loosened his waistcoat before he went into dinner i saw him do it didnt he make faces at me till he caught a warning from aunt pollys uplifted finger illustration a thanksgiving reunion how should i forget that good kindly aunt polly very severe in her turban and with her meetinghouse face upon her but full of a great wealth of bonbons and dried fruits on saturday afternoons in i know not what capacious pockets ample too in her jokes and in her laugh making that day a great maelstrom of mirth around her h sells hides now and is as rich as croesus whatever that may mean but does he remember his venturesome foray for a little bit of crisp roast pig that lay temptingly on the edge of the dish that day there was sarah too turned of seventeen education complete looking down on us all terribly learned i know for a fact that she kept mrs hemans in her pocket terribly selfasserting too if she had not married happily and not had a little brood about her in after years which she did i think she would have made one of the most terrible sorosians of our time at least that is the way i think of it now looking back across the basted turkey which she ate without gravy and across the range of eager thanksgiving faces there was uncle ned no forgetting him who had a way of patting a boy on the head so that the patting reached clear through to the boys heart and made him sure of a blessing hovering over that was the patting i liked thats the sort of uncle to come to a thanksgiving dinner the sort that eat double filberts with you and pay up next day by noon with a pocketknife or a riding whip hurrah for uncle ned and aunt eliza is there any keeping her out of mind i never liked the name much but the face and the kindliness which was always ready to cover as well as she might what wrong we did and to make clear what good we did make me enrol her now where she belongs evermore among the saints so quiet so gentle so winning making conquest of all of us because she never sought it full of dignity yet never asserting it queening it over all by downright kindliness of heart what a wife she would have made heigho how we loved her and made our boyish love of her a thanksgiving were there oranges i think there were with green spots on the peel lately arrived from florida tom boasted that he ate four i dare say he told the truth he looked peaked and was a great deal the worse for the dinner next day i remember was there punch or any strong liquors no so far as my recollection now goes there was none champagne i have a faint remembrance of a loud pop or two which set some cousinly curls over opposite me into a nervous shake yet i would not like to speak positively good bottled cider or pop beer may possibly account for all the special phenomena i call to mind was there coffee and were there olives not to the best of my recollection or if present i lose them in the glamour of mince pies and marlborough puddings how we ever sidled away from that board when that feast was done i have no clear conception i am firm in the belief that thanksgiving was said at the end as at the beginning i have a faint recollection of a gray head passing out at the door and of a fleece of golden curls beside him against which i jostle not unkindly dark yes i think the sun had gone down about the time when the mince pies had faded did dick and tom and the rest of us come sauntering in afterwards when the rooms were empty foraging for any little tidbits of the feast that might be left the tables showing only wreck under the dim light of a solitary candle how we found our way with the weight of that stupendous dinner by us to the heights of townhill it is hard to tell but we did and when our barrel pile was fairly ablaze we danced like young satyrs round the flame shouting at our very loudest when the fire caught the tar barrel at the top and the yellow pile of blaze threw its lurid glare over hill and houses and town afterwards i have recollection of an hour or more in a snug square parlor which is given over to us youngsters and our games dimly lighted as was most fitting but a fire upon the hearth flung out a red glory on the floor and on the walls was it a high old time or did we only pretend that it was didnt i know little floy in that peagreen silk with my hands clasped round her waist and my eyes blinded ever so fast didnt i give dick an awful pinch in the leg when i lay perdu under the sofa in another one of those tremendous games didnt the door that led into the hall show a little open gap from time to time old faces peering in looking very kindly in the red firelight flaring on them and didnt those we loved best look oftenest dont they always well well we were fagged at last little floy in a snooze before we knew it dick pretending not to be sleepy but gaping in a prodigious way but the romps and the fatigue made sleep very grateful when it came at last yet the sleep was very broken the turkey and the nuts had their rights and bred stupendous thanksgiving dreams what gorgeous dreams they were to be sure i seem to dream them again today once again i see the old revered gray head bowing in utter thankfulness with the hands clasped once again over the awful tide of intervening years so full and yet so short i seem to see the shimmer of her golden hair an aureole of light blazing on the borders of boyhood for this and all thy bounties our father we thank thee footnote footnote from bound together by donald g mitchell published by charles scribners sons

footnote footnote by robert herrick an english poet first days at wakefield a proof that even the humblest fortune may grant happiness which depends not on circumstances but constitution the place of our retreat was in a little neighborhood consisting of farmers who tilled their own grounds and were equal strangers to opulence and poverty as they had almost all the conveniences of life within themselves they seldom visited towns or cities in search of superfluity remote from the polite they still retained the primeval simplicity of manners and frugal by habit they scarcely knew that temperance was a virtue they wrought with cheerfulness on days of labor but observed festivals as intervals of idleness and pleasure they kept up the christmas carol sent true love knots on valentine morning ate pancakes on shrovetide showed their wit on the first of april and religiously cracked nuts on michaelmas eve being apprised of our approach the whole neighborhood came out to meet their minister dressed in their finest clothes and preceded by a pipe and tabor a feast also was provided for our reception at which we sat cheerfully down and what the conversation wanted in wit was made up in laughter our little habitation was situated at the foot of a slopping bill sheltered with a beautiful underwood behind and a prattling river before on one side a meadow on the other a green my farm consisted of about twenty acres of excellent land having given a hundred pounds for my predecessors goodwill nothing could exceed the neatness of my little inclosures the elms and hedgerows appearing with inexpressible beauty my house consisted of but one story and was covered with thatch which gave it an air of great snugness the walls on the inside were nicely whitewashed and my daughters undertook to adorn them with pictures of their own designing though the same room served us for parlor and kitchen that only made it the warmer besides as it was kept with the utmost neatness the dishes plates and coppers being well scoured and all disposed in bright rows on the shelves the eye was agreeably relieved and did not want richer furniture there were three other apartments one for my wife and me another for our two daughters and the third with two beds for the rest of the children the little republic to which i gave laws was regulated in the following manner by sunrise we all assembled in our common apartment the fire being previously kindled by the servant after we had saluted each other with proper ceremony for i always thought fit to keep up some mechanical forms of good breeding without which freedom ever destroys friendship we all bent in gratitude to that being who gave us another day this duty being performed my son and i went to pursue our usual industry abroad while my wife and daughters employed themselves in providing breakfast which was always ready at a certain time i allowed half an hour for this meal and an hour for dinner which time was taken up in innocent mirth between my wife and daughters and in philosophical arguments between my son and me as we rose with the sun so we never pursued our labors after it was gone down but returned home to the expecting family where smiling looks a neat hearth and pleasant fire were prepared for our reception nor were we without guests sometimes farmer flamborough our talkative neighbor and often the blind piper would pay us a visit and taste our gooseberry wine for the making of which we had lost neither the receipt nor the reputation the night was concluded in the manner we began the morning my youngest boys being appointed to read the lessons of the day and he that read loudest distinctest and best was to have a halfpenny on sunday to put in the poors box when sunday came it was indeed a day of finery which all my sumptuary edicts could not restrain how well soever i fancied my lectures against pride had conquered the vanity of my daughters yet i still found them secretly attached to all their former finery they still loved laces ribbons bugles and catgut my wife herself retained a passion for her crimson paduasoy because i formerly happened to say it became her illustration the first sunday at wakefield the first sunday in particular their behavior served to mortify me i had desired my girls the preceding night to be dressed early the next day for i always loved to be at church a good while before the rest of the congregation they punctually obeyed my directions but when we were to assemble in the morning at breakfast down came my wife and daughters dressed out all in their former splendor their hair plastered up with pomatum their faces patched to taste their trains bundled up in a heap behind and rustling at every motion i could not help smiling at their vanity particularly that of my wife from whom i expected more discretion in this exigence therefore my only resource was to order my son with an important air to call our coach the girls were amazed at the command but i repeated it with more solemnity than before surely my dear you jest cried my wife we can walk it perfectly well we want no coach to carry us now you mistake child returned i we do want a coach for if we walk to church in this trim the very children in the parish will hoot after us indeed replied my wife i always imagined that my charles was fond of seeing his children neat and handsome about him you may be as neat as you please interrupted i and i shall love you the better for it but all this is not neatness but frippery these rufflings and pinkings and patchings will only make us hated by all the wives of all our neighbors no my children continued i more gravely those gowns may be altered into something of a plainer cut for finery is very unbecoming in us who want the means of decency i do not know whether such flouncing and shredding is becoming even in the rich if we consider upon a moderate calculation that the nakedness of the indigent world may be clothed from the trimmings of the vain this remonstrance had the proper effect they went with great composure that very instant to change their dress and the next day i had the satisfaction of finding my daughters at their own request employed in cutting up their trains into sunday waistcoats for dick and bill the two little ones and what was still more satisfactory the gowns seemed improved by this curtailing footnote footnote from the vicar of wakefield by oliver goldsmith a celebrated english author expression in this selection and the two which follow we have

another reread the selections from dickens thackeray and george eliot and compare them with these which do you like best why doubting castle i the pilgrims lose their way now i beheld in my dream that christian and hopeful had not journeyed far until they came where the river and the way parted at which they were not a little sorry yet they durst not go out of the way now the way from the river was rough and their feet tender by reason of their travel so the souls of the pilgrims were much discouraged because of the way wherefore still as they went on they wished for a better way now a little before them there was in the left hand of the road a meadow and a stile to go over into it and that meadow is called bypath meadow then said christian to his fellow if this meadow lieth along by our wayside let us go over into it then he went to the stile to see and behold a path lay along by the way on the other side of the fence tis according to my wish said christian here is the easiest going come good hopeful and let us go over but how if this path should lead us out of the way that is not likely said the other look doth it not go along by the wayside so hopeful being persuaded by his fellow went after him over the stile when they were gone over and were got into the path they found it very easy for their feet and withal they looking before them espied a man walking as they did and his name was vainconfidence so they called after him and asked him whither that way led he said to the celestial gate look said christian did not i tell you so by this you may see we are right so they followed and he went before them but behold the night came on and it grew very dark so that they who were behind lost sight of them that went before he therefore that went before vainconfidence by name not seeing the way before him fell into a deep pit and was dashed in pieces with his fall now christian and his fellow heard him fall so they called to know the matter but there was none to answer only they heard a groan then said hopeful where are we now then was his fellow silent as mistrusting that he had led him out of the way and now it began to rain and thunder and lightning in a most dreadful manner and the water rose amain by reason of which the way of going back was very dangerous yet they adventured to go back but it was so dark and the flood so high that in their going back they had like to have been drowned nine or ten times neither could they with all the skill they had get back again to the stile that night wherefore at last lighting under a little shelter they sat down there until daybreak but being weary they fell asleep illustration in the giants dungeon ii in the giants dungeon now there was not far from the place where they lay a castle called doubting castle the owner whereof was giant despair and it was in his grounds they now were sleeping wherefore he getting up in the morning early and walking up and down in his fields caught christian and hopeful asleep in his grounds then with a grim and surly voice he bid them awake and asked them whence they were and what they did in his grounds they told him they were pilgrims and that they had lost their way then said the giant you have this night trespassed on me by trampling in and lying on my grounds and therefore you must go along with me so they were forced to go because he was stronger than they they also had but little to say for they knew themselves in a fault the giant therefore drove them before him and put them into his castle in a very dark dungeon here then they lay from wednesday morning till saturday night without one bit of bread or drop of drink or light or any to ask how they did they were therefore here in evil case and were far from friends and acquaintance now giant despair had a wife and her name was diffidence so when he was gone to bed he told his wife that he had taken a couple of prisoners and had cast them into his dungeon for trespassing on his grounds then he asked her also what he had best do to them so she asked him what they were whence they came and whither they were bound and he told her then she counseled him that when he arose in the morning he should beat them without mercy so when he arose he getteth him a grievous crabtree cudgel and goes into the dungeon to them and there first falls to rating of them as if they were dogs although they never gave him an unpleasant word then he fell upon them and beat them fearfully in such sort that they were not able to help themselves or to turn them upon the floor this done he withdraws and leaves them there to condole their misery and to mourn under their distress so all that day they spent their time in nothing but sighs and bitter lamentations the next night she talking with her husband further about them and understanding that they were yet alive did advise him to counsel them to make away with themselves so when morning was come he goes to them in a surly manner as before and perceiving them to be very sore with the stripes that he had given them the day before he told them that since they were never like to come out of that place their only way would be forthwith to make an end of themselves either with knife halter or poison for why he said should you choose to live seeing it is attended with so much bitterness but they desired him to let them go with that he looked ugly upon them and rushing to them had doubtless made an end of them himself but that he fell into one of his fits and lost for a time the use of his hands wherefore he withdrew and left them as before to consider what to do then did the prisoners consult between themselves whether it was best to take his counsel or no but they soon resolved to reject it for it would be very wicked to kill themselves and besides something might soon happen to enable them to make their escape well towards evening the giant goes down to the dungeon again to see if his prisoners had taken his counsel but when he came there he found them alive i say he found them alive at which he fell into a grievous rage and told them that seeing they had disobeyed his counsel it should be worse with them than if they had never been born at this they trembled greatly and i think that christian fell into a swoon but coming a little to himself again they renewed their discourse about the giants counsel and whether yet they had best take it or no now christian again seemed for doing it but hopeful reminded him of the hardships and terrors he had already gone through and said that they ought to bear up with patience as well as they could and steadily reject the giants wicked counsel now night being come again and the giant and his wife being in bed she asked him concerning the prisoners and if they had taken his counsel to this he replied they are sturdy rogues they choose rather to bear all hardships than to make away themselves then said she take them into the castle yard tomorrow and show them the bones and skulls of those that thou hast already dispatched and make them believe thou wilt tear them in pieces as thou hast done their fellows before them so when morning has come the giant goes to them again and takes them into the castle yard and shows them as his wife had bidden him these said he were pilgrims as you are once and they trespassed on my grounds as you have done and when i thought fit i tore them in pieces and so within ten days i will do to you get you down to your den again and with that he beat them all the way thither now when night was come mrs diffidence and her husband began to renew their discourse of their prisoners the old giant wondered that he could neither by his blows nor by his counsel bring them to an end and with that his wife replied i fear said she that they live in hopes that some will come to relieve them or that they have picklocks about them by the means of which they hope to escape and sayest thou so my dear said the giant i will therefore search them in the morning well on saturday about midnight they began to pray and continued in prayer till almost break of day now a little before it was day good christian as one half amazed brake out into a passionate speech what a fool am i thus to lie in a dungeon i have a key in my bosom called promise that will i am persuaded open any lock in doubting castle then said hopeful thats good news good brother pluck it out of thy bosom and try then christian pulled it out of his bosom and began to try at the dungeon door whose bolt as he turned the key gave back and the door flew open with ease and christian and hopeful both came out after that he went to the iron gate for that must be opened too but that lock went desperately hard yet the key did open it then they thrust open the gate to make their escape with speed but that gate as it opened made such a creaking that it waked giant despair who hastily rising to pursue his prisoners felt his limbs to fail for his fits took him again so that he could by no means go after them then they went on and came to the kings highway again and so were safe footnote footnote from the pilgrims progress by john bunyan a famous english preacher and writer expression what peculiarities do you observe in bunyans style of writing select the three most striking passages in this story and read them with spirit and correct expression shooting with the longbow proclamation was made that prince john suddenly called by high and peremptory public duties held himself obliged to discontinue the entertainments of tomorrows festival nevertheless that unwilling so many good yeomen should depart without a trial of skill he was pleased to appoint them before leaving the ground presently to execute the competition of archery intended for the morrow to the best archer a prize was to be awarded being a buglehorn mounted with silver and a silken baldric richly ornamented with a medallion of st hubert the patron of sylvan sport more than thirty yeomen at first presented themselves as competitors several of whom were rangers and underkeepers in the royal forests of needwood and charnwood when however the archers understood with whom they were to be matched upwards of twenty withdrew themselves from the contest unwilling to encounter the dishonor of almost certain defeat the diminished list of competitors for sylvan fame still amounted to eight prince john stepped from his royal seat to view more nearly the persons of these chosen yeomen several of whom wore the royal livery having satisfied his curiosity by this investigation he looked for the object of his resentment whom he observed standing on the same spot and with the same composed countenance which he had exhibited upon the preceding day fellow said prince john i guessed by thy insolent babble thou wert no true lover of the longbow and i see thou darest not adventure thy skill among such merry men as stand yonder under favor sir replied the yeoman i have another reason for refraining to shoot besides the fearing discomfiture and disgrace and what is thy other reason said prince john who for some cause which perhaps he could not himself have explained felt a painful curiosity respecting this individual because replied the woodsman i know not if these yeomen and i are used to shoot at the same marks and because moreover i know not how your grace might relish the winning of a third prize by one who has unwittingly fallen under your displeasure prince john colored as he put the question what is thy name yeoman locksley answered the yeoman then locksley said prince john thou shalt shoot in thy turn when these yeomen have displayed their skill if thou carriest the prize i will add to it twenty nobles but if thou losest it thou shalt be stripped of thy lincoln green and scourged out of the lists with bowstrings for a wordy and insolent braggart and how if i refuse to shoot on such a wager said the yeoman your graces power supported as it is by so many men at arms may indeed easily strip and scourge me but cannot compel me to bend or to draw my bow if thou refusest my fair proffer said the prince the provost of the lists shall cut thy bowstring break thy bow and arrows and expel thee from the presence as a fainthearted craven this is no fair chance you put on me proud prince said the yeoman to compel me to peril myself against the best archers of leicester and staffordshire under the penalty of infamy if they should overshoot me nevertheless i will obey your pleasure look to him close men at arms said prince john his heart is sinking i am jealous lest he attempt to escape the trial and do you good fellows shoot boldly round a buck and a butt of wine are ready for your refreshment in yonder tent when the prize is won a target was placed at the upper end of the southern avenue which led to the lists the contending archers took their station in turn at the bottom of the southern access the distance between that station and the mark allowing full distance for what was called a shot at rovers the archers having previously determined by lot their order of precedence were to shoot each three shafts in succession the sports were regulated by an officer of inferior rank termed the provost of the games for the high rank of the marshals of the lists would have been held degraded had they condescended to superintend the sports of the yeomanry one by one the archers stepping forward delivered their shafts yeomanlike and bravely of twentyfour arrows shot in succession ten were fixed in the target and the others ranged so near it that considering the distance of the mark it was accounted good archery of the ten shafts which hit the target two within the inner ring were shot by hubert a forester who was accordingly pronounced victorious now locksley said prince john to the bold yeoman with a bitter smile wilt thou try conclusions with hubert or wilt thou yield up bow baldric and quiver to the provost of the sports sith it be no better said locksley i am content to try my fortune on condition that when i have shot two shafts at yonder mark of huberts he shall be bound to shoot one at that which i shall propose that is but fair answered prince john and it shall not be refused thee if thou dost beat this braggart hubert i will fill the bugle with silver pennies for thee a man can but do his best answered hubert but my grandsire drew a good longbow at hastings and i trust not to dishonor his memory the former target was now removed and a fresh one of the same size placed in its room hubert who as victor in the first trial of skill had the right to shoot first took his aim with great deliberation long measuring the distance with his eye while he held in his hand his bended bow with the arrow placed on the string at length he made a step forward and raising the bow at the full stretch of his left arm till the center of grasping place was nigh level with his face he drew the bowstring to his ear the arrow whistled through the air and lighted within the inner ring of the target but not exactly in the center you have not allowed for the wind hubert said his antagonist bending his bow or that had been a better shot so saying and without showing the least anxiety to pause upon his aim locksley stepped to the appointed station and shot his arrow as carelessly in appearance as if he had not even looked at the mark he was speaking almost at the instant that the shaft left the bowstring yet it alighted in the target two inches nearer to the white spot which marked the center than that of hubert by the light of heaven said prince john to hubert an thou suffer that runagate knave to overcome thee thou art worthy of the gallows hubert had but one set of speech for all occasions an your highness were to hang me he said a man can but do his best nevertheless my grandsire drew a good bow the foul fiend on thy grandsire and all his generation interrupted john shoot knave and shoot thy best or it shall be the worse for thee thus exhorted hubert resumed his place and not neglecting the caution which he had received from his adversary he made the necessary allowance for a very light breath of wind which had just arisen and shot so successfully that his arrow alighted in the very center of the target a hubert a hubert shouted the populace more interested in a known person than in a stranger in the clout in the clout a hubert forever thou canst not mend that shot locksley said the prince with an insulting smile i will notch his shaft for him however replied locksley and letting fly his arrow with a little more precaution than before it lighted right upon that of his competitor which it split to shivers the people who stood around were so astonished at his wonderful dexterity that they could not even give vent to their surprise in their usual clamor this must be the devil and no man of flesh and blood whispered the yeomen to each other such archery was never seen since a bow was first bent in britain and now said locksley i will crave your graces permission to plant such a mark as is used in the north country and welcome every brave yeoman to try a shot at it he then turned to leave the lists let your guards attend me he said if you please i go but to cut a rod from the next willow bush prince john made a signal that some attendants should follow him in case of his escape but the cry of shame shame which burst from the multitude induced him to alter his ungenerous purpose locksley returned almost instantly with a willow wand about six feet in length perfectly straight and rather thicker than a mans thumb he began to peel this with great composure observing at the same time that to ask a good woodsman to shoot at a target so broad as had hitherto been used was to put shame upon his skill for my own part said he in the land where i was bred men would as soon take for their mark king arthurs round table which held sixty knights around it a child of seven years old might hit yonder target with a headless shaft but he added walking deliberately to the other end of the lists and sticking the willow wand upright in the ground he that hits that rod at fivescore yards i call him an archer fit to bear both bow and quiver before a king and it were the stout king richard himself my grandsire said hubert drew a good bow at the battle of hastings and never shot at such a mark in his life neither will i if this yeoman can cleave that rod i give him the bucklers or rather i yield to the devil that is in his jerkin and not to any human skill a man can but do his best and i will not shoot where i am sure to miss i might as well shoot at the edge of our parsons whittle or at a wheat straw or at a sunbeam as at a twinkling white streak which i can hardly see cowardly dog exclaimed prince john sirrah locksley do thou shoot but if thou hittest such a mark i will say thou art the first man ever did so however it be thou shalt not crow over us with a mere show of superior skill a man can but do his best as hubert says answered locksley so saying he again bent his bow but on the present occasion looked with attention to his weapon and changed the string which he thought was no longer truly round having been a little frayed by the two former shots he then took his aim with some deliberation and the multitude awaited the event in breathless silence the archer vindicated their opinion of his skill his arrow split the willow rod against which it was aimed a jubilee of acclamations followed and even prince john in admiration of locksleys skill lost for an instant his dislike to his person these twenty nobles he said which with the bugle thou hast fairly won are thine own we will make them fifty if thou wilt take livery and service with us as a yeoman of our bodyguard and be near to our person for never did so strong a hand bend a bow or so true an eye direct a shaft pardon me noble prince said locksley but i have vowed that if ever i take service it should be with your royal brother king richard these twenty nobles i leave to hubert who has this day drawn as brave a bow as his grandsire did at hastings had his modesty not refused the trial he would have hit the wand as well as i hubert shook his head as he received with reluctance the bounty of the stranger and locksley anxious to escape further observation mixed with the crowd and was seen no more footnote footnote from ivanhoe by sir walter scott expression compare this selection with the two

head to show where i am and to keep people out of the gutters at this sultry noontide i am cupbearer to the parched populace for whose benefit an iron goblet is chained to my waist like a dram seller

eyes around the brim of their monstrous drinking vessel an ox is your true toper i hold myself the grand reformer of the age from the town pump as from other sources of water supply must flow the

forth upon this continent a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal now we are engaged in a great civil war testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure we are met on a great battle field of that war we have come to dedicate a portion of that field as the final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live it is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this but in a larger sense we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract the world will little note nor long remember what we say here but it can never forget what they did here it is for us the living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced it is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain that this nation under god shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth footnote footnote by

poet the chariot race orestes he is dead i will tell all as it happened he journeyed forth to attend the great games which hellas counts her pride to join the delphic contests there he heard the heralds voice with loud and clear command proclaim as coming first the chariot race and so he entered radiant every eye admiring as he passed and in the race he equaled all the promise of his form in those his rounds and so with noblest prize of conquest left the ground summing up in fewest words what many scarce could tell i know of none in strength and act like him and having won the prize in all the fivefold forms of race which the umpires had proclaimed he then was hailed proclaimed an argive and his name orestes the son of mighty agamemnon who once led hellass glorious host so far well but when a god will injure none can escape strong though he be for lo another day when as the sun was rising came the race swiftfooted of the chariot and the horse he entered the contest with many charioteers one was an achжan one was from sparta two were from libya with fourhorsed chariots and orestes with swift thessalian mares came as the fifth a sixth with bright bay colts came from жtolia the seventh was born in far magnesia the eighth was an жnian with white horses the ninth was from athens the city built by the gods the tenth and last was a boeotian illustration the chariot race and so they stood their cars in order as the umpires had decided by lot then with sound of brazen trumpet they started all cheering their steeds at the same moment they shook the reins and at once the course was filled with the clash and din of rattling chariots and the dust rose high all were now commingled each striving to pass the hubs of his neighbors wheels hard and hot were the horses breathings and their backs and the chariot wheels were white with foam each charioteer when he came to the place where the last stone marks the courses goal turned the corner sharply letting go the righthand trace horse and pulling the nearer in and so at first the chariots kept their course but at length the жnians unbroken colts just as they finished their sixth or seventh round turned headlong back and dashed at full speed against the chariot wheels of those who were following then with tremendous uproar each crashed on the other they fell overturned and crissas broad plain was filled with wreck of chariots the man from athens skilled and wise as a charioteer saw the mischief in time turned his steeds aside and escaped the whirling raging surge of man and horse last of all orestes came holding his horses in check and waiting for the end but when he saw the athenian his only rival left he urged his colts forward shaking the reins and speeding onward and now the twain continued the race their steeds sometimes head to head sometimes one gaining ground sometimes the other and so all the other rounds were passed in safety upright in his chariot still stood the illstarred hero then just as his team was turning he let loose the left rein unawares and struck the farthest pillar breaking the spokes right at his axles center slipping out of his chariot he was dragged along with reins dissevered his frightened colts tore headlong through the midst of the field and the people seeing him in his desperate plight bewailed him greatly so young so noble so unfortunate now hurled upon the ground helpless lifeless the charioteers scarcely able to restrain the rushing steeds freed the poor broken body so mangled that not one of all his friends would have known whose it was they built a pyre and burned it and now they bear hither in a poor urn of bronze the sad ashes of that mighty form that so orestes may have his tomb in his fatherland such is my tale full sad to hear but to me who saw this accident nothing can ever be more sorrowful illustration footnote footnote translated from the electra of sophocles written about years before christ the narrative is supposed to have been related by the friend and attendant of the hero orestes the coliseum at midnight i crossed the forum to the foot of the palatine and ascending the via sacra passed beneath the arch of titus from this point i saw below me the gigantic outline of the coliseum like a cloud resting upon the earth as i descended the hillside it grew more broad and high more definite in its form and yet more grand in its dimensions till from the vale in which it stands encompassed by three of the seven hills of rome the majestic ruin in all its solitary grandeur swelled vast to heaven a single sentinel was pacing to and fro beneath the arched gateway which leads to the interior and his measured footsteps were the only sound that broke the breathless silence of night what a contrast with the scene which that same midnight hour presented when in domitians time the eager populace began to gather at the gates impatient for the morning sports nor was the contrast within less striking silence and the quiet moonbeams and the broad deep shadow of the ruined wall where now were the senators of rome her matrons and her virgins where was the ferocious populace that rent the air with shouts when in the hundred holidays that marked the dedication of this imperial slaughter house five thousand wild beasts from the libyan deserts and the forests of anatolia made the arena sick with blood where were the christian martyrs that died with prayers upon their lips amid the jeers and imprecations of their fellow men where were the barbarian gladiators brought forth to the festival of blood and butchered to make a roman holiday the awful silence answered they are mine the dust beneath me answered they are mine footnote footnote from outre mer by henry w longfellow expression

stout old onehoss shay as fresh as on lisbonearthquake day eighteen hundred it came and found the deacons masterpiece strong and sound eighteen hundred increased by ten hahnsum kerridge they called it then eighteen hundred and twenty came running as usual much the same thirty and forty at last arrive and then come fifty and fiftyfive little of all we value here wakes on the morn of its hundredth

first of november the earthquake day there are traces of age in the onehoss shay a general flavor of mild decay but nothing local as one may say there couldnt be for the deacons art had made it so like in every part that there wasnt a chance for one to start for the wheels were just as strong as the thills and the floor was just as strong as the sills and the panels just as strong as the floor and the whippletree neither less nor more and the back crossbar as strong as the fore and spring and axle and hub encore and yet as a whole it is past a doubt in another hour it will be worn out

the parson off went they the parson was working his sundays text had got to fifthly and stopped perplexed at what the moses was coming next all at once the horse stood still close by the meetnhouse on the hill first a shiver and then a thrill then something decidedly like a spill and the parson was sitting upon a rock at halfpast nine by the meetnhouse clock just the hour of the earthquake shock what do you think the parson found when he got up and stared around the poor old chaise in a heap or mound as if it had been to the mill and ground you see of course if youre not a dunce how it went to pieces all at once all at once and nothing first just as bubbles do when they burst end of the wonderful onehoss shay logic is logic thats all i say footnote footnote from the autocrat or the

expression study the historical allusions georgius secundus lisbon town braddocks army the earthquake day etc read again the passages in which dialect expressions occur try to speak these passages as the author intended them to be spoken select the passages which appeal most strongly to your sense of humor read them in such manner as to make their humorous quality thoroughly appreciable to those who listen to you now study the selection as a poem comparing it with several typical poems which you have already studied remembering your definition of poetry page what is the real poetical value of this delightful composition is it a true poem find some other poems written by dr holmes bring them to the class and read them aloud talk with your teacher about the life of dr holmes and about his prose and poetical works as a poet how does he compare with longfellow with whittier with walt whitman with browning dogs and cats most people agree that the dog has intelligence a heart and possibly a soul on the other hand they declare that the cat is a traitor a deceiver an ingrate a thief how many persons have i heard say oh i cant bear a cat the cat has no love for its master it cares only for the house i had one once for i was living in the country where there were mice one day the cook left on the kitchen table a chicken she had just prepared for cooking in came the cat and carried it off and we never saw a morsel of it oh i hate cats i will never have one true the cat is unpopular her reputation is bad and she makes no effort to improve the general opinion which people have of her she cares as little about your opinion as does the sultan of turkey and must i confess this is the very reason i love her in this world no one can long be indifferent to things whether trivial or serious if indeed anything is serious hence every person must sooner or later declare himself on the subjects of dogs and cats well then i love cats ah how many times people have said to me what do you love cats certainly well dont you love dogs better no i prefer cats every time oh thats very queer the truth is i would rather have neither cat nor dog but when i am obliged to live with one of these beings i always choose the cat i will tell you why the cat seems to me to have the manners most necessary to good society in her early youth she has all the graces all the gentleness all the unexpectedness that the most artistic imagination could desire she is smart she never loses herself she is prudent going everywhere looking into everything breaking nothing the cat steals fresh mutton just as the dog steals it but unlike the dog she takes no delight in carrion she is fastidiously clean and in this respect she might well be imitated by many of her detractors she washes her face and in so doing foretells the weather into the bargain you may please yourself by putting a ribbon around her neck but never a collar she cannot be enslaved in short the cat is a dignified proud disdainful animal she defies advances and tolerates no insults she abandons the house in which she is not treated according to her merits she is in both origin and character a true aristocrat while the dog is and always will be a mere vulgar parvenu the only serious argument that can be urged against the cat is that she destroys the birds not caring whether they are sparrows or nightingales if the dog does less it is because of his stupidity and clumsiness not because he is above such business he also runs after the birds but his foolish barking warns them of his coming and as they fly away he can only watch them with open mouth and drooping tail the dog submits himself to the slavery of the collar in order to be taught the art of circumventing rabbits and pigeons and this not for his own profit but for the pleasure of his master the hunter foolish foolish fellow an animal himself he delights in persecuting other animals at the command of the man who beats him but the cat when she catches a bird has a good excuse for her cruelty she catches it only to eat it herself shall she be slandered for such an act before condemning her men may well think of their own shortcomings they will find among themselves as well as in the race of cats many individuals who have claws and often use them for the destruction of those who are gifted with wings footnote footnote translated from alexandre dumas a noted french novelist expression in what does the humor of this selection consist read aloud and with expression the passages which appeal to you as the most enjoyable do you agree with all the statements made by the author read these with which you disagree and then give reasons for your disagreement the owl critic who stuffed that white owl no one spoke in the shop the barber was busy and he couldnt stop the customers waiting their turns were all reading the daily the herald the post little heeding the young man who blurted out such a blunt question not one raised a head or even made a suggestion and the barber kept on shaving dont you see mister brown cried the youth with a frown how wrong the whole thing is how preposterous each wing is how flattened the head is how jammed down the neck is in short the whole owl what an ignorant wreck tis i make no apology ive learned owleology ive passed days and nights in a hundred collections and cannot be blinded to any deflections arising from unskillful fingers that fail to stuff a bird right from his beak to his tail mister brown mister brown do take that bird down or youll soon be the laughingstock all over town and the barber kept on shaving illustration the owl critic ive studied owls and other night fowls and i tell you what i know to be true an owl cannot roost with his limbs so unloosed no owl in this world ever had his claws curled ever had his legs slanted ever had his bill canted ever had his neck screwed into that attitude he cant do it because tis against all bird laws anatomy teaches ornithology preaches an owl has a toe that cant turn out so ive made the white owl my study for years and to see such a job almost moves me to tears mister brown im amazed you should be so gone crazed as to put up a bird in that posture absurd to look at that owl really brings on a dizziness the man who stuffed him dont half know his business and the barber kept on shaving examine those eyes im filled with surprise taxidermists should pass off on you such poor glass so unnatural they seem theyd make audubon scream and john burroughs laugh to encounter such chaff do take that bird down have him stuffed again brown and the barber kept on shaving with some sawdust and bark i could stuff in the dark an owl better than that i could make an old hat look more like an owl than that horrid fowl stuck up there so stiff like a side of coarse leather in fact about him theres not one natural feather just then with a wink and a sly normal lurch the owl very gravely got down from his perch walked round and regarded his faultfinding critic who thought he was stuffed with a glance analytic and then fairly hooted as if he should say your learnings at fault this time anyway dont waste it again on a live bird i pray im an owl youre another sir critic good day and the barber kept on shaving footnote footnote by james t fields an american publisher and author mrs caudles umbrella lecture bah

the umbrella footnote footnote by douglas william jerrold an english humorous writer note which of the various specimens of humor here presented do you enjoy most give reasons the dark day in connecticut twas on a mayday of the far old year seventeen hundred eighty that there fell over the bloom and sweet life of the spring over the fresh earth and the heaven of noon a horror of great darkness like the night in day of which the norland sagas tell the twilight of the gods birds ceased to sing and all the barnyard fowls roosted the cattle at the pasture bars lowed and looked homeward bats on leathern wings flitted abroad the sounds of labor died men prayed and women wept all ears grew sharp to hear the doom blast of the trumpet shatter the black sky that the dreadful face of christ might look from the rent clouds not as he looked a loving guest at bethany but stern as justice and inexorable law meanwhile in the old statehouse dim as ghosts sat the lawgivers of connecticut trembling beneath their legislative robes it is the lords great day let us adjourn some said and then as if with one accord all eyes were turned to abraham davenport illustration the dark day in connecticut he rose slow cleaving with his steady voice the intolerable hush this well may be the day of judgment which the world awaits but be it so or not i only know my present duty and my lords command to occupy till he come so at the post where he hath set me in his providence i choose for one to meet him face to face no faithless servant frightened from my task but ready when the lord of the harvest calls and therefore with all reverence i would say let god do his work we will see to ours bring in the candles and they brought them in then by the flaring lights the speaker read albeit with husky voice and shaking hands an act to amend an act to regulate the shad and alewive fisheries whereupon wisely and well spake abraham davenport straight to the question with no figures of speech save the ten arab signs yet not without the shrewd dry humor natural to the man his awestruck colleagues listening all the while between the pauses of his argument to hear the thunder of the wrath of god break from the hollow trumpet of the cloud and there he stands in memory to this day erect selfpoised a rugged face half seen against the background of unnatural dark a witness to the ages as they pass that simple duty hath no place for fear footnote footnote from abraham davenport by john greenleaf whittier two interesting letters i columbus to the lord treasurer of spain barcelona to lord raphael sanchez knowing that it will afford you pleasure to learn that i have brought my undertaking to a successful termination i have decided upon writing you this letter to acquaint you with all the events which have occurred in my voyage and the discoveries which have resulted from it illustration thirtythree days after my departure from cadiz i reached the indian sea where i discovered many islands thickly peopled of which i took possession without resistance in the name of our most illustrious monarchs by public proclamation and with unfurled banners to the first of these islands which is called by the indians guanahani i gave the name of the blessed saviour relying upon whose protection i had reached this as well as the other islands as soon as we arrived at that which as i have said was named juana i proceeded along its coast a short distance westward and found it to be so large and apparently without termination that i could not suppose it to be an island but the continental province of cathay in the meantime i had learned from some indians whom i had seized that the country was certainly an island and therefore i sailed toward the east coasting to the distance of three hundred and twentytwo miles which brought us to the extremity of it from this point i saw lying eastwards another island fiftyfour miles distant from juana to which i gave the name espaсola all these islands are very beautiful and distinguished by a diversity of scenery they are filled with a great variety of trees of immense height and which i believe to retain their foliage in all seasons for when i saw them they were as verdant and luxurious as they usually are in spain in the month of may some of them were blossoming some bearing fruit and all flourishing in the greatest perfection according to their respective stages of growth and the nature and quality of each yet the islands are not so thickly wooded as to be impassable the nightingale and various birds were singing in countless numbers and that in november the month in which i arrived there the inhabitants are very simple and honest and exceedingly liberal with all they have none of them refusing anything he may possess when he is asked for it but on the contrary inviting us to ask them they exhibit great love toward all others in preference to themselves they also give objects of great value for trifles and content themselves with very little or nothing in return i however forbade that these trifles and articles of no value such as pieces of dishes plates and glass keys and leather straps should be given to them although if they could obtain them they imagined themselves to be possessed of the most beautiful trinkets in the world it even happened that a sailor received for a leather strap as much gold as was worth three golden nobles and for things of more trifling value offered by our men the indian would give whatever the seller required on my arrival i had taken some indians by force from the first island that i came to in order that they might learn our language these men are still traveling with me and although they have been with us now a long time they continue to entertain the idea that i have descended from heaven and on our arrival at any new place they published this crying out immediately with a loud voice to the other indians come come and look upon beings of a celestial race upon which both men and women children and adults young men and old when they got rid of the fear they at first entertained would come out in throngs crowding the roads to see us some bringing food others drink with astonishing affection and kindness although all i have related may appear to be wonderful and unheard of yet the results of my voyage would have been more astonishing if i had had at my disposal such ships as i required but these great and marvelous results are not to be attributed to any merit of mine but to the holy christian faith and to the piety and religion of our sovereigns for that which the unaided intellect of man could not compass the spirit of god has granted to human exertions for god is wont to hear the prayers of his servants who love his precepts even to the performance of apparent impossibilities thus it has happened to me in the present instance who have accomplished a task to which the powers of mortal men had never hitherto attained for if there have been those who have anywhere written or spoken of these islands they have done so with doubts and conjectures and no one has ever asserted that he has seen them on which account their writings have been looked upon as little else than fables therefore let the king and queen our princes and their most happy kingdoms and all the other provinces of christendom render thanks to our lord and saviour jesus christ who has granted us so great a victory and such prosperity christopher columbus expression in connection with this letter read again the story of the discovery as narrated by washington irving page in what respect do the two accounts differ ii governor winslow to a friend in england dear friend although i received no letter from you by this ship yet forasmuch as i know you expect the performance of my promise which was to write to you truly and faithfully of all things i have therefore at this time sent unto you accordingly referring you for further satisfaction to our more large relations illustration you shall understand that in this little time that a few of us have been here we have built seven dwelling houses and four for the use of the plantation and have made preparation for divers others we set the last spring some twenty acres of indian corn and sowed some six acres of barley and pease and according to the manner of the indians we manured our ground with herrings or rather shads which we have in great abundance and take with great ease at our doors our corn did prove well and god be praised we had a good increase of indian corn and our barley indifferent good but our pease not worth the gathering for we feared they were too late sown they came up very well and blossomed but the sun parched them in the blossom our harvest being gotten in our governor sent four men on fowling that so we might after a special manner rejoice together after we had gathered the fruit of our labors they four in one day killed as much fowl as with a little help beside served the company almost a week at which time amongst other recreations we exercised our arms many of the indians coming among us and among the rest their greatest king massasoit with some ninety men whom for three days we entertained and feasted and they went out and killed five deer which they brought to the plantation and bestowed upon our governor and upon the captain and others and although it be not always so plentiful as it was at this time with us yet by the goodness of god we are so far from want that we often wish you partakers of our plenty we have often found the indians very faithful in their covenant of peace with us very loving and ready to pleasure us we often go to them and they come to us yea it hath pleased god so to possess the indians with a fear of us and love to us that not only the greatest king amongst them called massasoit but also all the princes and peoples round about us have either made suit to us or been glad of any occasion to make peace with us so that seven of them at once have sent their messengers to us to that end they are a people without any religion or knowledge of any god yet very trusty quick of apprehension ripewitted just now because i expect you coming unto us with other of our friends i thought good to advertise you of a few things needful be careful to have a very good bread room to put your biscuits in let not your meat be drysalted none can better do it than the sailors let your meal be so hard trod in your cask that you shall need an adz or hatchet to work it out with trust not too much on us for corn at this time for we shall have little enough till harvest build your cabins as open as you can and bring good store of clothes and bedding with you bring every man a musket or fowling piece let your piece be long in the barrel and fear not the weight of it for most of our shooting is from stands i forbear further to write for the present hoping to see you by the next return so i take my leave commending you to the lord for a safe conduct unto us resting in him your loving friend edward winslow plymouth in new england this th of december poems of home and

word study caledonia shamrock brake erin gyves yearning frigid tepid patriot the age of coal come with me in fancy back to those early ages of the world thousands yes millions of years ago stand with me on some low ancient hill which overlooks the flat and swampy lands that are to become the american continent few heights are yet in sight the future rocky mountains lie still beneath the surface of the sea the alleghanies are not yet heaved up above the level surface of the ground for over them are spread the boggy lands and thick forests of future coal fields the mississippi river is not yet in existence or if in existence is but an unimportant little stream below us as we stand we can see a broad and sluggish body of water in places widening into shallow lakes on either side of this stream vast forests extend in every direction as far as the horizon bounded on one side by the distant ocean clothing each hilly rise and sending islets of matted trees and shrubs floating down the waters strange forests these are to us no oaks no elms no beeches no birches no palms nor many colored wild flowers are there the deciduous plants so common in our modern forests are nowhere found but enormous club mosses are seen as well as splendid pines and an abundance of ancient trees with waving frondlike leaves here also are graceful tree ferns and countless ferns of lower growth filling up all gaps illustration no wild quadrupeds are yet in existence and the silent forests are enlivened only by the stirring of the breeze among the trees or the occasional hum of monstrous insects but upon the margin of yonder stream a huge fourfooted creature creeps slowly along he looks much like a gigantic salamander and his broad soft feet make deep impressions in the yielding mud no sunshine but only a gleam of light can creep through the misty atmosphere the earth seems clothed in a garment of clouds and the air is positively reeking with damp warmth like the air of a hothouse this explains the luxuriant growth of foliage could we thus stand upon the hilltops and keep watch through the long coal building ages we should see generation after generation of forest trees and underwoods living withering dying falling to earth slowly a layer of dead and decaying vegetation thus collects over which the forest flourishes still tree for tree and shrub for shrub springing up in the place of each one that dies then after a very long time through the working of mighty underground forces the broad lands sink a little way perhaps only a few feet and the ocean tide rushes in overwhelming the forests trees and plants and living creatures in one dire desolation no not dire for the ruin is not objectless or needless it is all a part of the wonderful preparation for the life of man on earth under the waves lie the overwhelmed forests prostrate trunks and broken stumps in countless numbers overspreading the gathered vegetable remains of centuries before upon these the sea builds a protective covering of sand or mud more or less thick here sea creatures come to live fishes swim hungrily to and fro and shellfishes die in the mud which by and by is to become firm rock with stony animal remains embedded in it after a while the land rises again to its former position there are bare sandy flats as before but they do not remain bare lichens and hardier plants find a home the light spores of the ancient forest trees take root and grow and luxuriant forests like those of old spring again into being upon river and lake bottoms and over the low damp lands rich layers of decaying vegetation again collect then once more the land sinks and the ocean tide pours in and another sandy or muddy stratum is built up on the overflowed lands thus the second layer of forest growth is buried like the first and both lie quietly through the long ages following hidden from sight slowly changing in their substance from wood to shining coal thus time after time the land rose and sank rose and sank again and again not the whole continent is believed to have risen or sunk at the same time but here at one period there at another period the movements probably went on the greater part of the vegetable mass decayed slowly but when the final ruin of the forest came whole trunks were snapped off close to the roots and flung down these are now found in numbers on the tops of the coal layers the barks being flattened and changed to shining black coal how wonderful the tale of those ancient days told to us by these buried forests footnote footnote by agnes giberne an english writer on scientific subjects something about the moon i am going to say a few words about the moon but there are many matters relating to her of great interest which i must leave untouched for the simple reason that there is not room to speak of them in a single paper thus the moons changes of shape from the horned moon to the half and thence to the full moon with the following changes from full to half and so to the horned form again are well worth studying but i should want all the space i am going to occupy merely to explain properly those changes alone so a study of the way in which the moon rules the tides would i am sure interest every thoughtful reader but there is not room for it here let us now turn to consider the moon not as the light which makes our nights beautiful nor as the body which governs the mighty ocean in its tidal sway but as another world the companion planet of the earth it has always been a matter not only of the deepest curiosity but of the greatest scientific import whether other planets and particularly our own satellite are inhabited or exhibit any traces whatever of animal or vegetable life one or two astronomers have claimed the discovery of vegetation on the moons surface by reason of the periodic appearance of a greenish tint but as the power of the telescope can bring the moon to within only about a hundred and twenty miles of us these alleged appearances cannot be satisfactorily verified the moon is a globe two thousand one hundred and sixtyfive miles in diameter very much less therefore than our earth which has a diameter of about seven thousand nine hundred and twenty miles thus the moons surface is less than one thirteenth of the earths instead of two hundred millions of square miles as the earth has the moon has only about fourteen millions of square miles or about the same surface as north and south america together without the great american islands of the arctic regions the volume of the earth exceeds that of the moon more than fortynine times but the moons substance is somewhat lighter thus the mass or quantity of matter in the moon instead of being a fortyninth part of the earths is about an eightyfirst part this small companion world travels like our own earth around the sun at a distance of ninetythree millions of miles the path of the moon around the sun is in fact so nearly the same as that of the earth that it would be almost impossible to distinguish one from the other if they were both drawn on a sheet of paper a foot or so in diameter you may perhaps be surprised to find me thus saying that the moon travels round the sun when you have been accustomed to hear that the moon travels round the earth in reality however it is round the sun the moon travels though certainly the moon and the earth circle around each other the distance of the moon from the earth is not always the same but the average or mean distance amounts to about two hundred and thirtyeight thousand eight hundred and twentyeight miles this is the distance between the centers of the two globes with this distance separating them the companion worlds the earth and the moon circle round each other as they both travel round the central sun but now you will be curious to learn whether our companion planet the moon really presents the appearance of a world when studied with a powerful telescope if we judged the moon in this way we should say that she is not only not inhabited by living creatures but that she could not possibly be inhabited what is it that makes our earth a fit abode for us who live upon it her surface is divided into land and water we live on the land but without the water we should perish were there no water there would be no clouds no rain no snow no rivers brooks or other streams without these there could be no vegetable life and without vegetable life there could be no animal life even if animals themselves could live without water yet again the earths globe is enwrapped in an atmosphere the air we breathe without this air neither animals nor vegetables could live i might go further and show other features of the earth which we are at present justified in regarding as essential to the mere existence and still more to the comfort of creatures living upon the earth now before the telescope was invented many astronomers believed that there was water on the moon and probably air also but as soon as galileo examined the moon with his largest telescope and a very weak telescope it was he found that whatever the dark parts of the moon may be they certainly are not seas more and more powerful telescopes have since been turned on the moon it has been shown that there are not only no seas but no rivers pools lakes or other water surfaces no clouds are ever seen to gather over any part of the moons surface in fact nothing has ever yet been seen on the moon which suggests in the slightest degree the existence of water on her surface or even that water could at present possibly exist and of course without water it is safe to infer there could be neither vegetable nor animal existence it would seem then that apart from the absence of air on the moon there is such an entire absence of water that no creatures now living on the earth could possibly exist upon the moon certainly man could not exist there nor could animals belonging to any except the lowest orders of animal life footnote footnote by richard a proctor a noted english astronomer the coming of the birds i know the trusty almanac of the punctual comingback on their due days of the birds i marked them yestermorn a flock of finches darting beneath the crystal arch piping as they flew a march belike the one they used in parting last year from yon oak or larch dusky sparrows in a crowd diving darting northward free suddenly betook them all every one to his hole in the wall or to his niche in the apple tree i greet with joy the choral trains fresh from palms and cubas canes best gems of natures cabinet with dews of tropic morning wet beloved of children bards and spring o birds your perfect virtues bring your song your forms your rhythmic flight your manners for the hearts delight nestle in hedge or barn or roof here weave your chamber weatherproof forgive our harms and condescend to man as to a lubber friend and generous teach his awkward race courage and probity and grace footnote footnote by ralph waldo emerson an american poet and philosopher the return of the birds the coming and going of the birds is more or less a mystery and a surprise we go out in the morning and no thrush or finch is to be heard we go out again and every tree and grove is musical yet again and all is silent who saw them come who saw them depart this pert little winter wren for instance darting in and out the fence diving under the rubbish here and coming up yards away how does he manage with those little circular wings to compass degrees and zones and arrive always in the nick of time last august i saw him in the remotest wilds of the adirondacks impatient and inquisitive as usual a few weeks later on the potomac i was greeted by the same hardy little busybody does he travel by easy stages from bush to bush and from wood to wood or has that compact little body force and courage to brave the night and the upper air and so achieve leagues at one pull and yonder bluebird with the earth tinge on his breast and the sky tinge on his back did he come down out of heaven on that bright march morning when he told us so softly and plaintively that spring had come indeed there is nothing in the return of the birds more curious and suggestive than in the first appearance or rumors of the appearance of this little bluecoat the bird at first seems a mere wandering voice in the air one hears its call or carol on some bright march morning but is uncertain of its source or direction it falls like a drop of rain when no cloud is visible one looks and listens but to no purpose the weather changes perhaps a cold snap with snow comes on and it may be a week before i hear the note again and this time or the next perchance see the bird sitting on a stake in the fence lifting his wing as he calls cheerily to his mate its notes now become daily more frequent the birds multiply and flitting from point to point call and warble more confidently and gleefully not long after the bluebird comes the robin sometimes in march but in most of the northern states april is the month of the robin in large numbers they scour the field and groves you hear their piping in the meadow in the pasture on the hillside walk in the woods and the dry leaves rustle with the whir of their wings the air is vocal with their cheery call in excess of joy and vivacity they run leap scream chase each other through the air diving and sweeping among the trees with perilous rapidity in that free fascinating half work and half play pursuit sugar making a pursuit which still lingers in many parts of new york as in new england the robin is ones constant companion when the day is sunny and the ground bare you meet him at all points and hear him at all hours at sunset on the tops of the tall maples with look heavenward and in a spirit of utter abandonment he carols his simple strain and sitting thus amid the stark silent trees above the wet cold earth with the chill of winter in the air there is no fitter or sweeter songster in the whole round year it is in keeping with the scene and the occasion how round and genuine the notes are and how eagerly our ears drink them in the first utterance and the spell of winter is thoroughly broken and the remembrance of it afar off another april bird which makes her appearance sometimes earlier and sometimes later than robin and whose memory i fondly cherish is the phoebe bird the pioneer of the fly catchers in the inland fanning districts i used to notice her on some bright morning about easter day proclaiming her arrival with much variety of motion and attitude from the peak of the barn or hay shed as yet you may have heard only the plaintive homesick note of the bluebird or the faint trill of the song sparrow and phoebes clear vivacious assurance of her veritable bodily presence among us again is welcomed by all ears at agreeable intervals in her lay she describes a circle or an ellipse in the air ostensibly prospecting for insects but really i suspect as an artistic flourish thrown in to make up in some way for the deficiency of her musical performance another april comer who arrives shortly after robin redbreast with whom he associates both at this season and in the autumn is the goldenwinged woodpecker alias highhole alias flicker alias yarup he is an old favorite of my boyhood and his note to me means very much he announces his arrival by a long loud call repeated from the dry branch of some tree or a stake in the fence a thoroughly melodious april sound i think how solomon finished that beautiful climax on spring and the voice of the turtle is heard in the land and see that a description of spring in this farming country to be equally characteristic should culminate in like manner and the call of the highhole comes up from the wood the song sparrow that universal favorite and firstling of the spring comes before april and its simple strain gladdens all hearts may is the month of the swallows and the orioles there are many other distinguished arrivals indeed nine tenths of the birds are here by the last week in may yet the swallows and orioles are the most conspicuous the bright plumage of the latter seems really like an arrival from the tropics i see them flash through the blossoming trees and all the forenoon hear their incessant warbling and wooing the swallows dive and chatter about the barn or squeak and build beneath the eaves the partridge drums in the fresh sprouting woods the long tender note of the meadow lark comes up from the meadow and at sunset from every marsh and pond come the ten thousand voices of the hylas may is the transition month and exists to connect april and june the root with the flower with june the cup is full our hearts are satisfied there is no more to be desired the perfection of the season among other things has brought the perfection of the song and plumage of the birds the master artists are all here and the expectations excited by the robin and the song sparrow are fully justified the thrushes have all come and i sit down upon the first rock with hands full of the pink azalea to listen in the meadows the bobolink is in all his glory in the high pastures the field sparrow sings his breezy vesper hymn and the woods are unfolding to the music of the thrushes footnote footnote by john burroughs expression read again the four descriptive selections beginning on page observe the wide difference in style of composition of the three prose extracts which is the most interesting to you give reasons why this is so which passages require the most animation in reading read these passages so that those who are listening to you may fully appreciate their meaning the poet and the bird i the song of the lark on a pleasant evening in late summer the poet percy bysshe shelley and his wife mary shelley were walking near the city of leghorn in italy the sky was cloudless the air was soft and balmy and the earth seemed hushed into a restful stillness the green lane along which they were walking was bordered by myrtle hedges where crickets were softly chirping and fireflies were already beginning to light their lamps from the fields beyond the hedges the grateful smell of newmown hay was wafted while in the hazy distance the church towers of the city glowed yellow in the last rays of the sun and the graygreen sea rippled softly in the fading light of day suddenly from somewhere above them a burst of music fell upon their ears it receded upward but swelled into an ecstatic harmony with fluttering intervals and melodious swervings such as no musicians art can imitate what is that asked the poet as the song seemed to die away in the blue vault of heaven it is a skylark answered his wife nay said the poet his face all aglow with the joy of the moment no mere bird ever poured forth such strains of music as that i think rather that it is some blithe spirit embodied as a bird let us imagine that it is so said mary but hearken it is singing again and soaring as it sings yes and i can see it too like a flake of gold against the pale purple of the sky it is so high that it soars in the bright rays of the sun while we below are in the twilight shade and now it is descending again and the air is filled with its song hark to the rain of melody which it showers down upon us they listened enraptured while the bird poured forth its flood of song when at length it ceased and the two walked home in the deepening twilight the poet said we shall never know just what it was that sang so gloriously but mary what do you think is most like it a poet she answered there is nothing so like it as a poet wrapt in his own sweet thoughts and singing till the world is made to sing with him for very joy and i said he would compare it to a beautiful maiden singing for love in some high palace tower while all who hear her are bewitched by the enchanting melody and i said she would compare it to a red red rose sitting among its green leaves and giving its sweet perfumes to the summer breezes you speak well mary said he but let me make one other comparison is it not like a glowworm lying unseen amid the grass and flowers and all through the night casting a mellow radiance over them and filling them with divine beauty illustration the song of the lark i do not like the comparison so well was the answer yet after all there is nothing so like it as a poet as yourself for instance no poet ever had its skill because no poet was ever so free from care said shelley sadly it is like an unbodied joy floating unrestrained whithersoever it will ah mary if i had but half the gladness that this bird or spirit must know i would write such poetry as would bewitch the world and all men would listen entranced to my song that night the poet could not sleep for thinking of the skylarks song the next day he sat alone in his study putting into harmonious words the thoughts that filled his mind in the evening he read to mary a new poem entitled to a skylark it was full of the melody inspired by the song of the bird its very meter suggested the joyous flight the fluttering pauses the melodious swervings the heavenward ascent of the bird no poem has ever been written that is fuller of beautiful images and sweet and joyous harmonies have you ever listened to the song of a bird and tried to attune your own thoughts to its unrestrained and untaught melodies there are no true skylarks in america and therefore you may never be able to repeat the experience of the poet or fully to appreciate the harmonious madness of his matchless poem for no other bird is so literally the embodiment of song as the european skylark but now let us read shelleys inimitable poem ii to a skylark hail to thee blithe spirit bird thou never wert that from heaven or near it pourest thy full heart in profuse strains of unpremeditated art higher still and higher from the earth thou springest like a cloud of fire the blue deep thou wingest and singing still dost soar and soaring ever singest in the golden lightning of the sunken sun oer which clouds are brightning thou dost float and run like an unbodied joy whose race is just begun the pale purple even melts around thy flight like a star of heaven in the broad daylight thou art unseen but yet i hear thy shrill delight keen as are the arrows of that silver sphere whose intense lamp narrows in the white dawn clear until we hardly see we feel that it is there all the earth and air with thy voice is loud as when night is bare from one lonely cloud the moon rains out her beams and heaven is overflowed what thou art we know not what is most like thee from rainbow clouds there flow not drops so bright to see as from thy presence showers a rain of melody like a poet hidden in the light of thought singing hymns unbidden till the world is wrought to sympathy with hopes and fears it heeded not like a highborn maiden in a palace tower soothing her loveladen soul in secret hour with music sweet as love which overflows her bower like a glowworm golden in a dell of dew scattering unbeholden its aлrial hue among the flowers and grass which screen it from the view like a rose embowered in its own green leaves by warm winds deflowered till the scent it gives make faint with too much sweet these heavywingиd thieves sound of vernal showers on the twinkling grass rainawakened flowers all that ever was joyous and clear and fresh thy music doth surpass teach us sprite or bird what sweet thoughts are thine i have never heard praise of love or wine that panted forth a flood of rapture so divine chorus hymeneal or triumphal chaunt matched with thine would be all but an empty vaunt a thing wherein we feel there is some hidden want what objects are the fountains of thy happy strain what fields or waves or mountains what shapes of sky or plain what love of thine own kind what ignorance of pain with thy clear keen joyance languor cannot be shadow of annoyance never came near thee thou lovest but neer knew loves sad satiety waking or asleep thou of death must deem things more true and deep than we mortals dream or how could thy notes flow in such a crystal stream we look before and after and pine for what is not our sincerest laughter with some pain is fraught our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought yet if we could scorn hate and pride and fear if we were things born not to shed a tear i know not how thy joy we ever should come near better than all measures of delightful sound better than all treasures that in books are found thy skill to poet were thou scorner of the ground teach me half the gladness that thy brain must know such harmonious madness from thy lips would flow the world should listen then as i am listening now hark hark the lark hark hark the lark at heavens gate sings and phoebus gins arise his steeds to water at those springs on chaliced flowers that lies and winking marybuds begin to ope their golden eyes with everything that pretty is my lady sweet arise arise arise footnote footnote from cymbeline by william shakespeare expression read shelleys poem

memorize shakespeares song and repeat it in a pleasing manner point out any peculiarities you may notice echoes of the american revolution i patrick henrys famous speech mr president it is natural for man to indulge in the illusions of hope we are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth and listen to the song of that siren till she transforms us into beasts is this the part of wise men engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty are we disposed to be of the number of those who having eyes see not and having ears hear not the things which so nearly concern their temporal salvation for my part whatever anguish of spirit it may cost i am willing to know the whole truth to know the worst and to provide for it i have but one lamp by which my feet are guided and that lamp is the lamp of experience i know of no way of judging of the future but by the past and judging by the past i wish to know what there has been in the conduct of the british ministry for the last ten years to justify those hopes with which gentlemen have been pleased to solace themselves and the house is it that insidious smile with which our petition has been lately received trust it not sir it will prove a snare to your feet suffer not yourselves to be betrayed with a kiss ask yourselves how this gracious reception of our petition comports with those warlike preparations which cover our waters and darken our land are fleets and armies necessary to a work of love and reconciliation have we shown ourselves so unwilling to be reconciled that force must be called in to win back our love let us not deceive ourselves sir these are the implements of war and subjugation the last arguments to which kings resort i ask sir what means this martial array if its purpose be not to force us to submission can gentlemen assign any other possible motive for it has great britain any enemy in this quarter of the world to call for all this accumulation of navies and armies no sir she has none they are meant for us they can be meant for no other they are sent over to bind and rivet upon us those chains which the british ministry have been so long forging and what have we to oppose to them shall we try argument sir we have been trying that for the last ten years have we anything new to offer upon the subject nothing we have held the subject up in every light of which it is capable but it has been all in vain shall we resort to entreaty and humble supplication what terms shall we find which have not been already exhausted let us not i beseech you sir deceive ourselves longer sir we have done everything that could be done to avert the storm which is now coming on we have petitioned we have remonstrated we have supplicated we have prostrated ourselves before the throne and have implored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry and parliament our petitions have been slighted our remonstrances have produced additional violence and insult our supplications have been disregarded and we have been spurned with contempt from the foot of the throne in vain after these things may we indulge the fond hope of peace and reconciliation there is no longer any room for hope if we wish to be free if we mean to preserve inviolate these inestimable privileges for which we have been so long contending if we mean not basely to abandon the noble struggle in which we have been so long engaged and which we have pledged ourselves never to abandon until the glorious object of our contest shall be obtained we must fight i repeat it sir we must fight an appeal to arms and to the god of hosts is all that is left us they tell us sir that we are weak unable to cope with so formidable an adversary but when shall we be stronger will it be the next week or the next year will it be when we are totally disarmed and when a british guard shall be stationed in every house shall we gather strength by irresolution and inaction shall we acquire the means of effectual resistance by lying supinely on our backs and hugging the delusive phantom of hope until our enemies shall have bound us hand and foot sir we are not weak if we make a proper use of those means which the god of nature hath placed in our power three millions of people armed in the holy cause of liberty and in such a country as that which we possess are invincible by any force which our enemy can send against us besides sir we shall not fight our battles alone there is a just god who presides over the destinies of nations and who will raise up friends to fight our battles for us the battle sir is not to the strong alone it is to the vigilant the active the brave besides sir we have no election if we were base enough to desire it it is now too late to retire from the contest there is no retreat but in submission and slavery our chains are forged their clanking may be heard on the plains of boston the war is inevitable and let it come i repeat it sir let it come it is vain sir to extenuate the matter gentlemen may cry peace peace but there is no peace the war is actually begun the next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms our brethren are already in the field why stand we here idle what is it that gentlemen wish what would they have is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery forbid it almighty god i know not what course others may take but as for me give me liberty or give me death footnote footnote before the virginia convention march ii marions men we follow where the swamp fox

was the man for whom our nation mourns footnote footnote by henry lee of virginia extract from an oration delivered in the house of representatives three great american poems i one day when dr peter bryant of cummington massachusetts was looking through his writing desk he found a small package of papers on which some verses were written he recognized the neat legible handwriting as that of his son and he paused to open the papers and read presently he called aloud to his wife here sallie just listen to this poem which cullen has written he began to read and as he read the proud mother listened with tears in her eyes isnt that grand she cried ive always told you that cullen would be a poet and now just think what a pity it is that he must give up going to yale college and settle down to the study of law yes wife responded dr bryant it is to be regretted but people with small means cannot always educate their children as they wish a lawyer is a better breadwinner than most poets are and i am satisfied that our boy will be a successful lawyer of course he will said mrs bryant he will succeed at anything he may undertake but that poem why wordsworth never wrote anything half so grand or beautiful what is the title thanatopsis thanatopsis i wonder what it means it is from two greek words and means a view of death i have half a notion to take the poem to boston with me next winter i want to show it to my friend mr philips oh do and take some of cullens other poems with it perhaps he might think some of them good enough to publish dr peter bryant was at that time a member of the senate in the massachusetts general assembly when the time came for the meeting of the assembly he went up to boston and he did not forget to take several of his sons poems with him the north american review was a great magazine in those days and dr bryant was well acquainted with mr philips one of its editors he called at the office of the review and not finding mr philips he left the package of manuscript with his name written upon it when mr philips returned he found the package and after reading the poems concluded that dr bryant had written thanatopsis and that the others were probably by his son cullen it is a remarkable poem a remarkable poem he said as he showed it to his two felloweditors we have never published anything better in the review he said and he began to read it to them when he had finished one of them richard henry dana who was himself a poet said doubtingly mr philips you have been imposed upon there is no person in america who can write a poem like that ah but i know the man who wrote it answered mr philips he is in the state senate and he isnt a man who would impose upon any person well i must have a look at the man who can write such lines as those said mr dana he went to the statehouse and to the senate chamber and asked to see senator bryant a tall graybearded man was pointed out to him mr dana looked at him for a few minutes and then said to himself he has a fine head but he is not the man who could write thanatopsis so without speaking to him he returned to his office mr philips still full of enthusiasm soon had an interview with dr bryant and learned the truth in regard to the authorship of the poem it was printed in the next issue of the north american review it was the first great poem ever produced in america it was the work of a young man not eighteen years of age and it is without doubt the greatest poem ever written by one so young but let us read it thanatopsis to him who in the love of nature holds communion with her visible forms she speaks a various language for his gayer hours she has a voice of gladness and a smile and eloquence of beauty and she glides into his darker musings with a mild and healing sympathy that steals away their sharpness ere he is aware when thoughts of the last bitter hour come like a blight over thy spirit and sad images of the stern agony and shroud and pall and breathless darkness and the narrow house make thee to shudder and grow sick at heart go forth under the open sky and list to natures teachings while from all around earth and her waters and the depths of air comes a still voice yet a few days and thee the allbeholding sun shall see no more in all his course nor yet in the cold ground where thy pale form was laid with many tears nor in the embrace of ocean shall exist thy image earth that nourished thee shall claim thy growth to be resolved to earth again and lost each human trace surrendering up thine individual being shalt thou go to mix forever with the elements to be a brother to the insensible rock and to the sluggish clod which the rude swain turns with his share and treads upon the oak shall send his roots abroad and pierce thy mold yet not to thine eternal resting place shalt thou retire alone nor couldst thou wish couch more magnificent thou shalt lie down with patriarchs of the infant world with kings the powerful of the earth the wise the good fair forms and hoary seers of ages past all in one mighty sepulcher the hills rockribbed and ancient as the sun the vales stretching in pensive quietness between the venerable woods rivers that move in majesty and the complaining brooks that make the meadows green and poured round all old oceans gray and melancholy waste are but the solemn decorations all of the great tomb of man the golden sun the planets all the infinite host of heaven are shining on the sad abodes of death through the still lapse of ages all that tread the globe are but a handful to the tribes that slumber in its bosom take the wings of morning pierce the barcan wilderness or lose thyself in the continuous woods where rolls the oregon and hears no sound save his own dashings yet the dead are there and millions in those solitudes since first the flight of years began have laid them down in their last sleep the dead reign there alone so shalt thou rest and what if thou withdraw in silence from the living and no friend take note of thy departure all that breathe will share thy destiny the gay will laugh when thou art gone the solemn brood of care plod on and each one as before will chase his favorite phantom yet all these shall leave their mirth and their employments and shall come and make their bed with thee as the long train of ages glides away the sons of men the youth in lifes fresh spring and he who goes in the full strength of years matron and maid the speechless babe and the grayheaded man shall one by one be gathered to thy side by those who in their turn shall follow them so live that when thy summons comes to join the innumerable caravan that moves to the pale realms of shade where each shall take his chamber in the silent halls of death thou go not like the quarry slave at night scourged to his dungeon but sustained and soothed by an unfaltering trust approach thy grave like one who wraps the drapery of his couch about him and lies down to pleasant dreams expression observe that this poem is written in blank verse in what respects does it differ from other forms of verse read it with great care observing the marks of punctuation and giving to each passage the proper inflections and emphasis compare it with some other poems you have read ii one sunday evening in the summer of edgar allan poe was visiting at the house of a friend in new york city the day was warm and the windows of the conservatory where he was sitting were thrown wide open to admit the breeze mr poe was very despondent because of many sorrows and disappointments and he was plainly annoyed by the sound of some nearby church bells pealing the hour of worship i have made an agreement with a publisher to write a poem for him he said but i have no inspiration for such a task what shall i do his friend mrs shew gave him an encouraging reply and invited him to drink tea with her then she placed paper and ink before him and suggested that if he would try to write the required inspiration would come no he answered i so dislike the noise of bells tonight i cannot write i have no subject i am exhausted mrs shew then wrote at the top of the sheet of paper the bells by e a poe and added a single line as a beginning the bells the little silver bells the poet accepted the suggestion and after some effort finished the first stanza then mrs shew wrote another line the heavy iron bells this idea was also elaborated by mr poe who copied off the two stanzas and entitled them the bells by mrs m l shew he went home pondering deeply upon the subject the required inspiration was not long lacking and in a few days the completed poem was ready to be submitted to the publisher the bells hear the sledges with the bells silver bells what a world of merriment their melody foretells how they tinkle tinkle tinkle in the icy air of night while the stars that oversprinkle all the heavens seem to twinkle with a crystalline delight keeping time time time in a sort of runic rime to the tintinnabulation that so musically swells from the bells bells bells bells bells bells bells from the jingling and the tinkling of the bells hear the mellow wedding bells golden bells what a world of happiness their harmony foretells through the balmy air of night how they ring out their delight from the moltengolden notes and all in tune what a liquid ditty floats to the turtledove that listens while she gloats on the moon oh from out the sounding cells what a gush of euphony voluminously wells how it swells how it dwells on the future how it tells of the rapture that impels to the swinging and the ringing of the bells bells bells of the bells bells bells bells bells bells bells to the riming and the chiming of the bells hear the loud alarum bells brazen bells what a tale of terror now their turbulency tells in the startled ear of night how they scream out their affright too much horrified to speak they can only shriek shriek out of tune in a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire in a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire leaping higher higher higher with a desperate desire and a resolute endeavor now now to sit or never by the side of the palefaced moon oh the bells bells bells what a tale their terror tells of despair how they clang and crash and roar what a horror they outpour on the bosom of the palpitating air yet the ear it fully knows by the twanging and the clanging how the danger ebbs and flows yet the ear distinctly tells in the jangling and the wrangling how the danger sinks and swells by the sinking or the swelling in

their monody compels in the silence of the night how we shiver with affright at the melancholy menace of their tone for every sound that floats from the rust within their throats is a groan and the people ah the people they that dwell up in the steeple all alone and who tolling tolling tolling in that muffled monotone feel a glory in so rolling on the human heart a stone they are neither man nor woman they are neither brute nor human they are ghouls and their king it is who tolls and he rolls rolls rolls rolls a pжan from the bells and his merry bosom swells with the pжan of the bells and he

poets he is now however remembered chiefly as the author of a single poem marco bozzaris published in this poem has been described perhaps justly as the best martial lyric in the english language it was written at a time when the people of greece were fighting for their independence and it celebrates the heroism of the young greek patriot marco bozzaris who was killed while leading a desperate but successful night attack upon the turks august as here presented it is slightly abridged marco bozzaris at midnight in his guarded tent the turk was dreaming of the hour when greece her knee in suppliance bent should tremble at his power in dreams through camp and court he bore the trophies of a conqueror in dreams his song of triumph heard then wore his monarchs signet ring then pressed that monarchs throne a king as wild his thoughts and gay of wing as edens garden bird at midnight in the forest shades bozzaris ranged his suliote band true as the steel of their tried blades heroes in heart and hand there had the persians thousands stood there had the glad earth drunk their blood on old platжas day and now there breathed that haunted air the sons of sires who conquered there with arm to strike and soul to dare as quick as far as they an hour passed on the turk awoke that bright dream was his last he woke to hear his sentries shriek to arms they come the greek the greek he woke to die midst flame and smoke and shout and groan and saber stroke and death shots falling thick and fast as lightnings from the mountain cloud and heard with voice as trumpet loud bozzaris cheer his band strike till the last armed foe expires strike for your altars and your fires strike for the green graves of your sires god and your native land they fought like brave men long and well they piled that ground with moslem slain they conquered but bozzaris fell bleeding at every vein his few surviving comrades saw his smile when rang their proud hurrah and the red field was won then saw in death his eyelids close calmly as to a nights repose like flowers at set of sun bozzaris with the storied brave greece nurtured in her glorys time rest thee there is no prouder grave even in her own proud clime she wore no funeral weeds for thee nor bade the dark hearse wave its plume like torn branch from deaths leafless tree in sorrows pomp and pageantry the heartless luxury of the tomb but she remembers thee as one longloved and for a season gone for thee her poets lyre is wreathed her marble wrought her music breathed for thee she rings the birthday bells of thee her babes first lisping tells for thine her evening prayer is said at palace couch and cottagebed and she the mother of thy boys though in her eye and faded cheek is read the grief she will not speak the memory of her buried joys and even she who gave thee birth will by their pilgrimcircled hearth talk of thy doom without a sigh for thou art freedoms now and fames one of the few the immortal names that were not born to die expression talk with your teacher about these three poems and the proper manner of reading each learn all that you can about their authors the indian think of the country for which the indians fought who can blame them as philip looked down from his seat on mount hope and beheld the lovely scene which spread beneath at a summer sunset the distant hilltops blazing with gold the slanting beams streaming across the waters the broad plains the island groups the majestic forests could he be blamed if his heart burned within him as he beheld it all passing by no tardy process from beneath his control into the hands of the stranger as the river chieftains the lords of the waterfalls and the mountains ranged this lovely valley can it be wondered at if they beheld with bitterness the forest disappearing beneath the settlers ax the fishing places disturbed by his sawmills can we not imagine the feelings with which some strongminded savage chief who should have ascended the summit of the sugarloaf mountain in company with a friendly settler contemplating the progress already made by the white man and marking the gigantic strides with which he was advancing into the wilderness should fold his arms and say white man there is an eternal war between me and thee i quit not the land of my fathers but with my life in those woods where i bent my youthful bow i will still hunt the deer over yonder waters i will still glide unrestrained in my bark canoe by those dashing waterfalls i will still lay up my winters store of food on these fertile meadows i will still plant my corn stranger the land is mine i understand not these paper rights i gave not my consent when as thou sayest these broad regions were purchased for a few baubles of my fathers they could sell what was theirs they could sell no more how could my father sell that which the great spirit sent me into the world to live upon he knew not what he did the stranger came a timid suppliant he asked to lie down on the red mans bearskin and warm himself at the red mans fire and have a little piece of land to raise corn for his women and children now he is become strong and mighty and bold and spreads out his parchment over the whole and says it is mine stranger there is no room for us both the great spirit has not made us to live together there is poison in the white mans cup the white mans dog barks at the red mans heels if i should leave the land of my fathers whither shall i fly shall i go to the south and dwell among the graves of the pequots shall i wander to the west the fierce mohawk the maneater is my foe shall i fly to the east the great water is before me no stranger here have i lived and here will i die and if here thou abidest there is eternal war between me and thee thou hast taught me thy arts of destruction for that alone i thank thee and now take heed to thy steps the red man is thy foe when thou goest forth by day my bullet shall whistle past thee when thou liest down by night my knife shall be at thy throat the noonday sun shall not discover thy enemy and the darkness of midnight shall not protect thy rest thou shalt plant in terror and i will reap in blood thou shalt sow the earth with corn and i will strew it with ashes thou shalt go forth with the sickle and i will follow after with the scalping knife thou shalt build and i will burn till the white man or the indian perish from the land footnote footnote by edward everett an american statesman and orator expression this selection and also the selections on pages and are fine examples of american

life are expressed what mental pictures are called up by reading the fourth poem the fifth what traits of character are alluded to in the first poem the second now read each poem aloud giving to each line and each stanza the thought which was in the authors mind when he wrote it how king arthur got his name one day at sunset snowbird the young son of a king came over the brow of a hill that stepped forward from a dark company of mountains and leaned over the shoreless sea which fills the west and drowns the north all day he had been wandering alone his mind heavy with wonder over many things he had heard strange tales of late tales about his heroic father and the royal clan and how they were not like other men but half divine he had heard too of his own destiny that he also was to be a great king what was destiny he wondered then as he wondered he turned over and over in his mind all the names he could think of that he might choose for his own for the time was come for him to put away the name of his childhood and to take on that by which he should be known among men he came over the brow of the hill and out of the way of the mountain wind and being tired lay down among the heather and stared across the gray wilderness of the sea the sun set and the invisible throwers of the nets trailed darkness across the waves and up the wild shores and over the faces of the cliffs stars climbed out of shadowy abysses and the great chariots of the constellations rode from the west to the east and from the north to the south his eyes closed but when he opened them again he saw a great and kingly figure standing beside him so great in stature so splendid in kingly beauty was the mysterious one who had so silently joined him that he thought this must be one of the gods do you know me my son said the kingly stranger the boy looked at him in awe and wonder but unrecognizingly do you not know me my son he heard again for i am your father pendragon but my home is yonder and that is why i have come to you as a vision in a dream and as he spoke he pointed to the constellation of the arth or bear which nightly prowls through the vast abysses of the polar sky when the boy turned his gaze from the great constellation which hung in the dark wilderness overhead he saw that he was alone again while he yet wondered in great awe at what he had seen and heard he felt himself float like a mist and become like a cloud rise beyond the brows of the hills and ascend the invisible stairways of the sky it seemed to him thereafter that a swoon came over him in which he passed beyond the faroff blazing fires of strange stars at last suddenly he stood on the verge of arth arth uthyr the great bear there he saw with the vision of immortal not of mortal eyes a company of most noble and majestic figures seated at what he thought a circular abyss but which had the semblance of a vast table each of these seven great knights or lordly kings had a star upon his forehead and these were stars of the mighty constellation of the bear which the boy had seen night after night from his home among the mountains by the sea it was with a burning throb at his heart that he recognized in the king of all these kings no other than himself while he looked in amazement so great that he could hear the pulse of his heart as in the silence of a wood one hears the tapping of a woodpecker he saw this mighty phantom self rise till he stood towering over all there and heard a voice as though an ocean rose and fell through the eternal silences comrades in god it said the time is come when that which is great shall become small and when the voice was ended the mighty figure faded in the blue darkness and only a great star shone where the uplifted dragon helm had brushed the roof of heaven one by one the white lords of the sky followed in his mysterious way till once more were to be seen only the stars of the bear the boy dreamed that he fell as a falling meteor and that he floated over land and sea as a cloud and then that he sank as mist upon the hills of his own land a noise of wind stirred in his ears he rose stumblingly and stood staring around him he glanced upward and saw the stars of the great bear in their slow march round the pole then he remembered he went slowly down the hill his mind heavy with thought when he was come to his own place lo all the fierce chivalry of the land came out to meet him for the archdruid had foretold that the great king to be had received his mystic initiation among the holy silences of the hills i am no more snowbird the child the boy said looking at them fearless and as though already king henceforth i am arthurthyr for my place is in the great bear which we see yonder in the north so all there acclaimed him as arthur the wondrous one of the stars the great bear i am old said his father and soon you shall be king arthur my son so ask now a great boon of me and it shall be granted to you then arthur remembered his dream father and king he said when i am king after you i shall make a new order of knights who shall be pure as the immortal ones and be tender as women and simple as little children but first i ask of you seven flawless knights to be of my chosen company tomorrow let the wood wrights make for me a round table such as that where we eat our roasted meats but round and of a size whereat i and my chosen knights may sit at ease the king listened and all there so be it said the king then arthur chose the seven flawless knights and called them to him ye are now children of the great bear he said and comrades and liegemen to me arthur who shall be king of the west and ye shall be known as the knights of the round table but no man shall make a mock of that name and live and in the end that name shall be so great in the mouths and minds of men that they shall consider no glory of the world to be so great as to be the youngest and frailest of that knighthood and that is how arthur who three years later became king of the west read the rune of the stars that are called the great bear and took their name upon him and from the strongest and purest and noblest of the land made knighthood such as the world had not seen such as the world since has not seen footnotes footnote a gaelic legend by fiona macleod footnote pronounced arthur in the ancient british language

cжsars angel judge o you gods how dearly cжsar loved him this was the most unkindest cut of all for when the noble cжsar saw him stab ingratitude more strong than traitors arms quite vanquished him
