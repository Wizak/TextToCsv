 enid blyton the sea of adventure chapter no governess thank you do you know its may the fifth already said jack in a very gloomy voice all the fellows will be back at school today what a pity what a pity said kiki the parrot in just as gloomy a voice as jacks this awful measles said lucyann first philip had it as soon as he came home for the hols then dinah then she gave it to me and then you had it well were all out of quarantine now said dinah from her corner of the room its just silly of the doctor to say we ought to go away and have a change before we go back to school isnt it enough change to go back to school i do so love the summer term too yes and i bet id have been in the first eleven said philip pushing back the tuft of hair he had in front golly ill be glad to get my hair cut again i feel like a girl now its grown so long the four children had all had a bad attack of measles in the holidays jack especially had had a very nasty time and dinahs eyes had given her a lot of trouble this was partly her own fault for she had been forbidden to read and had disobeyed the doctors orders now her eyes kept watering and she blinked in any bright light certainly no school work for dinah yet the doctor had said sternly i suppose you thought you knew better than i did young lady when you disobeyed orders think yourself lucky if you dont have to wear glasses a little later on i hope mother wont send us away to some awful boardinghouse by the sea said dinah she cant come with us herself because shes taken on some kind of important job for the summer i hope she doesnt get us a governess or something to take us away a governess said philip in scorn i jolly well wouldnt go and anyway she wouldnt stay now that im training young rats his sister dinah looked at him in disgust philip always had some kind of creature about him for he had a great love of animals he could do anything he liked with them and lucyann secretly thought that if he met a roaring tiger in a jungle he would simply hold out his hand and the tiger would lick it like a dog and purr happily like a cat ive told you philip that if you so much as let me see one of your young rats ill scream dinah said all right then scream said philip obligingly hey squeaker where are you squeaker appeared above the neck of philips jersey collar and true to his name he squeaked loudly dinah screamed you beast philip how many of those things have you got down your neck if we had a cat id give them all to her well we havent said philip and poked squeakers head down his collar again three blind mice remarked kiki the parrot with great interest cocking her head on one side and watching for squeaker to appear again wrong kiki old bird said jack lazily putting out a hand and pulling at his parrots tail feathers far from being three blind mice its one very wideawake rat i say kiki why didnt you catch measles from us kiki was quite prepared to have a conversation with jack she gave a loud cackle and then put her head down to be scratched how many times have i told you to shut the door she cried how many times have i told you to wipe your feet wipe the door shut your feet wipe the hey youre getting muddled said jack and the others laughed it was always comical when kiki mixed up the things she loved to say the parrot liked to make people laugh she raised her head put up her crest and made a noise like a mowingmachine outside in the garden thats enough said jack tapping her on the beak now stop it kiki but kiki pleased with the noise flew up to the top of the curtains and went on being a mowingmachine one that wanted oiling mrs mannering put her head in at the door children dont let kiki make such a noise im interviewing someone and its very annoying whos come for an interview said philip at once mother you havent gone and got a governess or something awful to take us away for a change have you is she here yes she is said mrs mannering all the children groaned well dears you know i cant spare the time to take you myself she went on ive taken on this new job though of course if id known you were going to be measly for so long and then be so peaky afterwards were not peaky said philip indignantly what an awful word peaky squeaky said kiki at once and cackled with laughter she loved putting the samesounding words together peaky squeaky shut up kiki called jack and threw a cushion at her aunt allie we can quite well go away by ourselves were old enough to look after ourselves perfectly jack as soon as i let you out of my sight in the holidays you plunge into the middle of the most hairraising adventures said mrs mannering i shant forget what happened in the last summer holidays going off in the wrong aeroplane and being lost for ages in a strange valley oh that was a marvellous adventure cried philip i wish we could have another im fed up with being measly so long do do let us go away by ourselves mother theres a darling no said his mother youre going to a perfectly safe seaside spot with a perfectly safe governess for a perfectly safe holiday safe safe safe shrieked kiki sound and safe sound and safe other way round kiki said jack mrs mannering put her fingers to her ears that bird i suppose im tired with nursing you all but honestly kiki gets dreadfully on my nerves just now i shall be glad when shes gone with you i bet no governess will like kiki said jack aunt allie have you told her about kiki not yet admitted mrs mannering but i suppose id better bring her in and introduce her to you all and kiki too she went out the children scowled at one another i knew it would happen instead of having fun at school we shall mope about with somebody we cant bear said dinah gloomily phil cant you do something with those awful rats of yours when she comes in if she knew you were the kind of boy that likes mice and rats and beetles and hedgehogs living down his neck and in his pockets shed probably run for miles jolly good idea dinah said everyone at once and philip beamed at her its not often you get a brainwave he said but thats one all right hey squeaker come along out woffles where are you nosey come out of my pocket dinah retreated to the furthest corner of the room watching the young white rats in horror however many had philip got she determined not to go near him if she could possibly help it i think kiki might perform also said jack grinning kiki puffpuffpuff that was the signal for the parrot to do her famous imitation of a railway engine screeching in a tunnel she opened her beak and swelled out her throat in delight it wasnt often that she was begged to make this fearful noise lucyann put her hands to her ears the door opened and mrs mannering came in with a tall rather sternlooking woman it was quite plain that no adventure nothing unusual would ever be allowed to happen anywhere near miss lawson perfectly safe was written all over her children this is miss lawson began mrs mannering and then her voice was drowned in kikis railwayengine screech it was an even better imitation than usual and longer drawnout kiki was really letting herself go miss lawson gave a gasp and took a step backwards at first she did not see kiki but looked at the children thinking that one of them must be making the terrible noise kiki thundered mrs mannering really angry children how could you let her im ashamed of you kiki stopped she put her head on one side and looked cheekily at miss lawson wipe your feet she commanded shut the door wheres your handkerchief how many times have i told you to take kiki out jack said mrs mannering red with annoyance im so sorry miss lawson kiki belongs to jack and she isnt usually so badlybehaved i see said miss lawson looking very doubtful im not very much used to parrots mrs mannering i suppose of course that this bird will not come away with us i could not be responsible for pets of that kind and i dont think that a boardinghouse well we can discuss that later said mrs mannering hastily jack did you hear what i said take kiki out polly put the kettle on said kiki to miss lawson who took absolutely no notice at all kiki growled like a very fierce dog and miss lawson looked startled jack caught the parrot winked at the others and took kiki out of the room what a pity what a pity mourned kiki as the door shut behind them mrs mannering gave a sigh of relief jack and lucyann trent are not my own children she said to miss lawson lucyann shake hands with miss lawson lucyann and her brother are great friends of my own children and they live with us and all go off to boardingschool together she explained miss lawson looked at the greeneyed redhaired little girl and liked her she was very like her brother she thought then she looked at philip and dinah each darkeyed and darkhaired with a queer tuft that stuck up in front she would make them brush it down properly thought miss lawson dinah came forward politely and shook hands she thought that miss lawson would be very proper very strict and very dull but oh so safe then philip came forward but before he could shake hands he clutched at his neck then he clutched at one leg of his shorts then he clapped a hand over his middle miss lawson stared at him in amazement excuse me its only my rats explained philip and to miss lawsons enormous horror she saw squeaker running round his collar nosey making a lump here and there over his tummy and woffles coming out of his sleeve goodness how many more had the awful boy got im sorry said miss lawson faintly im very sorry but i cant take this post mrs mannering i really cant chapter a glorious idea after miss lawson had hurriedly said goodbye to mrs mannering and the front door had shut after her mrs mannering came back into the childrens playroom looking very cross that was too bad of you really i feel very annoyed and angry how could you let kiki behave like that jack and philip there was no need at all for you to make those rats all appear at once but mother argued philip i cant go away without my rats so it was only fair to let miss lawson know what she was in for i mean i was really being very honest and you were being most obstructive said mrs mannering crossly and you know you were i consider you are all being really unhelpful you know you cant go back to school yet you all look thin and pale and you really must pick up first and im doing my best to give you a good holiday in the care of somebody responsible sorry aunt allie said jack seeing that mrs mannering really was upset you see its the kind of holiday wed hate were too big to be chivvied about by miss lawson now if it was old bill old bill everyone brightened up at the thought of old bill smugs his real name was cunningham but as he had introduced himself as bill smugs in their very first adventure bill smugs he remained what adventures they had had with him golly yes if we could go away with bill said philip rubbing squeakers nose affectionately yes and dive into the middle of another dreadful adventure said mrs mannering i know bill oh no aunt allie its us children who have the adventures and drag old bill into them said jack really it is but we havent heard from bill for ages and ages this was true bill seemed to have disappeared off the map he hadnt answered the childrens letters mrs mannering hadnt heard a word he was not at his home and hadnt been there for weeks but nobody worried much about that bill was always on secret and dangerous missions and disappeared for weeks at a time still this time he really had been gone for ages without a word to anyone never mind he would suddenly turn up ready for a holiday grinning all over his cheerful ruddy face if only he would turn up now this very afternoon that would be grand nobody would mind missing the glorious summer term for a week or two if only they i could go off with bill but no bill came and something had to be decided about this holiday mrs mannering looked at the mutinous children in despair i suppose she said suddenly i suppose you wouldnt like to go off to some place somewhere by the sea where you could study the wild seabirds and their nesting habits i know jack has always wanted to but it has been impossible before because you were all at school at the best time of year for it and aunt allie yelled jack beside himself with joy thats the most marvellous idea youve ever had in your life oh i say yes mother its gorgeous agreed philip rapping on the table to emphasise his feelings kiki at once rapped her beak too come in she ordered solemnly but no one took any notice this new idea was too thrilling lucyann always loved to be where her brother jack was so she beamed too knowing how happy jack would be among his beloved birds philip too lover of animals and birds could hardly believe that his mother had made such a wonderful suggestion only dinah looked blue she was not fond of wild animals and was really scared of most of them though she was better than she had been she liked birds but hadnt the same intense interest in and love for them that the boys had still to be all by themselves in some wild lonely place by the sea wearing old clothes doing what they liked picnicking every day what joy so dinah began to smile too and joined in the cheerful hullabaloo can we really go all by ourselves when do say when tomorrow cant we go tomorrow golly i feel better just at the thought of it mother whatever made you think of it honestly its wizard kiki sat on jacks shoulder listening to the babel of noise the rats hidden about philips clothes burrowed deeply for safety scared of such a sudden outburst of voices give me a chance to explain said mrs mannering theres an expedition setting out in two days time for some of the lonely coasts and islands off the north of britain just a few naturalists and one boy the son of dr johns the ornithologist all the children knew what an ornithologist was one who loved and studied birds and their ways philips father had been a birdlover he was dead now and the boy often wished he had known him for he was very like him in his love for all wild creatures dr johns said philip why that was one of daddys best friends yes said his mother i met him last week and he was telling me about this expedition his boy is going and he wondered if there was any chance of you and dinah going philip you werent at all well then and i said no at once but now but now we can cried philip giving his mother a sudden hug fancy you thinking of somebody like miss lawson when you knew about this how could you well it seems a long way for you to go said mrs mannering and it wasnt exactly the kind of holiday i had imagined for you still if you think youd like it ill ring up dr johns and arrange for him to add four more to his birdexpedition if he can manage it of course hell be able to manage it cried lucyann we shall be company for his boy too aunt allie i say wont it be absolutely lovely to be up so far north in this glorious early summer weather the children felt happy and cheerful that teatime as they discussed the expedition to go exploring among the northern islands some of them only inhabited by birds to swim and sail and walk and watch hundreds no thousands of wild birds in their daily lives therell be puffins up there said jack happily thousands of them they go there in nesting time ive always wanted to study them theyre such comicallooking birds puffpuffpuffin said kiki at once thinking it was an invitation to her to let off her railwayengine screech but jack stopped her sternly no kiki no more of that frighten the gulls and the cormorants the guillemots and the puffins all you like with that awful screech when we get to them but you are not to let it off here it gets on aunt allies nerves what a pity what a pity said kiki mournfully puffpuff chchch idiot said jack and ruffled the parrots feathers she sidled towards him on the teatable and rubbed her beak against his shoulder then she pecked a large strawberry out of the jar of jam oh jack began mrs mannering you know i dont like kiki on the table at mealtimes and really thats the third time shes helped herself to strawberries out of the jam put it back kiki ordered jack at once but that didnt please mrs mannering either really she thought it would be very very nice and peaceful when the four children and the parrot were safely off on their holiday the children spent a very happy evening talking about the coming holiday the next day jack and philip looked out their fieldglasses and cleaned them up jack hunted for his camera a very fine one indeed i shall take some unique pictures of the puffins he told lucyann i hope theyll be nesting when we get there lucyann though i think we might be a bit too early to find eggs do they nest in trees asked lucyann can you take pictures of their nests too and the puffins sitting on them jack roared puffins dont nest in trees he explained they nest in burrows underground gracious said lucyann like rabbits well they even take rabbit burrows for nestingplaces sometimes said jack it will be fun to see puffins scuttling underground to their nests i bet they will be as tame as anything too because on some of these bird islands nobody has ever been known to set foot so the birds dont know enough to fly off when people arrive you could have puffins for pets easily then said lucyann i bet philip will i bet hell only just have to whistle and all the puffins will come huffing and puffing to meet him everyone laughed at lucyanns comical way of putting things huffin and puffin said kiki scratching her head huffin and puffin poor little piggywiggypig now whats she talking about said jack kiki you do talk a lot of rubbish poor little piggywiggypig repeated kiki solemnly huffin and puffin huffin and philip gave a shout of laughter i know shes remembered hearing the tale of the wolf and the three little pigs dont you remember how the wolf came huffing and puffing to blow their house down oh kiki youre a marvel shell give the puffins something to think about said dinah wont you kiki theyll wonder what sort of a freak has come to visit them hallo is that the telephone bell yes said jack thrilled aunt allie has put through a call to dr johns to tell him well join his expedition but he was out so she asked him to ring back when he got home i bet thats his call the children crowded out into the hall where the telephone was mrs mannering was already there the children pressed close to her eager to hear everything hallo said mrs mannering is that dr johns oh its mrs johns yes mrs mannering here whats that oh im so dreadfully sorry how terrible for you oh i do so hope it isnt anything serious yes yes of course i quite understand he will have to put the whole thing off till next year perhaps well i do hope youll have good news soon youll be sure to let us know wont you goodbye she hung up the receiver and turned to the children with a solemn face im so sorry children but dr johns has been in a car accident this morning hes in hospital so of course the whole expedition is off off no bird islands after all no glorious carefree time in the wild seas of the north what a terrible disappointment chapter very mysterious everyone was upset they were sorry for mrs johns of course and for her husband but as they didnt know them at all except as old friends of mr mannering long ago the children felt far far more miserable about their own disappointment wed talked about it such a lot and made such plans and got everything ready groaned philip looking sadly at the fieldglasses hanging nearby in their brown leather cases now mother will look for another miss lawson no i wont said mrs mannering ill give up my new job and take you away myself i cant bear to see you so disappointed poor things no darling aunt allie you shant do that said lucyann flinging herself on mrs mannering we wouldnt let you oh dear whatever can we do nobody knew it seemed as if their sudden disappointment made everyone incapable of further planning the birdholiday or nothing the birdholiday or nothing that was the thought in all the childrens minds they spent the rest of the day pottering about miserably getting on each others nerves one of their sudden quarrels blew up between philip and dinah and with yells and shouts they belaboured one another in a way they had not done for at least a year lucyann began to cry jack yelled angrily stop hitting dinah philip youll hurt her but dinah could give as good as she got and there was a loud crack as she slapped philip full across his cheek philip caught her hands angrily and she kicked him he tripped her up and down she went on the floor with her furious brother rolling over and over too lucyann got out of their way still crying kiki flew up to the electric light and cackled loudly she thought philip and dinah were playing there was such a noise that nobody heard the telephone bell ringing again mrs mannering frowning at the yells and bumps from the playroom went to answer it then she suddenly appeared at the door of the playroom her face beaming it changed when she saw dinah and philip fighting on the floor dinah philip get up at once you ought to be ashamed of yourselves quarrelling like this now that you are so big ive a good mind not to tell you who that was on the telephone philip sat up rubbing his flaming cheek dinah wriggled away holding her arm lucyann mopped her tears and jack scowled down at the pair on the floor what a collection of badtempered children said mrs mannering then she remembered that they all had had the measles badly and were probably feeling miserable and badtempered after their disappointment that day listen she said more gently guess who that was on the telephone mrs johns to say that dr johns is all right after all suggested lucyann hopefully mrs mannering shook her head no it was old bill bill hurrah so hes turned up again at last cried jack is he coming to see us well he was very mysterious said mrs mannering wouldnt say who he was just said he might pop in tonight late if nobody else was here of course i knew it was bill id know his voice anywhere quarrels and bad temper were immediately forgotten the thought of seeing bill again was like a tonic did you tell him wed had measles and were all at home demanded philip does he know hell see us too no i hadnt time to tell him anything said mrs mannering i tell you he was most mysterious hardly on the telephone for half a minute anyway hell be here tonight i wonder why he didnt want to come if anyone else was here because he doesnt want anyone to know where he is i should think said philip he must be on one of his secret missions again mother we can stay up to see him cant we if he isnt later than halfpast nine said mrs mannering she went out of the room the four looked at one another good old bill said philip we havent seen him for ages hope he comes before halfpast nine well i jolly well shant go to sleep till i hear him come said jack wonder why he was so mysterious the children expected to see bill all the evening and were most disappointed when no car drove up and nobody walked up to the front door halfpast nine came and no bill im afraid you must all go to bed said mrs mannering im sorry but really you all look so tired and pale that horrid measles i do feel so sorry that that expedition is off it would have done you all the good in the world the children went off to bed grumbling the girls had a bedroom at the back and the boys at the front jack opened the window and looked out it was a dark night no car was to be heard nor any footsteps i shall listen for bill he told philip i shall sit here by the window till he comes you get into bed ill wake you if i hear him well take it in turns said philip getting into bed you watch for an hour then wake up and ill watch in the back bedroom the girls were already in bed lucyann wished she could see bill she loved him very much he was so safe and strong and wise lucyann had no father or mother and she often wished that bill was her father aunt allie was a lovely mother and it was nice to share her with philip and dinah she couldnt share their father because he was dead i hope i shall keep awake and hear bill when he comes she thought but soon she was fast asleep and so was dinah the clock struck halfpast ten and then eleven jack awoke philip nobody has come yet he said your turn to watch tufty funny that hes so late isnt it philip sat down at the window he yawned he listened but he could hear nothing and then he suddenly saw a streak of bright light as his mother downstairs pulled back a curtain and the light flooded into the garden philip knew what it was of course but he suddenly stiffened as the light struck on something pale hidden in a bush by the front gate the something was moved quickly back into the shadows but philip had guessed what it was that was someones face i saw somebody is hiding in the bushes by the gate why it cant be bill hed come right in then it must be somebody waiting in ambush for him golly he slipped across to the bed and awoke jack he whispered to him what he had seen jack was out of bed and by the window at once but he could see nothing of course mrs mannering had drawn the curtain back over the window and no light shone out now the garden was in darkness we must do something quickly said jack if bill comes hell be knocked out if thats what that man down there is waiting for can we warn bill its plain he knows theres danger for himself or he wouldnt have been so mysterious on the telephone and insisted he couldnt come if anyone else was here i wish aunt allie would go to bed whats the time the clock struck eleven some time ago i know there came the sound of somebody clicking off lights and a door closing its mother said philip shes not going to wait up any longer shes coming up to bed good now the house will be in darkness and maybe that fellow will go well have to see that he does said jack do you suppose bill will come now philip its getting very late if he says he will he will said philip sh heres mother both boys hopped into bed and pretended to be asleep mrs mannering switched the light on and then seeing that both boys were apparently sound asleep she switched it off again quickly she did the same in the girls room and then went to her own room philip was soon sitting by the window again eyes and ears open for any sign of the hidden man in the bushes below he thought he heard a faint cough hes still there he said to jack he must have got wind of bill coming here tonight or more likely still he knows that bill is a great friend of ours and whatever gang he belongs to has sent a man to watch in that bush every night said jack hes hoping that bill will turn up sooner or later bill must have a lot of enemies hes always tracking down crooks and criminals listen said philip im going to creep out of the back door and get through the hedge of the nextdoor garden and out of their back gate so as not to let that hidden man hear me and im going to watch for old bill and warn him hell come up the road not down because thats the way he always comes good idea said jack ill come too no one of us must watch to see what that man down there does said philip well have to know if hes there or not ill go you stay at the window if i find bill coming along ill warn him and turn him back all right said jack wishing he had the exciting job of creeping about in dark gardens to go and meet bill give him our love and tell him to phone us if he can well meet him somewhere safe philip slipped quietly out of the room there was still a light in his mothers room so he went very cautiously downstairs anxious not to disturb her she would be very scared if she knew about the hidden man he opened the back door quietly shut it softly behind him and went out into the dark garden he had no torch for he did not want to show any sign of himself at all he squeezed through a gap in the hedge and came into the nextdoor garden he knew it very well he found the path and then made his way quietly along the grass at the edge of it afraid of making the gravel crunch a little if he walked on it then he thought he heard a sound he stopped dead and listened surely there wasnt another man hiding somewhere could they be burglars not men waiting for bill after all ought he to creep back and telephone to the police he listened again straining his ears and had a queer feeling that there was someone nearby also listening listening for him philip perhaps it was not a nice thought there in the darkness he took a step forward and then suddenly someone fell on him savagely pinned his arms behind him and forced him on his face to the ground philip bit deep into the soft earth of a flowerbed and choked he could not even shout for help chapter a visit from bill and a great idea philips captor was remarkably quiet in his movements he had captured philip with hardly a sound and as the boy had not had time to utter a single cry nobody had heard anything at all philip struggled frantically for he was half choked with the soft earth that his face was buried in he was twisted over quickly and a gag of some sort was put right across his mouth his wrists he found were already tied together whatever could be happening did this fellow think he was bill but surely he knew that bill was big and burly trying to spit out the earth in his mouth behind the gag philip wriggled and struggled but it was of no use for his captor was strong and merciless he was picked up and carried to a summerhouse quite silently and now hissed a voice close to his ear how many more of you are there here tell me that or youll be sorry grunt twice if there are more of you philip made no answer he didnt know what to do grunt or not grunt instead he groaned for his mouth was still full of earth and it did not taste at all nice his captor ran his hands over him then he got out a small pockettorch and flashed it once very quickly on philips gagged face he saw the tuft of hair standing straight up on philips forehead and gave a gasp philip you little ass what are you doing out here creeping about in the dark with a shock of amazement and delight philip recognised bills voice gosh so it was bill well he didnt mind his mouth being full of earth then he pulled at the gag making gurgling sounds shut up whispered bill urgently and he took off the gag there may be others about dont make a sound if youve anything to say whisper it right into my ear like this bill whispered philip his mouth finding bills ear theres a man hidden in the bushes at our front gate we spotted him there and i slipped out to warn you if i could be careful bill undid philips wrists the boy rubbed them tenderly bill knew how to tie people up no doubt about that good thing he hadnt knocked him out the back doors open he whispered into bills ear as far as i know theres nobody waiting about at the back lets try and get into the house we can talk there very silently the two made their way back to the gap in the hedge that philip knew so well neither of them trod on the gravel in case the slight crunch might warn any hidden watcher they squeezed through the gap slowly and carefully now they were in philips own garden taking bill by the arm he led him slowly over the dark lawn under the trees towards the house there was no light in it anywhere now mrs mannering had gone to bed the back door was still unlocked philip pushed it open and the two of them went in dont put on the light whispered bill we dont want anyone to know that were awake here ill lock this door they went cautiously upstairs one of the stairs creaked loudly and jack who was waiting in the bedroom shot to the door luckily he didnt switch the light on its all right its only me whispered philip and ive got old bill good egg said jack in delight and dragged them into his room bill gave his hand a hearty shake he was very fond of the whole family i must rinse my mouth out said philip its full of earth still i darent do any spitting out in the garden because of the noise ugh its horrible poor jack said bill remorsefully i didnt know it was you old fellow i thought it was somebody lying in wait for me and i meant to get him before he got me you did it jolly well said philip rinsing his mouth out now wheres my toothpaste i really must clean my teeth oh blow his hand seeking for his toothpaste in the dark had knocked over a glass it fell into the basin and smashed it made a tremendous noise in the silent night go and warn the girls not to put their light on if this has waked them said bill urgently to jack quick and see if it has waked aunt allie if it has warn her too lucyann was awake and jack just managed to stop her switching on the light his mother did not stir her room was further away and she had not heard the sound of breaking glass lucyann was astonished to hear jacks urgent voice whats up she asked anything gone wrong are you or philip ill of course not said jack impatiently get your dressinggown on and wake dinah bills here but were not to put on any lights see something fluttered by his head with a low squawk oh kiki i wondered where you were said jack what made you sleep in the girls room tonight come along and see bill lucyann awoke an astonished dinah the two girls put on their dressinggowns and went to the boys room kiki was already there nibbling bills ear in delight making soft noises in his ear hallo hallo said bill when the girls crept softly into the room which is which i can only feel you ah this must be lucyann i can smell your freckles you cant smell freckles said lucyann giggling but youre right it is me all the same oh bill where have you been so long you didnt answer any of our letters at all i know said bill you see i was on a peculiar job hunting down a gang of rogues and then before i knew what was happening they got wind of what i was doing and began to hunt me down so i had to go into hiding and keep dark why would they have kidnapped you or something bill asked lucyann scared oh theres no knowing what they would have done to me said bill airily i should certainly have disappeared for good but here i am as you see so thats what that man at the front gate was there for hoping to get you said philip why have you come to see us now bill do you want us to do anything well said bill ive got to disappear for some time and i wanted to see your mother particularly to give her a few things to keep for me just in case well just in case i didnt turn up again im what is called a marked man now as far as this particular gang is concerned i know too much about them for their own comfort oh bill but where are you going to disappear to asked lucyann forlornly i dont like you to disappear into the blue cant you tell us oh ill probably lead the simple life somewhere in the wilds said bill till these fellows have given up hunting for me or get themselves caught i dont want to disappear dont think that im not afraid of any of them but my chiefs cant afford to let anyone get hold of me so ive got to vanish completely for a time and not even get into touch with you or my family there was a silence it wasnt nice to hear all this told in a low voice in the darkness of midnight lucyann groped for bills hand he squeezed her fingers cheer up youll hear from me again some day next year or the year after i shall take some kind of disguise become a miner somewhere in the wilds of alaska or or a lonely ornithologist on some desolate island or jack gave a gasp something clicked in his mind as a really brilliant idea slid into place there bill oh bill ive thought of something grand sh not so loud said bill and just take kiki on your shoulder now will you before she nibbles away the whole of my left ear listen bill said jack urgently ive thought of something we had a great disappointment today ill tell you about it first go on then said bill thankful that kiki was no longer on his shoulder i dont expect you know but weve all had measles pretty badly said jack thats why were not back at school well the doctor said we ought to go away for a change and aunt allie decided we could go on a birdwatching expedition with dr johns and his party to some lonely coasts and islands off the north of britain you know places that only birds live on and only birdlovers visit i know said bill listening intently well dr johns got hurt in an accident today said jack so we cant go because there is nobody to take us but why cant you take us disguised as some birdman or other then wed have a perfectly glorious holiday youd be able to get off into the unknown without anyone knowing and we could leave you behind there when we come back quite safe there was a silence all the children waited breathlessly for bills answer even kiki seemed to be listening anxiously i dont know said bill at last its too much like using you as a smokescreen and if my enemies saw through the smoke well things wouldnt be too good for you or for me either i dont think its possible the mere thought of bills turning the wonderful idea down made the children more enthusiastic and urgent about it they each had a few words to contribute we were so disappointed not to go and now this really does seem a way and after all it would only be for about two weeks as far as were concerned wed be going back to school then youre awfully good at disguises you could easily look like an ornithologist sort of earnest and always peering into the distance for birds and with fieldglasses over your shoulder nobody could possibly know wed all be absolutely safe up in the northern seas so wild and desolate with you think of may up there the sea so blue the birds all soaring and gliding the seapinks out all over the place youd be safe bill no one surely would ever dream of hunting for you in a place like that and oh we do so want a holiday like that weve felt mouldy after measles not so loud whispered bill ill have to talk things over with your mother first even if i think its all right myself its a bold idea and i dont think it would occur to anyone for one moment that i would go off openly like that and i must say that a holiday with you four and kiki too of course is just what im needing at the moment oh bill i believe youll do it said lucyann hugging him with ecstasy what a lovely ending to a horrid day chapter exciting plans bill spent the night unknown to mrs mannering in the little spare room he said he would talk to her the next morning he was relieved to find that a daily maid came in each morning but that no one except the family slept in the house at night we children do all the beds and things upstairs now that we have recovered said dinah so you can stay up here unseen if you like well bring breakfast up but the next morning everything was upset again mrs mannering knocked on the wall separating the girls room from hers and dinah went running in to see what the matter was dinah the most sickening thing has happened said mrs mannering in disgust ive got measles now look at my spots i thought id had it when i was your age but its measles right enough oh dear i wish i had engaged that miss lawson and let her take you off to bournemouth or somewhere yesterday now what are we to do oh dear said dinah then she decided to tell her mother about bill being there perhaps that would help ill get you your dressingjacket and tidy the room she said briskly because theres someone who wants to see you he may help quite a lot its bill bill said mrs mannering amazed when did he come i waited up till eleven but i felt so terribly tired i just had to go to bed well now i wonder if old bill would take you off my hands for a bit and leave hilda the daily to look after me im sure he would said dinah delighted poor mother you feel worst the first two or three days and after that its not so bad there are your pillows comfy ill send bill in now the news was broken to the others the children were sorry and dismayed did grownups actually get measles then poor mother poor aunt allie she would certainly want them out of the house now shes ready to see you bill said dinah i say i suppose youve had measles all right havent you oh dozens of times said bill cheerfully going to mrs mannerings room cheer up well get things right in no time but you can only have measles once began lucyann then the door was shut and the children could hear only a murmur of voices in their mothers room they went down to breakfast the boys had more or less got back their ordinary appetites but the girls still only picked at their food dinah looked at lucyann your freckles hardly show she said nor do jacks a bit of sun will do us all good i dont feel like this bacon do you oh dear i wish bill would hurry up and come clown i do want to know what theyve decided bill did not come down the children heard the door above opening and then a soft whistle bill was evidently afraid the daily was about but she had gone out to do the shopping its all right called dinah hildas out come down if you want to weve saved you some breakfast bill came down your mother doesnt want any breakfast except toast and tea he said you make the toast dinah i see the kettles boiling we can make the tea as soon as the toast is ready then im going to ring up the doctor and then ring up miss tremayne your mothers friend and ask her to come along for a week or two to be with the invalid she says shell like that the children listened in silence and what about us asked jack at last didnt you decide yes i decided said bill your aunt begged me to take you away for two weeks and i told her i was due to disappear for a while so id go off to the northern seas with you i didnt scare her with my reasons for disappearing shes really feeling bad this morning and shes so thankful to think youll get away for a change that she hardly asked me any questions at all so were to go said jack unable to keep the joy out of his voice even though he was very sorry about aunt allie how absolutely super the four faces glowed kiki picked a piece of rind out of the marmalade and as nobody said anything took a piece of lump sugar from the sugarbasin mother will be quite all right wont she with miss tremayne said philip earnestly she wouldnt like one of us to stay with her would she ill stay if so she would be much better with you all out of the house said bill helping himself to bacon shes tired out and wants a really peaceful time measles is beastly but at least it will make her rest in bed for a while well then we can really look forward to going off with a light heart said jack cheerfully oh bill you always turn up just exactly at the right moment heres hilda said philip suddenly youd better hop upstairs bill take your plate ill bring you more toast and tea when we take mothers up isnt that toast finished yet dinah just said dinah and put the last piece in the toastrack no kiki leave it alone oh jack look at kikis beak just dripping with marmalade there wont be any left for us greedy bird bill disappeared upstairs hilda went into the kitchen and began to fill up the kitchen stove dinah went out to tell her about mrs mannering having the measles hilda was most sympathetic but looked very worried well i daresay i can manage she said but what with all you children here too oh but we shant be said dinah were going off on a birdexpedition as soon as we can and miss tremayne is coming to see to mother so hilda hillda hilllllda called a voice and hilda jumped my thats the missus calling she said and you told me she was in bed coming madam but it was only kiki of course doing one of her imitations she cackled with laughter when hilda came running into the diningroom wipe your feet she ordered dont sniff how many times have i told you to hilda went out and banged the door i dont mind taking orders from them as has the right to give them she said to a giggling dinah but take orders from that ridiculous bird i will not i hope miss that youre taking that parrot with you i dont want the minding of her whilst youre gone drive me crazy she would oh of course well take her said dinah jack would never dream of going without her the doctor came miss tremayne arrived hilda agreed to sleep in everything seemed to be going well bill ensconced in the spare room whose door he kept locked in case hilda should come barging in made a few quick plans pack up your things order a taxi for eight oclock tomorrow night well catch the night train to the north ill slip out tonight and make the rest of the plans for the journey and the holiday ill meet you at euston and it wont be as the bill smugs you know i shall then be dr walker the naturalist ill come over and introduce myself in a loud voice as soon as i see you arrive in case theres anyone about that knows you or me either then off well go it all sounded very thrilling what a mysterious way to begin a holiday it sounded as if they were setting off for a firstclass adventure but of course they werent it would be fun if they were but what could happen on lonely birdislands nothing at all except birds and more birds and yet more birds bill slipped off that night no one had known he was in the house not even miss tremayne who had been given the little dressingroom leading off mrs mannerings room mrs mannering had promised not to say that bill had been there in case it meant danger to him but she was so heavy and sleepy that day that she really began to wonder if bill had actually been there at all or if she had dreamt it the children packed no need to take best dresses or anything like that shorts and jerseys rubber shoes bathingsuits and mackintoshes were the things they would want and a few cardigans some towels and what about some rugs were they going to sleep under a roof or not bill hadnt said for all they knew they might be sleeping in tents what fun they decided not to take rugs bill would be sure to take things like that if they needed them fieldglasses notebooks pencils my camera and a rope said jack trying to think of everything lucyann looked astonished a rope she said why a rope we might want to go cliffclimbing if we want to examine nestingplaces there said jack well you can go cliffclimbing if you like i shant said lucyann with a shiver id hate to climb down steep cliffs with just a rope round me and hardly anything to put my feet on kikis taken your pencil said dinah kiki dont be such a nuisance we shant take you to see the puffins if you behave like this huffin and puffin puffin and huffin muffin and puffin muffins and crumpets pronounced kiki and cracked her beak in delight at having said something new huffin and puff oh stop huffing and puffing called dinah god save the king said kiki and stood up very straight goodness knows what the birds up there will think of you said lucyann jack shall we put her into a basket to take her with us on the train you know how she will keep shouting guard guard and pretending to blow a whistle and then telling everyone to wipe their feet she can go on my shoulder said jack we shall be sleeping on the train in beds or berths and shell be quite all right stop cracking your beak kiki its not clever to keep on making a nuisance of yourself naughty polly said kiki sing pollywollyoodleall theday philip threw a cushion at her and she retired to the top of the curtains and sulked the children went on discussing their coming holiday fancy having the luck to be with bill after all said jack much better than dr johns i wonder if hell have a boat and go exploring round golly im going to enjoy the next week or two we might even see a great auk you and your great auks said philip you know quite well theyre extinct dont start all that again jack we might find little auks up there though and razorbills and thousands of guillemots on the cliffs the next day came at last and then dragged on till the evening mrs mannering slept most of the time and miss tremayne would not let them go in and wake her to say goodbye better not she said ill say goodbye for you mind you write to her from wherever youre going is that the taxi i hear now ill come and see you off it was the taxi they bundled in with all their luggage now to london to meet dr walker and to travel hundreds of miles to the north to wild places where few people had ever been no adventures this time but just a glorious carefree holiday with old bill all aboard said kiki in a deep voice that made the taxidriver jump one two three off chapter travelling far bill had told the children exactly where to wait for him at euston station so each carrying a bag and a mackintosh they went to the spot they stood there waiting suppose said philip in a mysterious voice just suppose that one of the gang that bill is after knew bill was going to meet us here and came up and told us he was bill and took us all off with him so that we were never heard of again poor lucyann stared at him in the greatest alarm her eyes nearly popped out of her head oh philip do you think that might happen gracious i hope to goodness we recognise bill when we see him i shall be scared stiff of going with him if we dont a very fat man approached them smiling he was big all over big head big body big feet and big teeth that showed when he smiled lucyann felt her heart sink this couldnt be bill nobody could make himself as big as that if he wasnt fat to begin with she clutched philips hand was it one of the gang little girl said the big man to lucyann youve dropped your mackintosh behind you youll lose it if you dont pick it up lucyann had gone pale when he first began to speak then she looked round and saw her mack on the ground she picked it up then scarlet in the face she stammered out a few words of thanks the big man smiled again showing all his fine teeth dont look so scared he said i shant eat you he looks just as if he might thought lucyann retreating behind jack pop goes the weasel said kiki in a polite conversational tone pop pop pop what a remarkably clever bird said the big man and put out his hand to pat kiki she gave him a vicious nip with her beak and then whistled like an engine the big mans smile vanished and he scowled dangerous bird that he said and disappeared into the crowd the children were relieved they didnt think of course that he was one of the gang that had only been philips makeup but they were worried in case he kept them talking and prevented bill from coming up and fetching them they stood there under the clock looking all round for bill they couldnt see anyone even remotely resembling him then a rather shambling roundshouldered man came up wearing thick glasses through which his eyes peered sharply he wore a thick long coat had fieldglasses slung across his back and a curious black checked cap he also had a black beard but he spoke in bills voice good evening children i am glad to see you are punctual now at last we start on our little expedition lucyann beamed that was bills nice warm voice all right in spite of the beard and the queer getup she was just about to fling herself on him crying oh bill its good to see you when jack feeling sure that lucyann was going to do something silly like that pushed her away and held out his hand politely good evening dr walker how are you the others took their cue from jack and anyone looking on would have thought that here were four children greeting a tutor or a guardian who was going to take them on a journey somewhere come this way said dr walker i have a porter for your things hey porter put these bags on your barrow will you and find our reservations in the ten oclock train thank you it wasnt long before they were all safely on the night train the children were thrilled with their little bedrooms lucyann liked the way everything could fold down or fold back or be somehow pushed out of the way now you must sleep all night said bill his eyes smiling at them from behind his thick glasses dr walker will see that you are awake in time for breakfast how do we get to the place were going to and where exactly is it asked jack well we get there by this train and another and then by motorboat said bill the children looked thrilled they loved travelling ive got a map here said bill making sure that the door was shut its a map of all the many little islands dotted off the northwest coast of scotland hundreds of them some are too small to map i dont expect anyone has ever visited all of them only the birds live there i thought wed make one of them our headquarters and then cruise around a bit taking photographs and watching the birds in their daily life the eyes of the two boys gleamed what a glorious thing to do they visualised days of sunshine on the water chugging to and from tiny islands inhabited by halftame birds picnicking hungrily in the breeze sitting on rocks with their feet dangling in the clear water their hearts lifted in happiness at the thought what i should really like said philip would be a tame puffin or two ive never seen a live puffin only a stuffed one but they look real characters i suppose you would teach them to sit up and beg said bill amused huffin and puffin announced kiki god save the king nobody took any notice they were all too much absorbed in thinking of their unusual holiday i shall remain behind there once you have gone back said bill itll be a bit lonely without you all but no doubt you will leave me your tame puffins for company i shall hate leaving you said lucyann will you have to be there all alone for long bill a goodish time i expect said bill long enough for my enemies to forget about me or to think im dead and gone oh dear said lucyann i wish you didnt have to lead such a dangerous life bill cant you do something else instead what be a gardener or a tram conductor or something safe like that do you mean asked bill grinning at lucyanns serious face no lucyann this kind of life suits me im on the side of law and order and right and to my mind theyre worth while running any risk for evil is strong and powerful but im strong and powerful too and its good to try my strength against bad men and their ways well i think youre marvellous said lucyann stoutly and im sure youll always win dont you hate having to hide now im furious about it said bill looking anything but furious but with a note in his voice that made the others realise how desperate he felt having to disappear when there was work to be done but orders are orders and anyway my disappearance means a perfectly glorious holiday for all of us well boys have you finished studying that map the two boys had been poring over the map of islands jack put his finger on one look that sounds a good one the isle of wings it must be full of birds well try and go there said bill we shall probably get well and truly lost but never mind who minds being lost on the bluegreen sea in maytime with all kinds of little enchanted islands ready to welcome you it sounds glorious said dinah oh look at kiki shes trying to pull the plug off its chain in that basin kiki had thoroughly explored the whole of the bedroom and had had a good drink out of one of the water decanters now she settled down on the little towelrail and with a remarkably human yawn put her head under her wing at the same moment there came a loud banging of doors all down the train she took her head out again shut the door she remarked pop goes the door send for the doctor the whistle blew and to kikis alarm the whole bedroom suddenly shook as the train pulled out of the station she almost fell off the towelrail poor kiki what a pity what a pity she said and flew to jacks shoulder now its time we all retired to bed and to sleep said bill getting up he looked very queer in his black beard and thick glasses thank goodness he had taken off the awful black checked cap do two of us sleep here or four of us asked lucyann looking doubtfully at the small beds one on each side of the bedroom two silly said bill ive got a single room on the right of you and to the right again is another compartment or room for the two boys im in the middle of you you see and youve only to bang hard on the wooden wall between us if you want anything and ill come rushing in oh good said lucyann im glad youre so near us bill are you going to sleep in your beard well as its rather painful to remove it the moment being well and truly stuck on i think i will said bill ill take it off when were safely among our little islands no one will see us there dont you like me in my beautiful beard not much said lucyann i feel as if youre not you when i look at you but when i hear your voice its all right well my child look at me with your eyes shut and youll have no horrid feelings said bill with a grin now good night and sleep well come on boys ill take you to your compartment ill wake you in the morning and well dress and go along to the restaurant car for breakfast i feel a bit hungry now said philip although we had a jolly good supper but thats ages ago well ive got some sandwiches and some bananas said bill ill get them but dont be long turning in because its getting late only just gone ten said dinah but she yawned as loudly as she spoke kiki promptly imitated her and that set everyone else yawning too bill went into his own compartment and fetched sandwiches and ripe bananas then he said good night to the girls and took the boys to their own bedroom it really was very exciting to go to bed in a train it was queer undressing with the train swaying about rushing through the night at sixty miles an hour it was nice to be in bed listening to the tuttatuttah tuttatuttah of the train wheels turning rapidly over the rails travelling far travelling far travelling far said the wheels to lucyann as her eyes closed and her mind swung towards sleep travelling far in spite of all the excitement the four children were soon fast asleep and dreaming what were they dreaming of that was easy to guess bluegreen water clear as crystal enchanting little islands big white clouds flying across an enormous blue sky and birds birds birds travelling far travelling far travelling far chapter on the sea at last the journey was half over before the children awoke again bill banged on the walls and they woke with a jump they dressed and walked staggeringly along to the restaurant car feeling very hungry lucyann didnt much like walking across the bits that joined two carriages together she clutched bills hand then im always afraid the train might come in two just when im walking through the bit where two carriages are joined she explained bill quite understood and didnt even smile though the others were very scornful of lucyanns extraordinary idea kiki behaved very badly at breakfast throwing the toast about and squawking because she was not allowed any of the rather small helping of marmalade she made rude noises at the sunflower seeds jack offered her the other passengers were amused at her and laughed but that only made kiki show off all the more stop it kiki said bill exasperated and tapped her smartly on her beak kiki screeched and made a pounce at his beard a vicious tug and some of it came away kiki hadnt been able to understand why bill had arrived with a strange mass of hair under his chin and round his cheeks now having got some of it she retired under the table and began to peck it gently separating the hairs one by one and murmuring to herself all the time let her be said bill shell be happy pulling that bit of my beard to pieces he rubbed his chin that hurt i hope i dont look too peculiar now oh no it doesnt really show much jack assured him kiki always gets excited on a journey like this shes awful when i bring her back from school whistles like the guard and tells all the people in the carriage to blow their noses and wipe their feet and screeches in the tunnels till were almost deafened but shes a darling really said lucyann loyally and didnt say a word about kiki undoing her shoelaces and pulling them out of her shoes at that very moment the journey was a long one there was a change to be made at a very big and noisy station the next train was not quite so long as the first one and did not go so fast it took them to a place on the coast and the children were delighted to see the blue sea shining like a thin bright line in the distance hurrah they all loved the sea now i feel that our holiday has really begun said lucyann now that weve seen the sea i mean it gives me a proper holiday feeling everyone felt the same even kiki who leapt about like a red indian doing a wardance on the luggage rack above the childrens heads she flew down to jacks shoulder when they got out of the train at a big seaside town the strong breeze blew in their faces and the girls hair streamed back bills beard blew back too and kiki was careful to stand with her beak to the wind she hated her feathers being ruffled the wrong way they had a very good meal in a hotel and then bill went down to the harbour to see if his motorboat was there it had just come in the man who brought it knew bill very well and had been told in what disguise he was to be seen morning dr walker sir he said in loud tones fine weather for your expedition everythings ready sir plenty of provisions henty asked dr walker blinking through his thick glasses enough to stand a siege sir said henty im to pilot you out sir ive got a boat behind everyone went on board it was a fine motorboat with a little cabin in front jacks eyes gleamed when he saw the stock of food tins tins tins the little refrigerator was full of stuff too good there would be plenty to eat anyway and that in jacks opinion was one of the main things to be planned for on a holiday people always got so terribly hungry when they were holidaying henty piloted them out of the harbour his tiny boat bobbing behind when they were beyond the harbour henty saluted and got into his boat well good luck sir he said the wireless is ok sir well be expecting a message regularly to know youre all right there are extra batteries and a repair set as well good luck sir ill be here in two weeks time to pick up the kids he rowed off his oars making a soft plashplashplash in the water he soon looked very small indeed as bills motorboat sped away well were off said bill with great satisfaction and my beard can come off too and my glasses thank goodness and my coat here philip you know how to steer a motorboat dont you take the wheel whilst i make myself presentable again noone is likely to see me now keep her going northnorthwest proudly philip took the wheel the engine of the boat purred smoothly and they sped fast over the blue water it was a wonderful day almost as hot as summer the may sun shone down out of a sky flecked with tiny curly clouds and little points of light danced on the waves gorgeous said jack sitting down with a grunt of joy near philip simply absolutely perfectly gorgeous ive got such a lovely feeling said lucyann looking the picture of happiness you know that feeling you get at the very beginning of a lovely holiday when all the days spread out before you sunny and lazy and sort of enchanted youll end up by being a poet if you dont look out said philip from the wheel well if a poet feels like i feel just exactly at this moment i wouldnt mind being one for the rest of my life even if it meant having to write poetry said lucyann three blind mice see how they run remarked kiki and for one moment everyone thought that kiki was joining in the talk about poetry and giving what she thought was an example but she was merely referring to the three tame rats that had suddenly appeared on philips shoulders they stood there daintily their pink noses raised sniffing the salt sea air oh blow you philip said dinah from her seat near jack i was hoping against hope you hadnt brought those detestable little creatures i only hope the gulls eat them but even dinah couldnt feel annoyed for long as they glided over the green waves leaving a white wake behind them like a long feathery tail when bill appeared from the little cabin they all hailed him in delight bill dear old bill you look like yourself again oh bill never wear a beard again it does spoil your beauty hurrah weve lost dr walker for ever silly fellow i never liked him bill you look nice again i can see your mouth when you smile pay the bill pay the bill shut up kiki or the gulls will get you ah this is something like said bill happily taking the wheel from philip golly if we get this weather well all be burnt black in a day or two better keep your shirts on boys or youll get blistered everyone had discarded coats and wraps at once the breeze was cool but the sun was really very hot the sea in the distance was unbelievably blue the colour of cornflowers lucyann thought now my dears said bill his white shirt billowing in the breeze this is a holiday not a hairraising adventure youve had enough of adventures weve had three together and this time i want a holiday right said jack a holiday it shall be adventures keep out i dont want any adventures either said lucyann ive had plenty this is adventure enough for me i like this kind best not the kind where we have to hide and creep through secret tunnels and live in caves i just want a sunny lazy windy time with the people i like best it would be nice if aunt allie was here too but perhaps she wouldnt enjoy it very much i hope shes feeling better said dinah i say wheres the land i cant see a bit not even an island youll see plenty tomorrow said bill you can choose one for your own that was a wonderful afternoon and evening they had a fine tea on board prepared by the two girls who found new bread strawberry jam and a big chocolate cake in the cabin larder make the most of this said bill you wont get new bread often now i doubt if we shall find any farmhouses at all among the lonely islands we shall visit but ive brought tins and tins of biscuits of all kinds and as for this chocolate cake eat it up and enjoy it i dont think youll get any more for two weeks i dont care said dinah munching away when im hungry i simply dont mind what i eat and i can see im always going to be hungry on this holiday the sun went down in a great golden blaze and the tiny curly clouds turned a brilliant pink still the motorboat went on and on and on over a sea that blazed pink and gold too the sun has drowned itself in the sea said lucyann at last as it disappeared i watched the very very last little bit go down into the water where are we going to sleep tonight asked jack not that i mind but it would be fun to know there are two tents somewhere in the bow said bill i thought when we came to an island we like the look of wed land put up the tents and sleep there for the night what do you say oh yes said everyone lets look for an island a really nice wild one but at the moment there was no land in sight not even a small rocky island bill gave the wheel to jack and looked at the chart he pointed with his finger weve been running in this direction we should come on these two islands presently one has a few people on it and i believe a tiny jetty wed better go there tonight and then set off to the unknown tomorrow its getting too late to go hunting for islands further away it would be dark before we got there its still very light said philip looking at his watch at home it would be getting dark the further north you go the longer the evening light is said bill dont ask me why at the moment i dont feel capable of a lecture just now you dont need to tell us said philip loftily we learnt all about it last term you see owing to the sun being spare me spare me begged bill taking the wheel again look one of your inquisitive little rats is sniffing at kikis tail there will be murder done in a moment if you dont remove him but kiki knew better than to hurt any of philips pets she contented herself with cracking her beak so loudly in squeakers ear that he ran back to philip in alarm scampering up his bare legs and into his shorts in a trice gradually the sea lost its blue and became greygreen the breeze felt cold and everyone put on jerseys then far away in the distance a dark hump loomed up land thats it thats one of the islands we want for tonight said bill pleased i consider ive done pretty well to head so straight for it well soon be there it certainly was not long before they were nosing alongside a simple stone jetty a fisherman was there in a long blue jersey he was astonished to see them bill explained in a few words och so its bairds yere after said the fisherman weel theres a plenty for you out yon and he nodded towards the sea where will you be sleeping the night my bit cottage wont tak sae mony lucyann couldnt understand him but the others gathered what he meant bring the tents ordered bill well soon have them up well get the fishermans wife to give us a meal it will save our own provisions maybe we can get some cream too and good butter by the time that darkness came at last they had all had a good meal and were bedded down in the two tents comfortable on groundsheets and rugs the fresh air had made them so sleepy that the girls fell asleep without even saying good night theyre a daft said the fisherman to his wife wasting a fine boat like that yon looking for bairds bairds when theres good fish to be got well theyll soon see bairds in plenty och theyre a dafties chapter the islands of birds next day after a fine breakfast of porridge and cream and grilled herrings the tents were struck and the five went aboard their boat it was called lucky star which the children thought was a very nice name kiki had not been popular with the old fisherman and his wife they had never seen a parrot before and they could not understand a bird that talked they regarded kiki with awe and fear and seemed scared of her sharp curved beak god save the king said kiki having learnt by experience that most people thought this was a fine thing for her to say but she spoilt it by adding pop goes the king pop pop pop now she was aboard with the others and once again the boat was skimming over the blue water once again the sky was blue and the sun was hot true may weather that made the sea a clear translucent blue and set thousands of little sparkles dancing over the water ive still got that lovely feeling said lucyann happily as she dangled her hand over the side of the boat and felt the cool silky water catch hold of her fingers and trail them back now to find some birdislands we really are going to find some today arent we bill we certainly are said bill and gave the boat a little extra speed spray came up and fell lightly over everyone ooooh lovely said dinah i was so hot that cooled me beautifully let her out again bill i could do with some more of that for five hours they sped over the water and then jack gave a shout the islands look you can see little blobs here and there on the horizon they must be the islands and now the children began to see a great many different birds on the water and in the air jack called out their names excitedly theres a shearwater jolly good name for it and look philip thats a razorbill and gosh is that a little auk the boys well versed in the appearance of the wild seabirds almost fell overboard in their excitement many of the birds seemed to have no fear of the noisy boat at all but went bobbing on their way hardly bothering to swerve when it neared them theres a shag diving shouted jack look you can see it swimming under water its caught a fish here it comes its clumsy getting out of the water to fly gosh if only id got my camera ready kiki watched the many birds out of baleful eyes she did not like the interest that jack suddenly appeared to take in these other birds when a great gull appeared flying leisurely right over the boat kiki shot up underneath it gave a fearful screech and turned a somersault in the air the gull startled rose vertically on its strong wings and let out an alarmed cry eeeooeeooooo kiki imitated it perfectly and the gull thinking that kiki must be some strange kind of relation circled round then it made a pounce at the parrot but kiki flipped round and then dropped to jacks shoulder eeeoo she called defiantly and the gull after a doubtful glance went on its way wondering no doubt what kind of a gull this was that behaved in such a peculiar manner youre an idiot kiki said jack one of these days a gull will eat you for his dinner poor old kiki said the parrot and gave a realistic groan bill laughed i cant imagine what kiki will do when we see the puffins he said waddling about among the heather and seapinks im afraid she will give them an awful time as they came nearer to the first island more and more birds were to be seen on and above the water they glided gracefully on the wind they dived down for fish they bobbed along like toy ducks there was a chorus of different cries some shrill some guttural some mournful and forlorn they gave the children a wild exultant kind of feeling as they came near to the island the children fell silent a tall cliff towered in front of them and it was covered from top to bottom with birds the children stared in delight birds birds birds on every ledge they stood or squatted thousands of white gannets myriads of the browner guillemots and a mixture of other seabirds that the boys could hardly make out though they glued their fieldglasses to their eyes for minutes on end what a coming and going said bill staring with fascinated eyes too and it certainly was besides the birds that stood on the ledges there were always others arriving and others leaving that way and this went the busy birds with a chorus of excited cries theyre not very careful with their eggs said lucyann in distress when she looked through jacks glasses in her turn and saw eggs falling from the ledges as careless birds took off and knocked their precious eggs over the ledge and down the cliff to be smashed on the rocks below they can lay plenty more said philip come on dinah give me back my glasses golly what a wonderful sight i shall write this all up in my notes tonight the motorboat nosed carefully round the rocky cliffs bill stopped looking at the birds and kept a sharp lookout instead for rocks once round the steep cliffs the land sloped downwards and bill spotted a place that seemed suitable for the boat it was a little sheltered sandy cove he ran the boat in and it grounded softly he sprang out with the boys and made it safe by running the anchor well up the beach and digging it in is this going to be our headquarters asked dinah looking round oh no said jack at once we want to cruise round a bit dont we bill and find a puffin island id really like to be in the midst of the birdislands and be able to go from one to the other as we pleased but we could stay here for tonight couldnt we that was a wonderful day for the four children and for bill too with thousands of birds screaming round their heads but apparently not in the least afraid of them the children made their way to the steep cliffs they had seen from the other side of the island birds were nesting on the ground and it was difficult to tread sometimes without disturbing sitting birds or squashing eggs some of the birds made vicious jabs at the childrens legs but nobody was touched it was just a threatening gesture nothing more kiki was rather silent she sat on jacks shoulder her head hunched into her neck so many birds at once seemed rather to overwhelm her but jack knew that she would soon recover and startle the surrounding birds by telling them to wipe their feet and shut the door they reached the top of the cliffs and were almost deafened by the cries and calls around them birds rose and fell in the air glided and soared weaving endless patterns in the blue sky its funny they never bump into one another said lucyann astonished theres never a single collision ive been watching probably got a traffic policeman said philip solemnly for all you know some of them have licences under their wings dont be silly said lucyann all the same it is clever of them not to collide when theres so many thousands what a row i can hardly hear myself speak they came to the very edge of the cliff bill took lucyanns arm not too near he said the cliffs are almost sheer here they were when the children lay down on their tummies and looked cautiously over it gave them a queer feeling to see the sea so very very far below moving slowly in and out with only a faroff rumble to mark the breaking of the waves lucyann found herself clutching the cushions of seapink beside her i somehow feel im not safe on the ground she said with a laugh i feel as if ive got to hold on i feel sort of well sort of upsidedown bill held on to her tightly after that speech he knew that she felt giddy and he wasnt going to risk anything with little lucyann he liked all the children very much but lucyann was his favourite the children watched the birds going and coming endlessly to and from the narrow cliff ledges it was a marvellous sight jack looked through his glasses and chuckled at the squabbling and pushing that was going on on some of the narrower shelves just like naughty children he said telling each other to move up and make room or ill push you off and off somebody goes sure enough but it doesnt matter because out go their wings and they have a lovely glide through the air my word i wouldnt mind being a seabird able to stride along on the seashore or bob on the sea or dive for fish or glide for miles on the strong breeze i shouldnt mind be whats that said philip suddenly hearing a noise that wasnt made by seabirds listen an aeroplane surely they all listened straining their eyes through the sunwashed air and far away they saw a speck steadily moving through the sky and heard the rrrr of an engine a plane right off all the routes said bill well thats the last thing i expected to see here chapter hurrah for puffin island bill seemed so astonished that the children stared at him surely it wasnt so surprising to see an aeroplane even near these desolate birdislands bill took jacks glasses and looked through them but it was too late to make out anything i wonder if it was a seaplane or an ordinary plane he said half to himself queer why is it queer asked dinah aeroplanes go everywhere now bill said no more he handed back the glasses to jack i think wed better have a meal and then put up our tents he said what about putting them by that little stream we saw on our way here about a quarter of a mile from the shore it wouldnt be too far to carry everything if we all give a hand the tents were set up the groundsheets were put down and the rugs tumbled over them then sitting on a slight slope looking out to the blue sea the five of them had a glorious meal i always think began lucyann munching a couple of biscuits with butter and cream cheese between them i always think you neednt go on said jack we know what youre going to say and we quite agree with you you dont know what im going to say said lucyann indignantly we do said philip you say it every holidays when we have a meal out of doors youre going to say i always think food tastes much nicer when its eaten out of doors said dinah arent you well i was said lucyann do i really always say it anyway its quite true i do think yes we know said jack youre an awful repeater lucyann you tell us the same things over and over again never mind we think the same even if we dont keep on saying it kiki take your fat beak out of the cream cheese kikis awful said dinah she really is shes pinched three biscuits already i dont think you give her enough sunflower seeds jack golly i like that said jack she wont even look at sunflower seeds when theres a spread like this anyway philip your rats can always eat them i found squeaker in my pocket a little while ago nibbling one of them as fast as he could i hope it wont make him ill said philip in alarm i say look here comes a gull tame as anything it wants a biscuit too i should think it did it had watched kiki pecking at a biscuit and enjoying it and it didnt see why it shouldnt have a share kiki saw the gull out of the corner of her eye and sidled away the gull made a pounce got the biscuit and rose into the air making a loud laughing noise eeoo eeoo eeoo kiki flew up angrily calling out all kinds of things to the gull they were meant to be very rude but unfortunately the gull didnt understand kiki could not catch the strongwinged bird and flew disconsolately back to the children you cant complain kiki said jack you shouldnt have pinched that biscuit out of the tin and the gull shouldnt have pinched it from you its six of one and half a dozen of the other what a pity what a pity said kiki and sidled near the biscuit tin again that bird is a real clown said bill shaking the crumbs off his jersey now whos coming back to the boat with me to hear the news on the wireless also i must send out a few messages especially one for your mother philip who will be sure to want to know if weve got here safely they all wanted to stretch their legs so they walked back over the soft cushions of the seapinks whose bold little pink heads nodded everywhere in the wind they watched bill as he put up his little wireless mast and fiddled about with the set it was a transmitter as well as a receiver i suppose if you send messages home every night we shant need to post letters off to aunt allie said lucyann everyone roared and where would you post a letter pray asked jack i havent seen a pillarbox anywhere about lucyann youre an idiot yes i am said lucyann going red of course we cant post anything here how useful that you can send messages bill then if any of us wanted help you could get it quite so said bill but i hope if you wanted help i could whizz you off in the motorboat anyway i wouldnt have consented to bring you all away into the wilds like this if i hadnt a transmitter with me so that i could send messages every night i send them to headquarters and they telephone them to your aunt so shell follow our travels and adventures each night they watched for a while and then listened to part of a programme then lucyann yawned and kiki imitated her blow you make me feel sleepy said dinah rubbing her eyes look its getting dark so back they went to their tents and were soon cuddled into their rugs the birds called incessantly from the cliffs and the sea i believe they keep awake all night thought dinah but they didnt they slept too when the darkness came at last the next day was very warm and close looks to me like a storm blowing up sooner or later said bill screwing up his eyes and looking into the bright sky i almost think wed better try and find our headquarters today so that we have some shelter if a storm does blow up this sort of holiday needs fine weather if its going to be successful a storm wouldnt be at all pleasant with only tents to sleep in wed be blown to bits i just want to take a few photographs of these cliffs and the birds on them said jack ill do that whilst youre getting down the tents if you dont mind my not helping you so off he went with kiki towards the steep cliffs bill called after him that he was not to try any climbing down the cliffs and he shouted back that he wouldnt soon everything was packed away again on the motorboat which was just being floated by the rising tide and they waited patiently for jack he soon appeared his glasses and his camera slung round his neck and his face beaming got some beauties he said kiki was awfully useful to me i got her to parade up and down so that all the birds stayed still in amazement watching her and then click i got them beautifully i ought to have some fine pictures good said bill smiling at the enthusiastic boy youll have to have a book of bird photographs published masterpieces by jack trent price thirty shillings id like that said jack his face shining not the thirty shillings i mean but having a book about birds with my name on it come on in said philip impatiently for jack was still outside the boat we want to be off its so warm im longing to get out to sea again and feel the breeze on my face as the boat swings along they soon felt it and were glad of it it certainly was very hot for may the boat went swiftly through the water bobbing a little as it rode over the waves lucyann let her fingers run through the water again lovely and cool what i should like is a bathe said philip little drops of perspiration appearing round his nose can we bathe from the boat bill wait till we get to another island said bill i dont particularly want to stop out at sea with a storm in the offing its so jolly hot i feel there must be thunder about im anxious to run for shelter before it comes now here are more islands bobbing up out of the sea lets see if we can spot a puffin island thats what you want isnt it lucyann still dangling her hand in the water suddenly felt something gently touching it in surprise she looked down withdrawing her hand at once afraid of a jellyfish to her astonishment she saw that it was a piece of orange peel bobbing away on the waves she called to bill bill look theres a bit of orange peel now whoever in the world eats oranges in these wild little islands do you suppose there ate any other birdlovers somewhere about everyone looked at the tiny bit of orange peel bobbing rapidly away it did seem very much out of place there bill stared at it hard he was puzzled the fishermen if there were any on the islands they were coming to would not be at all likely to have oranges and naturalists surely would not bother to load themselves up with them then how did that bit of peel come to be there no ships went anywhere near where they were it was a wild and lonely part of the sea where sudden storms blew up and great gales made enormous waves beats me said bill at last i shall expect to see a pineapple or something next now look here is an island fairly flattish probably has puffins on it all right shall we make for it no cruise round a bit begged jack lets have a look at a few of the islands here there is quite a colony of them round about they cruised round looking at first this island and then that they came to one that had steep cliffs at the east side then ran down into a kind of valley then up again into cliffs jack put his glasses to his eyes and yelled out excitedly puffins plenty of them can you see them philip i bet the island is full of their burrows lets land here bill therell be masses of birds on the cliffs and hundreds of puffins inland its quite a big island we could probably find good shelter here and water too the cliffs would protect us from both the east and the west what ho for puffin island right said bill he looked all round and about as he guided the boat towards the island there were many other islands not far off but as far as he could see they were inhabited only by birds the sea chopped about between the islands making little rippling waves round puffin island went the boat and philip gave a shout heres a fine place to put the boat in bill see where that channel of water goes into a cleft of the cliff itll be deep there and we can just tie the boat up to a rock well put out the fenders so that she doesnt bump against the rocky sides the boat nosed into the channel as philip said the water was deep there it was a natural little harbour there was a ledge of rock on which they could land could anything be better hurrah for puffin island chapter a little exploring isnt this a gorgeous place said jack as the boat glided gently into the little channel there was just room for it it might be a boathouse made specially for the lucky star bill leapt out on to the rocky ledge which did very well for a landingstage sheer above them on each side rose rocky cliffs rows and rows of birds sat on the ledges and there was a continual coming and going there was also a continual dropping of eggs knocked off by the careless birds one broke near bill and splashed its yellow yolk over his foot good shot he yelled up to the circling birds and the children roared they made the boat fast by tying the mooringrope round a convenient rock the boat bobbed up and down gently as waves ran up the little channel and back tides up now said bill when it goes down there will still be plenty of water in this channel the boat will look much lower down then now is there a way up the cliff from here we dont want to have to walk down the ledge and clamber round the cliff over hundreds of rocks before we get on to the island proper they looked round jack ran up the rocky ledge and then turned and gave a shout hi we can get up here i think there are rocky shelves like rough steps going up the cliff and theres a break in it a bit above we could probably clamber out all right and find ourselves right on the island well you four go and explore said bill id better stay with the boat and see that she doesnt get her sides smashed in against these rocks you look round the island and see if you can spot a sheltered cove somewhere that i can take the boat round to the four children left the boat and followed jack kiki flew on ahead calling like a gull up the rocky ledges went jack they were almost like giant steps roughly hewn by the great wintry seas for century after century as jack said the cliff had a deep cleft in it just there and the children found that they could make their way through it and come out on to the cushions of seapinks beyond it needed a bit of clambering and they were out of breath when they reached the top but it was worth it the sea spread bright blue all round the island the sky looked enormous other islands blue in the distance loomed up everywhere a real colony of them it seemed and their island was in the centre then jack gave such a yell that everyone jumped puffins look hundreds and hundreds of them the children looked to where jack pointed and there among the seapinks and the old heather tufts were the most curiouslooking birds they had ever seen they were dressed in black and white their legs were orange but it was their extraordinary bills that held the childrens attention look at their beaks cried dinah laughing blue at the base and then striped red and yellow but what enormous beaks cried lucyann they remind me a bit of kikis puffins are called sea parrots remarked jack amused to see the crowd of solemnlooking puffins their eyes are so comical said philip they stare at us with such a fixed expression and look at the way they walk so upright the colony of puffins was as good as a pantomime to watch there were hundreds thousands of birds there some stood about watching their crimsonringed eyes fixed seriously on their neighbours others walked about rolling from side to side like a sailor some took off like small aeroplanes eager to get to the sea look whats that one doing asked lucyann as a puffin began to scrape vigorously at the soil sending a shower of it backwards its digging a burrow i should think said dinah they nest underground dont they jack rather i bet this island is almost undermined with their holes and burrows said jack walking forward towards the colony of busy birds come on do lets get near to them kiki keep on my shoulder i wont have you screaming like a railway engine at them and scaring them all away kiki was most interested in the comical puffins she imitated their call exactly arrrrr they said in deep guttural voices arrrrrrrr arrrrrr answered kiki at once and various birds looked up at her enquiringly to the childrens huge delight the puffins were not in the least afraid of them they did not even walk away when the children went near they allowed them to walk among them and although one aimed a peck at philips leg when he stumbled and almost fell on top of it not one of the others attempted to jab with their great beaks this is lovely said lucyann standing and gazing at the extraordinary birds simply lovely i never thought birds could be so tame theyre not exactly tame said jack theyre wild but they are so little used to human beings that they have no fear of us at all the puffins were all among the cushions of bright seapinks as the children walked along their feet sometimes sank right down through the soil the burrows were just below and their weight caused the earth to give way its absolutely mined with their burrows said philip and i say its not a very nice smell just about here is it it certainly wasnt the boys soon got used to it but the girls didnt like it pooh said lucyann wrinkling up her nose its getting worse and worse i vote we dont put our tents up too near this colony of puffins its as bad as being near a pigsty dont make a fuss said jack hey come here kiki but kiki had flown down to make friends the puffins gazed at her fixedly and solemnly arrrrr said kiki politely arrrrrrrr god save the king arrrrr replied a puffin and walked up to kiki rolling from side to side like a small sailor the two looked at one another i shall expect kiki to say howdoyoudo in a minute said dinah with a little squeal of laughter they both look so polite polly put the kettle on said kiki arrrrr said the puffin and waddled off to its hole kiki followed but apparently there was another puffin down the hole who did not want kikis company for there was soon an agonised squeal from the parrot who shot out of the hole much more rapidly than she had gone in she flew up to jacks shoulder poor kiki what a pity what a pity well you shouldnt poke your hose in everywhere said jack and took a step forward he trod on a tuft of seapinks which immediately gave way and he found his leg going down into quite a deep burrow whoever lived in it didnt like his leg at all and gave it a vicious nip ooooch said jack sitting down suddenly and rubbing his leg look at that a bit right out of my calf they went on through the amazing puffin colony there were puffins on the ground in the air and on the sea too arrrrr arrrrr arrrr their deep calls sounded everywhere ill be able to take some magnificent photographs said jack happily its a pity its too early for young ones to be about i dont expect there are any puffin eggs yet either the puffins were living mainly in the green little valley between the two high cliffs philip looked about to see if there was any good place to pitch their tents i suppose we all want to make puffin island our headquarters he said i imagine that nothing will drag jack away from here now hes got cliffs where guillemots and gannets nest and a valley where the puffins live so i suppose hes happy oh yes said jack well stay here this shall be our island well share it with the puffins well well find a good place for our tents said philip then well bring our goods and chattels here and camp wed better find a place where theres a stream though if there is one on this island we shall want water to drink and lets look for a cove where we can put the boat we cant very well leave it in that narrow channel look theres a dear little cove down there said dinah suddenly pointing to the sea we could bathe there and the boat would be quite all right there too lets go and tell bill ill go said philip jack wants to stare at the puffins a bit more i can see ill take the boat round to the cove with bill and you two girls can find a good place for our tents then well all help to bring the things there from the boat he ran off quickly to find bill and tell him where to put the boat jack sat down with kiki to watch the puffins the girls went to look for a good place to put up their tents for the night they wandered over the island beyond the puffin colony just at the end of it before they came to the high cliffs at the other side of the island was a little dell a few stunted birch trees grew there and banks of heather this is just the place said dinah pleased we can put up our tents here be sheltered from the worst of the wind watch the puffins go down to bathe when we want to and when were tired of that go cruising round the other islands a very nice life said lucyann with a laugh now is there any water about there was no stream at all on the island but dinah found something that would do equally well at least she hoped it would look here she called to lucyann heres an enormous rock with a hollow in its middle filled with water ive tasted it and it isnt salt lucyann came up followed by jack dinah dipped in her hand scooped up a palmful of water and drank it was sweet and as pure as could be rainwater said dinah pleased now well be all right so long as it doesnt dry up in this hot weather come on lets go back to the boat and collect all the things we want well have to do a bit of hard work now well wait here a bit said jack coming up with kiki i expect bill and philip will be bringing the boat round to the cove over there then well go and tell them weve found a good place and help to bring the things here it was not long before bill and philip ran into the cove with the boat bill leapt out took the anchor well up the beach and dug it in he saw jack and the girls and waved to them just coming he cried have you found a good place for the tents he and philip soon joined the others and were pleased with the little dell just right said bill well well bring all the things we want from the boat straightaway now so they spent quite a time going to and from the cove laden with goods it did not take quite as long as they feared because there were five of them to do it and even kiki gave a hand or rather a beak and carried a tentpeg she did it really to impress the watching puffins who stared at her seriously as she flew by the peg in her big curved beak arrrrr she called in a puffin voice youre showing off kiki said jack severely youre a conceited bird arrrrr said kiki and dropped the tentpeg on to jacks head it was fun arranging their new home the boys and bill were to have one tent the girls were to have the other behind the tents lucyann found a ledge of rock and below it was a very large dry space just the spot for storing everything in said lucyann proudly jack bring the tins here and the extra clothes theres room for heaps of things oh we are going to have a lovely time here chapter huffin and puffin isnt it about time we had a meal complained jack staggering over with a great pile of things in his arms it makes my mouth water to read spam and best tinned peaches and see that milk chocolate bill looked at his watch and then at the sun my word it certainly is time the sun is setting already how the time has flown it wasnt long before they were all sitting peacefully on tufts of seapink and heather munching biscuits and potted meat and looking forward to a plate of tinned peaches each bill had brought bottles of gingerbeer from the boat and these were voted better than boiling a kettle to make tea or cocoa it was very warm indeed i feel so happy said lucyann looking over the island to the deepblue sea beyond i feel so very very far away from everywhere honestly i hardly believe there is such a thing as school just at this very minute and this potted meat tastes heavenly philips white rats also thought it did they came out from his clothes at once when they smelt the food one sat daintily upright on his knee nibbling another took his titbit into a dark pocket the third perched on philips shoulder you tickle the lobe of my ear said philip dinah moved as far from him as she could but she was too happy like lucyann to find fault with anything just then they all ate hungrily bill too their eyes fixed on the setting sun and the goldsplashed sea which was now losing its blue and taking on sunset colours lucyann glanced at bill do you like disappearing bill she asked dont you think its fun well for a fortnight yes said bill but im not looking forward to living in these wild islands all alone once youve gone its not my idea of fun id rather live dangerously than like one of these puffins here poor bill said dinah thinking of him left by himself with only books to read and the wireless and nobody to talk to ill leave you my rats if you like offered philip generously no thanks said bill promptly i know your rats theyd have umpteen babies and by the time i left this would be rat island not puffin island besides im not so much in love with the ratandmouse tribe as you are oh look do look suddenly said dinah everyone looked a puffin had left its nearby burrow and was walking solemnly towards them rolling a little from side to side as all the puffins did when they walked its come for its supper then sing puffin sing commanded jack sing for your supper arrrrrrrrr said the puffin deeply everyone laughed the puffin advanced right up to philip it stood close against the boys knee and looked at him fixedly philips spell is working again said lucyann enviously philip what makes all animals and birds want you to be friends with them just look at that puffin its going all goofy over you dont know said philip pleased with his queer new friend he stroked the birds head softly and the puffin gave a little arrrrr of pleasure then philip gave it a bit of pottedmeat sandwich and the bird tossed it off at once and turned for more now i suppose youll be followed round by a devoted puffin said dinah well a puffin is better than three rats any day or mice or that awful hedgehog with fleas that you had or that pair of stagbeetles or spare us dinah spare us begged bill we all know that philip is a walking zoo personally if he likes a goofy puffin he can have it i dont mind a bit its a pity we havent bought a collar and lead the puffin said arrrr again a little more loudly and then walked off perfectly upright its brilliant beak gleaming in the setting sun well you didnt pay us a very long visit old thing said philip quite disappointed the puffin disappeared into its burrow but reappeared again almost immediately with another puffin a little smaller but with an even more brilliant beak darby and joan said jack the two birds waddled side by side to philip the children looked at them in delighted amusement what shall we call them said dinah if they are going to join our little company theyll have to have names funny little puffins huffin and puffin huffin and puffin remarked kiki remembering the words suddenly huffin and yes of course huffin and puffin cried lucyann in delight clever old bird kiki youve been talking about huffin and puffin ever since we started out on our holiday and here they are huffin and puffin as large as life everyone laughed huffin and puffin did seem to be perfectly lovely names for the two birds they came close to philip and to the boys amusement squatted down by him contentedly kiki was not too pleased she eyed them with her head on one side they stared back at her with their crimsonringed eyes kiki looked away and yawned theyve outstared kiki said jack it takes a lot to do that the three rats had prudently decided that it was best to keep as far away from huffin and puffin as possible they sat round philips neck gazing down at the two birds then at a movement from huffin they shot down the boys shirt bill stretched himself well i dont know about you kids but im tired he said the sun is already dipping itself into the west lets clear up and turn in well have a lovely day tomorrow bathing and sunning ourselves and watching the birds im getting used to their eternal chorus of cries now at first i was almost deafened the girls cleared up lucyann dipped a bowl into the clear pool of water and handed it round for washing in we oughtnt to wash in that pool ought we bill she said seriously good gracious no said bill it would be absolutely black after the boys had gone in well keep it for drinkingwater only or just take our water from it when we want it for boiling or washing i think ill go and have a dip now said jack getting up no not in the rockpool lucyann so dont look so upset ill go down to the little cove where the boat is coming philip right said philip and pushed huffin and puffin away from his knees move up you im not growing here ill come too said bill and knocked out the pipe he had been smoking i feel dirty you girls want to come no said lucyann ill get the rugs and things ready for you in the tents dinah didnt want to go either for she felt very tired measles had certainly taken some of the energy out of the two girls they stayed behind whilst the others set off to the cove to bathe the valley sloped right down to the sea just there and the small sandy cove was just right for bathing the boys and bill threw off their things and plunged into the sea it felt lovely and warm and rippled over their limbs like silk lovely said bill and began to chase the boys with howls and yells and splashings they eluded him making such a terrific noise that huffin and puffin who had solemnly accompanied philip all the way half walking and half flying retreated a little way up the beach they stared at the boys fixedly and thoughtfully philip saw them and was pleased surely nobody had ever had two puffins for pets before the girls were setting out groundsheets and rugs neatly in the two tents when dinah suddenly stopped and listened lucyann listened too what is it she whispered and then she heard the noise herself an aeroplane again surely the girls went out of the tent and looked all over the sky trying to locate the sound there there look cried lucyann excitedly and she pointed westwards cant you see it oh dinah whats it doing dinah couldnt spot the plane she tried and tried but she could not see the point in the sky where the aeroplane flew somethings falling out of it said lucyann straining her eyes oh where are the boys fieldglasses quick get them dinah dinah couldnt find them lucyann stood watching the sky her eyes screwed up something dropped slowly from it she said something white i saw it whatever could it have been i hope the aeroplane wasnt in any trouble bill will know said dinah i expect he and the boys saw it all right maybe they took the glasses with them i couldnt find them anywhere soon there was no more to be seen or heard of the plane and the girls went on with their work the tents looked very comfortable with the piles of rugs it was such a hot night that dinah fastened the tentflaps right back in order to get some air that storm doesnt seem to have come she said looking at the western sky to see if any big clouds were sweeping up but it still feels very thundery here are the others said lucyann as she saw jack philip and bill coming up from the shore and huffin and puffin are still with them oh di wont it be fun if we have two pet puffins i wouldnt mind puffins said dinah but i cant bear those rats hallo bill did you hear the aeroplane good gracious no was there one demanded bill with great interest where how was it we didnt hear it we were making such a row said jack grinning we shouldnt have heard a hundred aeroplanes it was funny said lucyann to bill i was watching the aeroplane when i saw something falling out of it something white bill stared frowning intently a parachute he said could you see no it was too far away said lucyann it might have been a parachute or a puff of smoke i dont know but it did look as if something was falling slowly from the plane why do you look so serious bill because ive a feeling theres something well just a bit queer about these planes said bill i think ill pop down to the motorboat and send a message through on the wireless maybe its nothing at all but it just might be important chapter bill goes off on his own he went off down the valley to the cove where the motorboat was moored his feet sank deeply into the soft earth the children stared after him lucy looked solemn as solemn as huffin and puffin who were leaning against philip standing upright their big beaks looking heavy and clumsy oh dear what does bill mean surely were not going to tumble into an adventure again up here where theres nothing but the sea the wind and the birds what could happen i wonder well bill isnt likely to tell us much said philip so dont bother him with questions im going to turn in brrrrrr its getting a bit cold now me for that big pile of rugs huffin and puffin youd better keep outside for the night therell be little enough room in this tent for you as well as us three kiki and the rats huffin and puffin looked at one another then with one accord they began to scrape the earth just outside the tent sending the soil up behind them lucyann giggled theyre going to make a burrow as near you as possible philip oh arent they funny kiki walked round to examine what the two puffins were doing she got a shower of earth all over her and was very indignant arrrrrrr she growled and the two puffins agreed politely arrrrrrrr bill came back in about half an hour all the children were cuddled up in their rugs and lucyann was asleep dinah called out to him everything all right bill yes i got a message from london to tell me that your mother is getting on as well as can be expected said bill but shes got measles pretty badly apparently good thing youre all off her hands what about your own message bill about the aeroplane said dinah who was very curious over bills great interest in it did that get through yes said bill shortly it did its nothing to worry your head about good night dinah in two minutes time everyone was asleep squeaker and his relations were only to be seen as bumps about philips person kiki was sitting on jacks tummy though he had already pushed her off several times huffin and puffin were squatting in their newmade tunnel their big coloured beaks touching everything was very peaceful as the moon slid across the sky making a silvery path on the restless waters the morning dawned bright and beautiful and it seemed as if the storm was not coming for there was no longer any closeness in the air instead it was fresh and invigorating the children ran down to the shore to bathe as soon as they got up they ran so fast that huffin and puffin could not keep up but had to fly they went into the water with the children and bobbed up and down looking quite ridiculous then they dived for fish swimming with their wings under the water they were very quick indeed and soon came up with fish in their enormous beaks what about giving us one for breakfast huffin called philip and tried to take a fish from the nearest puffins beak but it held on to it and then swallowed it whole you ought to teach them to catch fish for us said jack giggling we could have grilled fish for breakfast then hey get away puffin thats my foot not a fish at breakfast they discussed their plans for the day what shall we do lets explore the whole island and give bits of it proper names this glen where we are now is sleepy hollow because its where we sleep said lucyann and the shore where we bathe is splash cove said dinah and where we first moored our motorboat is hidden harbour bill had been rather silent at breakfast jack turned to him bill what do you want to do will you come and explore the island with us well said bill very surprisingly if you dont mind as youll be very busy and happy on your own ill take the motorboat and go cruising about a bit round all these islands you know what without us said dinah in astonishment well come with you then if you want to do that im going alone this first time said bill take you another time old thing but today ill go alone is there is there anything up asked jack feeling that something wasnt quite right has something happened bill not that i know of said bill cheerfully i just want to go off on my own a bit thats all and if i do a bit of exploring round on my own account i shall know the best places to take you to shant i all right bill said jack still puzzled you do what you want its your holiday too even if it is a disappearing one so bill went off on his own that day and the children heard the purr of the motorboat as it went out to sea and then set off apparently to explore all the islands round about bills up to something said philip and i bet its got to do with those aeroplanes i wish hed tell us but he never will talk i hope he comes back safely said lucyann anxiously it would be awful to be stranded here on a birdisland and nobody knowing where we were gosh so it would said jack i never thought of that cheer up lucyann bill isnt likely to run into danger hes got his head screwed on all right the day passed happily the children went to the cliffs and watched the great companies of seabirds there they sat down in the midst of the puffin colony and watched the queer bigbeaked birds going about their daily business lucyann wore a hanky tied round her nose she couldnt bear the smell of the colony but the others soon got used to the heavy sourness of the air and anyway the wind blew strongly huffin and puffin did not leave them they walked or ran with the children they flew round them and they went to bathe with them kiki was half jealous but having had one hard jab from huffins multicoloured beak she kept at a safe distance and contented herself with making rude remarks blow your nose how many times have i told you to wipe your feet you bad boy huffin and puffin all the time pop goes huffin the children sat in sleepy hollow after their tea and watched for bill to come back the sun began to set lucyann looked pale and worried where was bill hell be along soon dont worry said philip well hear his boat presently but the sun went down into the sea and still there was no bill then darkness closed down on the island and there was no longer any point in sitting up and waiting it was four anxious children who went into their tents and lay down to sleep but none of them could sleep a wink in the end the girls went into the boys tent and sat there talking then suddenly they heard a welcome sound rrrrrrrrrr they all leapt up at once and rushed from the tent thats bill it must be wheres a torch come on down to the cove they stumbled through the puffin colony waking up many a furious bird they got to the beach just as bill came walking up they flung themselves on him in delight bill dear bill what happened to you we honestly thought youd got lost oh bill we shant let you go off alone again sorry to have worried you so said bill but i didnt want to return in the daylight in case i was spotted by an aeroplane i had to wait till it was dark though i knew youd be worried still here i am but bill arent you going to tell us anything cried dinah why didnt you want to come back in daylight who would see you and why would it matter well said bill slowly theres something queer going on up here in these lonely waters i dont know quite what id like to find out i didnt see a soul today anywhere though i nosed round umpteen islands not that i really expected to because nobody would be fool enough to come up here for something secret and let anything of it be seen still i thought i might find some sign i suppose that bit of orange peel was a sign that someones here besides ourselves on some other island said lucyann remembering the piece that had bobbed against her fingers but what are they doing surely they cant do much in this desolate stretch of waters with nothing but islands of birds around thats what im puzzled about said bill cant be smuggling because the coasts of the mainland are very well patrolled at the moment and nothing could get through then what is it bill youre sure nobody saw you asked dinah anxiously there might be hidden watchers on one of the islands you know and one might see you without you seeing him thats true said bill but i had to risk that its not very likely though the risk of anyone coming to these islands and disturbing whatever secret game is going on is very remote and i dont think there would be sentinels posted anywhere still you might have been seen or heard persisted dinah oh bill and you were supposed to be disappearing completely now perhaps your enemies have spotted you they would hardly be the same enemies that ive disappeared from said bill with a laugh i dont think anyone else would recognise me here seen at a distance in a motorboat in any case they would just think i was a birdman or a naturalist of some kind who likes the solitude of these seas they were soon back in their tents again happy to have bill with them in safety the stars shone down from a clear sky huffin and puffin shuffled down their burrow glad that their new family had gone to rest they did not approve of these night walks lucyann lay and worried i can feel an adventure coming its on the way oh dear and i did think this would be the very very last place for one lucyann was quite right an adventure was on the way and had very nearly arrived chapter what happened in the night the next morning everything seemed all right the children had forgotten their fears of the night before and bill joked and laughed as merrily as the others but all the same he was worried and when an aeroplane appeared and flew two or three times over the islands he made the children lie down flat in the middle of the puffin colony where they happened to be at that moment i dont think our tents can be seen he said i hope not anyway dont you want anyone to know were here bill asked jack no said bill shortly not at present anyway if you hear a plane bob down and we wont light a fire to boil a kettle well have gingerbeer or lemonade instead the day passed happily enough it was very hot again and the children went to bathe half a dozen times lying in the sun to dry afterwards kiki was jealous of huffin and puffin because they could go into the water with the children she stood on the sandy beach her toes sinking in shouting loudly pollys got a cold send for the doctor atishoooooo isnt she an idiot said jack and splashed her she was most annoyed and walked a bit further back poor kiki what a pity poor pity what a kiki yes what a kiki shouted jack and dived under the water to catch bills legs they took a good many photographs and huffin and puffin posed beautifully staring straight at the camera in a most solemn manner i almost feel theyll suddenly put their arms round one another said jack as he clicked the camera thank you huffin and puffin very nice indeed but i wish youd smile next time kiki get out of the way and leave that tentpeg alone youve already pulled up three that night the sky was full of clouds and the sun could not be seen looks as if that storm might be coming soon said bill i wonder if our tents will be all right well theres nowhere else to go said jack sleepy hollow is about the most sheltered place on this island and as far as ive seen there are no caves or anything of that sort perhaps the storm will blow over said philip phew its hot i really think i must have one last bathe youve had eight already today said dinah i counted darkness came earlier that night because of the clouds the children got into their rugs yawning i think said bill looking at the luminous face of his wristwatch i think ill slip along to the boat and send a message or two on my transmitter i might get some news too for myself you go to sleep i shant be long right said the boys sleepily bill slipped out of the tent the girls were already asleep and did not hear him go philip fell asleep almost before bill was out of the tent jack lay awake a few minutes longer and pushed kiki off his middle for the fifth time she went and stood on philips middle and waited for a lump to come near her feet which she knew would be one of the tame rats when one did venture near raising a little mound under the rug kiki gave a sharp jab at it philip awoke with a yell you beast kiki jack take her away shes given me an awful peck in my middle if i could see her id smack her on her beak kiki retired outside the tent till the boys were asleep again she flew to the top of it and perched there wide awake meanwhile bill was in the cabin of the boat tuning in on the wireless but because of the coming storm it was difficult to hear anything but atmospherics blow said bill at last i shant get my messages through at this rate ive a good mind to take the boat to the little channel what is it the children call it hidden harbour maybe i could get the wireless going better there its so sheltered it was very important to bill to be able to use the wireless that night he set the engine of the boat going and was soon on his way to hidden harbour he nosed in carefully and moored the boat then he set to work on his wireless again after a while he thought he heard some noise out to sea a noise getting nearer and nearer bill turned off his wireless and listened but the wind was getting up and he heard nothing but that he turned the knobs again listening intently for any message he had got one through and now he had been told to stand by and wait for an important announcement from headquarters the wireless fizzed and groaned and whistled bill waited patiently then suddenly hearing a sound he looked up startled half expecting to see one of the boys coming down into the cabin but it wasnt it was a hardfaced man with a curious crooked nose who was staring down at him as bill turned and showed his face the man uttered a cry of the utmost astonishment you what are you doing here what do you know of bill leapt up but at the same moment the man lunged out at him with a thick fat knobbly stick he held in his hand and poor bill went down like a ninepin he struck his head against the edge of the wireless and slid to the floor his eyes closed the man with the crooked nose whistled loudly another man came to the small cabin and looked in see that said the first man pointing to bill bit of a surprise eh to find him up here do you suppose he guessed anything must have if hes here said the second man who had a short thick beard hiding a very cruel mouth tie him up hell be useful well make him talk bill was tied up like a trussed chicken he did not open his eyes the men carried him out and took him into a small boat moored beside the lucky star it was a rowingboat into it went poor bill and the men undid their rope ready to row back to their own motorboat which lay perfectly silent a little way beyond the island do you suppose theres anyone else with him asked the man with the crooked nose there was noone on board but him no when the boat was sighted yesterday we only saw one man aboard and it was him all right said the man with the beard if thered been anyone else wed have seen them hes all alone ho he didnt know he was being watched back here last night i suppose there really isnt anyone else here said the first man who seemed very reluctant to go hadnt we better smash up the boat just in case all right and the wireless too said the man with the beard he found a hammer and soon there were crashing sounds as the engine of the motorboat was damaged and the beautiful little wireless was smashed to bits then the men set off in their rowingboat with the unconscious bill soon the purring of the motorboat getting fainter and fainter sounded in the night but nobody on puffin island heard it except kiki and the seabirds the children had no idea at all that bill had not returned that night they slept peacefully hour after hour dreaming of huffins and puffins big waves and golden sands jack awoke first kiki was nibbling at his ear blow you kiki said jack pushing the parrot away oh goodness heres huffin and puffin too so they were they waddled over to philip and stood patiently by his sleeping face arrrrrrr said huffin lovingly philip awoke he saw huffin and puffin and grinned he sat up and yawned hallo jack he said bill up already looks like it said jack probably gone to bathe he might have waked us up though come on lets wake the girls and go and bathe too soon all four were speeding to the sea expecting to see bill in the water but he wasnt where is he then said lucyann puzzled and good gracious wheres the boat yes where was the boat there was no sign of it of course the children stared at the cove puzzled and dismayed he must have taken it round to hidden harbour said jack perhaps the wireless wouldnt work or something it still feels stormy and that might have upset it well lets go to hidden harbour then said philip perhaps bill got sleepy down there in the boat and thought hed snuggle up in the cabin hes probably there said dinah fast asleep too lets go and give him a shock well halloo down into the cabin and make him jump the sleepyhead oh i do hope hes there said lucyann shivering as much with worry as with cold they dressed quickly shivering a little for the sun was hidden behind angrylooking clouds i do hope the weather isnt going to break up just as weve begun such a lovely holiday said dinah oh huffin im sorry but you got right under my feet did i knock you over the puffin didnt seem to mind having dinah tread on it it shook out its wings said arrrrr and hurried on after puffin who was trying to keep pace with philip they went across the puffin colony and came to the cleft in the cliffs there below them lay the motorboat swaying very gently as waves ran up under her and then ran back again there she is said dinah in delight bill did take her round to the harbour hes not on deck said jack he must be in the cabin come on lets call him said lucyann suddenly do lets i want to know if hes there and before the others could stop her she shouted at the top of her voice bill oh bill are you there no bill came out from the cabin and for the first time a little uneasiness crept into the childrens minds bill yelled jack making everyone jump violently bill come on out no sound from the boat suddenly panicstricken all four children stumbled down the rocky ledges to the boat they jumped on board and peered down into the little cabin hes not there said dinah scared well where is he then he must be somewhere about as the boat is still here said jack sensibly hell come along soon maybe hes exploring somewhere on the island they were just turning away when philip caught sight of something he stopped and clutched jack turning very pale what said jack frightened whats up silently philip pointed to the wireless smashed he said in a whisper smashed to bits who did it lucyann began to cry jack went up on deck and had a look around feeling sick and upset then philip gave an anguished howl from the cabin that sent the others running to his side look the engine of the boat is smashed up too absolutely destroyed my goodness whats been happening here and where is bill said dinah in a husky whisper gone kidnapped said philip slowly someone came for him in the night they dont know were here i suppose they just thought bill was alone theyve got him and now were prisoners on puffin island and we cant get away chapter a few plans everyone felt suddenly sick lucyann sat down in a heap dinah joined her the boys stood staring at the smashed engine as if they couldnt believe their eyes it must be a nightmare said dinah at last it cant be true why why everything was right as rain last night and now now the boats smashed up so that we cant get away the wireless is smashed so that we cant get a message through and bills gone said philip and it isnt a dream its real lets sit down in the cabin all together said lucyann wiping her eyes lets sit close and talk lets not leave each other at all poor lucyann said philip putting his arm round her as she sat down unsteadily dont worry weve been in worse fixes than this we havent said dinah this is the worst fix weve ever been in kiki felt the tenseness of all the children she sat quietly on jacks shoulder making little comforting noises huffin and puffin sat solemnly on the deck staring fixedly in front of them even they seemed to feel that something awful had happened in the cabin sitting close together the children felt a little better jack rummaged in a tiny cupboard beside him and brought out some bars of chocolate the children had had no breakfast and although the shock they had had seemed to have taken their appetites away they thankfully took the chocolate to nibble lets try and think out carefully exactly what must have happened said jack giving a bit of his chocolate to kiki well we know that bill was worried about something said philip those planes for instance he felt certain something queer was going on up here and thats why he went out by himself in the boat he must have been seen yes and maybe in some way his enemies got to know he was here said dinah they could have followed him a long way back using field glasses to keep him in sight anyway its quite clear that they came looking for him here and found him said jack what a pity he went off to tinker with the wireless last night well if he hadnt the enemy whoever they are would probably have searched the island and found us too said dinah as it is they probably dont know were here it wouldnt matter if they did know said lucyann sniffing theyll be quite sure we cant do any harm living on an island we cant get off they got here in a motorboat probably went on jack left the motorboat out beyond somewhere and slipped inshore quietly in a rowingboat they must know this little channel or maybe they saw a light from the boat bill would be sure to have the cabin light on and its a pretty bright one yes and they surprised him and knocked him out i suppose said philip gloomily theyve taken him away goodness knows whatll happen to him they wont they wont hurt him will they said lucyann in rather a trembly voice nobody answered lucyann began to cry again cheer up lucyann said philip weve been in worse scrapes before whatever dinah says well get out of this one all right how wept lucyann i dont see how we can you dont either philip didnt he scratched his head and looked at jack well weve got to make some kind of plan said jack i mean we must make up our minds what we are going to do to try and escape and what we are going to do till we escape wont bills friends come and look for us when they dont get bills messages through asked dinah suddenly pooh what would be the good of that said philip at once there are hundreds of these little birdislands here it might take years visiting and exploring every single one to find us we could light a fire on the cliff and keep it burning so that any searcher could see the smoke in the daytime and the flames at night said dinah excitedly you know like shipwrecked sailors do yes we could said jack only the enemy might see it too and come along and find us before anyone else does there was a silence nobody knew who the enemy were they seemed mysterious and powerful and frightening well i cant help it i think we ought to follow dinahs plan and light a fire said philip at last weve got to run the risk of the enemy seeing it and coming to find us but we simply must do something to help anyone searching for us we can keep a lookout for the enemy and hide if they come hide where can we hide asked dinah scornfully there isnt a single place on this island for anyone to hide no thats true said jack no caves no trees except for those few little birches and the cliffs too steep to explore we really are in a fix cant we do anything to help bill asked lucyann dolefully i keep on and on thinking of him so do i said jack but i dont see that we can do much to help ourselves let alone bill now if we could escape from here or wireless for help and get some of bills friends along it would be something but there doesnt seem anything at all to do except stay here and wait theres plenty of food anyway said dinah stacks of tinned stuff and biscuits and potted meat and nestles milk and sardines i think wed better strip the boat of them said jack im surprised the enemy didnt take what they could with them maybe theyll come back for them so well take them first we can hide them down some of the puffin burrows lets have a bit of breakfast now said philip feeling better now that they had all talked the matter over and made a few plans open some tins and get some gingerbeer come on they all felt better still when they had had something to eat and drink they had put a cover over the poor smashed wireless they couldnt bear to look at it jack went up on deck when they had finished their meal it was very close again and even the wind seemed warm the sun shone through a thin veiling of cloud and had a reddish hue that storm is still about said jack come on everyone lets get to work before it comes it was decided that philip and dinah should hunt for driftwood to make a fire up on the cliff we dont know that those aeroplanes we sometimes see belong to the enemy said philip if they dont they may see our signal and come to circle round then they will send help one might come today even so well get a fire alight well bank it with dry seaweed that will smoulder well and send up plenty of smoke jack and lucy were to carry things from the boat to the tents in sleepy hollow take all the tins and food you can said philip if the enemy happened to come back at night and take it wed be done we should starve as it is weve got heaps to last us for weeks the four children worked very hard indeed jack and lucy carried sacks of tins from the boat to sleepy hollow for the time being they bundled them in a heap by the tents kiki examined them with interest and pecked at one or two its a good thing your beak isnt a tinopener kiki said jack making the first little joke that day to try and make lucyann smile we shouldnt have much food left if it was philip and dinah were also very busy they took a sack each from the boat and wandered along the shore to pick up bits of wood they found plenty at the tideline and filled their sacks then they dragged them to the top of the cliff huffin and puffin went with them solemn as ever sometimes walking sometimes flying philip emptied his sack of wood on a good spot he began to build a fire dinah went off to fill her sack with dry seaweed there was plenty soon jack and lucyann emptying their own sacks in sleepy hollow saw a spire of smoke rising up from the clifftop look said jack theyve got it going already good work the wind bent the smoke over towards the east it was good thick smoke and the children felt sure that it could be seen from quite a distance one of us had always better be up here feeding the fire and keeping watch for enemies or friends said philip how shall we know which they are asked dinah throwing a stick on the fire well i suppose we shant know said philip what wed better do if we see any boat coming is to hide that is if we can find anywhere to hide and then try and discover if the searchers are enemies or friends we are sure to hear them talking wed better get lots more wood di this fire will simply eat it up lucyann and jack helped them when they had finished their own job weve taken every single tin and every scrap of food out of the boat said lucyann we really have got plenty to eat and that rockpool to drink from when weve finished the gingerbeer there arent an awful lot of bottles left now wouldnt you like to have dinner soon yes im jolly hungry said philip lets have it up here shall we or is it too much bother to fetch a meal here lucyann you see one of us must keep the fire going all the time well it wont go out for a while anyhow said lucyann bank it up with some more seaweed honestly we feel fagged out carrying all that stuff lets go to sleepy hollow and have a good rest and a jolly good meal so they all returned to sleepy hollow where the two tents flapped in the little breeze they sat down and lucyann opened tins and ladled the contents on to plates youve got tinned salmon biscuits and butter tinned tomatoes and tinned pears she said even huffin and puffin came closer than usual to share such a nice meal they would have eaten every scrap of the salmon if they could kiki preferred the tinned pears but the children would only allow her one well things would be a lot worse if we hadnt got all this nice food said jack leaning back in the warm sun after a big meal an adventure without good food would be awful kiki take your head out of that tin youve had more than any of us you greedy glutton of a parrot chapter a really terrible storm the wind got up about five oclock it whipped the waves round the island until they towered into big white horses that raced up the beaches and broke with a sound of thunder the seabirds deserted the coves and flew into the air crying loudly the wind took them and they soared for miles without beating a wing enjoying themselves thoroughly kiki didnt like so much wind she could not glide or soar like the gulls and guillemots it offended her dignity to be blown about too much so she stayed close to the tents which flapped like live things in the wind and strained at the tentpegs violently look here we cant possibly watch the fire all night said philip well have to bank it up and hope for the best maybe it will send out a glow anyway doesnt that seaweed keep it in nicely my goodness the wind tears the smoke to rags now the sun went down in a bank of angry purple clouds that gathered themselves together in the west jack and philip stared at them thats the storm coming up all right said jack well weve felt one coming for days this hot weather was bound to end up like that i hope the wind wont blow our tents away in the night so do i said philip anxiously honestly theres a perfect gale blowing up now look at those awful clouds they look really wicked the boys watched the clouds covering the sky making the evening dark much sooner than usual philip put his hand into one of his pockets my rats know there is a storm coming he said theyre all huddled up in a heap together right at the very bottom of my pocket funny how animals know things like that jack called lucyann anxiously do you think the tents are safe the wind is blowing them like anything the boys went to examine them they were as well pegged as they could be but in this gale who knew what might happen we just cant do anything about it but hope for the best said jack rather gloomily philip have you got your torch wed better be prepared to be disturbed in the night if this gale goes on we might have to repeg one of the tents both boys had torches with new batteries so that was all right they put them down beside their beds when they cuddled up into their rugs that night they all went early because for one thing it was getting very dark for another thing it had begun to rain heavily and for a third thing they were all very tired with the days work kiki retired with the boys as usual and huffin and puffin scuttled into their burrows nearby wonder what poor old bill is doing said jack to philip as the two boys lay listening to the wind howling round them i bet hes worried stiff about us its a shame just as we were all set for a glorious holiday said philip and now the weathers broken too what on earth shall we do with ourselves if it goes on like for this for days it will be frightful oh it may clear up again when the storm is over said jack golly hark at the waves on the beaches round the island and how they must be dashing against those steep cliffs i bet the gannets and guillemots arent getting much sleep tonight the winds pretty deafening too said philip blow it i feel so tired and yet i cant possibly sleep with all this din going on and gosh whats that thunder said jack sitting up the storm is on us now all right lets go into the girls tent philip lucyann will be scared if shes awake a storm over this exposed little island wont be very funny they crept into the other tent the girls were wide awake and very glad to have them beside them dinah squeezed up into lucyanns rugs and the boys got into dinahs warm place jack flashed on his torch he saw that lucyann was very near tears theres nothing to be frightened of old thing he said gently its only a storm and youre never frightened of those lucyann you know you arent i know gulped lucyann its only that well the storm seems so wild and and spiteful somehow it tears at our tent and bellows at us it seems alive jack laughed the thunder came again and crashed more loudly than the waves on the shore kiki crept close to jack pop pop pop she said and put her head under her wing thunder doesnt pop kiki said jack trying to joke but nobody smiled the wind blew more wildly than ever and the children wished they had more rugs it was so very very draughty then the lightning flashed it made them all jump for it was so vivid for an instant the steep cliffs and the raging sea showed vividly then the picture was gone crash the thunder came again this time sounding overhead then the lightning split the sky open again and once more the children saw the cliffs and the sea they didnt seem quite real somehow sort of unearthly said philip gosh hark at the rain im getting spattered all over with it though goodness knows how its getting in here the winds getting worse said lucyann fearfully our tents will blow away they will they will no they wont said jack stoutly taking lucyanns cold hand in his they cant they but at that very moment there came a rending sound a great flapflapflap something hit jack across the face and their tent was gone the four children were struck dumb for a moment the wind howled round them the rain soaked them they had nothing over them to protect them their tent had vanished vanished with the wild wind in the darkness of the night lucyann screamed and clutched jack he put his torch on quickly gosh its gone the gale has taken it away come into our tent quickly but before the children could even get up from their rugs the gale had taken the other tent too it rushed by philip as he stood trying to help the girls up and when he turned his torch to where his tent should be there was nothing ours has gone too he cried trying to outshout the wind whatever are we to do wed better get down to the boat if we possibly can yelled jack or do you think we shall be blown over had we better roll ourselves up in the groundsheets and rugs and wait till the storm has blown itself out no well be soaked better try for the boat said philip he dragged the girls up each of the children wrapped a rug round their shoulders to try and ward off the rain and the cold take hands and keep together yelled philip ill go first they took hands philip set off staggering in the gale that was blowing in his face through the puffin colony he went trying to keep on his feet suddenly dinah who had hold of philips hand felt him drag it away then she heard a cry she called in fright philip philip whats happened there was no answer jack and lucyann came close to dinah whats up wheres philip jacks torch shone out in front of them there was no philip there he had vanished completely the children their hearts beating painfully stayed absolutely still in dismay and astonishment surely the gale hadnt blown him away philip philip yelled jack but only the wind answered him then all three yelled at the top of their voices jack thought he heard a faint answering cry but where it sounded at his feet he swung his torch downwards and to his immense surprise and fright he saw philips head but only his head on a level with the ground dinah shrieked in fright jack knelt down too dumbfounded to say a word just philips head just philips then he saw in a flash what had happened philip had trodden on soil so undermined by the puffins that it had given way and he had fallen right through to a hole below jack could have cried with relief are you all right philip he yelled yes give me your torch ive dropped mine ive fallen through into a whopping big hole there might be room for us all to shelter here for a bit shouted back philip the words being whipped away by the wind almost before jack could hear them jack gave philip his torch the boys head disappeared then it came back again looking very queer sticking up between some heather and a seapink cushion yes its an enormous hole can you all get down wed keep safe and dry here till the storm is over come on its a bit smelly but otherwise not bad dinah slid through the opening of the hole and found herself beside philip then came lucyann and then jack jack had found philips torch and the two torches were now shone around the hole i suppose the rabbits and the puffins together managed to burrow so much that they have made an enormous hole said jack look theres a puffin burrow leading out of it over there and one of the puffins staring in astonishment at us hallo old son sorry to burst in on you like this the relief of finding that philip was safe and of being out of the wild noise of the storm made jack feel quite lighthearted lucyanns sobs stopped and they all looked round them with interest i should think this was a natural cavity of some sort said philip with a layer of good soil held together by roots and things making a surface above but all that burrowing by the puffins made it give way when i trod on it and down i fell well its just what we want for the moment above them deadened by tangled heather and seapinks the storm raged on no rain came into the cavity the thunder sounded very far away the lightning could not be seen i dont see why we shouldnt sleep here for the night said jack spreading out the rug he had taken from his shoulders the soil is dry and soft and the air must be good enough because that puffin is still there gazing at us i say i hope huffin and puffin are all right they all spread out their rugs and lay down cuddled up together congratulations on finding us such a fine home for tonight philip said jack sleepily very clever of you indeed good night everybody chapter next day they all slept soundly in their queer shelter they did not awake until late in the morning because for one thing it was dark in the hole and for another they had been tired out jack awoke first feeling kiki stirring against his neck he could not think where he was a little daylight filtered through the entrance of the hole but not much it was very warm arrrrrrr said a guttural voice and made jack jump arrrrrrr it was the puffin which had come down its burrow to see them the night before jack switched on his torch and grinned at it good morning if it is morning sorry to have disturbed you ill get huffin and puffin to explain to you when we see them again philip woke and sat up then the girls stirred soon they were all wide awake looking round the curious cavity and remembering the events of the night before what a night said dinah shuddering oh when our tents blew away i really did feel awful and when philip disappeared i felt worse said lucyann what time is it jack jack looked at his watch and whistled my word its almost ten oclock how weve slept come on lets see if the storm is still going strong he stood up and pulled away the overhanging heather that blocked up the narrow entrance to the hole at once a shaft of blinding sunlight entered and the children blinked jack put his head out of the hole in delight golly its a perfect day the sky is blue again and theres sunshine everywhere not a sign of the storm left come on lets go up into the sunlight and have a look round up they went giving each other a hand once they wore out of the hole and the heather fell back into place again there was no sign of where they had spent the night wouldnt it make an absolutely marvellous hidingplace said jack the others looked at him the same thought occurring to everyone at once yes and if the enemy comes thats where well go said dinah unless they actually walk over the place they cant possibly find it why i dont know myself where it is now though ive just come out of it gosh dont say weve lost it as soon as weve found it said jack and they looked about for the entrance jack found it in almost the same way as philip had the night before by falling down it he set an upright stick beside it so that they would know the entrance easily next time we might have to sleep down there each night now as our tents have gone said jack its a pity weve brought our rugs up still they can do with a sunning well spread them out on the heather thank goodness that awful winds gone said dinah theres hardly even a breeze today its going to be frightfully hot well bathe they had a dip in the quiet sea which looked quite different from the boiling raging sea of the day before now it was calm and blue and ran up the sand in frilly little waves edged with white after their bathe the children had an enormous breakfast in the spot where their tents had been huffin and puffin appeared as soon as the children arrived and greeted them joyfully arrrrrr arrrrrrr theyre saying that they hope weve got a good breakfast for them said dinah huffin and puffin i wish youd eat rats youd be very useful then philips rats had appeared again now that the storm was over much to dinahs disgust they seemed very lively and one went into jacks pockets to find a sunflower seed it brought one out sat on jacks knee and began to nibble it but kiki pounced at once and snatched the seed away whilst squeaker scurried back to philip in a hurry youre a dog in the manger kiki said jack you dont really want that sunflower seed yourself and you wont let squeaker have it either fie fie fo fum said kiki promptly and went off into a screech of laughter right in jacks ear he pushed her off his shoulder i shall be deaf for the rest of the day lucyann look out for that potted meat huffin is much too interested in it really what with kiki pinching fruit out of the tin and huffin and puffin wanting the potted meat and philips rats sniffing round its a wonder weve got anything ourselves said lucyann but all the same it was fun to have the creatures joining in and being one with them huffin and puffin were especially comical that morning for now that they were really friendly they wanted to look into everything huffin suddenly took an interest in dinahs fork and picked it up with his beak oh dont swallow that silly cried dinah and tried to get her fork away but huffin had a very strong beak and he won the tug of war he waddled away to examine the fork in peace he wont swallow it dont worry said philip tossing dinah his own fork itll keep him quiet a bit if he plays with it for a while the childrens fire was of course completely out it had to be pulled to pieces and lighted all over again this was not so easy as before because everything had been soaked during the night still the sun was so very hot that it wouldnt be long before the wood and the seaweed were bonedry again the children missed out dinner completely that day because it had been twelve oclock before they had cleared up their breakfast things well have a kind of high tea about five said jack weve plenty to do look for our tents light the fire find some more wood and go and see if the motor boat is all right their tents were nowhere to be seen one or two pegs were found but that was all the tents are probably lying on some island miles and miles away said jack scaring the seabirds there well shall we sleep in that hole tonight oh no please dont lets begged lucyann its smelly and its so very hot again now that surely we could put our rugs on cushions of heather and sleep out in the open i should like that philip looked up at the clear blue sky not a cloud was to be seen well he said if its like this tonight it would be quite comfortable to sleep in the open well plan to do that unless the weather changes lets find a nice cushiony place and put our rugs there and our other clothes with the groundsheets over them good thing the groundsheets only blew up against those birchtrees and got stuck there they found a nice heathery place not too far from where lucyann kept the stores beneath the big ledge of stone and piled their extra jerseys their mackintoshes their rugs and their groundsheets there lucyann had stored their spare clothes with the food under the ledge but the rain had driven in and had made them damp so it was decided that it would be better to use them as extra bedclothes at night and keep them under the groundsheets during the daytime after they had done all this they went to see their fire which was burning well now they sat on the top of the cliff with the birds crying all round them and looked out on the calm brilliantlyblue sea whats that said lucyann suddenly pointing to something floating not far off looks like a heap of wood or something said philip wreckage of some sort hope it comes inshore we can use it for our fire it came slowly in with the tide philip put his glasses to his eyes then he lowered them again looking so takenaback that the others were scared do you know he said that wreckage looks awfully like bits of the lucky star and theres more bits over there look and i daresay we should find some down on the rocks there was a shocked silence nobody had even thought that the motorboat might have been taken by the storm and battered jack swallowed hard that would be a blow he got up come on wed better go and see of course it was bound to be smashed up but we couldnt have moved it gosh what bad luck if the boats gone even if the engine was smashed it was still a boat we might have rigged up a sail or something in silence the children left the fire on the cliff and made their way through the cleft and down the rocky ledges to the little harbour there was no boat there only a bit of the mooring rope was left still round the rock nearby its ragged ends fluttering in the tiny breeze look said jack pointing she must have been battered up and down by great waves rushing in and out of the channel see the paint on the rocks and look at the bits of wood about when the rope broke she must have been taken right out of the channel and then beaten to bits against the cliffs what a frightful shame the girls had tears in their eyes and philip had to turn away too such a lovely boat now she was nothing but masses of wreckage which they could burn on their fire poor lucky star unlucky star should have been her name well nothing we could have done would have helped said jack at last the storm would have wrecked her anyway though if bill had been here and the boat was all right he would have taken her round to splash cove and we could have dragged her right up the beach out of reach of the waves it wasnt our fault they all felt sad and downcast as they left the little harbour and went back the sun was going down now and the evening was very peaceful and beautiful there was hardly any wind at all i can hear an aeroplane again said lucyann her sharp ears picking up the distant throbbing before the others hark far away a small speck showed low down in the blue sky the boys clapped their glasses to their eyes jack gave an exclamation its dropping something look philip what is it is it a parachute it looks like a small parachute with something underneath it swinging to and fro said philip his eyes glued to his glasses is it a man no it doesnt look like a man then what in the world is it and why is the plane dropping things here gosh i wish bill was here to see this there is something queer going on something the enemy are doing i shouldnt be surprised if they get the wind up when they see our smoke and come along to search the island tomorrow one of us must always be on the lookout on the cliff puzzled and anxious the children went back to sleepy hollow it was time for high tea and lucyann and dinah prepared it in silence they were in the middle of an adventure again and they couldnt possibly get out of it chapter a boat a boat do you think its worth while keeping the fire going if the aeroplanes belong to the enemy asked lucyann at last well if were ever to be rescued we shall have to show some kind of signal said jack well have to risk the aeroplanes seeing it perhaps when no messages come through from bill motorboats will come looking for us then they will see our signal and come to the island i hope they do said dinah i dont want to be here for months and it would be awful in the winter good gracious dont talk about being here for the winter said lucyann in alarm why its only may dinahs looking on the black side of things as usual said philip dinah flared up im not im being sensible you always call being sensible looking on the black side of things oh dont quarrel just now when we all ought to stick by each other begged lucyann and dont put those rats near dinah philip dont be mean just now philip snapped his fingers and the rats scurried back to his pockets kiki snorted three blind mice see how they run pop goes kiki arrrrr said huffin agreeing politely it was really very comical the way he and puffin seemed to talk to kiki they never said anything but arrrr but they said it in many different tones and sounded quite conversational at times that night the children slept out in the open it was a beautiful calm night and the stars hung in the sky big and bright lucyann tried to keep awake to watch for shooting stars which she loved but she didnt see any her bed was very comfortable the children had chosen thick heather to put their groundsheets and rugs on and had used their extra clothes for pillows a tiny breeze blew against their cheeks and hair it was lovely lying there with the stars shining peacefully above and the sound of the sea in the distance its like the wind in the trees thought lucyann sleepily and the wind in trees is like the sound of the sea oh dear im getting muddled muddled mud the weather was still lovely the next day and the spire of smoke from the signal fire went almost straight up in the air there was so little wind jack and philip took a good many birdphotographs and jack looked longingly over the steep birdcliff wishing he could climb down a little way and take some photographs of the birds there bill said not said philip and i think we oughtnt to suppose anything happened to us boys what would the girls do weve got heaps of fine photographs without bothering to take the eggs and birds on those ledges i wish the puffins had laid eggs said jack i havent found a single puffin egg yet its a bit too early i suppose how sweet baby puffins must look i wish i could see some well youre likely to as things have turned out said philip with a halfcomical groan we may be here for quite a long time it was arranged that one or other of the children should always be on the lookout somewhere on the birdcliff from there it was possible to see nearly all round the island and no enemy could approach without being seen when still far off that would give plenty of time for the others to be warned and for all of them to go into hiding wed really better hide all the tins and things that are under our ledge down in that hole hadnt we said lucyann when the plans were made they might easily be found well stuff heather round them said jack it would be an awful bore to have to keep going down into the hole to fetch all the food each time we wanted something to eat so clumps of heather were most realistically tucked under the rocky ledge where lucyann kept the tins nobody would guess it wasnt growing it looked so natural there wed have plenty of time to chuck our clothes and things down into the hideyhole if we saw anyone coming said jack ill take first watch i shant be a bit bored because there are so many birds up there and kiki is such a clown with them its as good as a pantomime to watch her two days went by without anything exciting happening at all once they heard another aeroplane but didnt see it more wreckage was thrown up on the beach from the unfortunate lucky star the children bathed and ate and slept and took ft in turns to keep watch but they saw nothing to worry them at all kiki always kept watch with jack huffin and puffin kept watch with philip once another puffin came too near philip for huffins liking and the bird ran at it with his head down growling arrrrrrrr like an infuriated dog their big beaks locked together and philip almost cried with laughter as he watched the curious battle the battle of beaks he called it when he described it to the others afterwards talk about stags locking their antlers together and fighting those two puffins were every bit as fierce with their huge beaks who won asked lucyann with great interest huffin i suppose of course said philip he not only won he chased the other one right into its burrow and they both came out again at another entrance with huffin winning the race im surprised the other poor bird had any feathers left by the time huffin had finished with him on the afternoon of the third day jack was sitting up on the top of the birdcliff it was his turn to look out he gazed lazily out to sea there was just a little more breeze that day and the waves had frills of white as they came in to shore jack was thinking about bill where was he what had happened to him had he been able to escape and if so would he come quickly to rescue the four children and what was aunt allie thinking had she heard that there was no word from bill and was she worried jack thought deeply about all these things listening to the different cries of the seabirds about him and watching their graceful flight over the sea then his eyes suddenly picked out something far off out on the water he stiffened like a dog that suddenly sees something unusual he reached down for his fieldglasses and put them to his eyes he had soon got the something out there into focus and he saw that it was a small motorboat enemies he thought and was about to leap to his feet when he remembered that whoever was in the boat might also have glasses and might see him so he wriggled away on his tummy and not until he was well down into the little valley did he jump up and run to the others hi he called breathlessly as he tore down to sleepy hollow where the others were having a laze theres a boat coming they all sat up at once lucyanns green eyes were wide with excitement and fright where how far away quite a way off it will take them about ten minutes to come in and tie up wed better chuck everything down into the hole at once what about the fire said dinah grabbing her pile of jerseys and coats have to leave that theyve already seen the smoke anyway said jack come on quick get a move on lucyann it didnt take long to part the heather over the narrow entrance to the hole and hurl everything down jack removed the stick he had put there to mark the place no good leaving a signpost for them he said trying to make lucyann smile she gave him a watery grin now everything cleared up said philip looking round he pulled at the clumps of heather they had been lying on which had got rather flattened but the springy plants were already getting back into position themselves philip picked up a spoon that someone had left lying there and popped it into his pocket there really did seem to be nothing left now that would show that the children had been there a few minutes before come on tufty dont wait about said jack in a fever of impatience to get below ground the girls were already safely in the hole jack slid down himself and philip followed almost at once jack pulled the heather neatly over the hole there now unless anybody actually treads in the hole as philip did the other night were safe nobody would ever know there was a big cavity underground i feel like a puffin said philip i feel id like to burrow what about digging a nice little burrow for each of us to lie in oh dont make jokes now begged lucyann i dont feel like jokes i feel i feel all sort of tight and breathless and my heart simply couldnt beat any louder can you hear it nobody could but then their own hearts were beating so fast and so loudly that it was no wonder they could not hear anybody elses can we whisper asked dinah in a loud whisper that made everyone jump i should think so but dont talk out loud said jack and if we hear anyone coming listen with all your might so that we shall know if its friends or enemies it would be too awful if it were friends and we let them go away without finding us that was indeed an awful thought almost worse than the thought of being found by an enemy everyone sat quietly holding their breaths listening with all their might friend or enemy friend or enemy friend or enemy said a voice in lucyanns mind and she couldnt stop it saying the words over and over again friend or sh came jacks whisper suddenly i can hear something but it was only huffin and puffin arriving in the hole they pushed the heather aside and flopped in giving the children a terrible shock the heather swung back and the puffins stared in the darkness trying to find philip you wretched birds scolded philip you might have shown them our hidingplace dont you dare to say a word arrrrrr said huffin deeply philip gave him an angry push and the bird walked away in astonishment it was the first time he had ever had an angry word or gesture from his beloved philip he hopped up to the beginning of a nearby burrow followed by puffin and began to walk up it very much offended the children were glad to hear them go sh came jacks whisper again and the others clutched one another theyre really coming now shhhhhhh chapter the enemy and kiki the thud of footsteps could be felt in the dark hole below ground then came the sound of voices well search the whole place somebody must be keeping that fire going theres nowhere much to hide on this small island said another voice nobody could get down those sheer cliffs so that rules them out an theres obviously nobody in this valley except these ridiculous birds there came the sound of a match being struck one of the men was evidently lighting a cigarette he tossed the match away and it came trickling through the heather into the hole where the trembling children crouched it fell on to dinahs knee and she almost squealed theyre dreadfully near everyone was thinking dreadfully dreadfully near look here said one of the mens voices suddenly whats this a bit of chocolate wrapping paper i bet the hidingplace isnt far off the childrens hearts almost stopped beating philip remembered that a bit of his chocolate paper had blown away on the wind and he hadnt bothered to go and pick it up blow blow blow jack felt about for kiki where was she she had slid off his shoulder but he couldnt feel her anywhere near he did hope she wouldnt suddenly make one of her loud remarks just under the very feet of the men kiki had gone up the burrow after huffin and puffin the two puffins were now staring at the men who had come to hunt they stood at the entrance of a burrow looking fixedly with their crimsoncircled eyes look at those silly chaps said one man whatever are these ridiculous birds with beaks like fireworks about to go off dont know puffins or sea parrots or something said the other man huffin and puffin said kiki in a loud conversational sort of voice the men jumped violently and looked all round kiki was in the burrow behind huffin and puffin and could not be seen she didnt want to push past them in case they nipped her did you hear that said the first man well i thought i heard something said the other but these birds all round make such a racket yes a frightful din said the first man dindindinner announced kiki and went off into one of her cackles of laughter the men stared in alarm at the two solemn puffins i say surely those birds cant talk said one kiki went on laughing and then coughed deeply its a bit queer isnt it said the first man rubbing his chin and staring at huffin and puffin it seemed as if it really must be the two puffins who were talking and coughing kiki could not be seen huffin opened his big beak arrrrrr he said solemnly there said the man i saw him that time they are talking birds sea parrots perhaps and parrots talk dont they yes but they have to be taught said the other and who taught these two oh come on dont lets waste any time on the ridiculous creatures said the first man turning to go well go down to the shore and walk along it to make sure theres no one there pity that boats been smashed up in the gale we could have taken off some of the food in it kiki gave an imitation of a motorbike in the distance and the men stopped suddenly in astonishment i could have sworn that was a motorbike said one with a halfashamed laugh come on were hearing things wait till i get hold of whoever is on this island making us waste time hunting like this to the childrens enormous relief the mens voices got fainter and fainter and at last could not be heard at all kiki came back into the cave what a pity what a pity she said in a whisper cracking her beak kiki you awful idiot you nearly gave the game away whispered jack get on my shoulder and i warn you if you say just one more word ill tie your beak up with my hanky arrrrrrr said kiki and settled down with her head under her wing she was offended for what seemed like hours the children sat silently in the hole underground they heard no more voices and no more footsteps shook the ground nearby how long have we got to stay here like this whispered dinah at last she was always the first to get impatient im cramped i dont know said jack in a whisper that seemed to fill the underground cavity it would be dangerous to pop my head out and take a looksee im hungry said lucyann i wish wed brought something to eat down with us and im thirsty too jack wondered whether or not to risk sticking his head out just as he was making up his mind that he would everyone in the hole heard a faroff very welcome noise its the engine of their motorboat being started up said jack in relief they must have given up the hunt thank goodness well give them a few minutes then ill hop out they waited for five minutes the motorboats engine sounded for a little while then grew fainter and finally could not be heard at all jack cautiously put his head out he could see and hear nothing but puffins huffin and puffin were squatting nearby and got up politely when they saw his head arrrrrr they said jack got right out of the hole he lay down flat put his fieldglasses to his eyes and swept the sea around at last he spotted what he was looking for the motorboat going away at top speed getting smaller and smaller in the distance its all right he called down to the others theyre almost out of sight come on out soon they were all sitting in sleepy hollow with the girls getting a meal ready for by this time they were once again ravenous the gingerbeer had now all been drunk so they drank the water from the rockpool which was rather warm from the sun but tasted very sweet the rain from the storm had swelled it considerably well that was a rather narrow escape said philip his spirits rising as he tucked into slices of spam i really did think one of them would tumble in on top of us well what do you suppose i felt like when the match one of them used fell through the hole and bounced on my knee said dinah i nearly let out a yell kiki almost gave the game away too said jack putting potted meat on a biscuit calling out dindindinner like that im ashamed of you kiki shes sulking said dinah laughing look at her standing with her back to you pretending not to take any notice thats because you were cross with her jack grinned he called to huffin and puffin who were as usual standing patiently beside philip hey huff and puff come and have a titbit nice birds good birds dear huff and puff huffin and puffin walked over to jack doing their sailorroll from side to side they solemnly took a bit of biscuit from jacks fingers but that was more than kiki could stand she whisked round and screeched at the top of her voice naughty boy naughty boy naughty boy poor polly poor polly pollys got a cold put the kettle on naughty boy naughty boy she rushed at the startled puffins and gave them a sharp jab with her curved beak huffin retaliated at once and kiki stepped back she began to screech like a railway train and the two puffins hurriedly returned to philips knees where they stood and stared in alarm at kiki ready to dart down a burrow at a moments notice the children roared with laughter at this little pantomime kiki went to jack sidling along in a comical manner poor kiki poor kiki naughty boy naughty boy jack gave her a titbit and she sat on his shoulder to eat it looking triumphantly at muffin and puffin arrrrrr she said to them sounding like a snarling dog arrrrr all right kiki dont arrrrr any more just by my ear said jack and i should advise you not to go too near huffin for a bit he wont forget that jab of yours do you think itll be safe to sleep out of doors again tonight asked dinah clearing up the meal i dont fancy sleeping down that hole again somehow oh i should think it would be all right said jack i dont somehow think those fellows whoever they were will come along in the dark of night pity we didnt catch a glimpse of them i didnt like their voices said lucyann they sounded hard and horrid what a good thing that storm blew our tents away the other night said dinah suddenly if it hadnt we wouldnt have stumbled on that hole and been able to use it as a hidingplace we wouldnt have known where to go but for that thats true said philip i wonder if those men will come back again well go on keeping watch anyway and keep the fire going its our only hope of rescue and bills only hope too i should think because if nobody comes to rescue us certainly nobody will rescue bill poor bill said lucyann he wanted to disappear and he has those men must have put our fire out said jack suddenly noticing that there was no smoke the wretches i suppose they thought theyd put it out and then if it was lighted again and the smoke rose up theyd know for certain that somebody was here well jolly well go and light it again said philip at once well show them were going to have our fire going if we want to i guess they dont want it going in case somebody does happen to come along and see it they wont want people exploring this part of the world at the moment so they all went up to the clifftop and set to work to light the fire again the men had kicked it out and the ashes and halfburnt sticks were scattered everywhere it didnt take long to get it going again the children built it up carefully and then philip lighted it it caught at once and flames sprang up when it was going well the children banked it with seaweed and at once a thick spire of smoke ascended in the air ha you men i hope you have caught sight of our signal again cried jack facing out to sea you cant beat us well get the better of you yet youll see chapter someone else comes to the island the children were now very brown with the sun if mother could see us now she wouldnt call us peaky said philip and youve got back all your freckles jack and lucyann and a few hundreds more oh dear said lucyann rubbing her brown freckled face what a pity i did think i looked so nice when my freckles faded away during measles i seem to be losing count of the days said jack i cant for the life of me make out whether today is tuesday or wednesday its friday said philip promptly i was counting up only this morning weve been here quite a time now well is it a week since we left home wondered dinah it seems about six months i wonder how mother is getting on she must be feeling a bit worried about us said philip except that she knows were with bill and shell think were quite all right even if she doesnt get messages and were not with bill and were not all right said lucyann i do wish i knew where bill was and what was happening to him if only we had a boat we could go off in it and try to find where he was he must have been taken to the west of us somewhere because thats where the planes seem to be well were not likely to get a boat said philip come on lets go up on the clifftop and see to the fire the smoke doesnt seem very thick this morning huffin and puffin are you coming arrrrrrr said both huffin and puffin and walked along beside philip huffin had taken to bringing fish as a little present for philip and this amused the children immensely the first time that huffin had waddled up with the fish in his big beak the children hadnt been able to make out what he was carrying but when he came nearer they roared with laughter philip hes got six or seven fish in his beak for you and do look how hes arranged them cried jack heads and tails alternately in a row all down his beak huffin how did you do it thanks awfully old chap said philip as huffin deposited the fish beside the boy very generous of you now huffin brought fish two or three times a day much to the childrens amusement philip knew how to prepare it for cooking over the fire and the children ate the bigger fish with biscuits and tinned butter huffin solemnly accepted a piece cooked and seemed to enjoy it just as much as raw but puffin would not touch it well as long as weve got huffin to provide us with fish we shant starve said jack kiki dont be so jealous if huffin wants to be generous let him kiki tried to head off huffin when he arrived with fish she could not catch fish herself and did not like the way huffin brought presents to the little company naughty naughty naughty boy she screeched but huffin took no notice at all the children were sitting by the fire idly throwing sticks on to it and stirring it now and again to make it flare up a little a spire of smoke rose up bent northwards jack took up his fieldglasses and swept the lonely sea with them you never knew when friends or enemies might turn up hallo theres a boat again cried jack suddenly his glasses focussed on something small far away philip get your glasses the boys gazed through them whilst the girls waited impatiently they could see nothing with their bare eyes not even a speck on the sea is it the same boat as before said philip its getting nearer we shall soon be able to find out it looks a different one to me said jack smaller and its coming from a different direction that might just be a trick though to make us think it was a friend how shall we know said lucyann have we got to go and hide again jack gave his glasses to her to look through he turned to philip a gleam in his eye philip theres only one man this time hell have to leave his boat moored somewhere if hes come to look for us what about capturing it golly if only we could said philip his face glowing its a motorboat a small one but big enough to take us all easily capture it but how demanded dinah her eyes glued on the approaching boat the man would see us easily come running up and capture us here let me have my glasses back said philip tugging them away from dinah thats the worst of you di you will always make your turn so long now lets think a bit said jack his eyes bright that fellow cant be coming to rescue us because anyone knowing we were all alone here would send a bigger boat and probably more men in case they had to tackle our enemy if bill had managed to get word to anyone thats what they would do therefore it seems to me that this boat is not one sent to rescue so its probably a trick of the enemys continued philip they may or may not know there are only children here it depends on how much bill has told them but they might quite easily send someone who would pretend not to be an enemy so as to take us in and then we would be persuaded to get into his boat to go to safety and hed take us off somewhere to join bill as prisoners oh said lucyann who didnt like the sound of this at all well i certainly shant get into his boat jack what are we going to do now listen said jack i really have got a good idea but it needs all of us to carry it out you girls too well what have we got to do said dinah impatiently well find out where hes going to moor his boat said jack hell either go into that little channel where the lucky star was or pull her up on a sandy beach we shall soon know because we shall watch yes what then asked lucyann beginning to feel excited well dinah and i will hide nearby said jack the man will walk up on to the island to look for us and you and lucyann philip must go and meet him oh i couldnt said lucyann in alarm all right then you stay put somewhere said jack and philip can meet him and philip somehow or other youve got to get this fellow into that underground hole we can easily keep him prisoner there and if we can block him in somehow with plenty of food we can take the boat and go there was a silence whilst everyone digested this remarkable plan but how am i to get him into the hole asked philip at last it sounds a bit like wont you come into my parlour said the spider to the fly and somehow i dont think that the fly will oblige this time cant you just take him through the puffin colony and walk him near the hole and then trip him up asked jack impatiently im sure i could do it all right well you do it then said philip and ill hide near the boat to capture it but suppose you dont trip the man up and make him fall into the hole and be a prisoner what about the boat what shall i do with it well silly youll hop into it if you find that i havent been able to manage the man and youll get out to sea said jack and there youll stay till it begins to get dark when you can creep in and see if you can find us and take us off but you neednt worry i shall get that fellow all right i shall tackle him just like i tackle chaps at rugger at school lucyann gazed at jack in admiration what it was to be a boy well ill help too she said ill go and meet him with you we shall have to pretend to believe all he says said jack every word itll be funny him trying to take us in with a cockandbull story and us doing the same i hope he wont be very fierce said lucyann hell pretend to be quite harmless i expect said jack probably say hes a naturalist or something and look very simple and friendly well so shall i the boats getting quite near said philip there is only one man hes wearing dark glasses because of the sun to hide his fierce eyes i expect said lucyann fearfully not because of the sun do we show ourselves only two of us said jack you and i will get up lucyann and wave like mad standing beside the fire and mind whatever story i tell youve got to back me up philip you and dinah mustnt show yourselves wheres he going to park his boat wondered dinah oh hes making straight for the channel he knows it then there you are you see said jack nobody would make straight for that hidden channel unless he had been here before hes quite probably one of the men who came in that bigger boat this did seem very likely indeed for the boatman made straight for the little channel as if he had been there before just as he came near the cliffs jack and lucyann stood up and waved the man waved back now dinah you and philip get down among the rocks that lead to the little harbour said jack there are some big ones there you can crouch behind till hes moored his boat and comes up to find us here then down you must go and hop into the boat ready to go out to sea if we fail in our part if we dont fail things will be fine we shall have a prisoner we can hold as hostage and a boat to escape in hurray said philip feeling suddenly excited hiphiphip said kiki flying down to jacks shoulder she had been on an expedition of her own somewhere probably chivvying the gulls around jack thought you can join in the fun kiki said jack and mind you say all the right things send for the doctor answered kiki solemnly pop goes the doctor hes going into the channel said philip come on dinah time we hid good luck jack and lucyann chapter mr horace tipperlong gets a shock the man guided the motorboat expertly into the narrow channel of water where the lucky star had been battered to pieces he saw the bit of broken rope still round one of the rocks and looked at it puzzled dinah and philip were crouching behind two or three large rocks further up the cliff they could not see what the man was doing for they were afraid of being spotted if they peeped out jack and lucyann were waiting on the clifftop lucyann was nervous my knees feel funny she complained to jack he laughed dont be a baby buck up knees now here he comes you neednt say a word if you dont want to the man came up the rocky steps that led to the top of the cleft in the cliff he was a thin fellow rather weedy with skinny legs he wore shorts and a pullover he had been burnt by the sun and his skin was blistered he had a thin little moustache and a high forehead on which the hair grew rather far back he wore very dark glasses indeed so that it was quite impossible to see his eyes he did not look anybody to be very much feared jack thought hallo hallo hallo said the man as he and the children met i was astonished to know there were people on this island who told you asked jack at once oh nobody said the man i saw your spire of smoke whatever are you doing here is there a camp of you or something there might be said jack airily why have you come here im an ornithologist said the man very earnestly you wont know what that means of course jack grinned to himself considering that he and philip thought themselves very fine ornithologists this amused him but he wasnt going to let this man know that orni orn ornibologist he said innocently whats that well my lad its a student of bird life said the man a birdlover one who wants to know all he can about birds and their ways is that why youve come here then to study birds asked lucyann thinking she ought to say something her knees had stopped shaking and feeling funny now that she saw the man was not at all fearsome yes ive been to this island before years and years ago when i was a lad said the man and i wanted to come again though i had a job finding it i was surprised to see your smoke going up whats it for playing at shipwrecked sailors or something i know what children are it was plain that the man knew very little about children and thought the two to be much younger than they were hell be reciting humpty dumpty to us in a moment thought jack with a private grin do you know a lot about birds said jack not answering the mans question well i dont know a great deal about seabirds said the man thats why ive come to these islands again i know more about ordinary birds aha thought jack he says that because he is afraid ill ask him a few questions about the birds here weve got two tame puffins said lucyann suddenly would you like to see them oh very much my dear very much said the man beaming at her by the way my name is tipperlong horace tipperlong tripalong said lucyann with a giggle thinking it was a very good name for this man who walked with curious mincing steps jack wanted to laugh no no tipperlong said horace and smiled all over his face at lucyann what is your name my names lucyann she said and my brothers name is jack are you coming to see the puffins its this way i should also like to meet whoever is in charge of you said mr horace tipperlong and er where is your boat didnt you come in a boat it was smashed up in a storm said jack solemnly mr tipperlong tuttutted with sympathy how dreadful then how were you going to get back home look out said jack just saving horace as he was about to plunge down a puffins burrow this place is undermined by the puffins mind where you go my word what a lot of birds said horace tipperlong standing still he had been so engrossed in polite talk that he did not seem to have noticed the amazing colony of puffins another black mark against him jack could not believe that a real ornithologist would walk halfway through the puffins without exclaiming at them extraordinary most astonishing i dont remember ever seeing so many birds together before said horace and all those thousands on the cliffs too well well well and do you mean to say you really have got two tame puffins i can hardly believe it theyre philips said lucyann and then could have bitten out her tongue i thought you said your brothers name was jack said horace enquiringly she must have made a mistake said jack saying the first thing he could think of they were getting very near the entrance of the underground hole now look out mr horace tipperlong lucyann began to feel nervous suppose this man tripalong or whatever his name was didnt fall into the hole when jack tripped him suppose instead he went for jack suppose well suppose he had a revolver he didnt look a desperate sort of man but you never knew lucyann looked at the pockets of his shorts to see if she could spy anything like a lump in the shape of a revolver there but his pockets were so bulged out with dozens of things that it was impossible to tell jack nudged her keep out of the way now he said in a very low voice lucyann obediently slipped behind her heart beating fast jack came to the entrance of the hole a stick marked it as usual for it really was almost impossible to find without some sort of signpost horace tripped along looking shortsightedly through his dark glasses and then to his enormous astonishment jack put out a leg rushed him and tripped him right over he fell at the side of the hole but before he could get up jack had given him a shove and right into the hole he went crash jack had a stout stick in his hand which he had picked from the pile beside the bonfire he parted the heather and looked into the hole in the dim light he could see horace tipperlong sitting up and he heard him groaning tipperlong looked up and saw jack you wicked boy he said angrily what do you mean by this his glasses had fallen off in his headlong dive his eyes certainly did not look very fierce they looked rather weak and watery he held his head as if he had hurt it sorry said jack but it had to be done either you caught us or we caught you we neednt go on pretending any more we know quite well what gang you belong to what are you talking about cried the man and he stood up his head popped out of the hole jack raised his stick at once get back he said fiercely youre our prisoner you took bill didnt you well now weve taken you if you attempt to clamber out i shall hit you on the head with this you just try it horace hastily retreated lucyann looked white and scared oh jack is he hurt jack you wont really hit him will you i jolly well will said jack think of bill lucyann and our poor lucky star and us stranded here because of this fellow and his precious friends dont you realise that if he gets out and back to his boat theyll send heaps more and wont rest till theyve got us dont be feeble well i dont want to see you hit him said lucyann dinah wouldnt mind a bit but im not strongminded like dinah look here will you kindly tell me what all this nonsense is about shouted horace i never heard of such a thing here i come to a birdisland which as far as i know certainly isnt a crime and you two kids lead me here trip me up and shove me down this hole ive hurt my head badly and now you say if i try to get out youll brain me you nasty little creatures im really very sorry about it said jack again but there wasnt anything else to be done you will realise that with our boat gone and bill disappeared we had to get a boat somehow we cant stay here for the rest of our lives horace was so amazed and upset at this speech that he stood up again he sat down hurriedly when he saw jacks stick but look here do you really mean to say youre now going to take my boat i never heard such brazen cheek you wait till i get hold of the people in charge of you my boy youll get the worst hiding youve ever had in your life chapter horace does not like puffin island lucyann see if you can spot either philip or dinah ordered jack philip will probably be in the boat ready to start her up if need be but dinah will possibly be looking out to see if there is any sign from us lucyann stood up she saw dinah standing way off waiting anxiously at the top of the cleft in the cliff philip was not to be seen presumably he was down in the boat lucyann waved violently its all right weve got him in the hole she yelled dinah waved back then disappeared she had gone to tell philip soon the two appeared again and came through the puffin colony at top speed to hear what had happened we got him said jack proudly easy as pie down he went plonk whos there enquired horace plaintively is that somebody else look here youve just got to tell me whats going on here im all at sea thats where well be soon i hope grinned jack and in your boat philip meet mr horace tripalong gosh is that really his name said philip the incensed mr tipperlong roared up the hole my name is tipperlong and ill thank you to remember it illmannered children you wait till i make a complaint about you and get you punished i never heard of such behaviour in all my life you cant blame him for being wild said jack he says hes a a i say mr tripalong what did you say you were an ornithologist ignorant boy yelled mr tipperlong golly whats that said philip innocently and the others giggled you let me out of this commanded mr tipperlong and his head appeared cautiously near the entrance of the hole ready to bob back if necessary it was necessary look here said jack exasperated do you want me to give you a good old conk on the head before you know i mean what i say because i will i dont want to but i will i bet you gave bill a few blows before you captured him whats sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander youre talking doubledutch said horace in a disgusted voice i think you must be mad do you mean to tell me you kids are all alone on this island i dont believe a word you say you tell whoever is in charge of you to come and have a word with me if you think im going to stay here much longer youre mistaken ive never met such unpleasant children in my life i suppose youre playing at being just williams pah this was a lovely noise kiki who had been listening with surprise and enjoyment to the animated conversation now joined in pah pooh pah pop she flew to the edge of the hole and looked in pah she said again and went off into a cackle of laughter horace looked up in fresh alarm was that really a parrot at the hole entrance saying pah and pooh to him in that rude way is that is that one of the tame puffins you told me about he asked doubtfully i thought you were an ornithologist said jack in scorn kiki is a parrot i should have thought anyone would have known that but how can a parrot live here said horace its not a seabird oh this is all a dream but what a very silly dream at that moment a puffin came down the end of the burrow that led into the back of the hole arrrrrrr it announced in a deep and guttural voice mr tipperlong jumped violently all he could see in the dimness of the hole was a baleful eye and a big and manycoloured beak go away he said weakly shoo shoo said kiki from the hole entrance in great delight pah pooh shoo arrrrrrrrr youre all mad said poor horace im mad too i suppose shoo i tell you the puffin said arrrrr again and then went back up its burrow judging by the flow of arrrrs that came down the hole it was telling its wife all about the peculiar puffinman it had just seen in the hole what are we going to do now weve got him said philip in a low voice i suppose he is an enemy i mean he does sound rather a goof doesnt he all part of a clever plan said jack hes no ornithologist hes been told to dress up like a goofy one and act the part some birdmen are awful goofs you know weve met them well this one is just about too goofy for words hes overacting if you know what i mean im glad he hasnt got a revolver ive been afraid of that all the time yes so was i admitted philip there may be one in the boat i hope there is it might come in useful well what are we going to do do you think he can hear what were saying said lucyann looking frightened no not if we talk as low as this said philip jack the boat is a nice little bit of work smaller than the lucky star but it has a little cabin and will easily take us all and some food are there oars in it in case we want to cut out the engine and go in quietly to shore anywhere asked jack yes said philip i noticed those have you got a good plan jack i keep on and on thinking but all i can make up my mind about is to sail off in the boat but where to i dont know we want to escape but we want to escape to somewhere and not out of the fryingpan into the fire either wed better do it soon too because if dear old tripalong doesnt get back to the gang with news pretty soon theyll send others here yes id thought of all that too said jack and the girls nodded the thing is shall we try to make for the outer islands and find one where a few fishermen live and try to get help or shall we try for the mainland or shall we hunt for bill there was a silence everyone was thinking hard lucyann spoke first i vote for hunting for bill she said we could try that first anyway and then make for safety afterwards if were not successful but i do think we ought to try to find bill first good for you lucyann said jack thats what i think now for some more planning horace tipperlong suddenly demanded their attention again stop all that talk talk talk he cried fretfully im ravenous and thirsty too if youre going to try and starve me to death say so but at least let me know were not going to starve you dont be an ass said jack lucyann open some tins and give them to him and chuck him down some biscuits too dinah fill a pan with water from the pool right chief grinned dinah and went off to the pool in the rocks horace was handed down the full pan of water and some tins and biscuits he began to eat hungrily the sight of the food made the others feel hungry too well have a feed as well said philip shall i take a turn at holding the stick and sitting by the hole jack yes said jack but mind give him a good old conk if he so much as shows a hair this was said in a very loud voice so that horace was sure to hear but horace said nothing apparently he was willing to bide his time now the children were soon devouring a tinned chicken tinned peas which they ate without heating a tinned fruit salad with tinned cream washed down with water from the pool jolly good said jack with a comfortable sigh i feel better wonderful what food does to you it would make me sick if i ate as much as youve just eaten said dinah youre a greedy pig you ate twice as much as anyone else cant help it said jack i was twice as hungry now then lower your voices please well make our plans shall we set out at night said philip in a low voice no said jack at once wed never see our way even in the moonlight wed better set off first thing tomorrow morning about dawn well hope old tripalong is asleep then so that we can get a good start without his interrupting us yes because well have to leave the hole unguarded when we all go to the boat said lucyann id thought of that said jack you three can go to the boat take food with you and our clothes and rugs get everything absolutely ready and then when youre ready to start give me a yell and ill come tearing along to join you you can send dinah up to the top of the cleft to wave and by the time horace has realised nobody is on guard to conk him on the head well be out to sea in his boat said dinah enjoying the thought poor old horace i feel quite sorry for him i dont said jack unfeelingly if hes bills enemy hes jolly well mine he deserves all hes got and honestly except for being tripped into the hole hes got nothing much to complain about i shant block him in when we leave and put food there as i thought we would at first it wont matter if he gets out once were gone and i shouldnt think it will be long before some others of the gang come along to see why he hasnt turned up at home wherever that is it seems a bit of a wildgoose chase to try and find bill with all these scores of islands to choose from said philip but i shouldnt feel comfortable if we didnt have a shot anyway nor should i said jack bills often come to our rescue in other adventures its time we went to his if only we can find him i suppose theres no doubt but that the enemy have taken him to their headquarters on some island or other here dont you think it would be a good idea if we got everything ready this evening said dinah suddenly you know all the food in the boat and rugs and clothes and things so as not to have to waste a single minute getting ready tomorrow morning you said you wanted to set off at dawn yes thats a good idea said jack ill take turn at the hole with the stick now if you like philip and you help the girls to carry things down to the boat what a bit of luck capturing one like that i must say i think weve been pretty clever pah said kiki pooh pah sorry you dont agree old thing said jack very sorry but i still think we have been very clever wed better leave some food for tripalong hadnt we asked dinah i mean i know the gang will be along in a day or two to see what has happened to him but hell have to have things to eat till they come yes leave him some tins and a tinopener said jack and philip were there any rugs in the boat belonging to him yes said philip ill bring them back here after ive taken some food to the boat well chuck them down to him i think were being awfully kind to our enemy horace didnt think so he got all upset again after a bit and began to shout wildly down in the hole this has gone on long enough you let me out you little villains wait till i get my hands on you what is the meaning of this id like to know oh dont keep up the pretence any more mr horace tripalong said jack bored were enemies both of us and you know it you open up a bit and tell me where bill is and a few things more you might get off more lightly in the end if you do whos this bill you keep talking about said horace in an exasperated tone look here are you playing at pirates or red indians or what i never heard of anyone being kept prisoner down a hole like this by a pack of villainous children no i never heard of it either now i come to think of it said jack well dear horace if you wont admit what we all know keep quiet pah said horace aggravated beyond words pah said kiki at once and went to the hole entrance she looked down pah naughty boy pop goes the weasel how many times have i told you to shut the door god save the king pah mr tripalong listened in amazed horror was he really and truly mad could that be a parrot talking to him so rudely ill wring that birds neck he said fiercely and got up ring the bell please said kiki and went off into one of her cackles then she poked her head in again and screeched like a railway engine in a tunnel it was absolutely deafening in the hole below and horace fell back on the ground defeated mad quite mad all mad he muttered and putting his head in his hands he said ho more chapter the enemy the three children accompanied by huffin and puffin made various journeys to and from sleepy hollow with food rugs and clothes philip brought back a pile of rugs from the boat and thrust them down the hole entrance they descended on poor horace and enveloped him he was very much startled but glad to find in a moment or two that his captors were actually offering him something warm and soft to lie on he arranged them underneath himself ah that was more comfortable he began to think longingly of all the things he would do to those children once he got free at last everything was in the motorboat ready for the early start it was now getting dusk philip lucyann and dinah came and sat beside jack i suppose one or other of us must keep watch over the hole all night in case horace escapes whispered philip jack nodded yes we cant risk his getting out just as weve got everything set you take first watch philip we wont let the girls watch because im pretty sure they wouldnt hit horace good and hard if he popped his head out i would said dinah indignantly lucyann is the softie im not lucyann said nothing she felt sure she wouldnt be able to hit horace hard anyway the boys decided that only they should keep watch so that was all right the sun had gone down into the sea the sky was pricked with the first few stars the children lay about comfortably on the heather talking in low voices there was no sound from horace perhaps he was asleep philips three rats which had suddenly begun to look very grownup came out to sniff the evening air dinah removed herself at once huffin and puffin regarded the rats with fixed eyes kiki yawned and then sneezed then she coughed in a very hollow manner shut up kiki said jack if you want to practise your awful noises go up on the cliff and make the seagulls and guillemots listen arrrr said huffin solemnly huffin agrees with me said jack pah said kiki and pah to you said jack now shut up kiki do its a lovely evening dont spoil it with your pahing and poohing just as he finished speaking there came a noise from far out to sea a very small noise at first hardly heard above the sound of the sea and the wind but becoming quite unmistakable after a while a motorboat said jack sitting upright now what in the world have they come to look for horace already said philip in a low voice blow this upsets our plans like anything nothing could be seen on the darkening sea but the noise came nearer and nearer jack clutched philip and spoke in his ear theres only one thing to do we must all go and get into our boat now this very minute and get out to sea we mustnt let the enemy see the boat in the channel there or theyll take it and our only chance will be gone come on quickly silently the four children rose to their feet kiki flew to jacks shoulder not uttering a sound huffin and puffin who had retired to their burrow came out again they flew beside the hurrying children not even remarking arrrr to one another across the puffin colony they went stumbling and staggering between the hundreds of burrows up the little slope of the cliff and over to the cleft in the rock down the rocky ledges be careful be careful and into the rocking boat their breath coming fast and their hearts beating like hammers start her up ordered philip and jack started the engine philip threw off the mooringrope and it skittered into the boat by the girls feet in a moment more they were backing gently out of the little channel soon they were right out of it philip went to the east a little it was almost dark now well stop the engine said philip and wait here till the other boat goes into the channel because i expect shell make for it i dont want to bump into her and the men on board her might hear our engine so the engine was stopped and the motorboat swung up and down gently as waves ran beneath her to the rocky cliffs some way off the sound of the other boats engine was now very loud philip wished he had gone a bit further off after all but the bigger boat swung by without stopping and then nosed its way into the hidden harbour the children crouching in their boat straining their eyes had just been able to make out a dark shape and that was all the other boats engine stopped and peace came back into the night some of the seabirds disturbed uttered a few wild cries and then flew back to their roostingplaces on the ledges horace will be glad to be rescued said dinah at last yes hell probably already be out of the hole said jack hed soon know when we were gone ive no doubt therell be a lot of bad language going on when they find out how we imprisoned poor horace and gosh when they find out weve taken his boat arrrrrr said a deep voice from the rail round the deck the children jumped in the darkness oh it must be huffin or puffin said philip pleased fancy them coming with us i do think thats friendly of them theyre sweet said lucyann and put out her hand to huffin both the puffins were there sitting side by side in the darkness kiki flew to join them what are we going to do now said dinah dare we go off in the dark we might bump into rocks and wreck the boat well have to stay here till the first light of day said philip then well set off and hope the men on the island wont hear our engine and come after us we shall have got a good start said jack well what about having a snooze if were going to stay here wheres the anchor shall we let it down i dont fancy drifting about at the mercy of the waves all night long whilst the boys were busy the girls laid out rugs mackintoshes and jerseys to lie on it was a lovely warm night and nobody minded its so nice to have the stars above us instead of a ceiling or a tent roof said lucyann snuggling down i dont feel a bit sleepy somehow i suppose its all the excitement ive got used to this adventure now oh dear how glad i am that i didnt have to hit horace on the head i should have dreamt about that for ages they lay for some time talking they all felt very wideawake indeed huffin and puffin appeared to be awake too because they occasionally remarked am to one another kiki was on jacks feet she also was wideawake and began to recite the nursery rhymes she knew humpty dumpy puddingypie ding dong bell ring his neck shut up said jack were trying to go to sleep you tiresome bird i hope huffin and puffin stay with us said lucyann wouldnt it be lovely if we could take them home with us shut up said kiki and cackled parrots are not allowed to say that said jack severely and sat up to tap her on her beak but she had promptly put her head under her wing so he couldnt artful creature said jack and heard a faint pah from under kikis wing just as lucyann was falling off to sleep the others sat up so suddenly that she was jerked awake whats the matter she began and then she knew the engine of the other motorboat was going again lucyann sat up with the others her eyes straining through the darkness they must have found horace heard his report and all have gone back on board said jack they are evidently not going to spend the night here look here they come gosh theyve got their lights on this time jack jack theyll be going back to their headquarters said philip urgently lets follow them get the anchor up quick they wont hear our engine because theirs makes such a row come on lets follow them theyll take us to where bill is the mens motorboat swung round when it had come from the channel and headed out to sea it was not long before the childrens set off in its wake they could not hear the other boats engine because of their own and they knew that theirs would not be heard by the men for the same reason huffin and puffin were still on the deckrail clearly they meant to go wherever the children went lucyann thought it was nice to have such staunch loyal friends even if they were only puffins kiki was on jack s shoulder again her beak to the breeze all aboard she kept saying all aboard pah the first boat sped along quickly it was easy to follow because of its lights the children stood with their noses to the wind in silence lucyann spoke first this adventure is getting more adventurous she said oh dear it really is chapter the secret lagoon for a long time the two boats sped across the sea its the sea of adventure lucyann thought anything might happen here oh i do hope we find bill things always seem right when hes with us you girls had better have a nap said jack at last youll be tired out philip and i will keep awake and take turns at the wheel you snuggle down and go to sleep so they did and it wasnt long before both girls were asleep and dreaming of swings and hammocks because of the swinging swaying motion of the boat they were in after a good long time jack spoke to philip tufty do you see that light flashing over there it must be a signal of some sort i should think the boat in front is heading towards it i hope were soon coming to our journeys end because the moon will be up soon and we might be seen that light must be a guide to the boat or perhaps to an aeroplane said philip blow here comes the moon out of that bank of clouds well shes not very bright thats one good thing by the light of the moon the boys could see an island looming up in front of the boats to the left was another island two or three miles away from the first or so it seemed to the boys look here jack we dont want to drive right into the jaws of danger said philip which is what we shall do if we follow the first boat right up to that island its heading for i think it would be better to go to that other one yonder look we could probably see enough in the moonlight to make out a cove to land in we could pull this boat into safety between us right said jack swinging the wheel round now they were no longer following the first boat it was soon out of sight and was probably by now safely in some little harbour their own boat headed for the further island by the time they got there their eyes were used to the moonlight and they could see everything fairly clearly doesnt seem very rocky said jack nosing in gently no all sand and fine shingle ill run her straight up this beach philip be ready to jump out as soon as she stops the girls awoke and scrambled out of their wraps jack ran the boat straight up the shingly beach it drove into the fine shingle and stopped philip sprang out cant shift her at all he panted when he and the others had tried to pull the boat further up lets chuck out the anchor and let her be its nearly low tide now so well just paddle out and drop the anchor and give the boat a push it will be quite all right then if the sea keeps calm the boys did this and they lay on the shingle to get their breath they were both very tired they almost fell asleep as they lay there come on boys said dinah at last bring some rugs and find a sheltered place somewhere youre half asleep well were safe till the morning anyway said jack as he stumbled up the beach with the others almost asleep as he walked nobody knows were here another birdisland i suppose they came to a low cliff lucyann saw a dark cave at the foot put your torch on she called to philip we might be able to sleep here it proved to be a small cave with a soft dry sandy floor it smelt a little of seaweed but nobody minded that they dragged their rugs in and flung themselves down huffin and puffin squatted at the opening of the cave as if they had put themselves on guard almost before their heads touched the rugs the boys were asleep the girls followed suit and soon there was nothing to be heard but tiny snores from jack who was flat on his back kiki examined his face in the darkness to find out why her beloved jack was making such queer little noises then decided they werent worth bothering about she sat herself down in the middle of his tummy and went to sleep too the next morning huffin and puffin walked over to philip and stood heavily on him arrrr they said meaning come on wake up philip awoke get off he said dont copy kikis bad ways huffin and puffin oh i say thanks for the fish but dont put them all over my chest huffin huffin had been diving for fish he now deposited them carefully on philip opened and shut his mouth a few times and made his one and only remark in a deep and satisfied voice arrrrrrrrrrr the children laughed when they heard about huffins morning offering they rubbed their eyes and decided to have a dip in the sea for they all felt dirty then well have breakfast said jack gosh i wish i wasnt always so frightfully hungry i say this is rather a nice island isnt it look you can see the enemys island on the horizon over there wonder if bill is there well go up to the highest point on this island after breakfast and have a good look round at all the others said philip lets go and get some food from the boat the boat was afloat on the high tide the children had to swim out to her they rifled her for food and whilst she was looking for a tin of salmon she knew she had put in lucyann found something that made her shout i say look a wireless do you suppose it is a transmitter as well as a receiver can we send a message on it dont know said jack examining it its not a bit like bills if only we knew anyway even if we could send out messages on it i wouldnt know how to i expect its just some sort of portable wireless come on lets have breakfast phew this suns hot with huffin puffin kiki and the three rats all sharing their breakfast the four children made a very good meal on the boat now what next said jack shall we go up to the topmost height in this island and see whats all round us yes said the others so leaving the boat by itself they made their way up the low cliff and on to the grassgrown land behind it was not so heathery as puffin island had been nor were there many birds on it its funny youd think there would be plenty on a nice little island like this said jack look theres a hill at the other end of the island lets climb it they climbed to the very top and then they stood still in astonishment beyond them sparkling blue was a lagoon flat and still as a mirror it lay between two islands but the islands were joined by broad strips of rocks that enclosed the whole lagoon so that it was impossible to say which island it really belonged to the rocks ran out from each one in places as high as cliffs and there between them lay this unbelievably lovely sealake look at that said jack in awe weve seen some wonderful sights but never one as beautiful as that blue lagoon it cant be real but it was it stretched out below them for about a mile and a half so sheltered and protected that not a ripple broke its calm blue surface and then something happened that gave the children a shock of amazement they heard the low hum of an aeroplane they saw it coming towards them jack pulled them down flat in case they were seen it flew right over the lagoon and as it flew something dropped from it something that opened out billowed white and had something else fixed below it the children watched in amazement all sorts of ridiculous things flashed through their minds was it a scientific experiment bombs atom bombs what was it a little parachute had opened and was swinging down to the lagoon the package underneath it was wrapped in glistening stuff some kind of waterproof material jack thought it reached the water and disappeared the parachute spread itself out on the calm surface and lay still but as the children watched it seemed to dissolve and finally it too disappeared into the water look the plane is circling the lagoon again its going to drop another said philip they all watched as the plane once more dropped a parachute and the same thing happened down to the water it floated with its unknown package and in a few minutes all trace of it had disappeared a third one was sent down and then the aeroplane circled round once and headed away soon it was lost in the distance well whatever in the world was it doing dropping things into this lagoon said jack in astonishment what a strange thing to do whats in those enormous packages the parachutes carry and why drop them into the lagoon wondered dinah it seems so silly do they want to get rid of something what a strange way to do it lets take the boat and go and sail over the lagoon to see if we can see down into the depths said lucyann and how do you think we are going to get into the lagoon idiot said jack no boat can get into that water unless its dragged over that barrier of rocks surrounding it yes of course how silly of me said lucyann i do wish we could see down into that water though and find out what secrets it is holding down in the blue depths arrrrrr said huffin and puffin and their wings vibrating quickly they sailed down to the lagoon as if to say you want to go there well its easy they bobbed there on the lagoon very small specks indeed diving under the water for fish the children watched them i dont see why we cant go and have a bathe there said jack at last we could swim a good way out and then dive down to see if we could find out anything you never know well lets go now then said dinah eagerly i feel as if i simply must find out what all this is about its the most peculiar secret i must say they began to scramble down the hill it grew rocky as they got lower down but there were plenty of seapink cushions to soften the way for their feet at last they reached the edge of the still blue water they undressed and went in the water was very warm indeed and rippled like soft silk over their arms they swam out slowly enjoying the warmth of the lake and of the sun on their shoulders now im going to dive down and see if i can make out anything said jack and turning himself up like a duck down he went down and down and down what would he find at the bottom chapter an amazing discovery the lagoon was quite deep jack could not swim to the bottom because he couldnt possibly hold his breath long enough he came up gasping all i could see was a pile of silvery stuff lying on the bottom he gasped to the others nothing else at all i couldnt go right down to it because i hadnt enough breath well thats not much use said dinah we want to see whats inside the waterproof wrapping tear it off so that we can see what it holds we wouldnt be able to do that very easily said philip i bet its sewn up pretty tightly or sealed in some clever way ill go down jack perhaps i can get near enough to feel whats inside oh dear do be careful said lucyann you dont know what might be inside well its hardly likely to be anything that will eat us grinned jack kiki why dont you do a little diving like huffin and puffin do you could be a bit of help then but kiki did not approve of all this love of bathing she flew about above the children in the water and tried occasionally to perch on a bare shoulder huffin and puffin loved having the children in the water and swam and dived beside them uttering deep arrrrrs of satisfaction philip dived under and swam rapidly downwards his eyes wide open in the salt water far below him he saw the silvery mass gleaming dimly on the lagoon bed he swam right down to it and put out his hand to touch it beneath the wrapping he felt something very hard indeed then his breath giving out he rose up to the surface almost bursting he took in great gulps of air i felt something hard he said at last but it was impossible to tell what it was blow isnt it sickening to be right on top of a mystery like this and not be able to solve it we shall have to give it up said jack i know perfectly well i havent enough breath to go down and probe the wrappings i should burst for want of breath i do hate giving things up said dinah well swim under the water yourself and see if you can find out anything said philip you know i cant hold my breath even as long as you can said dinah so whats the good of that im going to swim back to shore said lucyann theres a nice sunny rock over there covered with seaweed i shall have a sunbath there she swam slowly over to it huffin and puffin dived under just beside her i wonder what they look like when they swim under water thought lucyann id love to see them chasing a fish she turned herself up and duckdived under the water ah there was huffin using his wings to swim swiftly through the water after a big fish quick huffin or youll lose it just as she was going to swim upwards again lucyann noticed something below her the lagoon was not nearly so deep just there for a shelf of rocks ran out into the water making it fairly shallow although it was much too deep still for lucyanns feet to touch the bottom the little girl took a quick glance to see what it was on the rocks below the water but then her breath gave out and half choking she rose up to the surface gasping and spluttering when she had got her breath again down she went and then she realised what it was she saw one of the parachuted packages instead of falling into the deeper waters of the lagoon had fallen on to the shallow rocky bed just below her the package had split open and all its contents were spread and scattered on the rocky bottom below but whatever were they lucyann could not make them out at all they looked such peculiar shapes she rose up to the surface again and yelled to jack hi jack one of those secret packages has split open on the rocky bottom just here but i cant make out what was in it the boys and dinah swam up in great excitement they all duckdived and down they went down down down they came to where the silvery wrapping was split open moving gently up and down with the flow of the water all around it were the spilt contents the boys almost bursting for breath examined them quickly then shot up to the surface gasping they looked at one another and then both shouted out the same words guns guns scores of them the children swam to the sunny rock that lucyann was now sitting on and clambered up fancy that guns what in the wide world do they want to drop guns down in this lagoon for are they getting rid of them and why no they wouldnt wrap them up so carefully in waterproof stuff if they were just dumping them said philip soberly theyre hiding them hiding them but what a very peculiar place to hide guns in said dinah what are they going to do with them theyre probably gunrunning said jack bringing hundreds of guns here from somewhere and hiding them till theyre ready for them ready for some revolution somewhere south america perhaps something like that i bet said philip there are always people stirring up trouble somewhere and wanting weapons to fight with those who can supply them with guns would make a lot of money yes thats what it is gunrunning well said lucyann to think weve dropped right into an awful thing like that i expect bill guessed it and they saw him snooping round and captured him so that he couldnt give the game away however do they get the guns away from here wondered jack i mean they cant be got away by boat because this lagoon is absolutely enclosed by rocks yet the guns must be taken out of the water to be sent to wherever they are wanted its jolly queer well now we do know what that aeroplane was dropping said philip my word this lagoon must be full of armaments what an absolutely wonderful hidingplace nobody to see what happens nobody to discover the guns at the bottom except us said lucyann promptly i discovered that split package i suppose it hit the rocks just below the surface and split open at once they lay basking in the sun talking over the curious discovery then kiki suddenly uttered an astonished cry and the children sat up to see why goodness theres a boat coming said jack in dismay coming towards this very place too from the seaward side of the rocky barrier what shall we do said lucyann frightened theres nowhere to hide and we havent time to make our way back without being seen the boys gazed round in desperation what could be done then philip suddenly grabbed up a great armful of seaweed and flung it over the surprised lucyann well cover ourselves up with this he said theres stacks of it quick pull it up and cover yourselves with it its the only way we can hide their hearts thumping loudly again the four children piled the thickly growing seaweed with its great ribbonlike fronds all over themselves jack peered through his and spoke urgently to dinah one of your feet is showing di put some seaweed over it quick huffin and puffin were amazed at this sudden seaweed game they decided which lump was philip and went to perch solemnly on him he felt their weight and almost laughed nobody could possibly guess there was a boy under these two puffins and all the seaweed he thought i only hope the others are really well covered the boat grounded not far off the voices of two or three men could be heard coming nearer and nearer the children held their breath dont tread on us oh dont tread on us prayed lucyann feeling quite sick especially as there was a great flabby piece of seaweed across her mouth the men did not tread on them they came and stood quite nearby however and all of them lighted cigarettes as they stood there the last lot of stuff came today said one man in a husky deep voice this lagoon must be almost full now yes time we got some of it away said another voice a sharp commanding kind of voice we dont know how much information that fellow weve got has passed on to his headquarters he wont talk better send a message through to the chief to tell him to collect as much as he wants in case anyone else is sent along to snoop what about the second fellow he wont talk either said the first voice what are we going to do with them they cant remain up here said the commanding voice put them on the boat tonight and well dump them somewhere where they wont be heard of again im not going to waste my time on that first fellow any more whats his name cunningham hes been enough trouble to us poking his nose into all we do for the last year time he disappeared the four hidden children feeling very damp and cold under their seaweed shivered to hear all this they knew perfectly well what was meant they these men were bills bitter enemies because he had been successful in keeping on their track now they had got him and they were afraid he knew too much though actually it was likely that bill didnt know as much as they the children did and so they are going to remove all these guns and then dump poor bill somewhere so that he never will be heard of again because he will be drowned thought jack desperately we shall have to rescue him and as quickly as possible too i wonder who the other fellow is they are talking about surely it cant be horace i thought he was one of the enemy the men wandered away over the rocks evidently they had come to survey their extraordinary hidingplace though they could see very little of its contents the children lay perfectly still not daring to move in case they should be noticed they got very tired indeed of lying there and lucyann was shivering then they heard the sound of the motorboats engine starting up again thank goodness they waited a while and then jack sat cautiously up he looked round there was noone to be seen the men had gone back to the boat by a different way and it was now some distance out to sea phew said jack i didnt like that at all another inch or two nearer and one of the men would have trodden on my foot chapter another surprise they all sat up and removed the slippery seaweed from themselves huffin and puffin walked down philips body where they had perched the whole time kiki to her fright and dismay had been covered with seaweed by jack and forced to stay beside him for he was afraid she might give them away by talking she talked angrily now poor poor polly send for the doctor what a pity what a pity ding dong bell pollys in the well the children looked at one another solemnly when they had finished uncovering themselves bill was in great danger there was no doubt of that at all what are we going to do said lucyann with tears in her eyes nobody quite knew there seemed to be danger wherever they turned well said jack at last weve got a boat of our own thats one thing and i think when its dark tonight wed better set out for the other island the one the men are on and see if we cant find where they keep their motorboat we know that bill will be there and rescue him said dinah thrilled but how shall we get close in to shore without being seen or heard well go when its dark as i said said jack and when we get near to the shore well stop our engine and get the oars then we can row in without being heard oh yes id forgotten there were oars in our boat said dinah thank goodness cant we get back to our little cave on the shore at the other side of the island asked lucyann i dont feel safe here somehow and id be glad to know our boat was all right also we cant have anything to eat till we get back there said philip getting up come on im frozen we shall get warm climbing up the rocks on to the height over there and then over the island to the boat so they went back over the rocks and found their clothes where they had left them they stripped off their wet suits and dressed quickly philips rats which he had left in his pockets were extremely pleased to see him again and ran all over him with little squeals of delight huffin and puffin accompanied the children as usual all of them were secretly relieved to find their boat was safe on the shingly beach they went to her and chose some tins of food better have something with lots of juice to drink said jack theres no fresh water here as far as i can see and im awfully thirsty lets open a tin of pineapple theres always lots of juice in that better open two tins if kikis going to have any said dinah you know what a pig she is over pineapple they all tried to be jolly and cheerful but somehow what with their strange discovery of the guns in the lagoon and the news that bill was in real danger none of them could talk for long one by one they fell silent and hardly knew what they were eating i suppose said dinah at last after a long silence in which the only noise was the sound of kikis beak scraping against the bottom of one of the pineapple tins i suppose we had better set out as soon as its dark but i do feel quaky about it well look here said jack ive been thinking hard and im sure it would be best if philip and i went alone to get bill its very risky and we dont know a bit what we shall be up against and i dont like the idea of you girls coming oh we must come cried lucyann who couldnt bear the thought of jack going off without her supposing something happened to you wed be here on this island all alone and nobody would know about us anyway im going with you jack you cant stop me all right said jack perhaps it would be better if we stuck together i say i suppose that other fellow they spoke about couldnt be horace we couldnt have made a mistake about him could we well i did think he was too idiotic for words said dinah i mean he looked it not only acted it i believe we did make a mistake i think perhaps he really was a birdlover gosh he must have thought we were frightful said jack horrified and we took his boat too and left him to be taken prisoner by the enemy and they must have thought he was bills friend and have been wild with him when he said he didnt know bill or anything about him said philip everyone thought solemnly about poor horace im jolly glad none of us hit him on the head after all said jack poor old horace tripalong well have to rescue him too said lucyann thatll make up a bit for taking his boat but wont he be furious with us for all weve done huffin appeared at this moment with his familiar gift of half a dozen fish neatly arranged head and tail alternately in his large beak he deposited them at philips feet thanks old man said philip but wont you eat them yourself we darent make a fire here to cook anything on arrrrrr said huffin and walked over to have a look in the empty tins puffin took the opportunity of gobbling up the fish and kiki watched her in disgust kiki had no use for fish fresh from the sea pah she said in horaces voice and the children smiled kiki youll have to be jolly quiet tonight said jack scratching her head no pahing or poohing to warn the enemy were near when the sun began to sink the children took the motorboat a little way out to sea to make sure that there were no rocks about that they must avoid when setting out at night far away on the horizon line they saw the island of the enemy somewhere there was bill and perhaps horace too i hope to goodness we see some kind of light to show us where to go inshore said jack we cant shoot all round the island looking for the right place wed be heard and we couldnt possibly row round well we saw that light that was signalling to the other boat last night said philip maybe it will be signalling again lets go back now there doesnt seem to be any rock to avoid tonight well set out as soon as it is dark they went back and no sooner had they got to their little beach than they heard the humming of an aeroplane surely theyre not going to drop any more packages said jack lie down flat all of you we dont want to be spotted get near those rocks they crouched down near a mass of rocks the aeroplane made an enormous noise as it came nearer and nearer jack gave a cry its a seaplane look its got floats underneath what an enormous one said dinah its coming down so it was it circled the island once and then came lower as it circled it again it seemed almost to brush the hill that towered at the other end of the island the hill that overlooked the lagoon then the engines were cut out and there was a silence shes landed said jack shes on the lagoon i bet you anything you like thats where she is oh do lets go and see as soon as dusk comes begged dinah do you think shes going to get up the hidden guns however could she do that said jack rather scornfully well shes pretty big and hefty said philip its possible shes got some sort of apparatus on her for dragging up the hidden armaments if the men think theres a danger of our government sending patrols up here to look into the matter always supposing that bill has sent a message through to his headquarters then our enemy will certainly try to remove the guns as soon as possible it rather looks seeing that this is a seaplane as if the guns are going to be flown to south america or somewhere far across the sea as soon as it was dusk the children could not resist the temptation to go across the island and climb up the heights to peep over and see the lagoon even in the twilight they might be able to see something interesting they were soon on the cliff overlooking the lagoon they could just make out the great shape of the giant seaplane in the middle of the sealake then suddenly lights shone out from it and a noise began a grating dragging noise as if some kind of machinery was being set to do some heavy work i bet theyre dragging up the packages of guns whispered jack we cant very well see but we can hear enough to know something is at work something needing winches i should think lucyann didnt know what winches were but she could quite well imagine some kind of machinery that would send hooked cables overboard to drag up the heavy bundles of guns then the seaplane when loaded up would fly off again and another would come and another or maybe the same one would come back again and again the lights showed the children the vast shape of the seaplane it looked weird lying quietly there in the middle of the dark lagoon lucyann shivered its awful to be up against enemies who have boats and aeroplanes and seaplanes and guns she thought we havent anything except poor horaces little motorboat and our own wits they went back soberly to their boat the tide had taken it out a little way but as they had tied a rope to a convenient rock they pulled it in without difficulty they all got on board now this is the greatest adventure of all said jack rather solemnly hiding is an adventure escaping is an adventure but rescuing somebody else from the very jaws of the enemy is the greatest adventure of all if only we dont get captured ourselves said lucyann jack started up the engine the little boat nosed out to sea leaving the lagoon island behind huffin and puffin settled themselves on the deckrail as usual and kiki sat on jacks shoulder philips rats frightened at the sudden noise of the engine twined themselves together in a large bump in the hollow of philips back you tickle me he said but the rats took no notice well good luck to us all said dinah may we rescue bill and horace too defeat the enemy and get back home in safety god save the king said kiki devoutly in exactly the same tone of voice and everyone laughed funny old kiki chapter off to the enemys island the little boat sped along in the darkness philip was at the wheel he took a large star as guide and kept the boat well on its course after a while jack touched his arm see that light it must come from the enemys island its not the bright signalling light we saw before but it certainly comes from the island ill set course for it said philip youll make certain kiki doesnt go off into one of her cackles or screeches wont you jack any noise out here on the water would be easily heard on land sound over water carries such a distance ill have to shut off the engine soon or that will be heard kiki wont make a sound said jack shhhhhhh said kiki at once yes good bird shhhhhhh said jack philip shut off the engine and the boat gradually lost way until it was just drifting on then it came to a gentle strip on the restless sea jack looked through his glasses at the light he could see on the island i think it must be some sort of harbour light he said perhaps they have a small harbour there they may have quite a fleet of motorboats you know continually patrolling to make sure no one visits islands near here its quite a steady light philip fumbled for the oars now for a spot of hard rowing he said whats the time jack can you see by your wristwatch its got a luminous face hasnt it its almost eleven oclock said jack just about right we shall be nearing land about midnight when we can hope that the enemy wont be wide awake the boys took an oar each splishsplash the oars went in and out of the water as the boys pulled with a will and the boat glided smoothly along well take turns when youre tired said dinah philip where are your rats something brushed against my leg just now i shant be able to help squealing if you let them run about theyre in my pocket said philip youre imagining things as usual and if you dare to squeal ill jolly well tip you overboard she wont she wont said lucyann its only huffin and puffin walking about the deck dinah one of them perched on my leg just now arrrr said a guttural voice from the deckrail shhhhhh said kiki at once she doesnt understand that it doesnt in the least matter huffin and puffin arrring all they like said jack they make a natural birdnoise that wouldnt put anyone on guard shhhhhh said kiki reprovingly the light from the shore gleamed steadily must be from a lantern said jack in a low voice pulling hard at his oar probably a guide to any motorboat going in or out philip lets have a rest im getting puffed right said philip the girls wanted to take a turn but jack wouldnt let them no you dont row as well together as philip and i do we can keep having a rest if we want to theres no hurry the later we are the better in a way they soon took the oars again and their boat moved steadily over the water towards the light no more talking now whispered jack only tiny whispers lucyanns knees went queer again her tummy felt peculiar too dinah was strung up and her breath came fast although she was not rowing the two boys were tense with excitement would they find the enemys motorboat there with bill already in it ready to be dumped as the man had said that day and would there be many men on guard whatevers that noise whispered dinah at last as their boat drew nearer to land it does sound queer the boys paused in their rowing and leaned on their oars to listen sounds like a band playing said jack of course its a wireless good said philip then the enemy wont be so likely to hear us creeping in jack look i think thats a little jetty there you can just make it out by the light of that lantern can we possibly creep in without being seen or heard and look is that a boat lying under the lantern ill get the glasses said philip and felt about for them he put them to his eyes yes it is a boat quite a big one i should think its the one the enemy came to our island in i bet bill is on it battened down in the cabin the band continued playing on the wireless somebody on board has got it on said jack the guard i should think will he be on deck then the guard i mean theres no light there if you ask me hes having a nice lazy time snoozing on deck with his wireless playing him nice tunes whispered back philip look can you see that little glow jack i bet thats the end of a cigarette the guard is smoking yes it probably is said jack i dont think we dare go in any closer said philip we dont want to be seen if the guard gives the alarm were done for i wonder how many there are on the deck i can only see one glowing cigaretteend what are you going to do whispered lucyann do do something i feel awful i shall burst in a minute philip put out his hand and took hers dont worry he whispered we shall have to do something soon it looks to be rather a good time if only that guard would fall asleep i say tufty do you know what i think would be much the best thing to do said jack suddenly if you and i swam to the harbour climbed up got on the boat and surprised the guard we could probably tip him into the water and before he could raise the alarm wed open up the hatch and get bill out why we could probably drive the motorboat off too then wed have two sounds a good plan said philip but we dont know yet if bill is there and its quite likely we couldnt tip the guard overboard especially if there are more than one wed better do a little exploring first your idea of slipping overboard and swimming to the harbour is jolly good though well certainly do that we can clamber up a part where there are shadows away from that light oh dear must you go swimming in the dark said lucyann looking at the black water with a shiver i should hate it do do be careful jack ill be all right said jack come on philip strip off your clothes well swim in our pants it wasnt long before the boys silently slid overboard and entered the water it was cold and they drew their breaths in sharply but they soon felt warm as they swam rapidly towards the harbour they could hear the wireless more plainly as they came near good thing thought jack they wont be able to hear us coming at all they avoided the light and clambered up the part of the jetty where there were black shadows it was not easy the boats just there whispered jack in philips ear not right under the light thank goodness a sound made them stop suddenly a loud and prolonged yawn came from the deck of the boat then the wireless was snapped off and silence came back to the night he may be going to sleep hissed jack lets wait they waited in complete silence for about ten minutes the man tossed a glowing cigaretteend overboard but did not light another the boys heard him give several grunts as if he was settling down comfortably then he gave a loud yawn again still the boys waited shivering in the darkness of the jetty keeping close to one another in order to get a little bit of warmth from each others bodies then on the night air came very very welcome sounds hes snoring whispered jack pressing philips arm in joy hes asleep im sure theres only one guard because otherwise they would have been talking together nows our chance come on but quietly so as not to wake him the two boys shivering now with excitement as much as with cold crept along the jetty to the boat they climbed cautiously on board their bare feet making no sound at all on the deck lay the sleeping guard if he was a guard then another sound stopped them this time it came from beneath their feet philip clutched jacks bare arm and made him jump violently they stood and listened it was somebody talking down below in the cabin who was it could it be bill and who was he with horace perhaps but maybe after all it wasnt bill down there maybe it was the enemy playing cards and perhaps the sleeping man wasnt a guard it would be very foolish to toss him overboard and open the cabin hatch to find the enemy down in the cabin wed better listen and find out if its bill said jack right in philips ear the boys could see thin streaks of light where the hatch was fitted down into the deck covering in the little cabin so they knew exactly where it was they crept forward and then knelt down by the closed hatch they put their ears to the cracks and strained to listen to the voices talking they could not hear what was being said but when one of the talkers suddenly cleared his throat and gave a little cough the boys knew who it was all right it was one of bills little ways bill was down there it was bill who was talking both boys felt a surge of tremendous relief if only they could get bill out and let him take charge of things if we throw this fellow overboard we may find he raises the alarm so quickly that we shant be able to get bill out and explain things to him fast enough said jack in philips ear as hes so fast asleep what about unbolting the hatch and letting bill see were here then he could help us with the guard and take charge of the boat you undo the hatch and ill stand by the guard so that if he wakes i can knock him overboard said philip go on quick jack felt for the bolt his fingers were trembling and he could hardly pull it he was afraid it might make a grating noise but it didnt it slid back easily and smoothly jack felt for the iron handle that raised the hatch and then lifted up the hatch itself so that a bright mass of light came up from the cabin below the men in the cabin heard the slight noise and looked up one was bill and the other was horace when bill saw jacks face peering down out of the darkness he leapt to his feet in amazement jack put his finger to his lips and bill bit back the exclamation on his tongue come on out whispered jack quick weve got to deal with the guard here but horace spoilt everything as soon as he saw jack the hated boy who had shut him into the hole on puffin island he sprang up furiously theres that villainous boy wait till i get him he shouted chapter escape sh said jack fiercely and pointed over his shoulder towards the guard but it was too late the man awoke with a jump as the shouting penetrated into his dreams he sat up blinking and then seeing the brilliant light streaming up from the open hatch he leapt to his feet bill had the sense to switch off the light now all was darkness bill began to climb up the hatchway and the guard began to shout whats all this hi what are you doing whos there philip sprang at him and tried to push him overboard but the man was strong and began to struggle in the end it was poor philip who was thrown overboard with a most terrific splash then bill came up and guided by the sounds of the panting of the guard hit out with his right fist the surprised guard felt the sudden blow and reeled over bill put out a foot hoping to trip him and down he went to the deck in a trice bill was on top of him and jack came to help who was that going overboard panted bill philip answered jack sitting firmly on the guards legs hes all right he can swim to the other boat get him down into the cabin ordered bill wheres the other fellow tipperlong the idiot spoilt the whole show horace was standing well out of the way wondering what was happening he could hear pants and groans and strugglings and he was scared then there came another yell from the guard and down the man went into the cabin slithering sideways down the steps bang the hatch shut down on him and bill slid the bolt across hes safe for the moment said bill grimly now lets get the boat going quick well be off before the enemy know what were up to thats what i planned wed do panted jack thrilled that his wildest hopes seemed to be coming true how do we start up the engine blow this darkness i havent a torch on me the guard below was kicking up a terrific row he was banging for all he was worth bill made his way in the darkness to the wheel of the boat and then things began to happen lights sprang up on shore and voices began to shout there came the sound of running feet we shant have time to get her free from her moorings and start her up before theyre on us groaned bill did you say youve got another boat here jack where is it and what about philip quick answer me yes theres a boat off the end of the jetty there with the girls in it and philip will probably be there by now too said jack his words falling over one another in his excitement wed better swim for it overboard then said bill tipperlong where are you youd better come too i ccccant swim stammered poor horace well jump overboard and ill help you commanded bill but the thought of leaping into the dark cold water in the middle of the night with enemies all round was too much for horace he crawled into a corner and refused to move well stay where you are then said bill scornfully ill have to go with these kids cant let them down now overboard went bill and jack horace heard the splashes and shivered nothing would have induced him to do the same he trembled in his corner waiting for the enemy to come pounding down the jetty and come they did with torches flashing and voices that urgently demanded from the guard what all the noise was about they swarmed on board the motorboat and found horace at once shivering in his corner they dragged him out the guard was still hammering down in the cabin getting hoarse with fury the enemy not really certain of what had happened flung questions at poor horace bill and jack swimming swiftly through the dark water heard the excited voices and prayed that horace would not give them away the guard would soon tell them all they wanted to know but perhaps the few minutes start they had would be all they needed philip was already on board the boat reassuring the two frightened girls when he heard the splash of bill and jack jumping overboard from the other boat he strained his eyes to watch for them as he caught the sound of their swift armstrokes through the water he cautiously held his torch down over the sea and flicked it on once or twice to mark their way for them they saw the slight flashes of light and thankfully swam towards it jack had been afraid of missing the boat altogether in his excitement soon they were clambering up and lucyann and dinah caught hold of bills wet hairy arms so strong and firm and comforting come on we must get going said bill giving each girl a quick pat my what a row there is on that boat theyve let the guard out now come on before they know where we are the engine will tell them when we start it up said jack weve got oars shall we row no said bill we must get away as quickly as possible theyll chase us and we must get a good start you girls lie flat on your tummies and you boys lie on top of them therell be bullets flying after me in a tick bill started up the engine lucyann and dinah lay down flat the boys lay on top of them almost squeezing the breath out of the girls it was most uncomfortable queerly enough not one of the children felt frightened they all felt a terrific excitement and lucyann had a mad feeling that she would like to yell and dance about it was hard to have to keep flat on the deck with jack squashing her breath out of her as soon as the engine of the motorboat started up there came an astonished silence on board the other boat plainly the guard had not gathered that there was a second boat not far off and had not told his friends about it the enemy had thought that bill and his rescuers were swimming somewhere about and they were still quite in the dark about what had happened but when the engine of bills boat purred out in the night the enemy knew that they must stop it somehow that boat could not be allowed to get away crack somebodys revolver went off and a bullet sped over the sea towards the boat crack crack crack bill crouched as low as he could by the wheel as he heard a bullet whiz much too near the boat for his liking keep down you kids he ordered anxiously well soon be out of reach crack another bullet went pinging by and struck the water beyond the boat bill said several things under his breath and wished the motorboat would go a little faster rrrrrrr went the engine steadily and the boat swung over the waves out to sea crack crack there came a sudden squeal from kiki who was sitting on top of jack puzzled by all the noise and excitement then she screeched wildly oh kikis hit shouted jack and sat up in anxiety feeling for his beloved parrot kiki didnt say a single word but continued to screech as if she was in the most terrible pain jack was beside himself with grief keep down you idiot roared bill sensing that jack was not lying flat do you hear what i say but kiki began jack only to be drowned by an even more furious roar from bill kikis all right she couldnt screech like that if she was really hurt lie down flat and do as youre told jack obeyed orders he lay down again and listened with anxiety to kikis screeching the others quite certain that the bird was wounded were very anxious too lucyann wondered what had happened to huffin and puffin she had not heard them say arrrrr for a long time perhaps they were shot too oh dear when would they be out of reach of the enemy and safe the shooting stopped but another noise came sounding faintly over the chugging of their own boat bills sharp ears heard it theyre after us he called theyve started up their own boat thank goodness its a dark night we might just go on and on till our petrol gives out and hope for the best the motorboat chasing them switched on a powerful searchlight it swept the sea all round were just out of reach said bill thankfully this little boat can certainly get a move on kiki shut up screeching youre not hurt bill we might have enough petrol to get to the island we came from over to the east there said jack suddenly the men would probably think wed try and make for safety miles away and if we do we shall certainly be overtaken their boat is more powerful than ours and as soon as we get within the range of their searchlight well be seen lets swing off to the left what island did you come from demanded bill and whats been happening to you all since i was fool enough to let myself get captured ive been worrying my head off about you we were worried about you too said jack swing her to port bill well make for the lagoonisland and hope that the men wont guess were there the boat set course for the other island across the dark heaving sea far behind them the searchlight was still sweeping the waters but it was plain that the enemys motorboat was now going off in the other direction another few minutes and they would be out of sight and hearing arrrrrrr said a guttural voice from just beyond bill he jumped then he laughed my goodness have you still got huffin and puffin now dont start screeching again kiki im absolutely certain youre not hurt can i sit up now and just feel if kiki is hurt begged jack anxiously theyre not doing any more shooting but before bill could answer the engine of the motorboat gave a series of coughs and wheezes and then with a curious sound like a tired sigh stopped altogether petrols run out said bill bitterly it would of course now well have to row and it wont be long before the enemy catch us up chapter a night of talking the children all sat up at once and the girls thankfully stretched their arms and legs you are heavy philip grumbled dinah oh bill what awful bad luck to have no petrol just as we must be so near shore jack reached out for kiki his hands felt over her body anxiously and down her legs and over her beak where was she hurt kiki nestled close to him murmuring funny little words that had no sense youre not hurt silly bird said jack thankfully you made a fuss for nothing im ashamed of you poor kiki poor kiki send for the doctor murmured kiki and put her head under her wing shes not hurt as far as i can make out said jack to the others but she must have had an awful scare perhaps a bullet zipped very near her oh forget kiki for a moment and lets talk about ourselves said dinah bill what are we going to do bill had sat lost in thought what was the best thing to do it was no joke to be in charge of four children with such dangerous enemies so near would it be best to make for this lagoonisland whatever if was it should at least be within rowing distance or would it be best to row further on well make for your lagoonisland he said at last its the best idea it cant be far away said jack straining his eyes in the darkness i think i can make out a dark shape over there can you philip yes said philip look over there bill can you see not a thing said bill but ill take your word for it you youngsters have got such sharp eyes and ears now where are the oars they were soon found and the slow splishsplash of rowing came to the ears of the girls as they sat huddled together for warmth yes it is land of some sort said bill after a while with satisfaction well be ashore soon i only hope there are no rocks to run aground on oh no said jack well be all right there arent any rocks near the lagoonisland at least not the part where we should be coming to now but hardly were the words out of his mouth before there came a horrid grinding noise and the boat shivered from end to end everyone got a terrible shock whatever was happening now on the rocks said bill grimly and i dont somehow think well get her off she means to stay here all right the boat could not be moved jack anxiously switched on a torch and tried to see what had happened it was only too plain there are rocks all round he said dolefully we havent come to the right part of the island at all goodness knows where we are lets see if were holed said bill and took jacks torch he examined the boat thoroughly and gave a sigh of relief no it looks as if were safe so far she must have run right on to a shallow ledge of rock its no use doing anything about it now well have to wait till its light and then see if we can shift her if we mess about now and do get her off we shall only get on to other rocks at once well lets snuggle down in rugs and have something to eat and talk then said lucyann i should never never be able to go to sleep none of us could tonight said jack ive never felt so wideawake in my life im going to get some clothes on first i havent had time to put any on wasnt i glad to get some rugs round me though im pretty wet through myself said bill ill have a few rugs too i think theres some clothes of horaces in that locker said dinah the one behind you we gave him all of his as we thought but i found some more yesterday tucked away there they wont fit you bill but at least theyll keep you warm good said bill and opened the locker ill put them on now if i can feel what they are in the dark you girls get some food if youve got any pity we cant boil a kettle and get something hot into us soon bill and the boys had dry clothes on then all five of them sat close together for warmth and ate biscuits and chocolate hungrily now suppose we tell each other whats happened since i so hurriedly departed from puffin island said bill you tell your tale first said lucyann pressing close to him oh bill its good to have you back i was so scared when we found you were gone and the engine of the motorboat smashed up and the wireless too yes they told me theyd done that said bill apparently they didnt know you kids were on the island at all so i didnt say a word of course well to make a long story short when i was fiddling about with the wireless that night on our boat trying to get a message through and not succeeding unfortunately oh bill then we shant be rescued said lucyann at once oh we did hope you would have sent a message for help or something well headquarters knew that i was on to something up here but no more than that said bill anyway as i say i was fiddling with the wireless when i suddenly got a blow on the head and down i went then i knew nothing more at all until i woke up on some other island a prisoner in a shack the enemy didnt hurt you did they asked lucyann anxiously bill didnt answer that he went on with his tale they questioned me of course and got nothing out of me at all the queer part was that the very men id been told to disappear from because they were after me were the very men we bumped into up here this was where they were carrying on their activities i had thought it was somewhere in wales but they made me think that by laying false clues oh bill and to think this wild desolate sea with all its little islands was the very place they had chosen and we too chose to come to said jack they must have thought youd found out their hidingplace and had come to track them down just what they did think said bill and whats more they imagined that one or other of their men must have given their secret away and they wanted to find out from me who it was that was why they held me for questioning i imagine instead of bumping me off at once humpydumptybumpy said kiki taking her head out from under her wing but nobody paid the slightest attention bills story was too absorbing they wanted to know how much i knew and who had told me said bill well i didnt actually know very much and what i did know nobody had told me so they didnt get a great deal out of me and they were not pleased didnt you really know very much then said philip astonished i knew this gang were up to something illegal i knew they were getting a lot of money from somewhere i guessed it was something to do with guns said bill i tried to put several spokes in their wheel and they got wise to the fact that i was after them id cleaned up a nasty little business of theirs once before though we didnt get the chief ones then so i wasnt popular and they decided to track you down and bump you off said jack so you were told to disappear and lo and behold you came here to disappear and walked right into the hornets nest agreed bill and took you with me too how is it you kids always attract adventures as soon as i go near you an adventure leaps up and we all get caught in it it is very peculiar said jack go on bill well then my guards suddenly brought mr horace tipperlong to my shack said bill they appeared to think that he was a pal of mine and was up here among these islands to help me in my snooping he was just as bewildered as i was i couldnt make him out at all but when we were alone he began to tell me about you kids and i guessed what had happened you were absolute little demons to him according to his story yes we were said jack remorsefully remembering their treatment of the puzzled and angry horace you see we honestly thought he was one of the enemy got up to look like a rather goofy ornithologist sent to capture us and make us get into his boat so we captured him instead and pushed him down a hole we found and kept him there said dinah and conked him on the head every time he popped up it appears said bill i shouldnt have thought you were so bloodthirsty he said even the girls took turns at hitting him well said everyone in shocked astonishment at such colossal untruths bill we never hit him once i wouldnt have been surprised at the boys giving him one or two knocks if they really thought he was one of the enemy sent to capture them said bill but i simply could not imagine the girls hitting him he said lucyann was the worst oh and i was the only one that said i couldnt possibly said lucyann really shocked at such wicked statements anyway apparently you gave him an awful time and then made off with his boat leaving him to be captured by the enemy said bill you know i couldnt help grinning when i heard it all theres plenty of pluck in you kids the enemy took him off in their boat and didnt believe a word of his story about your taking him prisoner they really thought he was a pal of mine of course i pretended not to believe his tale about there being children on the island either because i didnt want you captured as well but i did wonder what was happening to you when i heard youd taken his boat horace said it was no longer in the little harbour when he was yanked on board the enemys boat i dont like horace said lucyann i hope the enemy give him an awful time hes silly and hes untruthful and hes a coward and if he hadnt yelled out when he did tonight just after id opened the hatch of the cabin to let you out bill wed have been able to capture that big fast motorboat and got right back to the mainland said jack gloomily silly idiot yelling like that yes that was a great pity said bill now you tell me your story so the children told it and bill listened with interest and amazement when they came to the bit about the lagoon and what was hidden there he held his breath in astonishment so thats where they put the guns dropped them by parachute into a secret lagoon and then meant to get them up again as soon as the time was ripe and take them away by seaplane gunrunning on the grand scale we were jolly astonished when we watched it all happening said jack i should think so said bill its beyond belief and to think you children stumbled on the whole secret my word if only i could get a message through to headquarters wed catch the whole gang redhanded its been pretty thrilling said philip we had some scares i can tell you bill youre good kids said bill good and plucky kids im proud of you but theres one thing i dont understand why didnt you make for safety when you captured horaces boat why did you mess about here well said jack you see we had the choice of making for safety or trying to find you and we chose to try and find you bill even lucyann voted for that there was a silence then bill put his big arms all round the huddledup four and gave them such a hug that lucyann gasped i dont know what to say said bill in a queer sort of voice youre only kids but youre the finest company of friends anyone could have you know the meaning of loyalty already and even if youre scared you dont give up im proud to have you for my friends oh bill said lucyann tremendously thrilled to hear such a speech from her hero you ore nice youre our very very best friend and you always will be always said dinah the boys said nothing but they glowed inwardly at bills praise friendship loyalty staunchness in face of danger they and bill both knew these things and recognised them for the fine things they were they felt very close to bill indeed look said lucyann suddenly the dawn over there in the east oh bill i wonder whats going to happen today chapter bill makes a grand find the sky grew silvery in the east then a golden glow spread slowly upwards and the sea became a milky colour that gradually turned to gold almost at once there came a crying of seabirds as guillemots gannets cormorants puffins and gulls came from their roostingplaces to greet the new day soon the sea around the children was dotted thickly with hundreds of birds eagerly seeking fish for food huffin and puffin joined jack gave an exclamation as he looked all round him this isnt the lagoonisland there were no rocky cliffs to it like this facing the sea this is another island weve come to yes it is said philip one i dont remember to have seen before blow where are we i should think it must be the island we once noticed on the chart said lucyann remembering the isle of wings just look at the mass of birds on the waters round us its more than weve ever seen before extraordinary said bill amazed there must be millions of birds some of them are so close that they bob against each other not only the sea was full of birds but the air too and the screaming and calling was deafening soon one bird after another flew up from the water with fish in its beak huffin flew to the boat and presented philip with his usual beakful of neatly arranged fish kikis very quiet said philip looking at her whats the matter with her kiki put up your crest you ridiculous bird send for the doctor said kiki mournfully jack looked at her closely then he gave an exclamation shes lost some of her crest shes hardly got any oh bill thats what she screeched for last night a bullet must have zipped through her crest right through her topknot and taken some of the feathers off with it poor polly poor polly what a pity what a pity said kiki glad to be the centre of attention yes poor old kiki said jack and he fondled her what a shock you must have got no wonder you screeched never mind old thing the crest will grow again youll look a bit mangy for a while but we shant mind bill had been looking to see exactly what had happened to the boat it had run on to a shelf of rock and had settled there so firmly that until high tide came there was no hope of getting off they were not on the mainland of the island but on an outcrop of tall rocks hung with thick seaweed and inhabited by about two hundred or more birds they did not seem to mind the boat and its load of people in the least in fact seeing huffin and puffin perched there some of the birds came on deck too jack was thrilled i dont think the boats damaged at all said bill once she gets afloat again with the tide shell be all right but the thing is what in the world are we going to do if she does get afloat row to safety said lucyann promptly sounds easy said jack scornfully but you dont realise what a wild and desolate sea this is lucyann or how few people ever come to these little birdislands we couldnt possibly row to the mainland for instance could we bill no i dont think so said bill im glad to see weve got a good store of food thats something but what about drinkingwater well have to drink pineapple juice or something like that said dinah and if it rains well catch rainwater what is the best thing to do said bill talking to himself with a frown theyll be looking for us i expect theyll know we couldnt get far theyll send out patrols probably even an aeroplane they cant afford to let me get away now the children knew that they meant the enemy dinah looked all round them if the enemy do come round this island they cant help seeing us wed be spotted at once in our boat well well make up our minds what to do when the boats afloat again said bill at last what about a spot of sleep lucyann is looking as white as a sheet shes had no sleep at all i do feel awfully sleepy admitted lucyann trying not to yawn but i feel dirty and sticky too lets have a quick dip in the sea and then have a snooze said jack we can take it in turn to keep watch for the enemy i dont want a dip said dinah im too sleepy you three and bill have a dip and ill make up our beds again and get the rugs and things set out comfortably ill help you said lucyann im too tired to bathe bill and the boys soon slipped into the water the girls watched them you know said lucyann after a while its almost impossible to see the boys and bill among all those birds bobbing about once i lose sight of them i cant spot them again it was quite true there were so many birds bobbing about on the water that the boys wet dark heads and bills could hardly be picked out from the crowd lets tell bill when they come back said dinah a sudden idea sliding into her head i bet if we all slid into the water if the enemy came nobody would ever spot us among the birds there no they wouldnt agreed lucyann it would be a marvellous idea dinah they told the others when they came back glowing from their bathe bill nodded pleased yes a fine idea if the enemy comes in sight thats what well do our heads would be completely lost among the bodies of the swimming birds what about the boat though said jack we could do what we did for ourselves when we were on the rocks beside the lagoon said philip drape it with seaweed so that it looked like a rock youre full of bright ideas you kids said bill whilst youre all having a snooze ill do a little boatdraping if the enemy come theyll come soon they wont waste many hours before they try to find us ill wake you if i see or hear any sign of them and you must all be prepared to drop over the side of the boat better sleep in your undies so that you dont wet all your clothes your bathingsuits are wet ours arent said lucyann oh dear im so awfully sleepy i do hope the enemy dont come yet im not at all sure i shall wake up if they do bill tucked them all up in rugs they were asleep in a moment or two tired out bill began to do a little boatdraping he pulled great fronds of seaweed off the nearby rocks and hung them over the boatsides till the little vessel looked like a boatshaped rock having finished his task bill sat down in the cabin he idly removed a cover from something there and then stared in surprise a wireless was it a transmitter too surely horace going off all alone into the wilds would have had the sense to take a transmitter with him in case he got hurt or became ill with trembling hands bill began to examine the wireless he gave a loud exclamation that woke up jack the boy sat up in alarm is it the enemy bill no but look here why on earth didnt you tell me there was a wireless in this boat i can get a message through with luck golly i forgot all about it said jack but is it a transmitter bill yes not a very good one but ill do my best to try and work it so that i can send a message to headquarters said bill theres always someone standing by there hoping to hear from me i havent reported for days bill began to hunt about and jack wondered why what are you looking for bill he asked the aerial said bill there must be an aerial somewhere for the transmitter where on earth can it be i remember seeing something on a shelf at the back of the cabin said jack sleepily it was about six feet long that would be it said bill and went to look he pulled out something long and slender good here it is i can soon fix it up jack watched bill for a few minutes then he felt his eyes closing and he slumped down in his rugs again it was very very exciting to watch bill putting up the aerial and trying to make the transmitter work but not even that excitement could make jacks eyes keep open in half a second he was fast asleep again bill worked and worked groaning occasionally with disappointment as first one thing failed and then another curious sounds came from the wireless and little lights glowed here and there within it there was something the matter with it and bill didnt know what if only he knew oh if only he could get the thing to work just for a minute or two at last he thought he had got it fixed now to send a message through now to send out his code number and wait for a reply he sent out his code time and again there was no reply the wireless seemed to be quite dead at his end there was nothing for it but to send a message and hope it would be received but bill had grave doubts about it he rapidly sent a message through in code asking for immediate help he repeated the message time and time again but got no reply at all he gave the lagoonisland as a guide to their whereabouts knowing that they must be somewhere near it surely it must be on some map and could be located he was so busy trying to send his message and listening for a reply which never came that he almost didnt hear the distant purr of a powerful motorboat but the sound did at last penetrate his mind and he looked up with a start he shouted to the children wake up quick into the water with you the enemy are here wake up they all woke up with a jump the enemy splash into the water they slid all five of them the two girls hardly awake the enemy yes there was the motorboat heading straight for them all chapter ahoy there show yourselves there was a sudden flash of sunlight on the lens of a pair of fieldglasses they were being levelled at the island on whose rocks the childrens boat had been grounded the glasses swept the rocks and the island and then came back to the rocks again the boat was there draped from end to end with seaweed the glasses rested on it for a few moments then they swept the sea but among the bobbing birds it was impossible to pick out the five wet heads the children kept as close to swimming birds as possible philip was all right because huffin and puffin perched on his head and hid him beautifully lucyann was near a big cormorant who eyed her with interest but did not swim away from her dinah and jack were among a crowd of bobbing diving puffins and bill fearful of his big somewhat bald head being spotted kept bobbing under the water and holding his breath there as long as he could after what seemed an age the enemys motorboat swung round and went away going right round the island or so bill thought they heard the sound of its engine growing fainter and fainter not until it had completely died away did bill let the children get back into the boat then when he thought it was quite safe they all clambered back wet and hungry but no longer sleepy how slippery the boat is with all this seaweed said jack dinah your idea worked well i dont think the enemy even guessed there was anyone here and there were five people and a boat within easy sight of their glasses yes a very fine idea dinah said bill now what about breakfast im starving they sat down and opened a few tins kiki screeched with delight when she saw the chunks of pineapple in one of them she tried to raise her crest but as she only had one or two feathers left in it it was not a very successful effort jack suddenly thought of something bill do i remember something something about you and horaces wireless or did i dream it yes perhaps i dreamt it you certainly didnt said bill i found horaces wireless most unexpectedly i must say and discovered to my joy that it was a transmitter as well as a receiver so that i ought to be able to send messages as well as receive them oh bill so youve wirelessed for help and we shall be saved said lucyann joyfully unfortunately theres something wrong with the thing said bill couldnt get a chirp out of it and whether or not my messages have gone through i cant tell but probably not its not a very good set this one of horaces oh so its not very likely it was of much use said dinah disappointed not very said bill by the way did anyone feel a slight upward lift then i have an idea the boat is coming off the rocks he was right it was soon afloat and bill took the oars he rowed for some distance away from the island and then a thought struck him look here horace couldnt possibly have come all the way up here and hoped to get back again without a store of petrol have you examined this boat thoroughly no not really thoroughly said jack it isnt much of a boat i grant you that but there really should be some petrol somewhere said bill philip pull those piles of rope and stuff up there would be room under the boards there for tins of petrol philip and jack did as they were told they hauled up three loose boards and there neatly arranged below was horaces store of petrol gosh said jack what a find now well be all right well be on the mainland in no time good old horace they handed bill a tin he emptied it into the petrol tank of the engine and then took another tin that was emptied in too hurrah now they could really make headway soon the engine was purring happily away and the little boat was speeding over the waves no more rowing bill set his course for the southeast hark theres an aeroplane about somewhere said lucyann suddenly i can hear it they all looked up into the sky soon they saw the plane coming from the northeast it was flying low looks as if its trying to spot us said bill uneasily it belongs to the enemy then said jack they all looked intently at the approaching plane it seemed suddenly to see them and veered in their direction it flew down very low circled round them and then made off blow said bill now were for it theyll send out their most powerful motorboat or maybe one of the seaplanes they seem to use and thatll be that well weve got plenty of petrol said jack so we can keep on quickly for miles well be well away from here before long the boat sped on bill giving her her top speed when he reckoned that her petrol would soon be running out he called to jack get out the other tins jack ill put some more in before shes empty but what a shock for the boys all the other tins were empty bill stared in dismay gosh somebody has swindled horace properly he probably gave orders for all the tins to be filled and somebody took the money for the lot and only filled half what a dirty trick but just the sort that would be played on poor silly horace said philip oh bill were out on the open sea now miles away from any island what will we do if the petrol gives out before weve reached anywhere bill wiped his forehead i dont like this he said theres not much left in the tank now once we run out we cant get far with oars and we shall be at the mercy of any fast motorboat sent out to catch us i think perhaps one of the bullets must have glanced off the petrol tank and made it leak a bit nobody said anything oh dear thought lucyann just as we think things are all right they turn out wrong again after a while the engine stopped with a series of coughs and splutters no more petrol said jack gloomily send for the doctor said kiki wish we could said philip arrrrrr said huffin from the deckrail both huffin and puffin were still with the little company lucyann had begun to hope that they would travel right home with them what excitement they would cause this is really disgusting said bill so near and yet so far there was a dead silence and only the plishplash of the sea against the sides of the boat could be heard philips rats surprised at the quiet ran out of their various hidingplaces in his clothes and sniffed the air bill hadnt seen them since he had been captured from puffin island and he stared in surprise my word how theyve grown well well who knows we may have to eat them in the end he meant this as a joke but both lucyann and dinah took it seriously and squealed in horror ugh bill how could you say such a horrible thing eat a rat id rather die said dinah shall we row just for something to do said jack or have a meal or what oh have a meal said philip then a thought struck him i say bill i suppose we oughtnt to start rationing ourselves ought we i mean do you think we may be marooned out here on this lonely sea for days on end no said bill who privately thought that before the day was up they would all be back on the island in the hands of the enemy now that their plane had spotted them no we really dont need to think of things like that at moment all the same i wouldnt have headed out for the open sea as we have done if id thought the petrol was going to give out id have kept near the islands it was a boring and anxious day the four children were still very tired but refused to try and sleep no motorboat appeared in chase of them the sun began to sink in the west and it looked as if the little company was going to spend a night out on the open sea well thank goodness it isnt cold anyway said dinah even the wind is warm tonight dont we seem a long long way from home and from school and from all the ordinary things we know lucyann gazed round her at the vast open sea green near the boat but a deep blue beyond yes she said were far away from everywhere lost on the sea of adventure the sun slid down further still then on the evening air came a familiar sound the throbthrobthrob of a powerful engine everyone sat up straight at once motorboat aeroplane seaplane what was it there it is cried jack making everyone jump look over there golly what a big one its a seaplane it must be the one we saw on the lagoon the other day said dinah theyve sent it after us oh bill what can we do all lie down flat said bill at once youve got to remember that if its the enemy they dont know ive got children with me they probably think there are three or four men in the boat and they may shoot as they did before so lie down flat and dont move dont show your heads at all lucyanns knees began their familiar wobbly feeling she lay down flat at once glad that bill had not suggested that the boys should squash on top of them again bill put his arm over her dont you worry lucyann he said youll be all right they wont hurt children but lucyann didnt want them to hurt bill either and she was very much afraid they would with her pale face pressed into the rugs she lay as still as a mouse the roar of the seaplane came much nearer it circled just overhead then its engine cut out and it landed not far off waves from it rippled under the boat and sent it up and down nobody dared to look overboard and see the great seaplane bill was afraid of a bullet if he did then a colossal voice came booming over the sea the voice of a giant ahoy there show yourselves dont move said bill urgently dont move dont be frightened lucyann theyre using a megaphone thats why the voice sounds so loud the giant voice came again weve got our guns on you any funny business and youll be blown to smithereens show yourselves chapter over the sea of adventure its no good said bill in a low voice i must stand up i dont want them to machinegun the boat he stood up and waved then put both hands up to show that he surrendered a boat put off from the seaplane and come rapidly towards bills boat in it were three men one of them holding a revolver in his hand the children waited panicstricken fearing to hear a shot at bill they had none of them raised their heads but they could picture all too plainly what was happening the boat came near and then there came a loud cry of amazement from it bill by all thats wonderful its bill why on earth didnt you welcome us instead of making us think you were part of the gang good heavens its you joe yelled bill and the relief in his voice brought all the children to their feet at once look here kids its joe my colleague hey joe you got my message then all right the boat came alongside with a gentle bump joe put away his revolver grinning yes i got your wireless message all right but i guess you didnt get ours we kept asking you questions and all you did was to go on repeating the same old thing so this seaplane was sent out and we were just cruising along looking for the lagoon you told us about when we spotted your boat here so down we came to investigate thank goodness said bill wed run out of petrol we were expecting the enemy to send a plane or a boat out after us at any moment come along to the seaplane said joe who had bright blue eyes and a very wide grin will the kids mind flying oh no were used to it said jack and helped the girls into the boat where joe stood are we rescued said lucyann hardly believing it could be true after all their alarms and fears you are said joe and grinned at her sent one of our biggest seaplanes after you to take you home have to do that for bill here you know hes a vip whats that asked lucyann as they sped towards the seaplane very important person of course said joe didnt you know he was yes said lucyann beaming oh yes i always knew he was weve left huffin and puffin behind suddenly wailed dinah good heavens was there somebody else in your boat then said joe in alarm never saw them oh theyre only puffins said jack but awfully nice ones quite tame oh there they are flying after the boat can we take them with us begged lucyann but bill shook his head no lucyann theyd be miserable away from their home here in the islands soon they will nest again and lay an egg then they will forget all about us i shall never never forget them said lucyann they kept with us all the time here we are said joe as they came to the enormous seaplane they were helped into it and then the plane took off smoothly and sweetly circling into the air like a broadwinged gull horaces boat was left bobbing alone waiting for one of the police boats to collect it what about that lagoon said joe suddenly id like to spot it and plot it on our maps i think we can find it will these kids know it if they see it oh yes said jack you cant mistake it its a most extraordinary sealake and much bluer than the sea i shouldnt be surprised if you can see some of the packages under the water if you go down low the waters so clear there the seaplane roared through the sky the children were thrilled down below was the blue sea looking smooth and still then as they looked they saw little islands coming into view what hosts of them there were then jack caught sight of the lagoon there it is there it is he shouted look down there you cant mistake it lying between those two islands shut in by a reef of rocks all the way round the seaplane circled round the surprising lagoon it drooped lower the children watched to see if they could make out any of the underwater packages and sure enough through the clear water glimmered the silverygrey wrappings that covered the hidden guns thats where the guns are said philip look bill you can see the waterproof wrappings they had already begun to lift the packages from the water and load them on to seaplanes we watched them loading one bill and joe exchanged glances weve got some pretty good witnesses then said joe good bunch of kids this bill are they the ones youve gone adventuring with before they are said bill you cant keep them out of adventures you know and they will drag me into them too they left the lagoon with its sinister secret behind them and flew to the island where bill had been a prisoner theres the little jetty said jack as they flew low and look there are two motorboats there now i say bill what about horace horace will be rescued when we clean up these scoundrels said bill theyre the men who make fortunes when one country goes to war with another or when civil war is fought because they get the guns and sell them to each side we try to stop it by all kinds of international treaties but these men are against the law and scorn it thats where i come in to stop them how will you stop them now asked jack will you raid the island and capture the men and destroy all the hidden guns suppose they escape by motorboat or plane dont you worry about that said joe with his wide grin stretching across his brown face weve got messages through already therell be a fleet of our seaplanes up here in a few hours and armed boats patrolling all round theres no hope for any of the gang now except for the little jetty which would hardly have been noticed if the children and bill hadnt known it was there there was nothing to see on the enemys island at all everything well camouflaged said bill a clever lot and ive been after them for a long time they sent me off on all kinds of false trails and id almost given up hope of finding their lair but there it is they must have been surprised to see you up here bill said lucyann as the seaplane left the enemys island behind oh look theres the island where we landed with bill cried dinah puffin island do look theres the birdcliff and you can just see the little narrow channel going into the cliff only you have to look hard to see it and theres where we had our signal fire and theres where we had our tents that blew away in the storm by those few trees said jack and look theres the puffin colony the seaplane flew down as low as it dared it flew low enough for the children to see a moving mass of birds scared of the enormous noise made by the seaplanes powerful engines i can see huffin and puffin cried lucyann the others roared with laughter you cant fibber said dinah no i cant really im pretending to said lucyann i want them to be there always i want them to have their own burrow and a nest and an egg i want them to have a lovely baby puffin that would be tame too goodbye dear huffin and puffin we did so love having you for pets the end
