 chapter one he would be in the pub of course where else would a smart man warm himself on a frigid windblown afternoon certainly not at home by his own fire no tom concannon was a smart man maggie thought and wouldnt be at home her father would be at the pub among friends and laughter he was a man who loved to laugh and to cry and to spin improbable dreams a foolish man some might call him but not maggie never maggie as she steered her racked ng lorry around the last curve that led into the village of kilmihil she saw not a soul on the street no wonder as it was well past time for lunch and not a day for strolling with winter racing in from the atlantic like a hound from icy hades the west coast of ireland shivered under it and dreamed of spring she saw her fathers battered fiat among other vehicles she recognized tim omalleys had a good crowd this day she parked as close as she could to the front entrance of die pub which was nestled in a line of several shops as she walked down the street the wind knocked her back made her huddle inside the fleecelined jacket and pull the black wool cap down lower on her head color whipped into her cheeks like a blush there was a smell of damp under the cold like a nasty threat there would be ice thought the farmers daughter before nightfall she couldnt remember a more bitter january or one dial seemed so hellbent on blowing its frosty breath over county clare the little garden in front of the shop she hurried by had paid dearly what was left of it was blackened by the wind and frost and lay pitifully on the soggy ground she was sorry for it but the news she held inside her was so fearfully bright she wondered the flowers didnt rise up and bloom away into spring there was plenty of warmth in omalleys she felt it nuzzle her the moment she opened the door she could smell the peat burning in the fire its redhot heart smoldering cheerfully and the stew omalleys wife deirdre had served at lunch and tobacco beer the filmy layer that frying chips left in the air she spotted murphy first sitting at one of the tiny tables his boots stretched out as he eased a tune out of an irish accordion that matched the sweetness of his voice the other patrons of the pub were listening dreaming a bit over their beer and porter the tune was sad as the best of ireland was melancholy and lovely as a lovers tears it was a song that bore her name and spoke of growing old murphy saw her smiled a little his black hair fell untidily over his brow so that he tossed his head to clear it away tim omalley stood behind die bar a barrel of a man whose apron barely stretched across the girth of him he had a wide creased face and eyes that disappeared into folds of flesh when he laughed he was polishing glasses when he saw maggie he continued his task knowing she would do what was polite and wait to order until the song was finished she saw david ryan puffing on one of the american cigarettes his brother sent him every month from boston and tidy mrs logan knitting with pink wool while her foot tapped to the tune there was old johnny conroy grinning toothlessly his gnarled hand holding the equally twisted one of his wife of fifty years they sat together like newlyweds lost in murphys song the television over the bar was silent but its picture was bright and glossy with a british soap opera people in gorgeous clothes and shining hair argued around a massive table lit with silverbased candles and elegant crystal its glittery story was more much more than a country away from the little pub with its scarred bar and smokedark walls maggies scorn for the shining characters squabbling in their wealthy room was quick and automatic as a knee jerk so was the swift tug of envy if she ever had such wealth she thought though of course she didnt care one way or the other she would certainly know what to do with it then she saw him sitting in the corner by himself not separate not at all he was as much a part of the room as the chair he sat on he had an arm slung over the back of that chair while the other hand held a cup she knew would hold strong tea laced with irish an unpredictable man he might be full of starts and stops and quick turns but she knew him of all the men she had known she had loved no one with the full thrust of her heart as she loved tom concannon she said nothing crossed to him sat and rested her head on his shoulder love for him rose up in her a fire that warmed down to the bone but never burned his arm came from around the chair and wrapped her closer his lips brushed across her temple when the song was done she took his hand in hers and kissed it i knew youd be here how did you know i was thinking of you maggie my love must be i was thinking of you she sat back to smile at him he was a small man but toughly built like a runt bull he often said of himself with one of his rolling laughs there were lines around his eyes that deepened and fanned out when he grinned they made him in maggies eyes all the more handsome his hair had once been gloriously red and full it had thinned a bit with time and the gray streaked through the fire like smoke he was to maggie the most dashing man in the world he was her father da she said i have news sure i can see it all over your face winking he pulled off her cap so that her hair fell wildly red to her shoulders hed always liked to look at it to watch it flash and sizzle he could still remember when hed held her the first time her face screwed up with the rage of life her tiny fists bunched and flailing and her hair shining like a new coin he hadnt been disappointed not to have a son had been humbled to have been given the gift of a daughter bring me girl a drink tim ill have tea she called out its wicked cold now that she was here she wanted the pleasure of drawing the news out savoring it is that why youre in here singing tunes and drinking murphy whos keeping your cows warm each other he shot back and if this weather keeps up ill have more calves come spring than i can handle as cattle do what the rest of the world does on a long winter night oh sit by the fire with a good book do they maggie said and had the room echoing with laughter it was no secret and only a slight embarrassment to murphy that his love of reading was wellknown now ive tried to interest them in the joys of literature but those cows theyd rather watch the television he tapped his empty glass and im here for the quiet what with your furnace roaring like thunder day and night why arent you home playing with your glass da when murphy walked to the bar maggie took her fathers hand again i needed to tell you first you know i took some pieces to mcguinnesss shop in ennis this morning did you now he took out his pipe tapped it you should have told me you were going id have kept you company on the way i wanted to do it alone my little hermit he said and flicked a finger down her nose da he bought them her eyes as green as her fathers sparkled he bought four of them and thats all i took in paid me for them then and there you dont say maggie you dont say he leaped up dragging her with him and spun her around the room listen to this ladies and gentlemen my daughter my own margaret mary has sold her glass in ennis there was quick spontaneous applause and a barrage of questions at mcguinnesss she said firing answers back four pieces and hell look at more two vases a bowl and a i supposed you could call the last a paperweight she laughed when tim set whiskeys on the counter for her and her father all right then she lifted her glass and toasted to tom concannon who believed in me oh no maggie her father shook his head and there were tears in his eyes to you all to you he clicked glasses and sent the whiskey streaming down his throat fire up that squeeze box murphy i want to dance with my daughter murphy obliged with a jig with the sounds of shouts and clapping hands tom led his daughter around the floor deirdre came out from the kitchen wiping her hands on her apron her face was flushed from cooking as she pulled her husband into the dance from jig to reel and reel to hornpipe maggie whirled from partner to partner until her legs ached as others came into the pub drawn either by the music or the prospect of company the news was spread by nightfall she knew everyone within twenty kilometers would have heard of it it was the kind of fame she had hoped for it was her secret that she wished for more oh enough she sank into her chair and drained her cold tea my hearts about to burst so is mine with pride for you toms smile remained bright but his eyes dimmed a little we should go tell your mother maggie and your sister too ill tell brianna this evening her own mood shifted at the mention of her mother all right then he reached down brushed his hand over her cheek its your day maggie mae nothing will spoil it for you no tis our day for i never would have blown the first bubble of glass without you then well share it just us two for a little while he felt smothered for a minute dizzy and hot he thought he felt a little click behind his eyes before it cleared air he thought he needed a bit of air im in the mood for a drive i want to smell the sea maggie will you come with me of course i will she rose immediately but its freezing out and the winds the devil are you sure you want to go to the cliffs today ive a need to he reached for his coat then tossing a muffler around his throat turned to the pub all the dark smoky colors seemed to whirl in his eyes he thought ruefully that he was a little drunk then again it was the day for it were having us a party tomorrow night itll be with fine food fine drink and fine music to celebrate my daughters success ill expect every one of me friends there maggie waited until they were out in the cold a party da you know shell not have it im still the master of my own house his chin very like his daughters jutted out a party there will be maggie ill deal with your mother would you drive now all right there was no arguing she knew once tom concannon had made up his mind she was grateful for that or she would never have been able to travel to venice and apprentice herself in a glass house never have been able to take what shed learned and what shed dreamed and build her own studio she knew her mother had made tom pay miserably for the money it had cost but he had stood firm tell me what youre working on now well its a kind of a bottle and i want it to be very tall very slim tapered you see from bottom to top then it should flare out a bit like a lily and the color should be very delicate like the inside of a peach she could see it clear as the hand she used to describe it its lovely things you see in your head its easy to see them there she shot him a smile the hard work is making them real youll make them real he patted her hand and fell into silence maggie took the twisting narrow road toward the sea away toward the west the clouds were flying in their sails whipped by the wind and darkened with storm clearer patches were swallowed up then fought their way free to glow gem bright amid the pewter she saw a bowl wide and deep swirled with those warring colors and began to fashion it in her head the road twisted then straightened as she threaded the rattling lorry through hedgerows yellowed with winter and taller than a man a roadside shrine to mary stood at the outskirts of a village the virgins face was serene in the cold her arms spread in generous welcome foolishly bright plastic flowers at her feet a sigh from her father had maggie glancing over he seemed a bit pale to her a little drawn around the eyes you look tired da are you sure you dont want me to take you back home no no he took out his pipe tapped it absently against his palm i want to watch the sea theres a storm brewing maggie mae well have a show from the cliffs at loop head we will at that past the village the road narrowed alarmingly again until she was threading the lorry along like cotton through the eye of a needle a man bundled tight against the cold trudged toward them his faithful dog following stoically at his heels both man and dog stepped off the road into the hedges as the lorry eased by inches from the toe of the mans boots he nodded to maggie and tom in greeting you know what ive been thinking da whats that if i could sell a few more pieces just a few more mind i could have another furnace i want to work with more color you see if i could build another furnace i could have more melts going the firebricks not so costly really but ill need more than two hundred ive a bit put by no not again on this she was firm i love you for it but this ill do on my own he took immediate umbrage and scowled at his pipe whats a father for id like to know if not to give to his children youll not have fancy clothes or pretty baubles so if its firebrick you want then thats what youll have so i will she shot back but ill buy it myself ive a need to do this myself its not the money i want its the faith youve paid me back tenfold already he sat back drawing the window down a crack so that the wind whistled through as he lit his pipe im a rich man maggie i have two lovely daughters each of them a jewel and though a man could ask for no more than that ive a good solid house and friends to count on maggie noticed he didnt include her mother in his treasures and always the pot at the end of the rainbow always that he fell silent again brooding they passed old stone cabins roofless and deserted on the verge of graygreen fields that stretched on endless and impossibly beautiful in the gloomy light and here a church standing against the wind that was unbroken now was blocked only by a few twisted and leafless trees it should have been a sad and lonely sight but tom found it beautiful he didnt share maggies love of solitude but when he looked out on a sight like this with lowered sky and empty land meeting with barely a sight of man between he understood it through the whistling crack of the window he could smell the sea once hed dreamed of crossing it once hed dreamed of many things he had always searched for that pot of gold and knew the failure to find it was his hed been a farmer by birth but never by inclination now hed lost all but a few acres of land enough only for the flowers and vegetables his daughter brianna grew so skillfully enough only to remind him that he had failed too many schemes he thought now as another sigh fetched up in his chest his wife maeve was right about that hed always been full of schemes but never had the sense or the luck to make them work they chugged past another huddle of houses and a building whose owner boasted it was the last pub until new york toms spirits lifted at the sight as they always did shall we sail over to new york maggie and have a pint he said as he always did ill buy the first round he chuckled a feeling of urgency came over him as she pulled the lorry to the end of the road where it gave way to grass and rock and at last to the windswept sea that spanned to america they stepped into a roar of sound that was wind and water lashing furiously against the teeth and fists of black rock with their arms linked they staggered like drunks then laughing began to walk its madness to come here on such a day aye a fine madness feel the air maggie i feel it it wants to blow us from here to dublin town do you remember when we went to dublin we saw a juggler tossing colored balls i loved it so much you learned how yourself his laugh boomed out like the sea itself oh the apples i bruised we had pies and cobblers for weeks and i thought i could make a pound or two with my new skill and took me up to galway to the fair and spent every penny you made on presents for me and brianna his color was back she noted and his eyes were shining she went willingly with him across the uneven grass into the gnashing teeth of the wind there they stood on the edge of the powerful atlantic with its warrior waves striking at the merciless rock water crashed then whipped away again leaving dozens of waterfalls tumbling through crevices overhead gulls cried and wheeled cried and wheeled the sound echoing on and on against the thunder of the waves the spray plumed high white as snow at the base clear as crystal in the beads that scattered in the icy air no boat bobbed on the rugged surface of the sea today the fierce whitecaps rode the sea alone she wondered if her father came here so often because the merging of sea and stone symbolized marriage as much as war to his eyes and his marriage had been forever a battle the constant bitterness and anger of his wifes lashing forever at his heart and gradually oh so gradually wearing it away why do you stay with her da what he pulled his attention back from the sea and the sky why do you stay with her maggie repeated brie and i are grown now why do you stay where youre not happy shes my wife he said simply why should that be an answer she demanded why should it be an end theres no love between you no liking if it comes to that shes made your life hell as long as i can remember youre too hard on her this too was on his head he thought for loving the child so much that hed been helpless not to accept her unconditional love for him a love he knew that had left no room for understanding the disappointments of the woman who had borne her whats between your mother and me is as much my doing as hers a marriage is a delicate thing maggie a balance of two hearts and two hopes sometimes the weights just too heavy on the one side and the other cant lift to it youll understand when youve a marriage of your own ill never marry she said in fiercely like a vow before god ill never give anyone the right to make me so unhappy dont say that dont he squeezed her hard worried theres nothing more precious than marriage and family nothing in the world if thats so how can it be such a prison it isnt meant to be the weakness came over him again and all at once he felt the cold deep in his bones we havent given you a good example your mother and i and im sorry for it more than i can tell you but i know this maggie my girl when you love with all you are it isnt unhappiness alone you risk its heaven too she pressed her face into his coat drew comfort from the scent of him she couldnt tell him that she knew had known for years that it hadnt been heaven for him and that he would never have bolted the door to that marital prison behind him if it hadnt been for her did you love her ever i did and it was as hot as one of your furnaces you came from that maggie mae born in fire you were like one of your finest and boldest statues however much that fire cooled it burned once maybe if it hadnt flared so bright so hard we could have made it last something in his tone made her look up again study his face there was someone else like a honeyed blade the memory was painful and sweet tom looked to sea again as if he could gaze across it and find the woman hed let go aye there was once but it wasnt to be had no right to be ill tell you this when love comes when the arrow strikes the heart theres no stopping it and even bleeding is a pleasure so dont say never to me maggie i want for you what i couldnt have she didnt say it to him but she thought it im twentythree da and eries but a year behind me i know what the church says but im damned if i believe theres a god in heaven who finds joy in punishing a man for the whole of his life for a mistake mistake his brows lowered tom stuck his pipe in his teeth my marriage has not been a mistake margaret mary and youll not say so now nor ever again you and brie came from it a mistake no a miracle i was past forty when you were born without a thought in my head to starting a family i think of what my life would have been like without the two of you where would i be now a man near seventy alone alone he cupped her face in his hands and his eyes were fierce on hers i thank god every day i found your mother and that between us we made something i can leave behind of all the things ive done and not done you and brianna are my first and truest joys now therell be no more talk of mistakes or unhappiness do you hear i love you da his face softened i know it too much i think but i cant regret it the sense of urgency came on him again like a wind whispering to hurry theres something id ask of you maggie what is it he studied her face his fingers molding it as if he suddenly had a need to memorize every feature the sharp stubborn chin the soft curve of cheek the eyes as green and restless as the sea that clashed beneath them youre a strong one maggie tough and strong with a true heart beneath the steel god knows youre smart i cant begin to understand the things you know or how you know them youre my bright star maggie the way eries my cool rose i want you the both of you to follow where your dreams lead you i want that more than i can say and when you chase them down youll chase them as much for me as for yourself the roar of the sea dimmed in his ears as did the light in his eyes for a moment maggies face blurred and faded what is it alarmed she clutched at him hed gone gray as the sky and suddenly looked horribly old are you ill da let me get you back into the lorry no it was vital for reasons he didnt know that he stand here just here at the farthest tip of his country and finish what hed begun im fine just a twinge is all youre freezing indeed his wiry body felt like little more than a bag of icy bones in her hands listen to me his voice was sharp dont let anything stop you from going where you need to go from doing what you need to do make your mark on the world and make it deep so it lasts but dont da panic bubbled inside her as he staggered fell to his knees oh god da what is it your heart no not his heart he thought through a haze of bleary pain for he could hear that beating hard and fast in his own ears but he felt something inside him breaking bursting and slipping away dont harden yourself maggie promise me youll never lose whats inside you youll take care of your sister and your mother youll promise me that youve got to get up she dragged at him fighting off fear the thrash of the sea sounded now like a storm breaking a nightmare storm that would sweep them both off the cliff and onto the spearing rocks do you hear me da youve got to get up now promise me aye i promise i swear it before god ill see to both of them always her teeth were chattering stinging tears already ran down her cheeks i need a priest he gasped out no no you need only to get out of this cold but she knew it was a lie as she said it he was slipping away from her no more how tightly she held his body what was inside him was slipping away dont leave me like this not like this desperate she scanned the fields the beaten paths where people walked year after year to stand as they had stood but there was nothing no one so she bit back a scream for help try da come and try now to get up well get you to a doctor he rested his head on her shoulder and sighed there was no pain now only numbness maggie he said then he whispered another name a strangers name and that was all no as if to protect him from the wind he no longer felt she wrapped her arms tight around him rocking rocking rocking as she sobbed and the wind trumpeted down to the sea and brought with it the first needles of icy rain chapter two thomas concannons wake would be talked about for years there was fine food and fine music as hed planned for his daughters celebration party the house where hed lived out his last years was crowded with people tom hadnt been a rich man some would say but he was a man whod been wealthy in friends they came from the village and the village beyond that from the farms and shops and cottages they brought food as neighbors do for such occasions and the kitchen was quickly stocked with breads and meats and cakes they drank to his life and serenaded his passing the fires burned warm to stave off the gale that rattled the windows and the chill of mourning but maggie was sure shed never be warm again she sat near the fire in the tidy parlor while the company filled the house around her in the flames she saw the cliffs the boiling sea and herself alone holding her dying father maggie startled she turned and saw murphy crouched in front of her he pressed a steaming mug into her hands what is it mostly whiskey with a bit of tea to warm it up his eyes were kind and grieving drink it down now theres a girl wont you eat a little it would do you good i cant she said but did as he asked and drank shed have sworn she felt each fiery drop slide down her throat i shouldnt have taken him out there murphy i should have seen he was sick thats nonsense and you know it he looked fine and fit when he left the pub why hed been dancing hadnt he dancing she thought shed danced with her father on die day he died would she someday find comfort in that but if we hadnt been so far away so alone the doctor told you plain maggie it would have made no difference the aneurysm killed him and it was mercifully quick aye it was quick her hand trembled so she drank again it was the time afterward that had been slow the dreadful time when she had driven his body away from the sea with her breath wheezing in her throat and her hands frozen on the wheel ive never seen a man so proud as he was of you murphy hesitated looked down at his hands he was like a second father to me maggie i know that she reached out brushed murphys hair off his brow so did he so now hed lost a father twice murphy thought and for the second time felt the weight of grief and responsibility i want to tell you to make sure you know that if theres anything anything atall youre needing or your family needs youve only to tell me its good of you to say so and to mean it he looked up again his eyes that wild celtic blue met hers i know it was hard when he had to sell the land and hard that i was the one to buy it no maggie set the mug aside and laid her hands over his the land wasnt important to him your mother she would have blamed a saint for buying it maggie said briskly even though the money it brought put food in her mouth i tell you it was easier that it was you brie and i dont begrudge you a blade of grass thats the truth murphy she made herself smile at him because they both needed it youve done what he couldnt and what he simply didnt want to do youve made the land grow lets not hear any more talk like that she looked around then as if shed just walked out of an empty room into a full one someone was playing the flute and omalleys daughter heavy with her first child was singing a light dreamy air there was a trill of laughter from across the room lively and free a baby was crying men were huddled here and there talking of tom and of the weather of jack marleys sick roan mare and the donovans leaking cottage roof the women talked of tom as well and of the weather of children and of weddings and wakes she saw an old woman an elderly and distant cousin in worn shoes and mended stockings spinning a story for a group of wideeyed youngsters while she knitted a sweater he loved having people around you know the pain was there throbbing like a wound in her voice he would have filled the house with them daily if he could it was always a wonder to him that i preferred to be on my own she drew in a breath and hoped her voice was casual did you ever hear him speak of someone named amanda amanda murphy frowned and considered no why do you ask its nothing i probably mistook it she shrugged it away surely her fathers dying words hadnt been a strange womans name should go help brie in the kitchen thanks for the drink murphy and for the rest she kissed him and rose there was no easy way to get through the room of course she had to stop again and again to hear words of comfort or a quick story about her father or in die case of tim omalley to offer comfort herself jesus ill miss him tim said unabashedly wiping his eyes never had a friend as dear to me and never will again he joked about opening a pub of his own you know giving me a bit of competition i know she also knew it hadnt been a joke but another dream he wanted to be a poet someone else put in while maggie hugged tim and patted his back said hed only lacked the words to be one he had the heart of a poet tim said brokenly the heart and soul of one to be sure a finer man never walked this earth than tom concannon maggie had words with the priest about funeral services set for the next morning and finally slipped into the kitchen it was as crowded as the rest of the house with women busily serving food or making it the sounds and smells were of life here kettles singing soups simmering a ham baking children wandered underfoot so that women with that uncanny maternal grace they seemed to be born with dodged around them or scooped them up as needs demanded the wolfhound puppy that tom had given brianna on her last birthday snored contentedly under the kitchen table brianna herself was at the stove her face composed her hands competent maggie could see the subtle signs of grief in the quiet eyes and the soft unsmiling mouth youll have a plate one of the neighbor women spotted maggie and began to heap food together and youll eat or answer to me i only came in to help youll help by eating some of this food enough for an army it is you know your father once sold me a rooster claimed it was the finest cock in the county and would keep me hens happy for years to come he had a way with him tom did that made you believe what he was saying even though you knew it for nonsense she piled great portions of food on the plate as she spoke taking time out to pat a child out of the way without breaking rhythm well a terrible mean bird he turned out to be and never crew once in his miserable life maggie smiled a bit and said what was expected of her though she knew the tale well and what did you do with the rooster da sold you mrs mayo i wrung the cursed cocks neck and boiled him into stew gave your rather a bowl of it too i did said hed never tasted better in his whole life she laughed heartily and pressed the plate on maggie and was it the meat was stringy and tough as old leather but tom ate every drop bless him so maggie ate because there was nothing she could do but live and go on she listened to the stories and told some of her own when the sun went down and the kitchen slowly emptied she sat down and held the puppy in her lap he was loved maggie said he was brianna stood beside the stove a cloth in her hand and a dazed look in her eyes there was no one left to feed or tend to nothing to keep her mind and her hands busy grief swarmed into her heart like angry bees to hold it off awhile longer she began to put away the dishes she was slim almost willowy with a cool controlled way of moving if there had been money and means she might have been a dancer her hair rosy gold and thick was neatly coiled at the nape of her neck a white apron covered her plain black dress in contrast maggies hair was a fiery tangle around her face she wore a skirt shed forgotten to press and a sweater that needed mending it wont clear for tomorrow brianna had forgotten the dishes in her hands and stared out the window at the blustery night no it wont but people will come just the same as they did today well have them back here after theres so much food i dont know what well do with all of it briannas voice trailed off did she ever come out of her room brianna stood still for a moment then began slowly to stack plates shes not well oh god dont her husbands dead and everyone who knew him came here today she cant even stir herself to pretend it matters of course it matters to her briannas voice tightened she didnt think she could bear an argument now not when her heart was swelling up like a tumor in her chest she lived with him more than twenty years and little else she did with him why do you defend her even now briannas hand pressed a plate so hard she wondered it didnt snap in two her voice remained perfectly calm perfectly reasonable im defending no one only saying whats true cant we keep peace at least until weve buried him cant we keep peace in this house theres never been peace in this house maeve spoke from the doorway her face wasnt ravaged by tears but it was cold and hard and unforgiving he saw to that he saw to it just as hes seeing to it now even dead hes making my life a hardship dont speak of him the fury maggie had held back all day broke through a jagged rock through fragile glass she shoved away from the table sending the dog racing for cover dont you dare to speak ill of him ill speak how i choose maeves hand clutched at the shawl she wore drew it tight to her throat it was wool and shed always wanted silk he gave me nothing but grief while he lived now hes dead and has given me more i see no tears in your eyes mother and you wont ill neither live nor die a hypocrite but speak gods own truth hell go to the devil for whats hes done to me this day her eyes bitter and blue shifted from maggie to brianna and as god wont forgive him neither will i do you know gods mind now maggie demanded has all your prayerbook reading and rosary clacking given you a line straight to the lord youll not blaspheme maeves cheeks reddened with temper youll not blaspheme in this house ill speak how i choose maggie echoed her mothers words with a tight smile ill tell you tom concannon needed none of your stingy forgiveness enough though her insides were trembling brianna laid a steadying hand on maggies shoulder she took a long careful breath to be certain her voice was calm ive told you mother ill give the house to you youve nothing to worry about whats this maggie turned to her sister what about the house you heard what it said at the will reading brianna began but maggie shook her head i didnt take any of it in lawyers talk i wasnt paying attention he left it to her still trembling maeve lifted a finger and jabbed it out as an accusation he left the house to her all the years i suffered and sacrificed and he takes even that from me shell settle down right enough when she knows she has a sturdy roof over her head and no need to do anything to keep it maggie said once her mother left the room it was true enough and brianna thought she could maintain the peace shed had a lifetime of practice ill keep the house and shell stay here i can tend them both saint brianna maggie murmured but there was no malice in it well manage it between us the new furnace would have to wait she decided but as long as mcguinness kept buying there would be enough to hold the two houses together ive thought about da and i talked about it a little while ago and ive been thinking brianna hesitated maggie pushed aside her own thoughts just say it it needs some fixing up i know and ive only a bit left of what gran left me and theres the lien ill be paying off the lien no thats not right its perfectly right maggie got up to fetch the teapot he took it to send me to venice didnt he mortgaged the house and weathered the gale mother brought down on his head for doing it i had three years of training thanks to him and ill pay it back the house is mine briannas voice firmed and sos the hen her sister had a soft look about her but maggie knew brianna could be mule stubborn when it suited her well we can argue that to death well both pay it off if you wont let me do it for you brie let me do it for him ive a need to well work it out brianna took the cup of tea maggie poured her tell me what youve been thinking all right it felt foolish she could only hope it didnt sound so i want to turn the house into a bandb a hotel stunned maggie could only stare you want to have paying guests nosing about the place youll have no privacy at all brianna and youll be working from morning till night i like having people around brianna said coolly not everyone wants to be a hermit like you and ive a knack for it i think for making people comfortable its in the blood she stuck out her chin granda ran a hotel didnt he and gran ran it after he died i could do it i never said you couldnt i just for the life of me cant see why youd want to strangers in and out every day why it gave her the shudders just to imagine it i can only hope theyll come the bedrooms upstairs will need freshening of course briannas eyes blurred as she thought through the details some paint some paper a new rug or two and the plumbing needs work god knows the fact is wed need another bath altogether but i think the closet down at the end of the hall upstairs would serve i might have a little apartment added off the kitchen here for mother so she wont be disturbed and id add a bit to the gardens put up a little sign nothing on a grand scale you see just small and tasteful and comfortable you want this maggie murmured seeing the light in her sisters eyes you truly do i do yes i want it then do it maggie grabbed her hands just do it brie freshen your rooms and fix your plumbing put up a fine sign he wanted it for you i think he did he laughed when i talked to him about it in that big way he had aye he had a grand laugh and he kissed me and joked about me being an innkeepers granddaughter and following tradition if started small enough i could open for summer this year the tourists they come to the west counties in the summer especially and they look for a nice comfortable place to spend the night i could brianna shut her eyes oh listen to this talk and were burying our father tomorrow its just what hed want to hear maggie was able to smile again a grand scheme like that hed have cheered you on we concannons brianna shook her head were great ones for scheming brianna that day on the cliff he talked of you he called you his rose hed want you to bloom and shed been his star maggie thought she was going to do whatever she could to shine chapter three she was alone as she liked best from the doorway of her cottage she watched the rain lashing murphy muldoons fields slashing wildly over the grass and stone while the sun beamed hopefully stubbornly behind her there was the possibility of a dozen different weathers in the layered sky all brief and fickle that was ireland but for margaret mary concannon the rain was a fine thing she often preferred it to the warm slant of sun and the clear brilliance of cloudless blue skies the rain was a soft gray curtain tucking her away from the world or more important cutting out the world beyond her view of hill and field and sleek spotted cows for while the farm the stone fences and green grasses beyond the tangle of fuchsia no longer belonged to maggie or her family this spot with its small wild garden and damp spring air was her own she was a farmers daughter true enough but no fanner was she in die five years since her lathers death shed set about making her own place and the mark hed asked her to make perhaps it wasnt so deep as yet but she continued to sell what she made in galway now and cork as well as ennis she needed nothing more than what she had wanted more perhaps but she knew that desires no matter how deep and dragging didnt pay the bills she also knew that some ambitions when realized carried a heavy price if from time to time she grew frustrated or restless she had only to remind herself that she was where she needed to be and doing what she chose to do but on mornings like this with the rain and the sun at war she thought of her father and of the dreams hed never seen come true hed died without wealth without success and without the farm that had been plowed and harvested by concannon hands for generations she didnt resent the fact that so much of her birthright had been sold off for taxes and debts and the highblown fantasies of her father perhaps there was a tug of sentiment and regret for the hillocks and fields she had once raced over with all the arrogance and innocence of youth but that was past indeed she wanted no part of the working of it the worrying over it she had little of the love of growing things that stirred her sister brianna true she enjoyed her garden the big defiant blooms and the scents that wafted from them but the flowers grew despite her periods of neglect she had her place and anything beyond it was out of her realm and therefore most usually out of her mind maggie preferred needing no one and certainly needing nothing she could not provide herself dependence she knew and the longing for more than what you had led to unhappiness and discontent she had her parents example before her pausing there just past the open door into the chilling rain she breathed in the air the damp sweetness of it tinged with spring from the blackthorn blossoms that formed a hedgerow to the east and the early roses struggling into bloom to the west she was a small woman shapely beneath the baggy jeans and flannel shirt over her shoulderlength fiery hair she wore a slouch hat as gray as the rain beneath its bill her eyes were the moody mystical green of the sea the rain dampened her face the soft curve of cheek and chin the wide melancholy mouth it dewed the creamy redheads complexion and joined the gold freckles scattered over the bridge of her nose she drank the strong sweet breakfast tea from a glass mug of her own design and ignored the phone that had begun to shrill from the kitchen ignoring the summons was as much policy as habit particularly when her mind was drifting toward her work there was a sculpture forming in her head as clear as a raindrop she thought pure and smooth with glass flowing into glass in the heart of it the pull of the vision beckoned dismissing the ringing phone she walked through the rain toward her workshop and the soothing roar of the glass furnace from his offices in dublin rogan sweeney listened to the ring of the phone through the receiver and swore he was a busy man too busy to waste his time on a rude and temperamental artist who refused to answer the sharp knock of opportunity he had businesses to see to calls to answer files to read figures to tally he should while the day was young go down to the gallery and oversee the latest shipment the native american pottery was after all his baby and hed spent months selecting the best of the best but that of course was a challenge already met that particular show would once again ensure that worldwide was a top international gallery meanwhile the woman the damn stubborn clarewoman was crowding his mind though hed yet to meet her facetoface she and her genius occupied too much of his mind the new shipment would of course receive as much of his skill energy and time as it required but a new artist particularly one whose work had so completely captured his imagination excited on a different level the thrill of discovery was as vital to rogan as the careful development marketing and sale of an artists works he wanted concannon exclusively for worldwide galleries as with most of his desires all of which rogan deemed quite reasonable he wouldnt rest until it was accomplished hed been raised to succeed the third generation of prosperous merchants who found clever ways to turn pence into pounds the business his grandfather had founded sixty years before flourished under his leadership because rogan sweeney refused to take no for an answer he would achieve his goals by sweat by charm by tenacity or any other means he deemed suitable margaret mary concannon and her unbridled talent was his newest and most frustrating goal he wasnt an unreasonable man in his own mind and would have been shocked and insulted to discover that he was described as just that by many of his acquaintances if he expected long hours and hard work from his employees he expected no less of himself drive and dedication werent merely virtues to rogan they were necessities that had been bred in his bones he could have handed the reins of worldwide over to a manager and lived quite comfortably on the proceeds then he could travel not for business but for pleasure enjoying the fruits of his inheritance without sweating over the harvesting he could have but his responsibility and thirsty ambition were his birthrights and m m concannon glass artist hermit and eccentric was his obsession he was going to make changes in worldwide galleries changes that would reflect his own vision that would celebrate his own country m m concannon was his first step and hed be damned if her stubbornness would make him stumble she was unaware because she refused to listen rogan thought grimly that he intended to make her worldwides first native irish star in the past with his father and grandfather at the helm the galleries had specialized in international art rogan didnt intend to narrow the scope but he did intend to shift the focus and give the world the best of the land of his birth he would risk both his money and his reputation to do it if his first artist was a success as he fully intended her to be his investment would have paid off his instincts would have been justified and his dream a new gallery that showcased works exclusively by irish artists would become reality to begin he wanted margaret mary concannon annoyed with himself he rose from his antique oak desk to stand by the window the city stretched out before him its broad streets and green squares the silver glint that was the river and the bridges that spanned it below traffic moved in a steady stream laborers and tourists merging on the street in a colorful stream in the sunlight they seemed very distant to him now as they strolled in packs or twosomes he watched a young couple embrace a casual linking of arms meeting of lips both wore backpacks and expressions of giddy delight he turned away stung by an odd little arrow of envy he was unused to feeling restless as he was now there was work on his desk appointments in his book yet he turned to neither since childhood hed moved with purpose from education to profession from success to success as had been expected of him as he had expected of himself hed lost both of his parents seven years before when his father had suffered a heart attack behind the wheel of his car and had smashed into a utility pole he could still remember the grim panic and the almost dreamy disbelief that had cloaked him during the flight from dublin to london where his mother and father had traveled for business and the horrible sterile scent of hospital his father had died on impact his mother had lived barely an hour longer so they had both been gone before hed arrived long before hed been able to accept it but theyd taught him a great deal before hed lost them about family and pride of heritage the love of art the love of business and how to combine them at twentysix hed found himself the head of worldwide and its subsidiaries responsible for staff for decisions for the art placed in his hands for seven years hed worked not only to make the business grow but to make it shine it had been more than enough for him this unsettled sensation the dilemma of it he knew had its roots in the breezy winter afternoon when he had first seen maggie concannons work that first piece spied during an obligatory tea with his grandmother had started him on this odyssey to possess no he thought uncomfortable with the word to control he corrected he wanted to control the fate of the artistry and the career of the artist since that afternoon hed been able to buy only two pieces of her work one was as delicate as a daydream a slim almost weightless column riddled with shimmering rainbows and hardly larger than the span of his hand from wrist to fingertip the second and the one he could admit privately haunted and enticed him was a violent nightmare fired from a passionate mind into a turbulent tangle of glass it should have been unbalanced he thought now as he studied the piece on his desk it should have been ugly with its wild war of colors and shapes the grasping tendrils curling and clawing out of the squat base instead it was fascinating and uncomfortably sexual and it made him wonder what kind of woman could create both pieces with equal skill and power since he had purchased it a little more than two months before he had tried with no success to contact the artist and interest her in patronage he had twice reached her by phone but the conversation on her part had been brief to the point of rudeness she didnt require a patron particularly a dublin businessman with too much education and too little taste oh that had stung she was she had told him in her musical west county brogue content to create at her own pace and sell her work when and where it suited her she had no need for his contracts or for someone to tell her what must be sold it was her work was it not so why didnt he go back to his ledgers of which she was certain he had plenty and leave her to it insolent little twit he thought firing up again here he was offering a helping hand a hand that countless other artists would have begged for and she snarled at it he should leave her to it rogan mused leave her to create in obscurity it was certain that neither he nor worldwide needed her but damn it all he wanted her on impulse he picked up his phone and buzzed his secretary eileen cancel my appointments for die next couple of days im going on a trip it was a rare thing for rogan to have business in the west counties he remembered a family holiday from childhood most usually his parents had preferred trips to paris or milan or an occasional break in the villa they kept on the french mediterranean there had been trips that had combined business and pleasure new york london bonn venice boston but once when he had been nine or ten they had driven to the shannon area to take in the wild glorious scenery of the west he remembered it in patches the dizzying views from the cliffs of mohr the dazzling panoramas and gembright waters of the lake district the quiet villages and the endless green of farmlands beautiful it was but it was also inconvenient he was already regretting his impulsive decision to make the drive particularly since the directions hed been given in the nearby village had taken him onto a pitted excuse for a road his aston martin handled it well even as the dirt turned to mud under the ceaseless driving rain his mood didnt negotiate the potholes as smoothly as did his car only stubbornness kept him from turning back the woman would listen to reason by god he would see to it if she wanted to bury herself behind hedges of furze and hawthorn it was her business but her art was his or would be following the directions hed been given at the local post office he passed the bedandbreakfast called blackthorn cottage with its glorious gardens and trim blue shutters farther on there were stone cabins sheds for animals a hay barn a slateroofed shed where a man worked on a tractor the man lifted a hand in salute then went back to work as rogan maneuvered the car around the narrow curve the farmer was the first sign of life other than livestock he had seen since leaving the village how anyone survived in this godforsaken place was beyond him hed take dublins crowded streets and conveniences over the incessant rain and endless fields every day of the week scenery be damned shed hidden herself well he thought hed barely caught sight of the garden gate and the whitewashed cottage beyond it through the tumbling bushes of privet and fuchsia rogan slowed though hed nearly been at a crawl in any case there was a short drive occupied by a faded blue lorry going to rust he pulled his dashing white aston behind it and got out he circled around to the gate moved down die short walk that cut between heavyheaded brilliant flowers that bobbed in the rain he gave the door which was painted a bold magenta three sharp raps then three again before impatience had him stalking to a window to peer inside there was a fire burning low in the grate and a sugan chair pulled up close a sagging sofa covered in some wild floral print that mated reds and blues and purples teetered in a corner he would have thought hed mistaken the house but for the pieces of her work set throughout the small room statues and bottles vases and bowls stood sat or reclined on every available surface rogan wiped the wet from the window and spied the manybranch candelabra positioned dead center of the mantel it was fashioned of glass so clear so pure it might have been water frozen in place the arms curved fluidly up the base a waterfall he felt the quick surge the inner click that presaged acquisition oh yes hed found her now if shed just answer the damn door he gave up on the front and walked through the wet grass around to the back of the cabin more flowers growing wild as weeds or he corrected growing wild with weeds miss concannon obviously didnt spend much time tidying her beds there was a leanto beside the door under which bricks of turf were piled an ancient bike with one flat tire was propped beside them along with a pair of wellingtons that were muddy to the ankles he started to knock again when the sound coming from behind him had him turning toward the sheds the roar constant and low was almost like the sea he could see the smoke pluming out of the chimney into the leaden sky the building had several windows and despite the chilly damp of the day some were propped open her workshop no doubt rogan thought and crossed to it pleased that he had tracked her down and confident of the outcome of their meeting he knocked and though he received no answer shoved the door open he had a moment to register the blast of heat the sharp smells and the small woman seated in a big wooden chair a long pipe in her hands he thought of fairies and magic spells close the door damn you theres a draft he obeyed automatically bristling under the sharp fury of the order your windows are open ventilation draft idiot she said nothing more nor did she spare him so much as a glance she set her mouth to the pipe and blew he watched the bubble form fascinated despite himself such a simple procedure he thought only breath and molten glass her fingers worked on the pipe turning it and turning it fighting gravity using it until she was satisfied with the shape she thought nothing of him at all as she went about her work she necked the bubble using jacks to indent a shallow grove just beyond the head of the pipe there were steps dozens of them yet to take but she could already see the finished work as clearly as if she held it cool and solid in her hand at the furnace she pushed the bubble under the surface of the molten glass heated there to make the second gather back at the bench she rolled the gather in a wooden block to chill the glass and form the skin all the while the pipe was moving moving steady and controlled by her hands just as the initial stages of the work had been controlled by her breath she repeated the same procedure over and over again endlessly patient completely focused while rogan stood by the door and watched she used larger blocks for forming as the shape grew and as time passed and she spoke not a word he took off his wet coat and waited the room was filled with heat from the furnace it felt as though his clothes were steaming on his body she seemed sublimely unaffected centered on her work reaching for a new tool now and then while one hand constantly revolved the pipe the chair on which she sat was obviously homemade with a deep seat and long arms hooks set here and there where tools hung there were buckets nearby filled with water or sand or hot wax she took a tool one that looked to rogan to be a pair of sharppointed tongs and placed diem at the edge of the vessel she was creating it seemed they would flow straight through the glass so resembled water but she drew the shape of it out lengthening it slimming it when she rose again he started to speak but a sound from her something like a snarl had him lifting a brow and keeping his silence fine then he thought he could be patient an hour two hours as long as it took if she could stand this vicious heat so by christ could he she didnt even feel it so intent was she she dipped a punt another gather of molten glass onto the side of the vessel she was creating when the hot glass had softened the wall she pushed a pointed file coated with wax into the glass gently gently flames sparked under her hand as the wax burned she had to work quickly now to keep the tool from sticking to the glass the pressure had to be exactly right for the effect she wanted the inner wall made contact with the outer wall merging creating the inner form the angel swing glass within glass transparent and fluid she nearly smiled carefully she reblew the form before flattening the bottom with a paddle she attached the vessel to a hot pontil she plunged a file into a bucket of water dripping it onto the neck groove of her vessel then with a stroke that made rogan jolt she struck the file against the blowpipe with the vessel now attached to the pontil she thrust it into the furnace to heat the lip taking the vessel to the annealing oven she rapped the pontil sharply with a file to break the seal she set the time and the temperature then walked directly to a small refrigerator it was low to the floor so she was forced to bend down rogan tilted his head at the view the baggy jeans were beginning to wear quite thin in several interesting places she straightened turned and tossed one of the two softdrink cans she taken out in his direction rogan caught the missile by blind instinct before it connected with his nose still here she popped the top on her can and drank deeply you must be roasting in that suit now that her work was out of her mind and her eyes clear of the visions of it she studied him tall lean dark she drank again well styled hair as black as a ravens wing and eyes as blue as a kerry lake not hard to look at she mused tapping a finger against the can as they stared at each other he had a good mouth nicely sculpted and generous but she didnt think he used it often for smiling not with those eyes as blue as they were and as appealing they were cool calculating and confident a sharply featured face with good bones good bones good breeding her granny used to say and this one unless she was very mistaken had blue blood beneath the bone the suit was tailored probably english the tie discreet there was a wink of gold at his cuffs and he stood like a soldier the son that had earned plenty of brass and braid she smiled at him content to be friendly now that her work had gone well are you lost then no the smile made her look like a pixie one capable of all sorts of magic and mischief he preferred the scowl shed worn while shed worked ive come a long way to speak with you miss concannon im rogan sweeney her smile tilted a few degrees into something closer to a sneer sweeney she thought the man who wanted to take over her work the jackeen she used the term not terribly flattering for a dubliner well youre a stubborn one mr sweeney thats the truth i hope you had a pleasant drive so your trip wont be wasted it was a miserable drive pity but i dont consider the trip wasted though he would have preferred a strong cup of tea he opened the softdrink can you have an interesting setup here he scanned theroom with its roaring furnace its ovens and benches the jumble of metal and wooden look the rods the pipes and the shelves and cupboards he imagined held her chemicals i do well enough as i believe i told you over the phone that piece you were working on when i came in it was lovely he stepped over to a table cluttered with sketch pads pencils charcoal and chalk he picked up a sketch of the glass sculpture now annealing it was delicate fluid do you sell your sketches im a glass artist mr sweeney not a painter he shot her a look set the sketch down again if you were to sign that i could get a hundred pounds for it she let out a snort of disbelief and tossed her empty can into a waste bin and the piece youve just finished how much will you ask for it and why would that be your business perhaps id like to buy it she considered scooting up on the edge of a bench and swinging her feet no one could tell her the worth of her work not even herself but a price a price had to be set she knew that well for artist or not she had to eat her formula for figuring price was loose and flexible unlike her formulas for making glass and mixing colors it had very little to do with science she would calculate the time spent on producing the piece her own feelings toward it then factor in her opinion of the purchaser her opinion of rogan sweeney was going to cost him dear two hundred and fifty pounds she decided a hundred of that was due to his gold cuff links ill write you a check then he smiled and maggie realized she was grateful he didnt seem to use that particular weapon often lethal she thought watching the way his lips curved his eyes darkened charm floated down on him light and effortless as a cloud and though ill add it to my personal collection for sentiment shall we say i could easily get double that for it at my gallery tis a wonder you stay in business mr sweeney soaking your clients that way you underestimate yourself miss concannon he crossed to her then as if he knew hed suddenly gained the upper hand he waited until shed tipped her head back to keep her eyes level with his thats why you need me i know exactly what im doing in here he lifted an arm to encompass the room ive aeen that quite dramatically for myself but the business world is a different matter im not interested in business precisely he told her smiling again as if shed answered a particularly thorny question i on the other hand am fascinated by it she was at a disadvantage sitting on the bench with him hovering over her and she didnt care for it i dont want anyone messing in my work mr sweeney i do what i choose when i choose and i get along very well you do what you choose when you choose he picked up a wooden form from the bench as if to admire the grain and you do it very well what a lots it would be for someone with your talent to merely get along as to messing about with your work i have no intention of doing so though watching you work was certainly interesting his eyes cut from the mold back to her with a speed that made her jolt very interesting she pushed off the bench the better to stand on her own feet to gain the room required she shoved him aside i dont want a manager ah but you need one margaret mary you need one badly a lot you know about what id be needing she mumbled and began to pace some dublin sharpie with fancy shoes twice as much hed said her mind replayed his earlier words twice what shed asked and there was mother to care for and the bills to pay and sweet jesus the price of chemicals was murderous what i needs peace and quiet and room she whirled back at him his very presense in the studio was crowding her room i dont need someone like you coming along and telling me we need three vases for next week or twenty paperweights or a half dozen goblets with pink stems im not an assembly line sweeney im an artist very calmly he took a pad and a gold pen out of his pocket and began to write what are you doing there im noting down that youre not to be given orders for vases paperweights or goblets with pink stems her mouth twitched once before she controlled it i wont take orders at all his eyes flicked to hers i believe thats understood i own a factory or two miss concannon and know the difference between an assembly line and art i happen to make my living through both thats fine for you then she waved both arms before setting her fists on her hips congratulations why would you be needing me i dont he replaced the pen and pad but i want you her chin angled up but i dont want you no but you need me and there is where well complement each other ill make you a rich woman miss concannon and more than that a famous one he saw something flicker in her eyes at that ah he thought ambition and he turned the key easily in the lock do you create just to hide your gift on your own shelves and cupboards to sell a few pieces here and there to keep the wolf from the door and horde the rest or do you want your work appreciated admired even applauded his voice changed subtly into a tone of sarcasm so light it stabbed bloodlessly or are you afraid it wont be her eyes went molten as the blade struck true im not afraid my work stands i spent three years apprenticing in a venice glass house sweating as a pontil boy i learned the craft there but not the art because the art is in me she thumped a hand on her chest its in me and i breathe in and out into the glass any who dont like my work can jump straight into hell fair enough ill give you a show at my gallery and well see how many take the jump a dare damn him she hadnt been prepared for it so a bunch of art snobs can sniff around my work while they slurp champagne you are afraid she hissed through her teeth and stomped to the door go away go away so i can think youre crowding my head well talk again in the morning he picked up hii coat perhaps you can recommend a place i could stay the night close by blackthorn cottage at the end of the road yes i saw it he slipped into his coat lovely garden very trim neat and tidy as a pin youll find the beds soft and the food good my sister owns it and she has a practical homemaking soul he lifted a brow at the tone but said nothing then i trust ill be comfortable enough until morning just get out she pulled open the door to the rain ill call the cottage in the morning if i want to talk to you again a pleasure meeting you miss concannon though it wasnt offered he took her hand held it while he looked into her eyes a greater one watching you work on an impulse that surprised both of them he lifted her hand to his lips lingered just a moment over the taste of her skin ill be back tomorrow wait for an invitation she said and closed the door smartly behind him chapter four at blackthorn cottage the scones were always warm the flowers always fresh and the kettle always on the boil though it was early in the season for guests brianna concannon made rogan comfortable in her serenely efficient manner as she had all the other guests shes welcomed since that first summer after her fathers death she served him tea in the tidy polished parlor where a fire burned cheerfully and a vase full of freesia scented the air ill be serving dinner at seven if that suits you mr sweeney she was already thinking of ways to stretch the chicken shed planned to cook so it would feed one more that will be fine miss concannon he sipped die lea and found it perfect a far cry from the chilly sugarladen soft drink maggie had tossed at him you have a lovely place here thank you it was if not her only pride perhaps her only joy if you need anything anything at all youve only to ask if i could make use of the phone of course she started to step away to give him privacy when he held up a hand a signal of command to anyone who has served the vase there on the table your sisters work briannas surprise at the question showed only in the quick widening of her eyes it is yes you know of maggies work i do i have two pieces myself and ive just purchased another even as it was made he sipped his tea again measuring brianna as different from maggie as one piece of her work was from another which meant he assumed that they were the same somewhere beneath what the eye could see ive just come from her workshop you were in maggies workshop only true shock would have driven brianna to ask a question of a guest with such a tone of disbelief inside is it so dangerous then a hint of a smile crossed briannas face lightening her features you seem to be alive and well well enough your sister is an immensely talented woman that she is rogan recognized the same undercurrent of pride and annoyance in the statement as he had when maggie had spoken of her sister do you have other pieces of hers a few she brings them by when the mood strikes her if youll not be needing anything else at the moment mr sweeney ill see about dinner alone rogan settled back with his excellent tea an interesting pair he thought the concannon sisters brianna was taller slimmer and certainly more lovely than maggie her hair was rose gold rather than flame and fell in soft curls to her shoulders her eyes were a wide pale green almost translucent quiet he thought even a trifle aloof like her manner her features were finer her limbs softer and shed smelled of wildflowers rather than smoke and sweat all in all she was much more the type of woman he found appealing yet he found his thoughts trailing back to maggie with her compact body her moody eyes and her uncertain temper artists he mused with their egos and insecurities needed guidance a firm hand he let his gaze roam over the rosecolored vase with its swirls of glass from base to lip he was very much looking forward to guiding maggie concannon so is he here maggie slipped out of the rain into the warm fragrant kitchen brianna continued to peel potatoes shed been expecting the visit who is he sweeney crossing to the counter maggie snatched a peeled carrot and bit in tall dark handsome and rich as sin you cant miss him in the parlor you can take in a cup and join him for tea i dont want to talk to him maggie hitched herself up on the counter crossed her ankles what i wanted brie love is your opinion of him hes polite and wellspoken maggie rolled her eyes sos an altar boy in church hes a guest in my home a paying one and ive no intention brianna went on without pause of gossiping about him behind his back saint brianna maggie crunched down on the carrot gestured with the stub of it what if i were to tell you that hes after managing my career managing briannas hands faltered before they picked on the rhythm again peelings fell steadily on the newspaper shed laid on the counter in what way financially to start displaying my work in his galleries and talking rich patrons into buying it for great sums of money she waved the remains of the carrot before finishing it off all the man can think about is making money galleries brianna repeated he owns art galleries in dublin and cork he has interests in others in london and new york paris too i think probably rome everybody in the art world knows rogan sweeney the artworld was as removed from briannas life as the moon but she felt a quick warm pride that her sister could claim it and hes taken an interest in your work stuck his aristocrats nose in is what hes done maggie snorted calling me on the phone sending letters all but demanding rights to everything i make now today he pops up on my doorstep telling me that i need him hah and of course you dont i dont need anyone you dont no brianna carried the vegetables to the sink to rinse not you margaret mary oh i hate that tone all cold and superior you sound just like mother she slid off the counter to stalk to the refrigerator and because of it she was swamped with guilt were getting along well enough she added as she pulled out a beer the bills are paid theres food on the table and a roof over all our heads she stared at her sisters stiff back and let out a sound of impatience it cant be what it once was brie you think i dont know that briannas lilting voice turned edgy do you think i have to have mere that i cant be content with what is suddenly unbearably sad she stared out the window toward the fields beyond its not me maggie tisnt me maggie scowled down at her beer it was brianna who suffered maggie knew brianna who had always been in the middle now maggie thought she had the chance to change that all she had to do was sell part of her soul shes been complaining again no brianna tucked a stray hair away in the knot at the nape of her neck not really i can tell by the look on your face shes been in one of her moods and taking it out on you before brianna could speak maggie waved a hand shell never be happy brianna you cant make her happy the good lord knows i cant shell never forgive him for being what he was and what was he brianna demanded as she turned around just what was our father maggie human flawed she set her beer down and walked to her sister wonderful do you remember brie the time he bought the mule and was going to make a fortune having tourists snap pictures of it in a peaked cap with our old dog sitting on its back i remember brie would have turned away but maggie grabbed her hands and i remember he lost more money feeding that cursed badtempered mule than he ever did with his scheming oh but it was fun we went to the cliffs of mohr and it was such a bright summer day the tourists swarming about and the music playing and there was da holding that stupid mule and that poor old dog joe as terrified of that mule as he would have been of a roaring lion brianna softened she couldnt help it poor joe sitting and shivering with fear on that mules back then that german came along wanting a picture of himself with joe and the mule and the mule kicked maggie grinned and picked up her beer again for a toast and the german screamed in three different languages white he hopped about on one foot and joe terrified leaped off and landed right on a display of lace collars and the mule ran scattering tourists oh what a sight people shouting and running ladies screaming there was a fiddler there remember and he just kept playing a reel as if wed all start dancing any moment and that nice boy from killarney caught the mules lead and dragged him back da tried to sell him the mule there and then and nearly did its a good memory brie he made many memories worth laughing over but you cant live on laughter alone and you cant live without it as she would he was alive now it seems this familys more dead than he is shes ill brianna said shortly as she has been for more than twenty years and ill shell stay as long as she has you to tend to her hand and foot it was true but knowing the truth didnt change briannas heart shes our mother that she is maggie drained the beer and set it aside the yeasty taste warred with the bitterness on her tongue ive sold another piece ill have money far you by the end of the month im grateful for it so is she the hell she is maggie looked into her sisters eyes with all the passion and anger and hurt boiling beneath i dont do it for her when theres enough youll hire a nurse and youll move her into her own place that isnt necessary it is maggie interrupted that was the agreement brie ill not stand by and watch you dance to her tune for the rest of her life a nurse and a place in the village if thats what she wants thats what shell have maggie inclined her head she kept you up last night she was restless embarrassed brianna turned back to prepare the chicken one of her headaches ah yes maggie remembered her mothers headaches well and how well timed they could be an argument maeve was losing instant headache a family outing she didnt approve of the throbbing began i know what she is maggie briannas own head began to ache that doesnt make her less of my mother saint brianna maggie thought again but with affection her sister might be younger than her own twentyeight by a year but it had always been brianna who took responsibility and you cant change what you are brie maggie gave her sister a fierce hug da always said youd be the good angel and i the bad he was finally right about something she closed her eyes a moment tell mr sweeney to come by the cottage in the morning ill speak with him youll let him manage you then the phrase had maggie wincing ill speak with him she repeated and headed back into the rain if maggie had a weakness it was family that weakness had kept her up late into the night and had awakened her early in the chill murky dawn to the outside world she preferred to pretend she had responsibilities only to herself and her art but beneath the facade was a constant love of family and the dragging often bitter obligations that went with it she wanted to refuse rogan sweeney first on principle art and business to her mind could not and should not mix she wanted to refuse him secondly because his type wealthy confident and blueblooded irritated her thirdly and most telling she wanted to refuse him because to do otherwise was an admission that she lacked the skill to handle her affairs aloneoh that was a pill that stuck bitterly in her throat she would not refuse him shed made the decision sometime during the long and restless night to allow rogan sweeney to make her rich it wasnt as though she couldnt support herself and well too shed been doing just that for more than five years briannas bed and breakfast was successful enough that keeping two homes was no heavy burden but they could not between them afford a third maggies goal indeed her holy grail was to establish their mother in a separate residence if rogan could help clear the path to her quest shed deal with him shed deal with the very devil but the devil might come to regret the bargain in her kitchen with the rain falling soft and steady outside maggie brewed tea and plotted rogan sweeney had to be cleverly handled she mused with just the right amount of artistic disdain and feminine flattery the disdain would be no problem at all but the other ingredient would be hard coming she let herself picture brianna baking gardening curled up with a book by the fire without the whining demanding voice of their mother to spoil the peace brianna would marry have children which maggie knew was a dream her sister kept locked in her heart and locked it would stay as long as brianna had the responsibility of a chronic hypochondriacwhile maggie couldnt understand her sisters need to strap herself down with a man and a half a dozen children she would do whatever it took to help brianna realize the dream it was possible just possible that rogan sweeney could play fairy godfather the knock on the front door of the cottage was brisk and impatient this fairy godfather maggie thought as she went to answer wouldnt make his entrance with angel dust and colored lights after opening the door she smiled a little he was wet as hed been the day before and just as elegantly dressed she wondered if he slept in a suit and tie good morning to you mr sweeney and to you miss concannon he stepped inside out of the rain and die swirl of mist shall i take your coat itll dry out some by the fire thank you he slipped out of his overcoat watched her spread it over a chair by the fire she was different today he thought pleasant the change put him on guard tell me does it do anything but rain in clare we enjoy good soft weather in the spring dont worry mr sweeney even a dubliner shouldnt melt in a westcounty rain she sent him a quick charming smile but her eyes were wickedly amused im brewing tea if youd like some i would before she could turn to the kitchen he stopped her a hand on her arm his attention wasnt on her but on the sculpture on the table beside them it was a long sinuous curve in a deep icy blue the color of an arctic lake glass clung to glass in waves at the tip then flowed down liquid ice an interesting piece he commented do you think so maggie blocked the urge to shake off his hand it held her lightly with an understated possession that made her ridiculously uncomfortable she could smell him the subtle woodsy cologne hed probably dashed on after shaving with undertones of soap from his shower when he ran a fingertip along the length of the curved glass the suppressed a shudder for a moment a foolish one it had felt as though hed trailed a touch from her throat to her center obviously feminine he murmured though his eyesstayed on the glass he was very aware of her the coiled tension in her arm the quick tremble shed tried to mask the dark wild scent of her hair powerful a woman about to surrender sexually to a man it flustered her because he was exactly right how do you find power in surrender he looked at her then those depthless blue eyes locked on her face his hand remained light on her arm nothings more powerful than a woman at that instant before she gives herself he stroked the glass again obviously youre aware of that and the man he smiled then just the faintest curve of lips his grip on her arm seemed more of a caress now a request and his eyes amused interested skimmed over her face that margaret mary would depend on the woman she didnt move absorbed the sexual punch acknowledged it with a slight nod well we agree on something sex and power generally depend on the woman thats not at all what i said or meant what draws you to create something like this its difficult to explain art to a man of business when she would have stepped back he curled his fingers around her arm tightened his grip try annoyance pricked through her what comes to me comes theres no plot no plan it has to do with emotions with passions and not with practicality or profit otherwise id be making little glass swans for gift shops jesus what a thought his smile widened horrifying fortunately im not interested in little glass swans but i would like that tea well have it in the kitchen she started to step away again and again his grip stopped her temper flashed into her eyes like lightning youre blocking my way sweeney i dont think so im about to clear it for you he released her and followed her silently into the kitchen her cottage was a far cry from the country comfort of blackthorn there were no rich smells of baking wafting in the air no plumped pillows or gleaming woodwork it was spartan utilitarian and untidy which was why he supposed the art carelessly set here and there was that much more effective and striking he wondered where she slept and if her bed was as soft and inviting as the one hed spent the night in and he wondered if he would share it with her no not if he corrected himself when maggie set the teapot on the table along with two thick pottery mugs did you enjoy your stay at blackthorn cottage she asked as she poured i did your sisters charming and her cooking memorable maggie softened added three generous spoons of sugar to her tea bries a homemaker in the best sense of the word did she make her currant buns this morning i had two of them relaxed again maggie laughed and propped one booted foot on her knee our father used to say brie got all the gold and i the brass im afraid you wont get any homebaked buns here sweeney but i could probably dig out a tin of biscuits no need youd probably rather get straight to business cupping the mug in both hands maggie leaned forward what if i were to tell you plain im not interested in your offer rogan considered sipping his tea black and strong td have to call you a liar maggie he grinned at the are that erupted in her eyes because if you werent interested you wouldnt have agreed to see me this morning and i certainly wouldnt be drinking tea in pour kitchen he held up a hand before she could speak well agree however that you dont want to be interested a clever man she mused only slightly mollified clever men were dangerous ones ive no wish to be produced or managed or guided we rarely wish for what we need he watched her over the rim of his cup calculating even as he enjoyed the way the faint flush seemed to silken her skin deepen the green of her eyes why dont i explain myself more clearly your art is your domain i have no intention of interfering in any way with what you do in your studio you create what youre inspired to create when youre inspired to create it and what if what i create isnt to your taste ive shown and sold a great number of pieces i wouldnt care to have in my home thats the business maggie and as i wont interfere with your art you wont interfere with my business ill have no say in who buys my work none he said simply if you have an emotional attachment to a piece youll have to get over it or keep the piece for yourself once its in my hands its mine her jaw clenched and anyone with the money can own it exactly maggie slapped the mug down and sprang up to pace she used her whole body a habit rogan admired legs arms shoulders all in rhythmically angry movements he topped off his tea and sat back to enjoy the show i pull something out of myself and i create it make it solid tangible real and some idiot from kerry or dublin or god help me london comes in and buys it for his wifes birthday without having the least understanding of what it is what it means do you develop personal relationships with everyone who buys your work at least i know where its going whos buying it usually she added to herself ill have to remind you that i bought two of your pieces before we met aye and look where thats got me temperament he thought with a sigh as long as hed worked with artists hed never understood it maggie he began trying for the most reasonable of tones the reason you need a manager is to eliminate these difficulties you wont have to worry about the sales only the creation and yes if someone from kerry or dublin or god help you london comes into one of my galleries and takes an interest in one of your pieces its his as long as he meets the price no resume no character references required and by the end of a year with my help youll be a rich woman is that what you think i want insulted infuriated she whirled on him do you think rogan sweeney that i pick up my pipe every day calculating how much profit there might be at the end of it no i dont thats precisely where i come in youre an exceptional artist maggie and at the risk of inflating what appears to be an already titanic ego ill admit that i was captivated the first time i saw your work perhaps you have decent taste she said with a cranky shrug so ive been told my point is that your work deserves more than youre giving it you deserve more than youre giving yourself she leaned back on the counter eyeing him narrowly and youre going to help me get more out of the goodness of your heart my heart has nothing to do with it im going to help you because your work will add to the prestige of my galleries and to your pocketbook one day youll have to explain to me the root of your disdain for money in the meantime your teas getting cold maggie let out a long breath she wasnt doing a good job of flattering him she reminded herself and returned to the table rogan she let herself smile im sure youre very good at what you do your galleries have a reputation for quality and integrity which im sure is a reflection of yourself she was good he mused and ran his tongue over his teeth very good i like to think so doubtless any artist would be thrilled to be considered by you but im accustomed to dealing for myself for handling all the aspects of my work from making the glass to selling the finished piece or at least placing it into the hands of someone i know and trust to sell it i dont know you or trust me she lifted a hand let it fall i would be a fool not to trust worldwide galleries but its difficult for me to imagine a business of that size im a simple woman he laughed so quickly so richly that she blinked before she could recover he was leaning forward taking one of her hands in his oh no margaret mary simple is exactly what you are not canny obstinate brilliant badtempered and beautiful you are but simple never i say i am she yanked her hand free and struggled not to be charmed and i know myself better than you do or ever will every time you finish a sculpture youre shouting out this is who i am at least for today thats what makes art true she couldnt argue with him it was an observation she hadnt expected from a man of his background making money from art didnt mean you understood it apparently he did im a simple woman she said again daring him to contradict her a second time and i prefer to stay that way if i agree to your management there will be rules mine he had her and he knew it but a wise negotiator was never a smug one what are they he asked ill do no publicity unless it suits me and i can promise you it wont itll add to the mystery wont it she very nearly grinned before she recovered ill not be after dressing up like some fashion plate for showings if i come at all this time he tucked his tongue firmly in his cheek tin sure your sense of style will reflect your artistic nature it might have been an insult but she couldnt be sure and i wont be nice to people if i dont want to be temperament again artistic he toasted her with his tea should add to sales though she was amused she sat back and crossed her arms over her chest i will never never duplicate a piece or create something out of someone elses fancy he frowned shook his head that may be a deal breaker i had this idea for a unicorn with a touch of gold leaf on the horn and hooves very tasteful she snickered then gave up and laughed out loud all right rogan maybe by some miracle well be able to work together how do we do it ill have contracts drawn up worldwide will want exclusive rights to your work she winced at that it felt as though she were surrendering a part of herself perhaps the best part exclusive rights to the pieces i choose to sell of course she looked past him out the window toward the fields beyond once long ago they like her art had felt like part of her now they were just part of a lovely view what else he hesitated she looked almost unbearably sad it wont change what you do it wont change who you are youre wrong she murmured with an effort she shook off the mood and faced him again go on what else ill want a show within two months at the dublin gallery naturally ill need to see what you have finished and ill arrange for shipping ill also need you to keep me apprised of what youve completed over the next few weeks well price the pieces and whatever inventory is left after the show will be displayed in dublin and our other galleries she took a long calming breath id appreciate it if youd not refer to my work as inventory at least in my presence done he steepled his fingers you will of course be sent a complete itemization of pieces sold you may if you choose have some input as to which ones we photograph for our catalog or you can leave it up to us and how and when am i paid she wanted to know i can buy the pieces outright i have no objection to that since i have confidence in your work she remembered what hed said before about getting twice as much as what hed paid her for the sculpture shed just finished she might not have been a businesswoman but she wasnt a fool how else do you handle it by commission we take the piece and when and if we sell it we deduct a percentage more of a gamble she mused and she preferred a gamble what percentage do you take hoping for a reaction he kept his eyes level with hers thirtyfive percent she made a strangled sound in her throat thirtyfive thirtyfive you thief you robber she shoved back from the table and stood youre a vulture rogan sweeney thirtyfive percent be damned and you with it i take all the risks i have all the expenses he spread his hands steepled them again you have merely to create oh as if all it takes is sitting on me ass and waiting lor the inspiration to come fluttering down like raindrops you know nothing nothing about it she began to pace again swirling the air with temper and energy ill remind you youd have nothing to sell without me and its my work my sweat and blood that theyll spend good money for youll get fifteen percent ill get thirty plague take you rogan for a horse thief twenty twentyfive he rose then to stand toe to toe with her worldwide will earn a quarter of your sweat and mood maggie i promise you a quarter she hissed through her teeth thats a businessman for you preying on art and making the artist financially secure think of it maggie your work will be seen in new york in rome and paris and no one who sees it will forget it oh its clever you are rogan taking a quick turn from money into fame she scowled at him then stuck out her hand the hell with it and you youll have your twentyfive percent which was exactly what hed planned on he look her hand held it were going to do well together maggie well enough she hoped to settle her mother in the village and away from blackthorn cottage if we dont rogan ill see that you pay for it because hed enjoyed the taste of her he lifted her hand to his lips ill risk it his lips lingered there long enough to make her pulse stutter if you were going to try to seduce me youd have been smarter to start before we had a deal the statement both surprised and annoyed him i prefer to keep personal and professional matters separate another difference between us it pleased her to see shed scratched the seamlessty polite exterior my personal and professional lives are always fusing and i indulge both when the whim strikes smiling she slipped her hand from his it hasnt as yet personally speaking ill let you know if and when it does are you baiting me maggie she stopped as if thinking it through no im explaining to you now ill take you to the glass house so you can choose what you want shipped to dublin she turned to pull a jacket from a peg by the back door you might want your coat itd be a shame to get that fancy suit wet he stared at her a moment wondering why he should feel so completely insulted without a word he turned on his heel and strode back into the living room for his coat maggie took the opportunity to step outside and cool her blood in the chilly rain ridiculous she told herself to get so sexually tied up over having her hand kissed rogan sweeney was smooth too smooth it was a fortunate thing he lived on die other side of the country more fortunate yet he wasnt her type not at all chapter five the high grass beside the ruined abbey made a lovely resting place for the dead maggie had fought to have her father buried there rather than in the tidy and cold ground near the village church she had wanted the peace and the touch of royalty for her father for once brianna had argued with her until their mother had sullenly closed her mouth and washed her hands of the arrangements maggie visited there only twice a year once on her fathers birthday and once on her own to thank him for the gift of her life she never came on the anniversary of his death nor did she allow herself to mourn in private nor did she mourn him now but sat down on the grass beside him tucking her knees up and wrapping her arms around them the sun fought through layers of clouds to gild the graves and the wind was fresh smelling of wildflowers she hadnt brought flowers with her never did brianna had planted a bed right over him so that as spring warmed the earth his grave sprang with color and beauty tender buds were just forming on the primroses the fairy heads of columbine nodded gently among the tender shoots of larkspur and betony she watched a magpie dart over headstones and sway toward a field one for sorrow she thought and searched the sky fruitlessly for the second that would stand for joy butterflies fluttered nearby flashing thin silent wings she watched them for a time taking comfort in the color and the movement there had been no place to bury him near the sea but this she thought this place would have pleased him maggie leaned back comfortably on the side of her fathers headstone and closed her eyes i wish you were still here she thought so i could tell you what im doing not that id listen to any of your advice mind but it would be good to hear it if rogan sweeneys a man of his word and i cant see how hed be anything else ill be a rich woman how youd enjoy that thered be enough for you to open your own pub like you always wanted oh what a poor farmer you were darling but the best of fathers the very best she was doing her best to keep her promise to him she thought to take care of her mother and her sister and to follow her dream maggie she opened her eyes and looked up at brianna tidy as a pin she thought studying her sister her lovely hair all scooped up her clothes neatly pressed you look like a school teacher maggie said and laughed at briannas expression a lovely one you look like a ragpicker brianna retorted scowling at maggies choice of ripped jeans and a tattered sweater a lovely one brianna knelt beside her sister and folded her hands not to pray just for neatness sake they sat in silence for a moment while the wind breathed through the grass and floated through the tumbled stones a lovely day for grave sitting maggie commented hed have been seventyone today she thought his flowers are blooming nicely needs some weeding and brianna began to do so i found the money on the kitchen counter this morning maggie its too much it was a good sale youll put some of it by id rather you enjoyed it i am knowing youre that much closer to having her out brianna sighed she isnt a burden to me catching her sisters expression she shrugged not as much as you think only when shes feeling poorly which is most of the time brie i love you i know you do the moneys the best way i know how to show it da wanted me to help you with her and the good lord knows i couldnt live with her as you do shed lend me to the madhouse or id send myself to prison by murdering her in her sleep this business with rogan sweeney you did it for her i did not maggie bristled at the thought of it because of her perhaps which is a different matter altogether once shes settled and you have your life back youll get married and give me a horde of nieces and nephews you could have your own children i dont want marriage comfortable maggie closed her eyes again no indeed i prefer coming and going as it suits me and answering to no one ill spoil your children and theyll come running to aunt maggie whenever youre too strict with them she opened one eye you could marry murphy briannas laugh carried beautifully over the high grass it would shock him to know it he was always sweet on you he was yes when i was thirteen no hes a lovely man and im as fond of him as i would be of a brother but hes not what im looking for in a husband youve got it all planned then ive nothing planned brianna said primly and were getting off the subject i dont want you to join hands with mr sweeney because you feel obliged to me i might think its the best thing you could do for your work but i wont have you unhappy because you think i am because im not how many times did you have to serve her a meal in bed this month i dont keep an accounting you should maggie interrupted in any case its done i signed his contracts a week ago im now being managed by rogan sweeney and worldwide galleries ill have a show in his dublin gallery in two weeks two weeks thats so fast he doesnt seem to be a man to waste time come with me brianna maggie grabbed her sisters hands well make sweeney pay for a fancy hotel and well eat out in restaurants and buy something foolish shops food she hadnt cooked herself a bed that didnt have to be made brianna yearned but only for a moment id love to be with you maggie but i cant leave her like that the hell you cant jesus she can stand her own company for a few days i cant brianna hesitated then sat back wearily on her haunches she fell last week was she hurt maggies fingers tightened on her sisters damn it brie why didnt you tell me how did it happen i didnt tell you because it turned out to be no great matter she was outside went out on her own while i was upstairs tidying rooms lost her footing it seems she bruised her hip jarred her shoulder you called dr hogan of course i did he said there was nothing to worry about shed lost her balance was all and if the got more exercise ate better and all the rest shed be stronger who didnt know that damn the woman maggie thought and damn the constant and incessant guilt that lived in her own heart and its back to bed she went ill wager and has stayed there ever since briannas lips twitched into a wry smile i havent been able to budge her she claims she has an innerear deficiency and wants to go into cork to a specialist hah maggie tossed back her head and glared at the sky its typical never have i known anyone with more complaints than maeve concannon and shes got you on a string my girl she jabbed a finger at brianna i wont deny it but i havent the heart to cut it i do maggie stood brushed at her knees the answers money brie its what shes always wanted god knows she made his life a misery because he couldnt hang on to it in a gesture of protection maggie laid a hand on her fathers headstone thats true and he made hers a misery as well two people less suited ive never seen marriages arent always made in heaven or in hell sometimes theyre just stuck in purgatory and sometimes people are too foolish or too righteous to walk away the hand on the headstone stroked once then dropped away i prefer fools to martyrs put the money by brie therell be more coming soon ill see to that in dublin will you see her before you go i will maggie said grimly i think youll enjoy her rogan dipped into the clotted cream for his scone and smiled at his grandmother shes an interesting woman interesting christine rogan sweeney lifted one sharp white brow she knew her grandson well could interpret every nuance of tone and expression on the subject of maggie concannon however he was cryptic in what way he wasnt sure of that himself and stalled for time by stirring his tea shes a brilliant artist her vision is extraordinary yet she lives alone in a little cottage in clare and the decor is anything but aesthetically unique shes passionate about her work but reluctant to show it shes by turns charming and rude and both seem to be true to her nature a contradictory woman very he settled back a man completely content in the gracious parlor sevres cup in his hand and his head resting against the brocade cushion of a queen anne chair a fire burned quietly in the grate the flowers and the scones were fresh he enjoyed these occasional teas with his grandmother as much as she did the peace and order of her home were soothing as was she with her perpetual dignity and softly faded beauty he knew she was seventythree and took personal pride in the fact that she looked ten years younger her skin was pale as alabaster lined yes but the marks of age only added to the serenity of her face her eyes were brilliantly blue her hair as soft and white as a first snowfall she had a sharp mind unquestionable taste a generous heart and a dry sometimes biting wit she was as rogan had often told her his ideal woman it was a sentiment that flattered christine as much at it concerned her he had failed her in only one way that was to find a personal contentment that equalled his professional one how are preparations for the show going she asked very well it would be easier if our artist of the moment answered her damn phone he brushed that irritation away the pieces that have been shipped in are wonderful youll have to come by the gallery and see for yourself i may do that but she was more interested in the artist than in the art did you say she was a young woman hmmm maggie concannon did you mention she was oh middle twenties id expect young certainly for the scope of her work lord it was like drawing teeth and flashy would you say like what was her name miranda whitfieldfry the one who did metal sculpture and wore all the heavy jewelry and colored scarves shes nothing like miranda thank christ he remembered with a shudder how relentlessly and embarrassingly the woman had pursued him maggies more the boots and cotton shirt type her hair looks like she had a whack at it with kitchen shears unattractive then no very attractive but in an unusual sense mannish no he recalled uncomfortably the vicious sexual tug the sensual scent of her the feel of that quick involuntary tremble under his hand far from it ah christine thought she would definitely make time to meet the woman who put that scowl on rogans face she intrigues you certainly i wouldnt have signed her otherwise he caught christines look and raised a brow in an identical manner its business grandmother just business of course smiling to herself she poured him more tea tell me what else youve been up to rogan arrived at the gallery at eight am the next morning hed enjoyed an evening at the theater and a late supper with a sometimes companion as always hed found patricia charming and delightful the widow of an old friend she was to his mind more of a distant cousin than a date theyd discussed the eugene oneill play over salmon and champagne and had parted with a platonic kiss at just after midnight and he hadnt slept a wink it hadnt been patricias light laugh or her subtle perfume that had kept him tossing maggie concannon he thought naturally the woman was in the forefront of his mind since most of his time and effort was focused on her upcoming show it was hardly any wonder that he was thinking of her particularly since it was all but impossible to speak to her her aversion to the phone had caused him to retort to telegrams which he fired off to the west with blistering regularity her one and only answer had been brief and to the point stop nagging imagine rogan thought as he unlocked the elegant glass doors of the gallery shed accused him of nagging like some spoiled whiny child he was a businessman for gods sake one about to give her career an astronomical boost and she wouldnt even spare the time to pick up the damn phone and have a reasonable conversation he was used to artists sweet mary knew he had dealt with their eccentricities their insecurities their often childish demands it was his job to do so and he considered himself adept but maggie concannon was trying both his skill and his patience he relocked the doors behind him and breathed to the quietly scented air of the gallery built by his grandfather the building was lofty and grand a striking testament to art with its gothic stonework and carved balusters the interior consisted of dozens of rooms some small some large all flowing into the next with wide archways stairs curved up fluidly to a second story that housed a ballroomsize space along with intirnate parlors fitted with antique sofas it was there he would show maggies work in the ballroom he would have a small orchestra while the guests enjoyed the music the champagne the canapes they could browse among her strategically placed works the larger bolder pieces he would highlight showcasing smaller pieces in more intimate settings imagining it refining the pictures in his mind he walked through the lower gallery toward the office and storage rooms he found his gallery manager joseph donahoe pouring coffee in the kitchenette youre here early joseph smiled showing the flash of one gold tooth coffee yes i wanted to check on the progress upstairs before heading into the office coming right along joseph assured him though the two men were of an age josephs hair was thinning on top he compensated for the loss by growing it long enough to tie in a streaming ponytail his nose had been broken once by a wayward polo mallet and so listed a bit to the left the result was the look of a pirate in a savile row suit the women adored him you look a bit washedout insomnia rogan said and took his coffee black did yesterdays shipment get unpacked joseph winced i was afraid youd ask he lifted his cup and muttered into it hasnt come in what joseph rolled his eyes hed worked for rogan for more than a decade and knew that tone it didnt arrive yesterday im sure itll be along this morning thats why i came in early myself what is that woman doing her instructions were very specific very simple she was to ship the last of the pieces overnight shes an artist rogan she probably got struck by inspiration and worked past the time to post it weve got plenty of time i wont have her dragging her feet incensed rogan snapped up the kitchen phone he didnt have to look up maggies number in his address book he already knew it by heart he stabbed buttons and listened to the phone ring and ring irresponsible twit joseph took out a cigarette as rogan slammed the receiver we have more than thirty pieces he said as he flicked an ornate enameled lighter even without this last shipment its enough and the work rogan even a jaded old hand like me is dazzled thats hardly the point is it joseph blew out smoke pursed his lips actually it is yes we agreed on forty pieces not thirtyfive not thirtysix forty and by god forty is what ill have rogan where are you going he called out rogan stormed from the kitchen goddamn clare took another drag on his cigarette and toasted the air with his coffee cup bon voyage the flight was a short one and didnt give rogans temper time to cool the feet that the sky was gloriously blue the air balmy didnt change a thing when he slammed the door on his rental car and headed away from shannon airport he was still cursing maggie by the time he arrived at her cottage he was at full boil the nerve of the woman he thought as he stalked up to her front door pulling him away from his work from his obligations did she think she was the only artist he represented he pounded on her door until his fist throbbed ignoring manners he pushed the door open maggie he called out striding from the living room to the kitchen damn you without pausing he stamped through the back door and headed for her workshop he should have known shed be there she glanced up from a workbench and a mountain of shredded paper good i could use some help with this why the hell dont you answer the bloody phone why have the damn thing if youre going to ignore it i often ask myself the same thing pass me that hammer will you he lifted it from the bench hefted the weight a moment as the very pleasant image of bopping her on the head with it flitted into his brain where the devils my shipment its right here she dragged a hand through her untidy hair before taking the hammer from him im just packing it up it was supposed to be in dublin yesterday well it couldnt be because i hadnt sent it yet with quick expert moves she began to hammer the crate on the floor and if youve come this way to check on it i have to say you dont enough to do with your time lifted her off the floor and plunked her down the workbench the hammer clanked on concrete barely missing his foot before shed drawn the breath to spit at him he caught her chin in his hand i have more than enough to do with my time he said evenly and babysitting for an irresponsible woman interferes with my schedule i a staff at the gallery one whose timetable is even meticulously thought out all you had was follow instructions and ship the damn merchandise she slapped his hand away i dont give a tinkers about your schedules and timetables you on an artist sweeney not a bleeding clerk what artistic endeavor prevented you from mowing a simple direction she bared her teeth considered punching him then simply pointed that he glanced over froze only the blindness of temper could have prevented him from seeing it being struck dumb by it on entering the building the sculpture stood on the far side of the room fully three feet high all bleeding colors and twisting sinous shapes a tangle of limbs surely he thought unashamedly sexual beautifully human he crossed to it to study it from a different angle he could almost almost make out faces they semed to melt into imagination leaving only the sensation of absolute fulfillment it was impossible to see where one form began and the other left off so completely so perfectly were they merged it was he thought a celebration of the human spirit and the sexuality of the beast what do you call it surrender she smiled it seems you inspired me rogan whipped by fresh energy she pushed off the bench she was lightheaded giddy and felt glorious it took forever to get the colors right you wouldnt believe what ive remelted and discarded but i could see it perfectly and it had to be exact she laughed and picked up her hammer to drive another nail i dont know when ive slept last two days three she laughed again dragging her hands through her tousled hair im not tired i feel incredible full of desperate energy i cant seem to stop its magnificent maggie its the best work ive ever done she turned to study it again tapping the hammer against her palm probably the best ill ever do ill arrange for a crate he tossed her a look over his shoulder she was pale as wax he noted with the fatigue her bustling brain had yet to transmit to her body and handle the shipping personally i was going to build one it wouldnt take long you cant be trusted of course i can her mood was so festive she didnt even take offense and itd be quicker for me to build one than for you to have one built i already have the dimensions how long an hour he nodded til use your phone and arrange for a truck your phone does work i assume sarcasm chuckling she crossed to him becomes you so does that impeccably proper tie before either of them had a chance to think she grabbed his tie and hauled him toward her her warm mouth fixed on his stunning him into immobility her free hand slid into his hair gripped as her body pressed close the kiss sizzled sparked smoldered then as quickly as she had initiated it she broke away just a whim she said and smiled up at him her heart might have been jolting like a rabbit in her chest but she would think about that later blame it on sleep deprivation and excess energy now he snagged her arm before she could turn away she wouldnt get away so easily he thought wouldnt paralyze him one moment and shrug it off the next i have a whim of my own he murmured as he did a hand around to cup the back of her neck he watched her eyes register wary surprise she didnt resist he thought he saw a hint of amusement on her face before he lowered his mouth to hers the amusement faded quickly this kiss was soft sweet sumptuous as unexpected as rose petals in the blaze of a furnace it cooled and soothed and aroused all at once she thought she heard a sound something between a whimper and a sigh the fact that it had slipped from her own burning throat amazed her but she didnt draw away not even when the came again quiet and helpless and beguiled no she didnt pull away his mouth was too clever too gently persuasive she opened herself to it and absorbed she seemed to melt against him degree by slow degree that first blast of heat had mellowed rippined into a low long burn he forgot that hed been angry or that hed been challenged and knew only that he was alive she tasted dark dangerous and his mouth was full of her his mind veered toward taking toward conquering toward ravishing the civilized man ill him the one who had been raised to follow a strict code of ethics stepped back appalled her head reeled she placed a hand down on the workbench for balance as her legs buckled one long breath followed by another helped clear her vision and she saw him staring at her a mixture of hunger and shock in his eyes well she managed thats certainly something to think about it was foolish to apologize for his thoughts rogan told himself ridiculous to blame himself for the fact that his imagination had drawn erotic and vivid pictures of throwing her to the floor and tearing away flannel and denim he hadnt acted on it hed only kissed her but he thought it was possible even preferable to blame her we have a business relationship he began tersely it would be unwise and possibly destructive to let anything interfere with that at this point she cocked her head rocked back on her heels and sleeping together would confuse things curse her for making him sound like a fool curse her twice for leaving him shaken and horribly horribly needy at this point i think we should concentrate on launching your show hmmm she turned away on the pretext of tidying the workbench in truth she needed a moment to setde herself she wasnt promiscuous by any means and certainly didnt tumble into bed with every man who attracted her but she liked to think of herself as independent enough liberated enough and smart enough to choose her lovers with care she had she realized chosen rogan sweeney why did you kiss me you annoyed me her wide generous mouth curved since i seem to be doing that on a regular basis well be spending a lot of time with our lips locked its a matter of control he knew he sounded stiff and prim and hated her for it im sure you have just buckets of it i dont she totted her head folded her arms over her chest if i decide i want you what are you going to do about it fight me off i doubt itll come to that the image brought on twinges of humor and desperation we both need to concentrate on the business at hand this could be she turning point in your career yes it would be wise to remember that she thought so well use each other professionally well enhance each other professionally he corrected christ he needed air ill go in and call for that truck rogan she waited until he reached the door and turned back to her id like to go with you to dublin today yes i can be ready to go by the time the truck arrives i only need to make one stop at my sisters she was as good as her word even as the shipment chugged away she was tossing a suitcase into the back rogans rented car if youd just give me ten minutes she said as rogan started down the narrow lane im sure brie has some tea or coffee on fine he stopped the car by blackthorn and went with maggie up the walk she didnt knock but stepped inside and headed straight toward the kitchen in the back brianna was there a white bib apron tied at her waist and her hands coated with flour oh mr sweeney hello maggie youll have to excuse the mess we have guests and im making pies for dinner im leaving for dublin so soon brianna picked up a tea towel to dust off her hands i thought the show was next week it is im going early is she in her room briannas polite smile strained a bit at the edges yes why dont i go tell her youre here ill tell her myself perhaps you could give rogan some coffee of course she cast one worried look at maggie as her sister walked out of the kitchen into the adjoining apartment if youll make yourself comfortable in the parlor mr sweeney ill bring you some coffee right away dont trouble his curiosity was up ill have a cup right here if i wont be in your way he added an easy smile and please call me rogan you have it black as i recall you have a good memory and youre a bundle of nerves he observed watching brianna reach for a cup and saucer i try to remember the preferences of my guests would you have some cake its a bit of chocolate i made yesterday the memory of your cooking makes it difficult to refuse he took a seat at the scrubbed wood table you do it all yourself yes i she heard the first raised voice and fumbled i do ive a fire laid in the parlor are you sure you wouldnt be more comfortable the clash of voices from the next room rose bringing a flush of embarrassment to briannas cheeks rogan merely lifted his cup whos she shouting at this time brianna managed a smile our mother they dont get on very well does maggie get along with anyone only when it suits her but she has a heart a wonderful generous heart its only that she guards it so carefully brianna sighed if rogan wasnt embarrassed by the shouting neither would she be ill cut you that cake you never change maeve stared at her oldest child through narrowed eyes just like your father if you think thats an insult to me youre wrong maeve sniffed and brushed at the lace cuffs of her bed gown the years and her own dissatisfactions had stolen the beauty of her face it was puffy and pale with lines dug deeply around the pursed mouth her hair once as golden as sunlight had faded to gray and was scraped back ruthlessly into a tight bun she was plumped onto a mountain of pillows her bible at one hand and a box of chocolates at the the television across the room murmured so its dublin is it brianna told me you were going off frittering money away on hotels i imagine its my money oh and you wont let me forget it bitterness reared as maeve pushed up in bed for her whole life someone else had held the purse strings her parents her husband and now most demeaning of all her own daughter to think of all he tossed away on you buying you glass sending you off to that foreign country and for what so you could play at being an artist and superior to the rest of us he tossed nothing away on me he gave me the chance to learn while i stayed on the farm working my fingers to the bone you never worked a blessed day in your life it was brianna who did it all while you took to your bed with one ailment after another do you think i enjoy being delicate oh aye maggie said with relish i think you revel in it its my cross to bear maeve picked up her bible pressed it to her chest like a shield she had paid for her sin she thought a hundred times over she had paid for it yet if forgiveness had come comfort had not that and an ungrateful child what am i supposed to be grateful for the fact that you complained every day of your life that you made your dissatisfaction for my father and your disappointment in me clear with every word every look i gave birth to you maeve shouted i nearly died giving you life and because i carried you in my womb i married a man who didnt love me and who i didnt love i sacrificed everything for you sacrificed maggie said wearily what sacrifices have you made maeve cloaked herself in the bitter rage of her pride more than you know and my reward was to have children who have no love for me do you think because you got pregnant and married to give me a name i should overlook everything youve done everything you havent done like love me even a litde maggie thought and ruthlessly pushed the ache away it was you on four back mother i was the result not the cause how dare you speak to me that way maeves face flushed hot her fingers dug into the blankets you never had any respect any kindness any compassion no because her eyes were stinging maggies voice was sharp as a whip and its that lack i inherited from you i only came today to tell you that you wont run brie ragged while im gone if i find you have ill stop the allowance youd take food out of my mouth maggie leaned over to tap the box of chocolates yes be sure of it honor thy father and thy mother maeve hugged the bible close youre breaking a commandment margaret mary and sending your soul to hell then ill give up my place in heaven rather than live a hypocrite on earth margaret mary maeve shouted when maggie had reached the door youll never amount to anything youre just like him gods curse is on you maggie for being conceived outside the sacrament of marriage i saw no sacrament of marriage in my house maggie tossed back only the agony of it and if there was a sin in my conception it wasnt mine she slammed the door behind her then leaned back against it a moment to steady herself it was always the same she thought they could never be in the same room together without hurling insults she had known since she was twelve why her mother disliked her condemned her her very existence was the reason maeves life had turned from dream to harsh reality a loveless marriage a sevenmonth baby and a farm without a farmer it was that her mother had thrown in her face when maggie had reached puberty it was that they had never forgiven each other for straightening her shoulders she walked back into the kitchen she didnt know her eyes were still angry and overbright or her face pale she walked to her sister and kissed her briskly on the cheek ill call you from dublin maggie there was too much to say and nothing to say brianna only squeezed her hands i wish i could be there for you you could if you wished it enough rogan are you ready yes he rose goodbye brianna thank you ill just walk you brianna broke off when her mother called out go see to her maggie said and walked quickly out of the house she was yanking at the door of rogans car when he laid a hand on her shoulder are you all right no but i dont want to talk about it with a final tug she jerked the door open and climbed inside he hurried around the hood and slipped onto die drivers seat maggie dont say anything anything at all theres nothing you can do or say to change whats always been just drive the car and leave me alone it would be a great favor to me she began to weep then passionately bitterly while he struggled with the urge to comfort her and the wish to comply with her request in the end he drove saying nothing but holding her hand they were nearing the airport when her sobs died and her tensed fingers went limp glancing over he saw she was sleeping she didnt awaken when he carried her inside his company jet or when he setded her in a seat nor did she awaken all through the flight as he watched her and wondered chapter six maggie awoke in the dark the only thing she was certain of in those first groggy minutes was that she wasnt in her own bed the scent of the sheets the texture of them was wrong she didnt have to sleep oh fine linen habitually to recognize the difference or to notice the faint restful scent of verbena that clung to the pillowslip in which shed buried her face as an uncomfortable thought zeroed into her brain she stretched out a cautious hand to make certain she was the only occupant of the bed the mattress flowed on a veritable lake of smooth sheets and cozy blankets an empty lake thank jesus she thought and rolled over to the center of the bed her last clear memory was of crying herself empty in rogans car and the hollow feeling that had left her drifting like a broken reed in a stream a good purge she decided for she felt incredibly better steady and rested and clean it was tempting to luxuriate in the soft dark on soft sheets with soft scents but she decided shed best find out where she was and how shed arrived after sliding her way over to the edge of the bed she groped around the smooth wood of the night table eased her fingers over and up until she located a lamp and its switch the light was gently shaded a warm golden hue that subtly illuminated a large bedroom with coffered ceiling dainty rosebud wallpaper and the bed itself a massive fourposter the veritable queen of beds she thought with a smile a pity shed been too tired to appreciate it the fireplace across the room was unlit but scrubbed clean as a new coin and set for kindling longstemmed pink roses fresh as a summer morning stood in a waterford vase on a majestic bureau along with a silver brush set and gorgeous little colored bottles with fancy stoppers the mirror above it reflected maggie rumpled and heavyeyed among the sheets you look a bit out of place my girl she decided and grinning tugged on the sleeve of her cotton nightshirt someone it seemed had had the good sense to change her before dumping her into the royal bed a maid perhaps or rogan himself it hardly mattered she thought practically since the deed was done and shed certainly benefited from it in all likelihood her clothes were gracing the carved rosewood armoire as out of place there she decided with a chuckle as she was in the glorious lake of smooth linen sheets if she was in a hotel it was certainly the finest that had ever had her patronage she scrambled up stumbled toward the closest door over a deeppiled aubusson the bath was as sumptuous as the bedroom all gleaming rose and ivory tiles a huge tub fashioned for lounging and a separate shower constructed from a wavy glass block with a sigh of pure greed she stripped off her nightshirt and turned on the spray it was heaven the hot water beating on the back of her neck her shoulders like the firm fingers of an expert masseuse a far cry from the stingy trickle her own shower managed at home the soap smelled of lemon and glided over her skin like silk she saw with some amusement that her few meager toiletries had been set out on the generous counter by the shellshaped pink sinks her robe such as it was hung on a brass hook beside the door well someone was taking care of her she realized and at the moment she could find no cause for complaintafter a steamy fifteen minutes while the water ran hot she reached for one of the thick towels folded over a warming bar it was big enough to wrap her from breast to calf she combed her wet hair back from her face made use of the cream in a crystal decanter then exchanged the towel for her tattered flannel robe barefoot and curious she set out to explore her room was off a long wide hall low lights tossed shadows over the gleaming floor and its regal red runner she heard not a sound as she wandered toward the stairs that curved graciously up to another story and down she chose down letting her fingers play along the polished railing quite obviously she wasnt a guest in a luxury hotel but in a private home rogans home she concluded with an envious glance at the art that graced the foyer and main hall the man had a van gogh and a matisse she realized as her mouth watered she found the front parlor with its wide windows open to the balmy night a sitting room its chairs and sofas arranged in conversation groupings across the hall was what she supposed would be called the music room as it was dominated by a grand piano and a gilded harp beautiful it all was with enough artwork to keep maggie entranced for days but at the moment she had another priority she wondered how long she would have to search before she found the kitchen the light under a door drew her closer when she looked in she saw rogan seated behind a desk papers arranged in tidy piles before him it was a twolevel room with his desk on the first and steps leading up to a small sitting area the walls were lined with books acres of them she thought at a glance in a room smelling of leather and beeswax the room was done in burgundies and dark woods that suited the man as much as it suited the literature she watched him interested in the way he scanned the page in front of him made quick decisive notes he was for the first time in their acquaintance without a suit coat or tie hed been wearing them certainly she mused but now his collar was unbuttoned the sleeves of his crisp shirt rolled up to the elbows his hair glinting darkly in the lamplight was a bit mussed as if hed run his hands impatiently through it while he worked even as she watched he did so again raking the fingers through scowling a bit whatever he was working on absorbed him for he worked in a steady undistracted rhythm that was in some odd way fascinating he wasnt a man to let his mind wander she thought whatever he chose to do he would do with the utmost concentration and skill she remembered the way he had kissed her concentration and skill indeed rogan read the next clause in the proposal and frowned the wording wasnt quite right a modification he paused considered crossed out a phrase and reworded it the expansion of his factory in limerick was crucial to his game plan and needed to be implemented before the end of the year hundreds of jobs would be created and with the construction of moderateincome apartments that a subsidiary of worldwide was planning hundreds of families would have homes as well one branch of the business would feed directly into the other he thought it would be a small but important contribution to keeping the irish sadly his countrys biggest export in ireland his mind circled around the next clause had nearly zeroed in when he caught himself drifting something pulled at his brain distracting it from the business at hand rogan glanced toward the doorway and saw it was not something but someone he must have sensed her standing there barefoot and sleepyeyed in a ratty gray robe her hair was slicked back shining red fire in a style that should have been severe but instead was striking unadorned and freshscrubbed her face was like ivory with a blush of rose beneath her lashes were spiked with damp around her slumberous eyes his reaction was swift and brutal and human even as the heat blasted through him he checked it ruthlessly sorry to interrupt she flashed him a quick cheeky smile that tortured his already active libido i was looking for the kitchen im halfstarved its hardly a wonder he was forced to clear his throat her voice was husky as sleepily sexy as her eyes when did you eat last im not certain leaning lazily on the doorjamb she yawned yesterday i think im still a bit foggy no you slept yesterday all of yesterday from the time we left your sisters and all of today oh she shrugged what time is it just past eight tuesday well she walked into the room and curled up in a big leather chair across from his desk as if shed been joining him there for years do you often sleep for thirtyodd hours straight only when ive been up too long she stretched her arms high to work out kinks she was just beginning to feel sometimes a piece grabs you by the throat and it wont let you go until youve finished resolutely he shifted his gaze from the flesh the fall of her robe had revealed and looked down blindly at the paperwork before him he was appalled that he would react like some hormonemad teenager its dangerous in your line of work no because youre not tired youre almost unbearably alert when youve simply worked too long you lose the edge you have to stop rest this is different and when im done i fall down and stay down until ive slept it off she smiled again the kitchen rogan im ravenous instead of an answer he reached for the phone and punched in a number miss concannon is awake he said shed like a meal in the library please thats grand she said when he replaced the receiver but i could have scrambled myself some eggs and saved your staff the bother theyre paid to bother of course her voice was dry as dust how smug you must be to have roundtheclock servants she waved a hand before he could answer best we dont get into that on an empty stomach tell me rogan how exactly did i come to be in that big bed upstairs i put you there did you now if he was hoping for a blush or stutter hed be disappointed ill have to thank you you slept like a stone at one point i nearly held a mirror up to your lips to be certain you were alive she was certainly alive now vibrant in the lamplight do you want a brandy better not before ive eaten he rose went to a sideboard and poured a single snifter from a decanter you were upset before we left she cocked her head now thats a fine and diplomatic way of phrasing it the weeping spell didnt embarrass her it was simply emotion passion as real and as human as laughter or lust but she remembered that he had held her hand and had offered no useless words to stem the storm im sorry if i made you uncomfortable she had miserably but he shrugged it off you didnt want to talk about it didnt and dont she took a quiet breath because her voice had been sharp he didnt deserve such rudeness after his kindness its nothing to do with you rogan just old family miseries since im feeling mellow ill tell you it was comforting to have you hold my hand i didnt think you were the type to offer his eyes flicked back to hers it seems to me we dont know each other well enough to generalize ive always considered myself a quick and accurate judge but you may be right so tell me she propped an elbow on the arm of the chair cocked her chin on her fist who are you rogan sweeney he was relieved when the need to answer was postponed by the arrival of her dinner a tidy uniformed maid wheeled in a tray settling it in front of maggie with no more than a whisper of sound and a jingle of silverware she bobbed once when maggie thanked her then disappeared the moment rogan told her that would be all ah what a scent maggie attacked the soup first a rich thick broth swimming with chunks of vegetables do you want some no ive eaten rather than go back around the desk he sat in the chair beside hers it was oddly cozy he realized to sit with her while she ate and the house seemed to settle quietly around them since youre back among the living perhaps youd like to go by the gallery in the morning umm she nodded her mouth full of crusty roll when eight i have appointments midmorning but i can take you in and leave a car at your disposal a car at my disposal tickled she pressed a fist to her mouth as she laughed oh i could get used to that quick enough and what would i do with the car at my disposal what you like god knew why her reaction annoyed him but it did or you can wander around dublin on foot if you prefer a bit touchy this evening are we she moved from the soup to the entree of honeyed chicken your cooks a treasure rogan do you diink i can charm this recipe out of him or her for brie him rogan said and youre welcome to try hes french insolent and given to tantrums then we have all but nationality in common tell me will i be moving to a hotel tomorrow hed thought about that a great deal it would certainly be more comfortable for him if she were tucked away in a suite at the westbury more comfortable he thought and much more dull youre welcome to stay in the guest room if it suits you it suits me down to the ground she studied him as she speared a tiny new potato he looked relaxed here she realized very much the complacent king of the castle is it just you in this big house it is he lifted a brow does that worry you worry me oh you mean because you might come knocking on my door one lustful night she chuckled infuriating him im able to say yes or no rogan the same as you would be if i came knocking on yours i only asked because it seems a lot of room for one man its my family home he said stiffly ive lived here all my life and a fine place it is she pushed the tray back and rose to go to the small sideboard lifting the top of a decanter she sniffed sighed at the fine scent of irish whiskey after pouring herself a glass she came back and curled up her legs slainte she said and tossed the whiskey back it set a good strong fire kindling in her gut would you like another one do me one warms the soul two warms the brain my father often said im in the mood for a cool head she set the empty glass on the tray shifted her body more comfortably her frayed flannel robe slid open at the curve of her knee you havent answered my question which was who are you im a businessman as you remind me with regularity he settled back making a determined effort not to let his mind or his gaze wander to her bare legs third generation born and bred in dublin with love and respect for art nurtured in me from the cradle and that love and respect was augmented by the idea of making a profit precisely he swirled his brandy sipped and looked exactly like what he was a man comfortable with his own wealth and content with his life while making a profit brings its own sense of satisfaction theres another more spiritual satisfaction that comes from developing and promoting a new artist particularly one you believe in passionately maggie touched her tongue to her top lip he was entirely too confident she decided much too sure of himself and his place in the world all that tidy certainty begged for a bit of shaking so im here to satisfy you rogan he met her amused eyes nodded i have no doubt you will maggie eventually on every level eventually she hadnt meant really to steer them onto this boggy ground but it seemed irresistible sitting with him in the quiet room with her body so rested her mind so alert your choice of time and place then its traditional i believe for the man to choose when to advance hah bristling she leaned over to jab a finger in his chest any thoughts shed had of easing into romance vanished like smoke stuff your traditions in your hat and wear it well i dont cater to them you might be interested to know that as we approach the twentyfirst century women are doing their own choosing the fact is weve been doing so since time began those of us sharp enough and men are just catching on to it she plopped back in her chair ill have you rogan in my time and in my place it baffled him why such an incredible statement should both arouse him and make him uneasy your father was right maggie about you getting the brass you have it to spare and what of it oh i know your type contempt colored her tone you like a woman to sit quietly by mooning a bit catering to your whims to be sure and hoping while her romantic heart beats desperately in her breast that youll look twice in her direction shell be proper as a saint in public never a sour word slipping through her rosy lips then of course when youve decided on that time and that place shes to transform herself into a veritable tiger indulging your most prurient fantasies until the lights switch on again and she turns into a doorstop rogan waited to be sure shed run down then hid a smile in his brandy that sums it up amazingly well jackass shrew he said pleasantly would you care for some dessert the chuckle tickled her throat so she set it free who would have thought shed actually come to like him no damn you ill not drag that poor maid away again from her television or her flirtation with the butler or however she spends her evenings my butler is seventysix and well safe from flirtations with a maid a lot you know maggie rose again and wandered toward a wall of books alphabetized by author she noted and nearly snorted she should have known whats her name whose the maids you want to know my maids name maggie stroked a finger down a volume of james joyce no i want to see if you know your maids name its a test he opened his mouth closed it again grateful that maggies back was to him what difference did it make if he knew the name of one of his maids colleen maureen hell the domestic staff was his butlers domain bridgit no damn it it was nancy he thought was nearly certain shes fairly new i believe shes been here about five months would you like me to call her back in for an introduction no casually maggie moved from joyce to keats it was a curiosity to me thats all tell me rogan do you have anything in here other than classics you know a good murder mystery i might pass some time with his library of first editions was considered one of the finest in the country and she was criticizing it for lacking a potboiler with an effort he schooled his temper and his voice i believe youll find some of dame agathas work the british she shrugged not bloodthirsty enough as a rule unless theyre sacking casdes like those damn cromwellians whats this she bent down peered this dantes in italian i believe it is can you read it or is it just for show i can fumble through it well enough she passed by it hoping for something more contemporary i didnt pick up as much of the language as i should have in venice plenty of slang little of the socially correct she glanced over her shoulder and grinned artists are a colorful lot in any country so ive noticed he rose and crossed to another shelf of books this might be more what youre looking for he offered maggie a copy of thomas harriss red dragon i believe several people are murdered horribly wonderful she tucked the book under her arm ill say good night then so you can get back to work im grateful for the bed and the meal youre welcome he sat behind his desk again lifted a pen and ran it through his fingers while he watched her id like to leave at eight sharp the dining rooms down this hall and to the left breakfast will be served anytime after six i can guarantee it wont be served to me at that hour but ill be ready at eight on impulse she crossed to him placed her hands on the arms of his chair and leaned her face close to his you know rogan were precisely what each other doesnt need or want on a personal level i couldnt agree more on a personal level her skin soft and white where the flannel parted at her throat smelled like sin and thats why to my way of thinking were going to have such a fascinating relationship barely any common ground at all wouldnt you say no more than a toehold his gaze lowered to her mouth lingered rose to hers again a shaky one at that i like dangerous climbs she leaned forward a little more just an inch and nipped his bottom lip with her teeth a spear of fire arrowed straight to his loins i prefer having my feet on the ground i know she leaned back again leaving him with a tingle on his lips and the heat in his gut well try it your way first good night she strolled out of the room without looking back rogan waited until he was certain she was well away before he lifted his hands and scrubbed them over his face good christ the woman was tying him into knots slippery tangled knots of pure lust he didnt believe on acting on lust alone at least not since his adolescence he was after all a civilized man one of taste and breeding he respected women admired them certainly hed developed relationships that had culminated in bed but hed always tried to wait until the relationships had developed before making love reasonably mutually and discreedy he wasnt an animal to be driven by instinct alone he wasnt even certain he liked maggie concannon as a person so what kind of man would he be if he did what he was burning to do at this moment if he stalked up those stairs threw open die door to her bedroom and ravished her good and proper a satisfied man he thought with grim humor at least until morning when he had to face her and himself and the business they had to complete perhaps it was more difficult to take the high road perhaps he would suffer as he was damn well certain she expected him to but when the time came for him to take her to bed he would have the upper hand that most certainly was worth something even he thought as he shoved papers aside a miserably sleepless night maggie slept like a baby despite the images evoked by the novel rogan had given her shed dropped off to sleep just after midnight and had slept dreamlessly until nearly seven flushed with energy and anticipation she searched out the dining room and was pleased to see a full irish breakfast warming on the sideboard good morning miss the same maid who had served her the night before scurried in from the kitchen is there anything i can get for you thank you no i can serve myself maggie picked up a plate from the table and moved toward the tempting scents on the sideboard shall i pour you coffee or tea miss tea would be lovely maggie took the lid off a silver warmer and sniffed appreciately at the thick rashers of bacon nancy is it no miss its noreen failed that test squire sweeney maggie mused would you tell the cook noreen that ive never had a better meal than my dinner last night id be happy to miss maggie moved from server to server heaping her plate she often skipped meals altogether so indifferent was her own cooking but when food was available in such quantity and food of such quality she made up for it will mr sweeney be joining me for breakfast she asked as she carried her plate back to the table hes already eaten miss mr sweeney breakfasts every day at halfsix precisely a creature of habit is he maggie winked at the maid and slathered fresh jam on her warmed toast he is yes noreen answered flushing a bit im to remind you miss hell be ready to leave at eight thank you noreen ill keep it in mind youve only to ring if you need anything quiet as a mouse noreen faded back into the kitchen maggie applied herself to a breakfast she felt was fit for a queen and perused the copy of the irish times that had been neatly folded beside her plate a cozy way to live she supposed with servants only the snap of a finger away but didnt it drive rogan mad to know they were always about the house that he was never alone the very idea made her wince shed go mad for sure maggie decided without solitude she looked over the room with its dark and glossy wainscoting the glitter from the twin crystal chandeliers the gleam from the silver on the antique sideboard the sparkle of china and waterford glass yes even in this lush setting shed go stark raving mad she lingered over a second cup of tea read the paper from back to front and cleaned every crumb from her plate from somewhere in the house a clock chimed the hour she debated having just one more serving of bacon called herself a glutton and resisted she took a few moments to study the art on the walls there was a watercolor she found particularly exquisite taking a last leisurely turn around the room she started out down the hall rogan stood in the foyer immaculate in a gray suit and navy tie he studied her studied his watch youre late am i its eight past the hour she lifted her brows saw he was serious and dutifully muffled a chuckle i should be flogged he skimmed a gaze up her from the half boots and dark leggings to the mannish white shirt that reached to midthigh and was cinched with two leather belts glittering translucent stones swung at her ears and she had for once added a touch of makeup she hadnt however bothered with a watch if you dont wear a timepiece how can you be on time youve a point there perhaps thats why i dont still watching her he took out a pad and his pen what are you doing noting down that we have to supply you with a watch as well as a phoneanswering machine and a calendar thats very generous of you rogan she waited until he opened the door and gestured her out why the watch so youll be prompt the answering machine so ill at least be able to leave a damn message when you ignore the phone and the calendar so youll know what the bloody day is when i request a shipment hed bitten off the last word as if it were stringy meat maggie thought since youre in such a bright and cheerful mood this morning ill risk telling you that none of those things will change me a whit im irresponsible rogan youve only to ask whats left of my family she turned around ignoring his hiss of impatience and studied his house it overlooked a lovely shady green st stephens she was to learn later and stood proudly a trifle haughtily against a dreamy blue sky though the stone was aged the lines were as graceful as a young womans body it was a combination of dignity and elegance maggie knew only the rich could afford every window of which there were many glistened like diamonds in the sun the lawn smooth and green gave way to a lovely front garden tidy as a church and twice as formal a pretty spot you have here i missed it you know on my way in im aware of that youll have to wait for the tour margaret mary i dont like to be late he took her arm and all but dragged her to the waiting car do you get docked for tardiness then she laughed when he said nothing and settled back to enjoy the ride are you by nature surly of a morning rogan im not surly he snapped at her or he wouldnt be he thought if hed gotten above two hours sleep and the responsibility for that damn all women fell solidly on her head i have a lot to accomplish today oh to be sure empires to build fortunes to win that did it he didnt know why but the light undertone of disdain broke the last link on control he swerved to the side of the road causing the driver who had been cruising behind him to blast rudely on his horn grabbing maggie by the collar he hauled her half out of her seat and crushed his mouth to hers she hadnt been expecting quite that reaction but that didnt mean she couldnt enjoy it she could meet him on even ground when he wasnt quite so controlled quite so skillful her head might have spun but the sensation of power remained no seduction here only raw needs rubbing together like live wires and threatening to flare he dragged her head back and plundered her mouth just once he promised himself only once to relieve some of this vicious tension that coiled inside him like a snake but kissing her didnt relieve it instead the complete and eager response of her the total verve of it wrapped his tension only tighter until he couldnt breathe for a moment he felt as though he were being sucked into some velvetlined airless tunnel and he was terrified that hed never want or need light again he jerked away fastened his hands like vises on the wheel he eased back onto the road like a drunk trying to negotiate a straight line im assuming that was an answer to something her voice was unnaturally quiet it wasnt his kiss that had unnerved her nearly as much as the way he had ended it it was that or throttle you i prefer being kissed to strangled still id like it better if you werent angry about wanting me he was calmer now concentrating on the road and making up the time shed cost him that morning i explained myself before the timings inappropriate inappropriate and whos in charge of propriety i prefer knowing whom im sleeping with having some mutual affection and respect her eyes narrowed theres a long way between a kiss on the lips and a tumble in the sheets sweeney ill have you know im not one to leap onto the mattress at the blink of an eye i never said oh didnt you now she was all the more insulted because she knew how quickly she would have leaped onto a mattress with him as far as i can see youve decided im plenty loose enough well i wont be explaining my past history to you and as for affection and respect youve yet to earn them from me boyo fine then were agreed were agreed you can go straight to hell and your maids name is noreen that distracted him enough to have him taking his eyes off the road and staring what your maid you dolt you narrownosed aristocrat tisnt nancy its noreen maggie folded her arms and stared resolutely out the side window rogan only shook his head im grateful to you for clearing that up god knows what an embarrassment it would have been to me if id had to introduce her to the neighbors blueblooded snob she muttered wasptongued viper they settled into an angry silence for the rest of the drive chapter seven it was impossible not to be impressed by worldwide gallery dublin the architecture alone was worth a visit to the place indeed photographs of the building had appeared in dozens of magazines and art books around the world as a shining example of the georgian style that was part of dublins architectural legacy though maggie had seen it reproduced in glossy pages the sight of it the sheer grandeur of it in three dimensions took her breath away shed spent hours of her free time during her apprenticeship in venice haunting galleries but nothing compared in splendor with rogans yet she made no comment at all while he unlocked the imposinglooking front doors and gestured her inside she had to resist the urge to genuflect such was the churchlike quiet the play of light the scented air in the main room the native american display was beautifully and carefully mounted the pottery bowls the gorgeous baskets the ritual masks shaman rattles and beadwork on the walls were drawings at once primitive and sophisticated maggies attention and her admiration focused on a buckskin dress the color of cream adorned with beads and smooth bright stones rogan had ordered it hung like a tapestry maggies fingers itched to touch impressive was all she said im delighted you approve ive never seen american indian work outside of books and such she leaned over a water vessel thats precisely why i wanted to bring the display to ireland we too often focus on european history and culture and forget theres more to the world hard to believe people who could create this would be the savages we see in those old john wayne movies then again she smiled as she straightened my ancestors were savage enough stripping naked and painting themselves blue before they screamed into battle i come from that she tilted her head to study him the perfectly polished businessman we both do one could say that such tendencies become more diluted in some than in others over the centuries i havent had the urge to paint myself blue in years she laughed but he was already checking his watch again were using the second floor for your work he started toward the stairs for any particular reason for several particular reasons impatience shimmering like a wave of heat around him he paused until she joined him on the staircase i prefer a show like this to have some sense of a social occasion people tend to appreciate art at least feel its more accessible if theyre relaxed and enjoying themselves he stopped at the top of the steps lifting a brow at her expression youve a problem with that id like people to take my work seriously not think of it as a party favor i assure you theyll take it seriously particularly with the prices hed decided to demand for it the strategy he intended to employ and the marketing of your work is after all my province he turned sliding open double pocket doors then stepped back so that maggie could enter first she quite simply lost her voice the wonderfully enormous room was flooded with light from the domed central skylight above it poured down over the dark polished floor and tossed back stunning reflections almost mirrorlike of the work rogan had chosen to display in all of her dreams in her wildest and most secret hopes shed never imagined that her work would be showcased so sensitively or so grandly thickbased pedestals of creamy white marble stood around the room lifting the glass to eye level rogan had chosen only twelve pieces to grace the lofty space a canny move she realized as it made each piece seem all the more unique and there in the center of the room glistening like ice heated by a core of fire was maggies surrender there was a dull ache in her heart as she studied the sculpture someone would buy it she knew within days someone would pay the price rogan was asking and steal it completely and finally from her life the price of wanting more she thought seemed to be the loss of what you already had or perhaps of what you were when she said nothing only walked through the room with her boots echoing rogan stuck his hands in his pockets the smaller pieces are displayed in what we call the upper sitting rooms its a more intimate space he paused waiting for some response then hissed through his teeth when he received none damn the woman he thought what did she want well have an orchestra at the show strings and champagne and canapes of course of course maggie managed she kept her back to him wondering why she should stand in such a magnificent room and want to weep ill ask you to attend at least for a short time you neednt do or say anything that would compromise your artistic integrity her heart was beating much too loudly for her to catch his tone of annoyance it looks she couldnt think of a word simply couldnt fine she said lamely it all looks fine fine yes she turned back sobereyed and for the first time in recent memory terrified you have a nice aesthetic sense a nice aesthetic sense he repeated amazed at her tepid response well margaret mary im so gratified its only taken three incredibly difficult weeks and the combined efforts of more than a dozen highly qualified people to make everything look fine she ran an unsteady hand through her hair couldnt he see she was speechless that she was completely out of her realm and scared as a rabbit faced by a hound what do you want me to say ive done my job and given you the art youve done yours and utilized it were both to be congratulated rogan now perhaps i should look about in your more intimate rooms he stepped forward blocking her path as she started for the doorway the fury that rose up in him was so molten so intense he was surprised it didnt melt her glass into puddles of shine and color you ungrateful peasant a peasant am i emotions swirled inside her contradictory and frightening youre right enough on that sweeney and if im ungrateful because i dont fall at your feet and kiss your boots then its ungrateful ill stay i dont want or expect any more from you than what it said in your cursed contracts with your bloody exclusive clauses and youll get no more from me she could feel the hot tears boiling up ready to erupt she was certain that if she didnt get out of the room quickly her lungs would quite simply collapse from the strain in her desperation to escape she shoved at him ill tell you what i expect he snagged her shoulder whirled her around and what ill have i beg your pardon joseph said from the doorway i seem to be interrupting he couldnt have been more amused or more fascinated as he watched his coolheaded boss spit fire and rage at the small dangerouseyed woman whose fists had already raised as if for a bout not at all using every ounce of willpower rogan released maggies arm and stepped back in the wink of an eye he had gone from fury to calmness miss concannon and i were just discussing the terms of our contract maggie concannon joseph donahoe the curator of this gallery a pleasure all charm joseph stepped forward to take maggies hand though it trembled a bit he kissed it lavishly dashingly and set his gold tooth flashing with a grin a pure pleasure miss concannon to meet the person behind the genius and a pleasure for me mr donahoe to meet a man so sensitive to art and to the artist ill be leaving maggie in your capable hands joseph i have appointments youll be doing me an honor rogan josephs eyes twinkled as he kept maggies hand lightly in his the gesture wasnt lost on rogan nor was the fact that maggie made no move to break the contact she was in fact smiling up at joseph flirtatiously youve only to tell joseph when you require the car rogan said stiffly the drivers at your disposal thank you rogan she said without looking at him but im sure joseph can keep me entertained for some time theres no way id rather spend the day joseph quickly put in have you seen the sitting rooms miss concannon i havent no youll call me maggie i hope i will his hand still linked with hers joseph drew her through the doorway i believe youll appreciate what weve done here with the showing only days away we want to be certain youre happy any suggestions you have will be most welcomed thatll be a change maggie paused glanced over her shoulder to where rogan remained standing dont let us keep you from your business rogan im sure its pressing with a toss of her head she beamed at joseph i know a francis donahoe from near ennis a merchant he is with the same look around the eyes as you would you be related ive cousins in clare on my fathers side and my mothers theyd be ryans i know scores of ryans oh she stopped sighed as she stepped through an archway into a tidy little room complete with fireplace and love seat several of her smaller pieces including the one rogan had bought at their first meeting graced the antique tables an elegant setting i think joseph moved inside to switch on the recessed lighting the glass jumped into life under the beams seemed to pulse the ballroom makes a breathless statement this a delicate one yes she sighed again do you mind if i sit a moment joseph for the truth is i have lost my breath she setded on the love seat and closed her eyes once when i was a child my father bought a billy goat with some idea of breeding i was in the field with it one morning paying it no mind and it got its dander up butted me hard he did and sent me flying i felt just that way when i stepped into that other room as if something had butted me hard and sent me flying nervous are you she opened her eyes and saw the understanding in josephs im frightened to death and damned if ill let himself know it hes so damned cocksure isnt he hes confident our rogan and with reason enough hes got an uncanny sense for buying the right piece or patronizing the right artist a curious man and one who enjoyed a good gossip joseph made himself comfortable beside her he stretched out his legs crossed them at the ankle in a posture inviting relaxation and confidence i noticed the two of you were butting heads so to speak when i interrupted we dont seem to have a lot of common ground maggie smiled a little hes pushy our rogan true enough but usually in such a subtle way one doesnt know ones been pushed maggie hissed through her teeth he hasnt been subtle with me i noticed interesting you know maggie i dont think id be giving away any corporate secrets if i told you rogan was determined to sign you with worldwide ive worked for him for more than ten years and never recall seeing him more focused on a single artist and i should be flattered she sighed and closed her eyes again i am most of the time when im not busy being infuriated with his bossy ways always prince to peasant hes used to having things his way well he wont be having me his way she opened her eyes and rose will you show me the rest of the gallery id be happy to and perhaps youll tell me the story of your life maggie cocked her head and studied him a mischief maker she thought with his dreamy eyes and piratical demeaner shed always enjoyed a mischiefmaking friend all right then she said and linked her arm through his as they strolled through the next archway there once was a farmer who wanted to be a poet there were just too damn many people in dublin for maggies taste you could hardly take a step without bumping into someone it was a pretty city she couldnt deny it with its lovely bay and spearing steeples she could admire the magnificence of its architecture all the red brick and gray stone the charm of its colorful storefronts she was told by her driver brian duggin that the early dubliners had a sense of order and beauty as keen as their sense of profit and so she thought the city suited rogan even as he suited it she settled back in the quiet car to admire the dazzling front gardens and copper cupolas the shady greens and the busy river liffey which split the city in two she felt her pulse quicken to the pace around her respond to the crowds and the hurry but the bustle excited her only briefly before it exhausted the sheer number of people on oconnell street where everyone seemed to be in a desperate rush to get somewhere else made her yearn for the lazy quiet roads of the west still she found the view from oconnell bridge spectacular the ships moored at the quays the majestic dome of the four courts glinting in the sun her driver seemed happy enough to obey her request simply to cruise or to pull over and wait while she walked through parks and squares she stopped on grafton street among the smart shops and bought a pin for brianna a simple silver crescent with a curve of garnets it would maggie thought as she tucked the box in her purse suit her sisters traditional taste for herself she mooned briefly over a pair of earrings long twists of gold and silver and copper accented top and bottom with fire opals she had no business spending good money on such frivolous baubles no business at all she reminded herself when she had no real guarantee when she might sell another piece so of course she bought the earrings and sent her budget to the devil to round off her day she visited museums wandered along the river and had tea in a tiny shop off fitzwilliam square she spent her last hour watching the sunlight and reflections from half penny bridge and sketching in a pad shed picked up in an art store it was after seven when she returned to rogans house he came out of the front parlor and stopped her before shed reached the stairs id begun to wonder if youd had duggin drive you all the way back to clare i thought of it once or twice she pushed back her untidy hair its been years since ive visited dublin she thought of the juggler shed seen and of course of her father id forgotten how noisy it is i assume you havent eaten i havent no if she didnt count the biscuit shed had with her tea dinners ordered for seventhirty but i can have it put back until eight if youd like to join us for cocktails us my grandmother shes anxious to meet you oh maggies mood plummeted someone else to meet to talk to to be with i wouldnt want to hold you up its not a problem if youd like to change well be in the parlor change for what resigned she tucked her sketchbook under her arm im afraid i left all my formal attire at home but if my appearance embarrasses you i can have a tray in my room dont put words in my mouth maggie taking her firmly by the arm rogan steered her into the parlor grandmother he addressed the woman sitting regally in the high back brocaded chair id like you to meet margaret mary concannon maggie christine sweeney an absolute delight christine offered a fineboned hand accented with one gleaming sapphire matching ones dripped from her ears i take full credit for you being here my dear as i bought the first piece of your work that intrigued rogan thank you youre a collector then its in the blood please sit rogan get the child something to drink rogan moved to the glittering decanters what would you like maggie whatever youre having resigned to being polite for an hour or two maggie set her sketchpad and purse aside it must be thrilling to be having your first major show christine began why the girl was striking she thought all cream and fire as eyecatching in a shirt and tights as dozens of women would attempt to be in diamonds and silks to be honest mrs sweeney its hard for me to imagine it she accepted the glass from rogan and hoped its contents would be enough to brace her for an evening of making conversation tell me what you thought of the gallery its wonderful a cathedral to art oh christine reached out again squeezing maggies hand how my michael would have loved to hear you say that its exactly what he wanted he was a frustrated artist you know no maggie slanted rogan a glance i didnt he wanted to paint he had the vision but not the aptitude so he created the atmosphere and the means to celebrate others who did christines smoky silk suit rustled as she sat back he was a wonderful man rogan takes after him in looks and temperament that must make you very proud it does as im sure what youve done with your life has made your family proud of you i dont know as prides quite the word maggie sipped her drink discovered rogan had served her sherry and struggled not to grimace fortunately the butler came to the doorway at that moment to announce dinner well thats handy grateful maggie set her glass aside im starved then well go straight in rogan offered his grandmother his arm julien is delighted youre enjoying his cuisine oh hes a fine cook thats the truth i wouldnt have the heart to tell him im such a poor one myself ill eat anything i dont have to prepare we wont mention it rogan drew out a chair for christine then for maggie we wont maggie agreed since ive decided to try to barter some of bries recipes for his brie is maggies sister rogan explained as the soup course was served she runs a bandb in clare and from personal experience i can attest that her cuisine is excellent so your sisters an artist in the kitchen rather than the studio she is maggie agreed finding herself much more comfortable in christine sweeneys company than shed expected to be its a magic touch brianna has with hearth and home in clare you say christine nodded as rogan offered her wine i know the area well i come from galway myself you do surprise and pleasure flitted across maggies face it was another reminder to her of how much she missed home what part galway city my father was in shipping i met michael through his business deals with my father my own grandmother on my mothers side came from galway though under most circumstances maggie would rather eat than talk she was enjoying the combination of excellent food and conversation she lived there until she married that would be about sixty years ago she was a merchants daughter is that so and her name she was sharon feeney before her marriage sharon feeney christines eyes brightened as deep now and as sparkling as her sapphires daughter of colin and mary feeney aye you knew her then oh i did we lived minutes from each other i was a bit younger than she but we spent time together christine winked at maggie then looked at rogan to draw him into the conversation i was madly in love with maggies greatuncle niall and used sharon shamelessly to be around him surely you needed to use nothing and no one to get any mans attention rogan said oh youve a sweet tongue christine laughed and patted his hand mind yourself around this one maggie he doesnt waste much sugar on me it dissolves in vinegar rogan retorted in the most pleasant of tones deciding to ignore him maggie turned back to christine i havent seen my uncle in years but ive heard he was a fine handsome man in his youth and had a way with the ladies he was and he did christine laughed again and the sound was young and gay i spent many a night dreaming of niall feeney when i was a girl the truth is she turned her brilliant eyes on rogan and there was a hint of mischief in them that maggie admired if michael hadnt come along and swept me off my feet id have fought to the death to marry niall interesting isnt it you two might have been cousins had things worked out differently rogan glanced at maggie lifted his wine horrifying was all he could think absolutely horrifying maggie snickered and polished off her soup niall feeney never married you know and lives a bachelors life in galway perhaps mrs sweeney you broke his heart id like to think so the bonedeep beauty so evident in christine sweeneys face was enhanced by a flattering blush but the sad truth is niall never noticed me was he blind then rogan asked and earned a beaming smile from his grandmother not blind maggie sighed at the scents as the fish course was set before her but a man perhaps more foolish than most and never married you say christines inquiry rogan noted with a slight frown was perhaps just a tad too casual never my sister corresponds with him a wicked twinkle gleamed in maggies eye ill have her mention you in her next letter well see if his memorys better than his youthful judgment though her smile was a bit dreamy christine shook her head fiftyfive years its been since i left galway for dublin and for michael sweet mary the thought of the passing years brought a pleasant sadness the same she might have felt on watching a ship sail out of port she still missed her husband though hed been gone for more than a dozen years in an automatic gesture maggie found touching christine laid a hand over rogans sharon married a hotelier did she not she did yes and was widowed for the last ten years of her life im sorry but she had her daughter to comfort her my mother but i dont know as she was a comfort the dregs of bitterness interfered with the delicate flavor of the trout in maggies mouth she washed them away with wine we wrote for several years after sharon married she was very proud of her girl maeve isnt it aye maggie tried to envision her mother as a girl and failed a lovely child sharon told me with striking golden hair the temper of a devil she would say and the voice of an angel maggie swallowed hurriedly gaped the voice of an angel my mother why yes sharon said she sang like a saint and wanted to be a professional i believe she was at least for a time christine paused thinking while maggie simply stared yes i know she was in fact she came up to gort to sing but i couldnt get down to see her i had some clippings sharon sent me must have been thirty years past she smiled curious she no longer sings no maggie let out a quiet baffled breath she had never heard her mother raise her voice in anything other than complaint or criticism a singer a professional with a voice like an angel surely they must be speaking of different people well christine went on i imagine she was happy raising her family happy that was surely a different maeve feeney concannon than had raised her i suppose maggie said slowly she made her choice as we all do sharon made hers when she married and moved from galway i must say i missed her sorely but she loved her johnny and her hotel with an effort maggie put thoughts of her mother aside she would have to pick through them later carefully i remember grans hotel from childhood we worked there one summer brie and i as girls tidying and fetching i didnt take to it a fortunate thing for the art world maggie acknowledged rogans compliment perhaps but it was certainly a relief to me ive never asked you how you became interested in glass my fathers mother had a vase venetian glass it was fluteshaped of pale hazy green the color of leaves in bud i thought it was the most beautiful thing id ever seen she told me it had been made with breath and fire maggie smiled at the memory lost herself in it a moment so that her eyes became as hazy as the vase she described it was like a fairy tale to me using breath and fire to create something you could hold in your hand so she brought me a book that had pictures of a glass house the workers the pipes the furnaces i think from that moment there was nothing else i wanted to do but make my own rogan was the same christine murmured so sure at such a young age of what his life would be she let her gaze wander from maggie to her grandson and back and now youve found each other so it would seem rogan agreed and rang for the next course chapter eight maggie couldnt stay away from the gallery there seemed to be no reason to joseph and the rest of the staff were welcoming enough even going so far as asking for her opinion on some of the displays however much it might have pleased her she couldnt improve on rogans eye for detail and placement she left the staff to carry out his orders and set herself up unobtrusively to sketch the native american artwork it fascinated her the baskets and headdresses the meticulous beading the intricacies of the ritual masks ideas and visions leaped around in her head like gazelles bounding soaring so that she rushed to transfer them to paper she preferred burying herself in work to everything else whenever she took too much time to think her mind veered back to what christine had told her about maeve just how much shed wondered was beneath the surface of her parents lives that shed been ignorant of her mother with a career her father loving some other woman and the two of them trapped because of her in a prison that had denied them their deepest wishes she needed to find out more and yet she was afraid afraid that whatever she learned would only further demonstrate the fact that she hadnt really known the people who had created her hadnt known them at all so she put that need aside and haunted the gallery when no one objected she used rogans office as a temporary studio the light was good and as the room was tucked away in the back of the building she was rarely disturbed roomy it was not obviously rogan had elected to utilize every space he could find for the showing of art she couldnt argue with that decision she covered his gleaming walnut desk with a sheet of plastic and thick pads of newspaper the charcoalandpencil sketches she had made were only a start she worked now by adding splashes of color shed picked up a few acrylics in a shop near the gallery but often her impatience with the imperfections of her materials caused her to use other materials at hand and she would dip her brush into coffee dregs or dampened ashes or stroke bolder lines with lipstick or eyebrow pencils she considered her sketches merely a first step while she believed herself an adequate enough draftsman maggie would never have termed herself a master with brush and paint this was only a way to keep her vision alive from conception to execution the fact that rogan had arranged for several of her sketches to be matted and hung for the show embarrassed her more than pleased her still she reminded herself that people would buy anything if they were made to believe in its quality and value shed become a cynic she thought narrowing her eyes as she studied her work and a bean counter as well tallying up profits before they were made god help her shed been caught up in the gossamer dream rogan had spun and shed hate herself even more than she would hate him if she went back home a failure did failure run in her blood she wondered would she be like her father and fail to achieve the goal that mattered most to her she was so intent on her work and on her darkening thoughts that she hissed in surprise and annoyance as the office door opened out out do i have to lock the damn thing my thoughts exactly rogan closed the door at his back what the hell are you doing an experiment in nuclear physics she snapped back what does it look like frustrated by the interruption she blew her choppy bangs out of her eyes and glared what are you doing here i believe this gallery which includes this office belongs to me theres no forgetting that maggie dipped her brush in a mixture of paint shed daubed on an old board not with the first words out of everyones mouth around here being mr sweeney this and mr sweeney that inspired by this little verbal foray she washed color over the thick paper shed tacked to another board as she did so his gaze dropped from her face to her hands and for a moment he was struck speechless what in sweet hell are you about dumbfounded he lunged forward his priceless and wellloved desk was covered with paintsplattered newspapers jars of brushes pencils and unless he had very much mistaken the sharp smell bottles of turpentine youre a madwoman do you realize this desk is a george ii its a sturdy piece she responded with no respect for the dead english king youre in my light distracted she waved a paintflecked hand at him he avoided it out of instinct and well protected she added ive a sheet of plastic under the newspaper oh well that makes it all right then he grabbed a handful of her hair and tugged ruthlessly if youd wanted a bloody easel he said when they were nose to nose id have provided you with one i dont need an easel only a bit of privacy so if youd make yourself scarce as youve done brilliantly for the past two days she gave him a helpful shove they both looked down at the bold red smudges shed transferred to his pinstriped lapel oops she said idiot his eyes narrowed into dangerous cobalt slits when she chuckled im sorry truly but the apology was diluted by a strangled laugh im messy when i work and i forgot about my hands but from what ive seen youve a warehouse full of suits you wont be missing this one you think not quick as a snake he dipped his fingers in paint and smeared it over her face her squeal of surprise was intensely satisfying the color becomes you she swiped the back of her hand over her cheek and spread the paint around so you want to play do you laughing she snatched up a tube of canary yellow if you dare he said torn between anger and amusement ill make you eat it tube and all a concannon never ignores a challenge her grin spread as she prepared to squeeze retaliation on both sides was interrupted as the office door opened rogan i hope youre not the elegant woman in the chanel suit broke off pale blue eyes widening i beg your pardon obviously baffled she smoothed back her soft swing of sable hair i didnt know you were engaged your interruptions timely cool as a spring breeze rogan ripped a sheet of newspaper and rubbed at the paint on his fingertips i believe we were about to make fools of ourselves perhaps maggie thought setting aside the tube of paint with a ridiculous sense of regret but it would have been fun patricia hennessy id like to present margaret mary concannon our featured artist this patricia thought though her fragile wellbred features revealed nothing but polite interest this paintsmeared wildhaired woman was m m concannon how lovely to meet you and you miss hennessy its missus patricia told her with the faintest of smiles but please call me patricia like a single rose behind glass maggie thought patricia hennessy was lovely delicate and perfect and she mused studying the elegant oval face unhappy ill be out of your way in a moment or two im sure you want to talk to rogan alone please dont hurry on my account patricias smile curved her lips but barely touched her eyes ive just been upstairs with joseph admiring your work you have an incredible talent thank you maggie snatched rogans handkerchief from his breast pocket dont the order died on his lips as she soaked the irish linen in turpentine with something resembling a snarl he took it back and scrubbed the rest of the paint from his hands my office seems to have been temporarily transformed into an artists garret sure and ive never worked in a garret in me life maggie announced deliberately broadening her brogue ive annoyed himself by disturbing sacred ground here dont you know if youve been acquainted with rogan long youll understand hes a finicky man im not finicky he said between his teeth oh of course not maggie responded with a roll of the eyes a wild man he is as unpredictable as the colors of a sunrise a sense of organization and control is not generally considered a flaw a complete lack of it normally is theyd turned toward each other again effectively if unintentionally closing patricia out even in the small room there was tension in the air and it was obvious to patricia she couldnt forget the time when he had desired her keenly she couldnt forget it because she was in love with rogan sweeney im sorry if ive come at a bad time she hated the fact that her voice was stiff with formality not at all rogans scowl was easily transformed into a charming smile as he turned to her its always a delight to see you i just dropped in thinking you might be done with business for the day the carneys invited me for drinks and hoped you could join us im sorry patricia rogan looked down at his ruined handkerchief then dropped it onto the spreadout sheets of newspaper with the show tomorrow ive dozens of details yet to see to nonsense maggie shot rogan a wide grin i wouldnt want to interfere with your social hour its not your fault ive simply other obligations give my apologies to marion and george i will patricia offered her cheek for rogan to kiss the scent of turpentine clashed with then overwhelmed her delicate floral perfume it was nice to meet you miss concannon im looking forward to tomorrow night its maggie she said with a warmth that came from innate female understanding and thank you well hope for the best good day to you patricia maggie hummed to herself as she cleaned her brushes shes lovely she commented after patricia left old friend thats right old married friend he only lifted a brow at the implication an old widowed friend ah a very significant response for reasons he couldnt fathom he became defensive ive known patricia for more than fifteen years my youre a slow one sweeney propping a hip on the desk maggie tapped a pencil to her lips a beautiful woman of obvious taste a woman of your own class i may add and in fifteen years you havent made a move a move his tone iced like frost on glass a particularly unattractive phrase but ignoring your infelicitous phrasing for the moment how do you know i havent such things show with a shrug maggie eased off the desk intimate relationships and platonic ones give off entirely different signals her look softened he was after all only a man ill wager you think youre terribly good friends naturally i do you dolt she felt a rush of sympathy for patricia shes more than half in love with you the idea and the casually confident way maggie presented it took him aback thats absurd the only thing absurd about it is that you havent a clue briskly she began to gather her supplies mrs hennessy has my sympathy or part of it hard for me to offer it all when im interested in you myself and i dont fancy the idea of you popping from her bed to mine she was he thought exasperated the damnedest woman this is a ridiculous conversation and i have a great deal of work to do it was rather endearing the way his voice could go so grandly formal on my account at that so i shouldnt be holding you up ill spread these drawings out in the kitchen to dry if thats all right with you as long as theyre out of my way and their creator with them he thought he made the mistake of glancing down focusing what have you done here made a bit of a mess as youve already pointed out but itll tidy quick enough without a word he picked up one of her drawings by the edges he could see clearly what had inspired her how she meant to employ the native american art and turn it into something boldly and uniquely her own no matter how much or how often she exasperated him he was struck time and again by her talent you havent been wasting time i see its one of the little things we have in common do you want to tell me what you think that you understand pride and beauty very well a good compliment rogan she smiled over it a very good one your work exposes you maggie and makes you all the more confusing sensitive and arrogant compassionate pitiless sensual and aloof if youre saying im moody i wont argue the tug came again quick and painful she wondered if there would come a time when he would look at her the way he looked at her work and what they would create between them when and if he did its not a flaw to me it only makes you difficult to live with no one has to but myself she lifted a hand disconcerting him by stroking it down his cheek im thinking of sleeping with you rogan and we both know it but im not your proper mrs hennessy looking for a husband to guide the way he curled his fingers around her wrist surprised and darkly pleased when her pulse bumped unsteadily what are you looking for she should have had the answer it should have been on the tip of her tongue but shed lost it somewhere between the question and the hard fast stroke of her own heart ill let you know when i find out she leaned forward rising on her toes to brush her mouth over his but that does fine for now she took the painting from him and gathered up others margaret mary he said as she started for the door id wash that paint from my face if i were you she twitched her nose looked crosseyed down at the red smear bloody hell she muttered and slammed the door on her way out the parting shot may have soothed his pride but he wasnt steady and bitterly resented that she could turn him inside out with so little effort there was simply no time for the complications she could cause in her personal life if there were time he would simply drag her off to some quiet room and empty all of this frustration this lust this maddening hunger into her until he was purged of it surely once hed taken control other or at least of the situation hed find his balance again but there were priorities and his first by legal contract and moral obligation was to her art he glanced down at one of the paintings shed left behind it looked hurriedly executed carelessly brilliant with quick strokes and bold colors demanding attention like the artist herself he mused it simply wouldnt be ignored deliberately he turned his back on it and started out but the image remained teasing his brain just as the taste of her remained teasing his senses mr sweeney sir rogan stopped in the main room bit back a sigh the thin grizzledlooking man standing there clutching a ragged portfolio was no stranger aiman he greeted the roughly dressed man as politely as he would have a silkdraped client you havent been in for a while ive been working a nervous tic worked around aimans left eye ive a lot of new work mr sweeney perhaps he had been working rogan mused hed most certainly been drinking the signs were all there in the flushed cheeks the redrimmed eyes the trembling hands aiman was barely thirty but drink had made him old frail and desperate he stayed just inside the door off to the side so that visitors to the gallery wouldnt be distracted by him his eyes pleaded with rogan his fingers curled and uncurled on the old cardboard portfolio i was hoping youd have time to look mr sweeney ive a show tomorrow aiman a large one i know i saw it in the paper nervously aiman licked his lips hed spent the last of the money hed earned from sidewalk sales in the pub the night before he knew it was crazy worse he knew it was stupid now he desperately needed a hundred pounds for rent or hed be out on the street within the week i could leave them with you mr sweeney come back on monday ive ive done some good work here i wanted you to be the first to see it rogan didnt ask if aiman was out of money the answer was obvious and the question would only have humiliated the man he had shown promise once rogan remembered before fears and whiskey had leveled him my office is a bit disrupted at the moment rogan said kindly come upstairs and show me what youve done thank you aimans bloodshot eyes brightened with a smile with hope as pathetic as tears thank you mr sweeney i wont take up much of your time i promise you i was about to have a bit of tea unobtrusively rogan took aimans arm to steady him as they started upstairs youll join me while we look over your work id be pleased to mr sweeney maggie eased back so that rogan wouldnt see her watching as he took the curve of the stairs shed been certain absolutely certain that he would boot the scruffy artist out the door or she mused have one of his underlings do his dirty work for him instead hed invited the man to tea and had led him upstairs like a welcomed guest who would have thought rogan sweeney had such kindness in him hed buy some of the paintings as well she realized enough so that the artist could keep his pride and a meal or two in his belly the gesture was more impressive to her more important than a dozen of the grants and donations she imagined worldwide made annually he cared the realization shamed her even as it pleased her he cared as much about the very human hands that created art as he did the art itself she went back into his office to tidy and to try to assimilate this new aspect of rogan to all the others twentyfour hours later maggie sat on the edge of her bed in rogans guest room she had her head between her knees and was cursing herself for being vilely ill it was humiliating to admit even to herself that nerves could rule her but there was no denying it with the nasty taste of sickness still in her throat and her body shivering with the chills it wont matter she told herself again it wont matter a whit what they think what i think is what counts oh god oh god why did i let myself be pulled into thison long careful breaths she raised her head the wave of dizziness slapped her made her grit her teeth in the cheval glass across the room her image shot back at her she was wearing nothing but her underwear and her skin was shockingly white against the lacy black shed chosen her face was pasty looking her eyes redrimmed a shuddering moan escaped her as she lowered her head again a fine mess she looked and it was nothing but a spectacle she was going to make of herself shed been happy in clare hadnt she it was there she belonged alone and unfettered just herself and her glass with the quiet fields and the morning mists it was there she would be if it hadnt been for rogan sweeney and all his fancy words tempting her away he was the devil she thought conveniently forgetting that shed begun to change her mind about him a monster he was who preyed on innocent artists for his own greedy ends he would squeeze her dry then cast her aside like an empty tube of paint she would have murdered him if shed had the strength to stand when the knock came softly at her door she squeezed her eyes shut go away she shouted in her mind go away and leave me to die in peace it came again followed by a quiet inquiry maggie dear are you nearly ready mrs sweeney maggie pressed the heels of her hands to her gritty eyes and bit back a scream no im not she fought to make her voice curt and decisive but it came out in a whimper im not going at all with a swish of silk christine slipped into the room oh sweetheart instantly maternal she hurried to maggie and draped an arm over her shoulders its all right darling its just nerves im fine but maggie abandoned pride and turned her face into christines shoulder im just not going of course you are briskly christine lifted maggies face to hers she knew exactly which button needed to be pushed and did so ruthlessly you dont want them to think youre afraid do you im not afraid maggies chin came up but the nausea swam like oil in her stomach im just not interested christine smiled stroked maggies hair and waited i cant face it mrs sweeney maggie blurted out i just cant ill humiliate myself and i hate that more than anything id sooner be hanged i understand completely but youll not humiliate yourself she took maggies frozen hands in hers its true its yourself on display as much as your work thats the foolishness of the art world theyll wonder about you and talk about you and speculate let them its not that so much though thats part of it im not used to being wondered over and i dont think ill like it but its my work she pressed her lips together its the best part of me mrs sweeney if its found wanting if its not good enough rogan thinks it is a lot he knows maggie muttered thats true a lot he does know christine tilted her head the child needed a bit of mothering she decided and mothering wasnt always kind do you want me to go down and tell him youre too afraid too insecure to attend the show no helpless maggie covered her face with her hands hes trapped me the tricky snake of a man the damned greedy i beg your pardon going stiff maggie lowered her hands christine made certain to swallow the chuckle thats quite all right she said soberly now you wait here and ill go down and tell rogan to go on without us hes already wearing a trench in the hallway with his pacing ive never seen anyone so obsessed with time its a sweeney trait michael drove me mad with it god bless him she patted maggies hand ill be right back up to help you dress mrs sweeney desperate maggie grabbed at christines sleeve couldnt you just tell him ive died they could make a lovely wake out of the showing and as a rule you make more of a profit off a dead artist than a live one there you see christine dislodged maggies clutching fingers youre feeling better already now run along and wash your face but im standing in for your gran tonight christine said firmly i believe sharon would have wanted me to and i said go wash your face margaret mary yes maam mrs sweeney with no place else to go maggie got shakily to her feet you wont tell him i mean id be grateful to you if you didnt mention to rogan that id on one of the most important evenings of her life a womans entitled to linger over dressing i suppose a ghost of a smile played around maggies mouth it makes me sound like a frivolous fool but its better than the alternative leave rogan to me theres just one other thing shed been putting this off maggie admitted she might as well face it now when she was feeling as low as she imagined she could possibly feel do you think you might be able to find those clippings you spoke of the ones about my mother i think i could i should have thought of it myself of course youd like to read them i would yes id be grateful ill see that you get them now go fix your face ill scoot rogan along she sent maggie a bolstering smile before closing the door when christine found him rogan was still furiously pacing in the foyer where the devil is she he demanded the moment he spotted his grandmother shes been primping up there for two hours well of course she has christine gestured grandly the impression she makes tonight is vital isnt it its important naturally if she made the wrong one his dreams would slide down the drain along with maggies he needed her here now and ready to dazzle but why should it take her so long shes only to put on her clothes and fuss with her hair youve been a single man too long my darling if you truly believe such nonsense affectionately christine reached out to straighten his already perfect tie how handsome you look in a tuxedo grandmother youre stalling no not at all beaming at him she brushed at his spotless lapels ive just come down to tell you to go along without us well follow when maggies ready she should be ready now but shes not besides how much more effective might it be if she arrived just late enough to make an entrance you appreciate the theater of these events rogan there was truth in that all right then he checked his watch swore lightly if he didnt go within the minute hed most certainly be late it was his responsibility to be there he reminded himself to see to any last minute details no matter how much he wanted to wait and take maggie to the gallery himself ill leave her in your more than capable hands ill have the car come back for you as soon as ive been dropped off see that shes there within the hour wont you you can count on me darling i always do he kissed her on the cheek stepped back by the way mrs sweeney i havent mentioned how beautiful you look no you havent i was quite deflated you will be as always the most stunning woman in the room well said now run along with you and leave maggie to me with pleasure he shot one look up the stairs as he headed for the door it was not a gentle look i wish you good luck with her as the door closed christine let out a sigh she thought she might need all the luck she could get chapter nine no detail had been overlooked the lighting was perfect leaping and bounding off the curves and swirls of glass the music a waltz now flowed as softly as happy tears through the room fizzing glasses of champagne crowded the silver trays carried gracefully by liveried waiters the sound of clinking crystal and murmuring voices set up a gracious counterpoint to the weeping violins it was in a word perfect not a detail missing except rogan thought grimly the artist herself its wonderful rogan patricia stood beside him elegant in a narrow white gown shivering with bugle beads you have a smashing success he turned to her smiling so it would seem his eyes lingered on hers long enough intensely enough to make her uneasy what is it have i smudged my nose no he lifted his own glass quickly cursing maggie for putting ridiculous thoughts in his head and making him wary of one of his oldest friends in love with him absurd im sorry i suppose my mind was wandering i cant imagine whats keeping maggie im sure shell be along any moment patricia laid a hand on his arm and in the meantime everyones being dazzled by our combined efforts its a lucky thing shes always late he added under his breath no more than a childs sense of time rogan dear there you are i see my patricia found you good evening mrs connelly rogan took patricias mothers delicate hand in his own im delighted to see you no gallery showing can be a success without your presence flatterer pleased she swept up her mink stole anne connelly held on as tightly to her beauty as she did to her vanity she considered it as much a womans duty to preserve her looks as it was to make a home and bear children ann never never neglected her duties and as a result she had the dewy skin and the youthful figure of a girl she fought a constant battle with the years and had for half a century emerged the victor and your husband rogan continued did dennis come with you naturally though hes already off somewhere puffing on one of his cigars and discussing finance she smiled when rogan signaled for a waiter and offered her a glass of champagne even his fondness for you doesnt change his apathy toward art this is fascinating work she gestured to the sculpture beside them an explosion of color mushrooming up from a twisted base gorgeous and disturbing all at once patricia tells me she met the artist briefly yesterday im dying to do so myself shes yet to arrive rogan covered his own impatience smoothly youll find miss concannon as contradictory and as interesting i think as her work and im sure as fascinating we havent seen nearly enough of you lately rogan ive badgered patricia unmercifully about bringing you by she shot her daughter a veiled look that spoke volumes get a move on girl it said dont let him slip away from you im afraid ive been so obsessed with getting this show together quickly that ive neglected my friends youre forgiven as long as we can expect you to dine with us one evening next week id love to rogan caught josephs eye excuse me just a moment wont you must you be so obvious mother patricia murmured into her wine as rogan slipped through the crowd someone has to be merciful heavens girl he treats you like a sister beaming a smile across the room at an acquaintance anne continued to speak in undertones a man doesnt marry a woman he thinks of as his sister and its time you were wed again you couldnt ask for a better match keep loitering around and someone else will scoop him up from under your nose now smile will you must you always look as though youre in mourning dutifully patricia forced her lips to curve did you reach them rogan demanded the moment hed cornered joseph on the car phone josephs gaze skimmed the room brushed over patricia lingered then moved on theyll be here any moment more than an hour late typical be that as it may youll be pleased to know that we have sales on ten pieces already and at least that many offers on surrender that piece is not for sale rogan studied the flamboyant sculpture that stood in the center of the room well tour it first in our galleries in rome paris and new york but along with the other pieces weve chosen it is not to be sold its your decision joseph said easily enough but i should tell you that general fitzsimmons offered us twentyfive thousand pounds for it did he make sure that gets around wont you count on it in the meantime ive been entertaining some of the art critics i think you should joseph trailed off when he saw rogans eyes darken as he looked intently at something over his shoulder joseph turned saw the object of his bosss gaze and let out a low whistle she may be late but shes certainly a showstopper joseph looked back at patricia and saw from the expression on her face that she too had noted rogans reaction his heart bled a little for the woman he knew from personal experience how miserable it was to love someone who thought of you as only a friend shall i go take her around joseph asked what no no ill do it myself rogan had never imagined maggie could look like that sleek and stunning and sensual as sin shed chosen black unrelieved and unadorned the dress took all its style from the body it covered it draped from throat to ankle but no one would call it prim not with the glossy black buttons that swirled the length of it the buttons that shed left daringly unfastened to the swell of her breast and up to the top of one slim thigh her hair was a tousled crown of fire carelessly curled around her face as he drew closer he saw that her eyes were already scanning assessing and absorbing everything in the room she looked fearless defiant and completely in control and so she was now the bout of nerves had served to embarrass her so much that shed beaten them back with nothing more than sheer willfulness she was here and she meant to succeed youre impossibly late the complaint was a last line of defense delivered in a mutter as he took her hand and raised it to his lips their eyes met and incredibly beautiful you approve of the dress thats not the word i would have chosen but yes i do she smiled then you were afraid id wear boots and torn jeans not with my grandmother standing guard shes the most wonderful woman in the world youre lucky to have her the emotional force of the statement more than the words caused rogan to study her curiously im aware of that you cant be not really for youve never known any different she took a deep breath well there were eyes on her already dozens of them bright with curiosity its into the lions den isnt it you neednt worry she said before he could speak ill behave my future depends on it this is only the beginning margaret mary as he drew her into the room with its whirl of light and color she was very much afraid he was right but behave she did the evening seemed to go well as she shook hands accepted compliments answered questions the first hour seemed to float by like a dream what with the sparkle of wine the glitter of glass and the flash of jewels drifting through it was easy as maggie felt slightly removed from the reality somewhat disconnected as much audience as actor in a sumptuously produced play this ah this a bald man with a drooping mustache and a fussy british accent expounded on a piece it was a series of glowing blue spears trapped within a sheer glass globe imprisoned you call it your creativity your sexuality fighting to set itself free mans eternal struggle after all its triumphant even as its melancholy its the six counties maggie said simply the bald man blinked i beg your pardon the six counties of ireland she repeated with a wicked rebel gleam in her eyes imprisoned i see standing beside this wouldbe critic joseph muffled a laugh i found the use of color here so striking lord whitfield the translucence of it creates an unresolved tension between its delicacy and its boldness just so lord whitfield nodded cleared his throat quite extraordinary excuse me maggie watched him retreat with a broad smile well i dont think hell be after buying it and setting it in his den do you joseph youre a wicked woman maggie concannon im an irishwoman joseph she winked at him up the rebels he laughed delightedly and slipping an arm around her waist led her around the room ah mrs connelly joseph gave maggie a subtle squeeze to signal her looking stunning as always joseph always a smooth word and this anne connelly shifted her attention from joseph whom she considered a mere factotum to maggie this is the creative drive im thrilled to meet you my dear im mrs dennis connelly anne i believe you met my daughter patricia yesterday i did yes maggie found annes handclasp as delicate and soft as a brush of satin she must be off with rogan somewhere theyre a lovely couple arent they very maggie lifted a brow she knew a warning when she heard one do you live in dublin mrs connelly i do indeed only a few houses away from the sweeney mansion my family has been a part of dublin society for generations and youre from the west counties clare yes lovely scenery all those charming quaint villages and thatched roofs your family are farmers im told anne lifted a brow obviously amused were this must be so exciting for you particularly with your rural upbringing im sure youve enjoyed your visit to dublin youll be going back soon very soon i think im sure you miss the country dublin can be very confusing to one unused to city life almost like a foreign land at least i understand the language maggie said equably i hope youll enjoy your evening mrs connelly excuse me wont you and if rogan thought he would sell that woman anything that maggie concannon created maggie thought as she walked away hed hang for it exclusive rights be damned shed smash every last piece into dust before she saw any in anne connellys hands talking to her as though she were some slackjawed milkmaid with straw in her hair she held her temper back as she made her way out of the ballroom and toward one of the sitting rooms each was crowded with people talking sitting laughing discussing her her head began to throb as she marched down the stairs shed get herself a beer out of the kitchen she decided and have a few minutes of peace she strode straight in only to come up short when she saw a portly man puffing on a cigar and nursing a pilsner caught he said and grinned sheepishly that makes two of us then i was coming down for a quiet beer myself let me fetch you one gallantly he heaved his bulk out of the chair and pulled a bottle out for her you dont want me to put out the cigar do you the plea in his voice made her laugh not at all my father used to smoke the worlds worst pipe stunk to high heaven i loved it theres a lass he found her a beer and a glass i hate these things he jerked his thumb toward the ceiling mwife drags me i hate them too pretty enough work i suppose he said as she drank like the colors and shapes not that i know a damn thing about it wifes the expert but i liked the look of it and that should be enough id say and i everyones always trying to explain it at these blasted affairs what the artist had in mind and such symbolism he rolled his tongue over the word as if it were a strange dish he wasnt quite ready to sample dont know what the devil theyre talking about maggie decided the man was halfpotted and that she loved him neither do they thats it he raised his glass and drank deeply neither do they just blustering but if i was to say that to anne thats my wife shed give me one of those looks he narrowed his eyes lowered his brows and scowled maggie hooted with laughter who cares what they think anyway maggie propped her elbow on the table and held a fist to her chin its not as if anyones life depended on it except mine she thought and pushed the idea away dont you think affairs like this are just an excuse for people to get all dressed up and act important i do absolutely so complete was his agreement that he rapped his glass sharply to hers as for me do you know what i wanted to be doing tonight what sitting in my chair with my feet on the hassock and irish in my glass watching the television he sighed regretfully but i couldnt disappoint anne or rogan for that matter you know rogan then like my own son a fine man hes turned out to be he wasnt yet twenty when i saw him first his father and i had business together and the boy couldnt wait to be part of it he gestured vaguely to encompass the gallery smart as a whip he is and what business are you in banking excuse me a female voice interrupted them they looked up to see patricia standing in the doorway her hands folded neatly ah theres my love while maggie looked on goggleeyed the man lunged out of his chair and enfolded patricia in a hug that could have felled a mule patricias reaction rather than stiff rejection or cool disgust was a quick musical laugh daddy youll break me in half daddy maggie thought daddy patricia henessys father annes husband this delightful man was married to that that icy stick of a woman it only went to prove she decided that the words till death do us part were the most foolish syllables human beings were ever forced to utter meet my little girl with obvious pride dennis whirled patricia around a beauty isnt she my patricia yes indeed maggie rose grinning its nice to see you again and you congratulations on the wonderful success of your show your show dennis said blankly we never introduced ourselves laughing now maggie stepped forward and offered dennis her hand im maggie concannon mr connelly oh he said nothing for a moment as he racked his brain trying to recall if hed said anything insulting a pleasure he managed to say as his brain stalled it was truly thank you for the best ten minutes ive had since i walked in the door dennis smiled this woman seemed downright human for an artist i do like the colors and the shapes he offered hopefully and thats the nicest compliment ive had all evening daddy mothers looking for you patricia brushed a stray ash from his lapel the gesture one she had carelessly used with her own father countless times arrowed straight into maggies heart id better let her find me then he looked back at maggie and when she grinned at him he grinned back i hope we meet again miss concannon so do i wont you come up with us patricia asked no not just now maggie answered not wishing to socialize further with patricias mother the bright look faded the moment their footsteps died away on the polished floor she sat down alone in the lightflooded kitchen it was quiet there so quiet she could nearly fool herself into believing the building was empty but for her she wanted to believe she was alone more she wanted to believe the sadness she suddenly felt was just that she missed the solitude of her own green fields and quiet hills the endless hours of silence with only the roar of her own kiln and her own imagination to drive her but it wasnt only that on this one of the brightest nights of her life she had no one none of the chattering brilliant crowd of people upstairs knew her cared for her understood her there was no one abovestairs waiting for maggie concannon so she had herself she thought and rose and that was all anyone needed her work was well received it wasnt so difficult to cut through all the fancy and pompous phrases to the core rogans people liked what she did and that was the first step she was on her way she told herself as she swung out of the kitchen she was rushing down the path toward fame and fortune the path that had eluded the concannons for the last two generations and she would do it all herself the light and the music sparkled down the staircase like fairy dust along the curve of a rainbow she stood at the foot of the stairs her hand clutched on the rail her foot on the first tread then with a jerk she turned to hurry outside into the dark when the clock struck one rogan yanked at his elegant black tie and swore the woman he thought as he paced the darkened parlor deserved murder and no less shed vanished like smoke in the middle of a crowded party arranged for her benefit leaving him he remembered with boiling resentment to make foolish excuses he should have known that a woman of her temperament couldnt be trusted to behave reasonably he certainly should have known better than to give her such a prominent place in his own ambitions his hopes for the future of his business how in hell could he hope to build a gallery for irish art when the first irish artist hed personally selected groomed and showcased had fled her own opening like an irresponsible child now it was the middle of the night and hed not had a word from her the brilliant success of the show his own satisfaction with a job well done had clouded over like her precious west county sky there was nothing he could do but wait and worry she didnt know dublin for all its beauty and charm there were still sections dangerous to a woman alone and there was always the possibility of an accident the thought of which brought on a vicious throbbing headache at the base of his skull hed taken two long strides toward the phone to telephone the hospitals when he heard the click of the front door he pivoted and rushed into the hallway she was safe and under the dazzle of the foyer chandelier he could see she was unharmed visions of murder leaped back into his aching head where in the sweet hell have you been shed hoped he be out at some highclass club clinking glasses with his friends but since he wasnt she offered him a smile and a shrug oh out and about your dublins a lovely city at night as he stared at her his hands closed into ready fists youre saying youve been out sightseeing until one in the morning is it so late then i must have lost track well then ill say good night no you wont he took a step toward her what you will do is give me an explanation for your behavior thats something i dont have to explain to anyone but if youd be more clear perhaps id make an exception there were nearly two hundred people gathered tonight for your benefit you were unbelievably rude i was nothing of the kind more weary than she wanted to admit she strolled past him into the parlor slipped out of the miserably uncomfortable heels and propped her tired feet on a tassled stool the truth is i was so unbelievably polite my teeth nearly fell out of my head i hope to christ i dont have to smile at another bloody soul for a month i wouldnt mind one of your brandies now rogan its chilly out this time of night he noticed for the first time that she wore nothing over the thin black dress where the devil is your wrap i didnt have one youll have to mark that down in your little book acquire maggie a suitable evening wrap she reached up for the snifter hed poured damn it your hands are frozen have you no sense theyll warm quick enough her brows arched as he stalked over to the fireplace and crouched down to start a fire what no servants shut up the one thing i wont tolerate from you tonight is sarcasm ive taken all i plan to take flames licked into life to eat greedily at dry wood in the shifting light maggie saw that his face was tight with anger the best way to meet temper shed always thought was to match it ive given you nothing to take she sipped the brandy would have sighed over the welcome heat of the liquor if she and rogan hadnt been glaring at each other i went to your showing didnt i in a proper dress with a proper foolish smile pasted on my face it was your showing he shot back you ungrateful selfish inconsiderate brat however weary her body she wouldnt allow him to get away with such language she stood rigidly and faced him i wont contradict you im exactly as you say and have been told so most of my life fortunately for both of us its only my work you have to be concerned about do you have any idea the time and effort and expense that went into putting that show together thats your province her voice was as stiff as her spine as youre always so quick to tell me and i was there stayed above two hours rubbing elbows with strangers youd better learn that a patron is never a stranger and that rudeness is never attractive the quiet controlled tone cut through her defensive armor like a sword i never agreed to stay the whole evening i needed to be alone thats all and to wander the streets all night im responsible for you while youre here maggie for gods sake id nearly called out the garda youre not responsible for me i am but she could see now that it wasnt simply anger darkening his eyes but concern as well if i caused you worry ill apologize i simply went for a walk you went out strolling and left your first major show without a byyourleave yes the snifter was out of her hand and hurtling toward the stone hearth before she realized it glass shattered rained like bullets i had to get out i couldnt breathe i couldnt bear it all those people staring at me at my work and the music the lights everything so lovely so perfect i didnt know it would scare me so i thought id gotten over it since that first day you showed me the room and my work set up like something out of a dream you were frightened yes yes damn you are you happy to hear it i was terrified when you opened the door and i looked inside and saw what youd done i could barely speak you did this to me she said furiously you opened this pandoras box and let out all my hopes and my fears and my needs you cant know what its like to have needs terrible ones you dont even think you should have he studied her now ivory and flame in a slim black dress oh but i can he said quietly i can you should have told me maggie his voice was gentle now as he stepped toward her she threw up both hands to ward him off no dont i couldnt bear you to be kind just now especially when i know i dont deserve it it was wrong of me to leave that way it was selfish and ungrateful she dropped her hands helplessly at her sides but there was no one for me up those stairs no one and it broke my heart she looked so delicate all at once so he did what she asked and didnt touch her he was afraid if he did however gently she might snap in his hands if youd let me know how important it was to you maggie id have arranged to have your family here you cant arrange brianna god knows you cant bring my father back her voice broke shaming her with a strangled sound she pressed a hand to her mouth im overtired thats all she fought a bitter war to control her voice overstimulated with all the excitement i owe you an apology for leaving the way i did and gratitude for all the work you did for me he preferred her raging or weeping to this suited politeness it left him no choice but to respond in kind the important thing is that the show was a success yes her eyes glittered in the firelight thats the important thing if youll excuse me now ill go up to bed of course maggie one more thing she turned back he stood before the fire the flames leaping gold behind him yes i was there for you up those stairs perhaps next time youll remember that and be content she didnt answer he heard only the rustle other dress as she hurried across the hall and up the stairs then the quick click of her bedroom door closing he stared at the fire watched a log break apart cut through by flame and heat smoke puffed once stirred by the wind he continued to stare as a shower of sparks rained against the screen scattered over stone and winked out she was he realized every bit as capricious moody and brilliant as that fire as dangerous and as elemental and he was quite desperately in love with her chapter ten what do you mean gone rogan pushed away from his desk and scraped joseph with a look of outrage of course shes not gone but she is she stopped by the gallery to say goodbye only an hour ago reaching into his pocket joseph drew out an envelope she asked me to give you this rogan took it tossed it on his desk are you saying shes gone back to clare the morning after her show yes and in a tearing hurry i didnt have time to show her the reviews joseph reached up to fiddle with the tiny gold hoop in his ear shed booked a flight to shannon said she only had a moment to say goodbye and god bless gave me the note for you kissed me and ran out again he smiled it was a bit like being battered by a small tornado he lifted his shoulders let them fall im sorry rogan if id known you wanted her to stay id have tried to stop her i believe id have been flattened but id have tried it doesnt matter he lowered carefully into his chair again how did she seem impatient rushed distracted very much as usual she wanted to be back home was all she told me back at work i wasnt sure you knew so i thought id come by and tell you in person i have an appointment with general fitzsimmons and it was on my way i appreciate it i should be by the gallery by four give the general my regards ill give him the business joseph said with a flashing grin by the way he went up another five thousand on surrender not for sale rogan picked up the note on his desk after joseph closed the door behind him ignoring his work rogan split the envelope with his ebonyhandled letter opener the creamy stationery from his own guest room was dashed over with maggies hurried and beautiful scrawl dear rogan i imagine youll be annoyed that ive left so abruptly but it cant be helped i need to be home and back at work and i wont apologize for it i will thank you im sure youll start firing wires my way and ill warn you in advance i intend to ignore them at least for a time please give my best to your grandmother and i wouldnt mind if you thought of me now and again maggie oh one more thing you might be interested to know that im taking home a half dozen of juliens recipes thats your cooks name if you dont know he thinks im charming rogan skimmed the letter a second time before setting it aside it was for the best he decided they would both be happier and more productive with the whole of ireland between them certainly he would be it was difficult to be productive around a woman when you were in love with her and when she frustrated you on every possible level and with any luck any at all these feelings that had grown in him would ease and fade with time and distance so he folded the letter and set it aside he was glad shed gone back satisfied that theyd accomplished the first stage of his plans for her career happy that shed inadvertently given him time to deal with his own confused emotions the hell he thought he missed her already the sky was the color of a robins egg and clear as a mountain stream maggie sat on the little stoop at her front door elbows on knees and just breathed beyond her own garden gate and the trailing flowering fuchsia she could see the lush green of hill and valley and farther since the day was so clear so bright she glimpsed the distant dark mountains she watched a magpie dart across her line of vision flashing over the hedge and up straight as an arrow he went until even the shadow of him was lost in the green one of murphys cows lowed and was answered by another there was a humming echo that would be his tractor and the more insistent sealike roar of her furnaces which shed fired the moment shed arrived her flowers were brilliant in the sunshine vivid red begonias tangled with the lateblooming tulips and dainty spears of larkspur she could smell rosemary and thyme and the strong perfume of the wild roses that swayed like dancers in the mild sweet breeze a wind chime shed made out of scraps of glass sang musically above her head dublin with its busy streets seemed very far away on the ribbon of road in the valley below she saw a red truck tiny and bright as a toy rumble along turn into a lane and climb toward a cottage home for tea she thought and let out a sigh of pure contentment she heard the dog first that fullthroated echoing bark then the rustle of brush that told her hed flushed out a bird her sisters voice floated out on the air amused indulgent leave the poor thing alone con you great bully the dog barked again and moments later leaped at the garden gate his tongue lolled happily when he spotted maggie get down from there brianna ordered do you want her to come home and find her gate crashed in and oh she stopped laying a hand on the wolfhounds massive head as she saw her sister i didnt know you were home the smile came first as she tugged open the gate ive just arrived maggie spent the next few minutes being greeted by concobar wrestling and accepting his lavish licks until he responded to briannas command to sit sit he did his front paws over maggies feet as if to ensure that she would stay put i had a little time brianna began so i thought id come down and tend to your garden it looks fine to me you always think so ive brought you some bread i baked this morning i was going to put it in your freezer feeling awkward brianna held out the basket there was something here she realized something behind the cool calm look in her sisters eyes how was dublin crowded maggie set the basket beside her on the stoop the scent beneath the neat cloth was so tempting that she lifted the cloth aside and broke off a warm hunk of brown bread noisy she tore off a bit of bread and tossed it concobar nipped it midair swallowed it whole and grinned greedy bastard arent you she tossed him another piece before she rose i have something for you maggie turned into the house leaving brianna standing on the path when she came back she handed brianna a box and a manila envelope you didnt have to get me anything brianna began but stopped it was guilt she felt she realized and guilt she was meant to feel accepting it she opened the box oh maggie its lovely the loveliest thing ive ever had she held the pin up to the sun and watched it glint you shouldnt have spent your money its mine to spend maggie said shortly and i hope youll wear it on something other than an apron i dont wear an apron everywhere brianna said evenly she replaced the pin carefully in the box slipped the box into her pocket thank you maggie i wish you havent looked at the other maggie knew what her sister wished and didnt care to hear it regrets that she hadnt been in dublin for the show hardly mattered now brianna studied her sisters face found no sign of softening all right then she opened the envelope drew out a sheet oh oh my however bright and lovely the pin it was nothing compared withthis they both knew it recipes so many souffles and pastries and oh look at this chicken it must be wonderful it is maggie shook her head at briannas reaction nearly sighed ive tasted it myself and the soup there the herbs are the trick to it im told where did you get them brianna caught her bottom lip between her teeth studied the handwritten pages as if they were the treasures of all the ages from rogans cook hes a frenchman recipes from a french chef brianna said reverently i promised him youd send a like number of your own in trade of mine brianna blinked as if coming out of a dream why he couldnt want mine he can and he does i praised your irish stew and your berry pie to the moon and back and i gave him my solemn word youd send them i will of course but i cant imagine thank you maggie its a wonderful gift brianna stepped forward for an embrace then back again cut to the quick by the coolness of maggies response wont you tell me how it went for you i kept trying to imagine it but i couldnt it went well enough there were a lot of people rogan seems to know how to tickle their interest there was an orchestra and waiters in white suits serving flutes of champagne and silver platters of fancy finger food it must have been beautiful im so proud of you maggies eyes chilled are you you know i am i know i needed you there damn it brie i needed you there con whined at the shout and looked uneasily from maggie to his mistress i would have been there if i could there was nothing stopping you but her one night of your life was all i asked one i had no one there no family no friends no one who loved me because you chose her as you always have over me over da even over yourself it wasnt a matter of choosing its always a matter of choosing maggie said coldly youve let her kill your heart brianna just as she killed his thats cruel maggie aye it is shed be the first to tell you that cruel is just what i am cruel marked with sin and damned to the devil well im glad to be bad id chose hell in a blink over kneeling in ashes and suffering silently for heaven as you do maggie stepped back curled a stiff hand around the doorknob well i had my night without you or anyone and it went well enough i should think theyll be some sales out profit ill have money for you in a few weeks im sorry i hurt you maggie briannas own pride stiffened her voice i dont care about the money i do maggie shut the door for three days she was undisturbed the phone didnt ring no knock came at the door even if there had been a summons she would have ignored it she spent nearly every waking minute in the glass house refining perfecting forming the images in her brain and on her sketchpad into glass despite rogans claim as to their worth she hung her drawings on clothespins or on magnets so that a corner of the studio soon came to resemble a dark room with prints drying shed burned herself twice in her hurry once badly enough to make her stop for some hastily applied first aid now she sat in her chair carefully meticulously turning her sketch of an apache breastplate into her own vision it was sweaty work and viciously exacting bleeding color into color shape into shape as she wanted required hundreds of trips to the glory hole but here at least she could be patient whitehot flames licked through open furnace doors blasting out heat the exhaust fan hummed like an engine to keep the fumes coating the glass and not her lungs to an iridescent hue for two days she worked with chemicals mixing and experimenting like a mad scientist until shed perfected the colors she desired copper for the deep turquoise iron for the rich golden yellow manganese for a royal bluish purple the red the true ruby she wanted had given her trouble as it did any glass artist she was working with that now sandwiching that section between two layers of clear glass shed used copper again with reducing agents in the melt to ensure a pure color though it was poisonous and potentially dangerous even under controlled conditions shed chosen sodium cyanide even with this the casing was necessary to prevent the red from going livery the first gather of the new section was blown rotated then carefully trailed from the iron she used long tweezers to draw the molten taffylike glass into a subtly feathery shape sweat dripped down onto the cotton bandanna shed tied around her brow as she worked the second gather repeated the procedure again and again she went to the glory hole to reheat not only to keep the glass hot but to ensure against thermal strains that could break any vessel and the heart of the artist to prevent searing her hands she dripped water over the pipe only the tip needed to be kept hot she wanted the wall of the breastplate thin enough so that light could seep and be refracted through it this required additional trips for heating and careful patient work with tools for flattening and for adding the slight curve she envisioned hours after shed blown the first gather she placed the vessel in the annealing oven and struck the pontil it wasnt until shed set both temperature and time that she felt the cramps in her hands the knots in her shoulders and neck and the emptiness in her belly no scraping out of a can tonight she decided she would celebrate with a meal and a pint at the pub maggie didnt ask herself why after pining for solitude she now hurried toward company shed been home for three days and had spoken to no one but brianna and then only briefly and angrily maggie was sorry for it now sorry that she hadnt tried harder to understand briannas position her sister was always in the middle the unlucky second child of a flawed marriage instead of leaping for her sisters throat she should have taken her oversolicitousness toward their mother in stride and she should have told brianna what shed learned from christine sweeney it would be interesting to gauge briannas reaction to the news of their mothers past but that would have to wait she wanted an undemanding hour with people she knew over a hotmeal and a cold beer it would take her mind off the work that had been driving her for days and off the fact that shed yet to hear from rogan because the evening was fine and she wanted to work out the worst of her kinks she straddled her bicycle and began the threemile trek into the village the long days of summer had begun the sun was brilliant and pleasantly warm keeping many of the farmers out in their fields long after their supper was over the curving narrow road was flanked on both sides by high hedgerows that provided no shoulder and gave maggie the impression of riding down a long sweetsmelling tunnel she passed a car gave the driver a wave and felt the breeze of its passing flutter her jeans pedaling hard more for the fun than because she was in a hurry she burst out of the tunnel of hedges into the sheer breathless beauty of the valley the sun dashed off the tin roof of a hay barn and dazzled her eyes the road was smoother now if no wider but she slowed simply to enjoy the evening breeze and the lingering sunlight she caught the scent of honeysuckle of hay of sweet mown grass her mood which had been manic and restless since her return began to mellow she passed houses with clothes drying on the line and children playing in the yard and the ruins of castles majestic still with their gray stones and legends of ghostly inhabitants a testament to a way of life that still lingered she took a curve caught the bright flash that was hhe river flowing through high grass and turned away from it toward the village the houses were more plentiful now and stood closer together some of the newer ones made her sigh with disappointment they were blocky and plain to her artists eye and usually drab in color only the gardens lush and vivid saved them from ugliness the long last curve took her into the village proper she passed the butchers the chemists ryans little food store and the tiny neat hotel that had once belonged to her grandfather maggie paused to study the building a moment trying to imagine her mother living there as a girl a lovely girl according to christine sweeneys report with the voice of an angel if it were true why had there been so little music in the house and why maggie wondered had there never been a mention a hint of maeves talent she would ask maggie decided and there was likely no place better than omalleys as she pulled her bike to the curb maggie noticed a family of tourists wandering on foot shooting videos and looking enormously pleased with themselves to be committing a quaint irish village onto tape the woman held the small clever little camera and laughed as she focused on her husband and two children maggie must have stepped into the frame for the woman lifted her hand and waved good evening miss and to you to her credit maggie didnt even snicker when the woman whispered to her husband isnt her accent wonderful ask her about food john im dying to get more of her on tape ah excuse me tourism couldnt hurt the village maggie decided and turned back to play the game can i help you with something this evening if you wouldnt mind we were wondering about a place to eat in town if you could recommend something and sure i could do that because they looked so delighted with her she layered a bit more west county into her speech now if youre after wanting something fancy you couldnt do better but to drive along this road another oh fifteen minutes and you could have the very king of meals at dromoland castle itll be hard on your wallet but your taste buds will be in heaven were not dressed for a fancy meal the woman put in actually we were hoping for something simple right here in the village if youre in the mood for a bit of pub grub she winked at the two children who were eyeing her as if shed stepped off a lightflashing ufo youll find omalleys to your liking im sure his chips are as good as anyones thats means french fries the woman translated we just arrived this morning from america she told maggie im afraid we dont know much about the local customs are children permitted in the bars pubs this is ireland children are welcome anywhere anywhere atall thats omalleys there she gestured toward the low plastered block building with dark trim im going there meself theyd be pleased to have you and your family for a meal thank you the man beamed at her the children stared and the woman had yet to take the camera from in front of her face well give it a try enjoy your meal then and the rest of your stay maggie turned and sauntered down the sidewalk and into omalleys it was dim smoky and smelled of frying onions and beer and how are you tim maggie asked as she settled herself at the bar and look whos dragged herself in tim grinned at her as he built a pint of guinness and how are you maggie im fit and hungry as a bear she exchanged greetings with a couple at a postagestampsized table behind her and at the two men who nursed pints at the bar will you fix me one of your steak sandwiches tim with a pile of chips and ill have a pint of harp while im waiting the proprietor stuck his head around the back of the bar and shouted out maggies order well now how was dublin city he asked while he drew her a pint ill tell you she propped her elbows on the bar and began to describe her trip for the patrons of the bar while she talked the american family came in and settled at a table champagne and goose liver tim shook his head isnt that a wonder and all those people come to see your glass your fatherd be proud of you maggie girl proud as a peacock i hope so she sniffed deeply when tim slid her plate in front other but the truth is id rather have your steak sandwich than a pound of goose liver he laughed heartily thats our girl it turns out that the grandmother of the man whos managing things for me was a friend of my gran gran oreilly you dont mean it with a sigh tim rubbed his belly sure and its a small world it is maggie agreed making it casual shes from galway and knew gran when they were girls they wrote letters for years after gran moved here keeping up you know thats fine no friend like an old friend gran wrote her about the hotel and such the family mentioned how it was my mother used to sing oh that was a time ago remembering tim picked up a glass to polish before you were born to be sure fact is now that i think of it she sang here in this very pub one of the last times before she gave it up here you had her sing here i did yes she had a sweet voice did maeve traveled all over the country hardly saw a bit of her for oh more than ten years id say then she came back to stay a time it seems to me missus oreilly was ailing so i asked maeve if maybe shed like to sing an evening or two not that weve as grand a place as some in dublin and cork and donnegal where shed performed she performed for ten years oh well i dont know as she made much of it at first anxious to be off and away was maeve as long as i remember she wasnt happy making beds in a hotel in a village like ours and let us know it he winked to take the sting out of his words but she was doing well by the time she came back and sang here then she and tom well they only had eyes for each other the moment he walked in and heard her singing and after they married maggie said carefully she didnt sing any longer didnt care to wouldnt talk of it fact is its been so long till you brought it up id nearly forgotten maggie doubted her mother had forgotten or could forget how would she herself feel if some twist in her life demanded that she give up her art she wondered angry sad resentful she looked down at her hands thought of how it would be if she couldnt use them again what would she become if suddenly just as she was about to make her mark it was all taken away if relinquishing her career wasnt an excuse for the bitter years that had passed with her mother at least it was a reason maggie needed time to shift through it to talk to brianna she toyed with her beer and began to put the pieces of the woman her mother had been together with the personality of the woman shed become how much of both maggie wondered had maeve passed on to her daughter youre to eat that sandwich tim ordered as he slid another pint down the bar not study it i am to prove her point maggie took a healthy bite the pub was warm and comforting time enough tomorrow she decided to wipe the film off old dreams will you get me another pint tim that ill do he said then lifted a hand when the pub door opened again well its a night for strangers whereve you been murphy why missing you boyo spotting maggie murphy grinned and joined her at the bar im hoping i can sit by the celebrity i suppose i can allow it she returned this once at any rate so murphy when are you going to court my sister it was an old joke but still made the pub patrons chuckle murphy sipped from maggies glass and sighed now darling you know theres only room in my heart for you i know youre a scoundrel she took back her beer he was a wildly handsome man trim and strong and weathered like an oak from the sun and wind his dark hair curled around his collar over his ears and his eyes were as blue as the cobalt bottle in her shop not polished like rogan she thought rough as a gypsy was murphy but with a heart as wide and sweet as the valley he loved maggie had never had a brother but murphy was the nearest to it id marry you tomorrow he claimed sending the pub except for the americans who looked on avidly into whoops of laughter if youd have me you can rest easy then for i wont be having the likes of you but ill kiss you and make you sorry for it she made good on her word kissing him long and hard until they drew back and grinned at one another have you missed me then maggie asked not a whit ill have a pint of guinness tim and the same thing our celebritys having he stole one of her chips i heard you were back oh her voice cooled a little you saw brie no i heard you were back he repeated your furnace ah my sister sent me some clippings from cork mmm how is mary ellen oh shes fit drew and the children too murphy reached in his pocket frowned patted another ah here we go he took out two folded pieces of newspaper clarewoman triumphs in dublin he read margaret mary concannon impressed the art word at a showing at worldwide gallery dublin sunday night let me see that maggie snatched the clipping out of his hand miss concannon a freeblownglass artist drew praise and compliments from attendees of the show with her bold and complex gculptures and drawings the artist herself is a diminutive diminutive hah maggie editorialized give it back murphy tugged the clipping away and continued to read it aloud himself a diminutive young woman of exceptional talent and beauty hah yourself murphy added sneering at her the greeneyed redhead of ivory complexion and considerable charm was as fascinating as her work to this art lover worldwide one of the top galleries in the world considers itself fortunate to display miss concannons work i believe shes only begun to tap her creativity stated rogan sweeney president of worldwide bringing miss concannons work to the attention of the world is a privilege he said that she reached for the clipping again but murphy held it out of reach he did its here in black and white now let me finish people want to hear indeed the pub had gone quiet every eye was on murphy as he finished the review worldwide will be touring several of miss concannons pieces over the next year and will keep others personally selected by the artist and mr sweeney on permanent display in dublin satisfied murphy placed the clipping on the bar where tim craned over to see it and theres pictures he added unfolding the second clipping of maggie with the ivory complexion and some of her fancy glass nothing to say maggie she let out a long breath dragged at her hair i guess id better say drinks for all my friends youre quiet maggie mae maggie smiled over the nickname one her father had used for her she was more than comfortable in murphys lorry with her bike stowed in the bed and the engine purring as did all of murphys machinery like a satisfied cat im thinking im a wee bit drunk murphy she stretched and sighed and that i like the feeling quite a lot well you earned it she was more than a wee bit drunk which was why hed hauled her bike into his lorry before she could think to argue were all proud of you and i for one will look upon that bottle you made me with more respect from now on tis a weed pot ive told you not a bottle you put pretty twigs or wild flowers in it why anyone would bring twigs pretty or otherwise into the house was beyond him so are you going back to dublin then i dont know not for a time anyway i cant work there and works what i want to do right now she scowled at a tumble of furze silvered now by the rising moon he never acted like it was a privilege you know whats that oh no it was always that i should be privileged hed taken a second look at me work the great and powerful sweeney giving the poor struggling artist a chance for fame and fortune well did i ask for fame and fortune murphy thats what i want to know did i ask for it he knew the tone the belligerent defensive slap of it and answered cautiously i cant say maggie but dont you want it of course i do do i look like a fleabrain but ask for it i did not i never once asked him for a blessed thing except at the start to leave me alone and did he hah she folded her arms across her chest not much he did he tempted me murphy and the devil himself couldnt have been more sly and persuasive now im stuck you see and cant go back murphy pursed his lips and pulled smoothly to a stop by her gate well are you wanting to go back no and thats the worst of it i want exactly what he says i can have and want it so it hurts my heart but i dont want things to change either thats the hell of it i want to be left alone to work and to think and just to be i dont know as i can have both you can have what you want maggie youre too stubborn to take less she laughed at that and turned to kiss him sloppily oh i love you murphy why dont you come out into the field and dance with me in the moonlight he grinned ruffled her hair why dont i put your bike away and tuck you into bed ill do it meself she climbed out of the lorry but he was quicker he lifted out her bike and set it on the road thank you for escorting me home mr muldoon the pleasure was mine miss concannon now get yourself to bed she wheeled her bike through the gate as he began to sing stopping just inside the garden she listened as his voice a strong sweet tenor drifted through the night quiet and disappeared alone all alone by the wave wash strand all alone in a crowded hall the hall it is gay and the waves they are grand but my heart is not here at all she smiled a little and finished the rest in her mind it flies far away by night and by day to the times and the joys that are gone slievenamon was the ballad she knew woman the mountain well she wasnt standing on a mountain but she thought she understood the soul of the tune the hall in dublin had been gay yet her heart hadnt been there shed been alone all alone she wheeled her bike around the back but instead of going inside maggie headed away from the liouse it was true she was a little lightheaded and none too steady on her feet but she didnt want to waste such a night in bed alone in bed and drunk or sober day or night she could find her way over the land that had once been hers she heard the hoot of an owl and the rustle of something that hunted or hid by night in the higher pass to the east overhead the moon just past full eraone like a bright beacon in a swimming sea of stars the night whispered around her secretly a brook to the west babbled in answer this this was part of what she wanted what she needed as much as breath was the glory of solitude having the green fields flowing around her silvered now in moon and starlight with only the faint glow in the distance that was the lamp in murphys kitchen she remembered walking here with her father her childs hand clutched warmly in his he hadnt talked of planting or plowing but of dreams always he had spoken of dreams hed never really found his sadder somehow she thought was that she was beginning to see that her mother had found hers only to lose it again how would it be she wondered to have what you wanted as close as your fingertips then have it slip away forever and wasnt that exactly what she herself was so afraid of she lay on her back on the grass her head spinning with too much drink and too many dreams other own the stars wheeled in their angels dance and the moon shiny as a silver coin looked down on her the air was sweetened by the lilt of a nightingale and the night was hers alone she smiled shut her eyes and slept chapter eleven it was the cow that woke her the big liquid eyes studied the sleeping form curled in the pasture there was little thought in a cows head other than food and the need to be milked so she sniffed once twice at maggies cheek snorted then began to crop grass oh god have mercy whats the noise her head throbbing like a large drum being beaten maggie rolled over bumped solidly into the cows foreleg and opened bleary bloodshot eyes sweet jesus christ maggies squeal reverberated in her head like a gong causing her to catch hold of her ears as if they were about to explode as she scrambled away the cow as startled as she mooed and rolled her eyes what are you doing here keeping a firm hold on her head maggie made it to her knees what am i doing here when she dropped back on her haunches she and the cow each other doubtfully i mustve fallen asleep oh in pitiful defense against a raging hangover she shifted her hands from her ears to her eyes oh the penance paid for one drink over the limit just sit right here for a minute if you dont mind until i have the strength to stand the cow after one last roll of her eyes began to graze again the morning was bright and warm and full of sound the drone of a tractor the bark of a dog the cheerful birdsong rolled in maggies sick head her mouth tasted as if shed spent the night dining on a peat bog and her clothes were coated with morning dew well its a fine thing to pass out in a field like a drunken hobo she made it to her feet swayed once and moaned the cow swished its tail in what might have been sympathy cautious maggie stretched when her bones didnt shatter she worked out the rest of the kinks and let her gritty eyes scan the field more cows uninterested in their human visitor grazed in the next field she could see the circle of standing stones ancient as the air that the locals called druids mark she remembered now kissing murphy good night and with his fading song playing in her head wandering under the moon and the dream shed had sleeping under its silver light came back to her so vividly so breathlessly that she forgot the throbbing in her head and the stiffness in her joints the moon glowing with light pulsing like a heartbeat flooding the sky and the earth beneath it with cold white light then it had burned hot as a torch until it ran with color bled blues and reds and golds so lovely that even in sleep she had wept she had reached up and up and up until she had touched it smooth it had been and solid and cool as she cupped it in her hands in that sphere she had seen herself and deep somewhere deep within those swimming colors had been her heart the vision whirling in her head was more than a match for a hangover driven by it she ran from the field leaving the placid cows to their grazing and the morning to its birdsong within the hour she was in her studio desperate to turn vision into reality she needed no sketch not with the image so boldly imprinted in her mind shed eaten nothing didnt need to with the thrill of discovery glittering over her like a cloak she made the first gather she smoothed it on the marble to chill and center it then she gave it her breath when it was heated and fluid again she marvered the bubble over powdered colorants into the flames it went again until the color melted into the vessel wall she repeated the process over and over adding glass fire breath color turning and turning the rod both against and with gravity she smoothed the glowing sphere with paddles to maintain its shape once shed transferred the vessel from pipe to pontil she heated it strongly in the glory hole she would employ a wet stick now holding it tightly to the mouth of her work so that the steam pressure enlarged the form all of her energies were focused she knew that the water on the stick would vaporize the pressure could blow out the vessel walls she would have done with a pontil boy now someone to be another pair of hands to fetch tools to gather more glass but she had never hired anyone for the job she began to mutter to herself as she was forced to make the trips herself back to the furnace back to the marver back to the chair the sun rose higher streaming through the windows and crowning her in a nimbus of light that was how rogan saw her when he opened the door sitting in the chair with a ball of molten color under her hands and sunlight circling her she spared him one sharp glance take off that damn suit coat and tie i need your hands what i need your hands damn it do exactly what i tell you and dont talk to me he wasnt sure he could he wasnt often struck dumb but at that moment with the blast of fire the flash of sun she looked like some sort of fierce fiery goddess creating new worlds he set his briefcase aside and stripped off his coat youll hold this steady she told him as she slipped out of the chair and youll turn the pontil just as i am you see slowly constantly no jerks or pauses or ill have to kill you i need a prunt he was so stunned that she would trust him with her work that he sat in her chair without a word the pipe was warm in his hands heavier than hed expected she kept hers over his until she felt he had the rhythm dont stop she warned him believe me your very life depends on it he didnt doubt her she went to the furnace gathered a prunt and came back do you see how i did that nothing to that part i want you to do it for me next time once the wall was softened she took jacks and pushed into the glass do it now she took the pipe from him and continued to work it i can shear it off if you gather too much the heat from the furnace stole his breath he dipped the pipe in following her terse directions rolled it under the melt he watched the glass gather and cling like hot tears youll bring it to me from the back of the bench and to the right anticipating him she snatched up a pair of tongs and took control of the pontil even as he angled it toward her she repeated the process sending off sparks from the wax merging glass into glass color into color when she was satisfied with the interior design she reblew the vessel urging it into a sphere again shaping it with air what rogan saw was a perfect circle the size perhaps of a soccer ball the interior of the clear glass orb exploded with colors and shapes bled and throbbed with them if he had been a fanciful man he would have said the glass lived and breathed just as he did the colors swirled impossibly vivid at the center then flowed to the most delicate hues as they trailed to the wall dreams he thought its a circle of dreams bring me that file she snapped out the what the file blast it she was already moving to a bench covered with fireproof pads as she braced the pontil on a wooded vise she held out her hand like a surgeon demanding a scalpel rogan slapped a file into it he heard her slow steady breathing pause hold just as she struck the glass bond with the file she struck the pontil the ball rolled comfortably onto the pad gloves she ordered the heavy ones by my chair hurry up with her eyes still on the ball she jerked the gloves on oh she wanted to hold it to cup it in her naked palms as she had in her dream instead she chose a metal fork covered with asbestos and carried the sphere to the annealing oven she set the timer then stood for a minute staring blankly into space its the moon you see she said softly it pulls the tides in the sea in us we hunt by it and harvest by it and sleep by it and if were lucky enough we can hold it in our hands and dream by it what will you call it it wont have a name everyone should see what they want most in it as if coming out of a dream herself she lifted a hand to her head im tired she trudged wearily back to her chair sat and let her head fall back she was milk pale rogan noticed drained of the energized glow that had covered her while shed worked have you worked through the night again no i slept last night she smiled to herself in murphys field under the bright full moon you slept in a field i was drunk she yawned then laughed and opened her eyes a little and it was such a grand night and who rogan asked as he crossed to her is murphy a man i know who would have been a bit surprised to find me sleeping in his pasture would you get me a drink at his lifted brow she laughed a soft one if you will from the refrigerator there and help yourself she added when he obliged her you make a passable pontil boy sweeney youre welcome he said taking that for a thanks as she tipped the can he gave her back he scanned the room she hadnt been idle he noted there were several new pieces tucked away her interpretations of the native american display he studied a shallow widelipped dish decorated with deep dull colors lovely work mmm an experiment that turned out well i combined opaque and transparent glass she yawned again broadly then tinfumed it tinfumed never mind he said when he saw that she was about to launch into a complicated explanation i wouldnt understand what you were talking about anyway chemistry was never my forte ill just be pleased with the finished product youre supposed to say its fascinating just as i am he glanced back at her and his lips twitched been reading your reviews have you god help us now why dont you go get some rest well talk later ill take you to dinner you didnt come all this way to take me to dinner id enjoy it just the same there was something different about him she decided some subtle change somewhere deep in those gorgeous eyes of his whatever it was he had it under control a couple of hours with her ought to fix that maggie concluded and smiled at him well go in the house have some tea and a bite to eat you can tell me why youve come to see you for one thing something in his tone told her to sharpen her workdulled wits well youve seen me so i have he picked up his briefcase and opened the door i could use that tea good you can brew it she shot a look over her shoulder as she stepped outside if you know how i believe i do your garden looks lovely bries tended it while i was gone whats this she tapped a foot against a cardboard box at her back door a few things i brought with me your shoes for one you left them in the parlor he handed her the briefcase and hauled the box into the kitchen after dumping it on the table he looked around the kitchen wheres the tea in the cupboard above the stove while he went to work she slit the box open moments later she was sitting down holding her belly as she laughed trust you never to forget a thing rogan if i wont answer the phone why should i listen to a silly answering machine because ill murder you if you dont theres that she rose again and pulled out a wall calendar french impressionists she murmured studying the pictures above each month well at least its pretty use it he said simply and set the kettle to boil and the machine and this he reached into the box himself and pulled out a long velvet case without ceremony he flipped it open and took out a slim gold watch its amber face circled by diamonds god i cant wear that its a ladys watch ill forget i have it on and shower with it its waterproof ill break it then ill get you another he took her arm began to unbutton the cuff of her shirt what the hell is this he demanded when he hit the bandage what have you done its a burn she was still staring at the watch and didnt see the fury light in his eyes i got a bit careless damn it maggie youve no right to be careless none at all am i to be worried about you setting yourself afire now dont be ridiculous youd think i severed my hand she would have pulled her hand away but his grip tightened rogan for pity sake a glass artist gets a burn now and again its not fatal of course not he said stiffly he forced back the anger he was feeling at her carelessness and clasped the watch on her wrist i dont like to hear youve been careless he let her hand go slipped his own in his pockets its not serious then no she watched him warily when he went to answer the kettles shrill shall i make us a sandwich as you like you didnt say how long youd be staying ill go back tonight i wanted to speak with you in person rather than try to reach you by phone in control again he finished making the tea and brought the pot to the table ive brought the clippings you asked my grandmother about oh the clippings maggie stared at his briefcase yes that was good other ill read them later when she was alone all right and there was something else i wanted to give you in person something else she sliced through a loaf of briannas bread its a day for presents this wouldnt qualify as a present rogan opened his briefcase and took out an envelope you may want to open this now all right then she dusted off her hands tore open the envelope she had to grab the back of a chair to keep her balance as she read the amount on the check mary mother of god we sold every piece wed priced more than satisfied by her reaction he watched her sink into the chair i would say the showing was quite successful every piece she echoed for so much she thought of the moon of dreams of changes weak she laid her head on the table i cant breathe my lungs have collapsed indeed she could hardly talk i cant get my breath sure you can he went behind her massaged her shoulders just in and out give yourself a minute to let it take hold its almost two hundred thousand pounds very nearly with the interest well generate from touring your work and offering only a portion of it to the market well increase the price the strangled sound she made caused him to laugh in and out maggie love just push the air out and bring it in again ill arrange for shipping for those pieces youve finished well set the tour for the fall because youve so much completed already you may want to take some time off to enjoy yourself have a holiday a holiday she sat up again i cant think about that yet i cant think at all youve time he patted her head then moved around her to pour the tea youll have dinner with me tonight to celebrate aye she murmured i dont know what to say rogan i never really believed it would i just didnt believe it she pressed her hands to her mouth for a moment he was afraid she would begin to sob but it was laughter wild and jubilant that burst out other mouth im rich im a rich woman rogan sweeney she popped out of the chair to kiss him then whirled away oh i know its a drop in the bucket to you but to me to me its freedom the chains are broken whether she wants them to be or not what are you talking about she shook her head thinking of brianna dreams rogan wonderful dreams oh i have to tell her right away she snatched up the check and impulsively stuffed it in her back pocket youll stay please have your tea make some food make use of the phone youre so fond of whatever you like where are you going i wont be long there were wings on her feet as she whirled back and kissed him again her lips missed his in her hurry and caught his chin dont go with that she was racing out of the door and across the fields she was puffing like a steam engine by the time she scrambled over the stone fence that bordered briannas land but then shed been out of breath before shed begun the race she barely missed trampling her sisters pansies a sin she would have paid for dearly and skidded on the narrow stone path that wound through the velvety flowers she drew in air to shout but didnt waste it as she spotted brianna in the little path of green beyond the garden hanging linen on the line clothespins in her mouth wet sheets in her hands brianna stared across the nodding columbines and daisies while maggie pressed her hands to her thudding heart saying nothing brianna snapped the sheet expertly and began to clip it to the line there was hurt in her sisters face still maggie observed and anger all chilled lightly with briannas special blend of pride and control the wolfhound gave a happy bark and started forward only to stop short at briannas quiet order he settled with what could only be a look of regret at maggie back at his mistresss feet she took another sheet from the basket beside her flicked it and clipped it neatly to dry hello maggie so the wind blew cold from this quarter maggie mused and tucked her hands into her back pockets hello brianna youve guests aye were full at the moment an american couple an english family and a young man from belgium a virtual united nations she sniffed elaborately youve pies baking theyre baked and cooling on the windowsill because she hated confrontations of any kind brianna kept her eyes on her work as she spoke i thought about what you said maggie and i want to say im sorry i should have been there for you i should have found a way why didnt you brianna let out a quick breath her only sign of agitation you never make it easy do you no i have obligations not only to her she said before maggie could speak but to this place youre not the only one with ambitions or with dreams the heated words that burned on maggies tongue cooled then slid away she turned to study the back of the house the paint was fresh and white the windows open to the summer afternoon were glistening lace curtains billowed romantic as a bridal veil flowers crowded the ground and poured out of pots and tin buckets youve done fine work here brianna gran would have approved but you dont youre wrong in an apology of her own she laid a hand on her sisters arm i dont claim i understand how you do it or why you want to but thats not for me to say if this place is your dream brie youve made it shine im sorry i shouted at you oh im used to that despite her resigned tone it was clear that she had thawed if youll wait till ive finished here ill put on some tea ive a bit of trifle to go with it maggies empty stomach responded eagerly but she shook her head i havent time for it i left rogan back at the cottage left him you should have brought him along with you you cant leave a guest kicking his heels that way hes not a guest hes well i dont know what wed call him but that doesnt matter i want to show you something though her sense of propriety was offended brianna took out the last pillowslip all right show me then get back to rogan if youve no food in the house bring him here the mans come all the way from dublin after all and will you stop worrying about sweeney maggie cut in impatiently and pulled the check out of her pocket and look at this one hand on the line brianna glanced at the paper her mouth dropped open and the clothespin fell out to plop on the ground the pillowslip floated after it what is it its a check are you blind a big fat beautiful check he sold all of it brie all hed set out to sell for so much brianna could only gape at all the zeros for so much how can that be im a genius maggie grabbed briannas shoulders and whirled her around dont you read my reviews i have untapped depths of creativity laughing she dragged brianna into a lively hornpipe oh and theres something more about my soul and my sexuality i havent memorized it all yet maggie wait my heads spinning let it spin were rich dont you see they tumbled to the ground together maggie shrieking with laughter and con jumping in frantic circles around them i can buy that glass lathe ive been wanting and you can have that new stove youve been pretending you dont need and well have a holiday anywhere in the world anywhere atall ill have a new bed she plopped back on the grass to wrestle with con and you can add a whole wing onto blackthorn if youve a mind to i cant take it in i just cant take it in well find a house pushing herself up again maggie hooked an arm around cons neck whatever kind she wants and hire someone to fetch and carry for her brianna shut her eyes and fought back the first guilty flare of elation she might not want it will be what she wants listen to me maggie grabbed briannas hands and squeezed shell go brie and shell be well taken care of shell have whatever pleases her tomorrow well go into ennis and talk to pat oshea he sells houses well set her up as grandly as we can and as quickly i promised da id do my best by both of you and thats what im going to do have you no consideration maeve stood on the garden path a shawl around her shoulders despite the warmth of the sun the dress beneath it was starched and pressed by briannas hand maggie had no doubt out here shouting and shrieking while a bodys trying to rest she pulled the shawl closer and jabbed a finger at her younger daughter get up off the ground whats wrong with you behaving like a hoyden and you with guests in the house brianna rose stiffly brushed at her slacks its a fine day perhaps youd like to sit in the sun i might as well call off that vicious dog sit con protectively brianna laid a hand on the dogs head can i bring you some tea yes and brew it properly this rime maeve shuffled to the chair and table brianna had set up beside the garden that boy that belgian hes clattered up the stairs twice today youll have to tell him to mind the racket its what comes when parents let their children traipse all over the country ill have the tea in a moment maggie will you stay not for tea but ill have a word with mother she sent her sister a steely look to prevent any argument can you be ready to drive into ennis by ten tomorrow brie i yes ill be ready whats this maeve demanded as brie walked toward the kitchen door what are the two of you planning your future maggie took the chair beside her mothers kicked out her legs shed wanted to go about it differently after what shed begun to learn shed hoped she and her mother could find a meeting ground somewhere beyond the old hurts but already the old angers and guilts were working in her remembering last nights moon and her thoughts about lost dreams she spoke quietly were after buying you a house maeve made a sound of disgust and plucked at the fringe of her shawl nonsense im content here with brianna to look after me im sure you are but its about to end oh ill hire you a companion you neednt worry that youll have to learn to do for yourself but you wont be using brie any longer brianna understands the responsibilities of a child to her mother more than maggie agreed shes done everything in her power to make you content mother it hasnt been enough and maybe ive begun to understand that you understand nothing perhaps but id like to understand she took a deep breath though she couldnt reach out to her mother physically or emotionally her voice softened i truly would im sorry for what you gave up i learned of the singing only you wont speak of it maeves voice was frigid her already pale skin whitened further with the shock of a pain shed never forgotten never forgiven you will never speak of that time i wanted only to say im sorry i dont want your sorrow with her mouth tight maeve looked aside she couldnt bear to have the past tossed in her face to be pitied because she had sinned and lost what had mattered most to her you will not speak of it to me again all right maggie leaned forward until maeves gaze settled on her ill say this you blame me for what you lost and maybe that comforts you somehow i cant wish myself unborn but ill do what i can youll have a house a good one and a respectable competent woman to see to your needs someone i hope can be a friend to you as well as a companion this ill do for da and for brie and for you youve done nothing for me in your life but cause me misery so there would be no softening maggie realized no meeting on new ground so youve told me time and again well find a place close enough so that brie can visit you for shell feel she should and ill furnish the place as well however you like youll have a monthly allowance for food for clothes for whatever it is you need but i swear before god youll be out of his house and into your own before a month is up pipe dreams her tone was blunt and dismissive but maggie sensed a little frisson of fear beneath like your father you are full of empty dreams and foolish schemes not empty and not foolish again maggie drew the check out of her pocket this time she had the satisfaction of seeing her mothers eyes go wide and blank aye its real and its mine i earned it i earned it because da had the faith in me to let me learn to let me try maeves eyes flicked to maggies calculating what he gave you belonged to me as well the money for venice for schooling and for the roof over my head thats true what else he gave me had nothing to do with you and youll get your share of this maggie tucked the check away again then ill owe you nothing you owe me your life maeve spat mine meant little enough to you i may know why that is but it doesnt change how it makes me feel inside understand me youll go without complaint without making your last days with brianna a misery for her ill not go at all maeve dug in her pocket for a laceedged hanky a mother needs the comfort of her child youve no more love for brianna than you do for me we both know it mother she might believe differently but here now lets at least be honest youve played on her heart its true and god knows shes deserving of any love you have in that cold heart of yours after a long breath she pulled out the trump card shed been holding for five years would you have me tell her why rory mcavery went off to america and broke her heart maeves hands gave a quick little jerk i dont know what youre talking about oh but you do you took him aside when you saw he was getting serious in his courting and you told him that you couldnt in good conscience let him give his heart to your daughter not when shed given her body to another you convinced him and he was only a boy after all that shed been sleeping with murphy its a lie maeves chin thrust out but there was fear in her eyes youre an evil lying child margaret mary youre the liar and worse much worse than that what kind of a woman is it that steals happiness from her own blood because she has none herself i heard from murphy maggie said tersely after he and rory beat each other to bloody pulps rory didnt believe his denial why should he when briannas own mother had tearfully told him the tale she was too young to marry maeve said quickly i wouldnt have her making the same mistake as i did ruining her life that way the boy wasnt right for her i tell you hed never have amounted to anything she loved him love doesnt put bread on the table maeve fisted her hands twisting the handkerchief in them why havent you told her because i thought it would only hurt her more i asked murphy to say nothing knowing briannas pride and how it would be shattered and maybe because i was angry that he would have believed you that he didnt love her enough to see the lie but i will tell her now ill walk right into that kitchen and tell her now and if i have to ill drag poor murphy over to stand with me youll have no one then she hadnt known the flavor of revenge would be so bitter it lay cold and distasteful on maggies tongue as she continued ill say nothing if you do as i say and ill promise you that i will provide for you as long as you live and do whatever i can to see that youre content i cant give you back what you had or wanted to have before you conceived me but i can give you something that might make you happier than youve been since your own home youve only to agree to my offer in order to have everything youve always wanted money a fine house and a servant to tend you maeve pressed her lips together oh it crushed the pride to bargain with the girl how do i know youll keep your word because i give it to you because i swear these things to you on my fathers soul maggie rose that will have to content you tell brianna ill be by to pick her up at ten tomorrow and with these words maggie turned on her heel and walked away chapter twelve he took her time walking back again choosing the fields rather than the road as she went she gathered wildflowers the meadowsweet and valerian that sunned themselves among the grass murphys wellfed cows their udders plump and nearly ready for milking grazed unconcernedly as she climbed over the stone walls that separated pasture from plowed field and field from summer hay then she saw murphy himself atop his tractor with young brian oshay and dougal finnian with him all to harvest the waving hay they called it comhair in irish but maggie knew that here in the west the word meant much more than its literal translation of help it meant community no man was alone here not when it came to haying or opening a bank of peat or sowing in the spring if today oshay and finnian were working murphys land then tomorrow or the day after he would be working theirs no one would have to ask the tractor or plow or two good hands and a strong back would simply come and the work would be done stone fences might separate one mans fields from another but the love of the land joined them she lifted a hand to answer the salute of the three farmers and gathering her flowers continued on to her home a jackdaw swooped overhead complaining fiercely a moment later maggie saw why as con barreled through the verge of the hay his tongue lolling happily helping murphy again are you she reached down to ruffle his fur and a fine farmer you are too go on back then with a flurry of selfimportant barks con raced back toward the tractor maggie stood looking around her the gold of the hay the green of the pasture with its lazy cows and the shadows cast by the sun on the circle of stones that generations of concannons and now murphy had left undisturbed for time out of mind she saw the rich brown of the land where potatoes had been dug and over it all a sky as blue as a cornflower in full blossom a quick laugh bubbled up in her throat and she found herself racing the rest of the way perhaps it was the pure pleasure of the day coupled with the giddy excitement of her first major success that made her blood pump fast it might have been the sound of birds singing as if their hearts would break or the scent of wildflowers gathered by her own hands but when she stopped just outside her own door and looked into her own kitchen she was breathless with more than a quick scramble over the fields he was at the table elegant in his english suit and handmade shoes his briefcase was open his pen out it made her smile to see him work there amid the clutter on a crude wooden table he might have used for firewood at home the sun streamed through the windows and open door flashing gold off his pen as he wrote in his neat hand then his fingers tapped over the keys of a calculator hesitated tapped again she could see his profile the faint line of concentration between the strong black brows the firm set of his mouth he reached for his tea sipped as he studied his figures set it down again wrote read elegant he was and beautiful she thought in a way so uniquely male and as wonderfully competent and precise as the handy little machine he used to run his figures not a man to run across sunny fields or lie dreaming under the moon but he was more than shed first imagined him to be much more she now understood the overpowering urge came over her to loosen that careful knot in his tie unbutton that snug collar and find the man beneath rarely did maggie refuse her own urges she slipped inside even as her shadow fell over his papers she was straddling his lap and fastening her mouth to his shock pleasure and lust speared into him like a threetipped arrow all sharp all true to aim the pen had clattered from his fingers and his hands had dived into her hair before he took the next breath through a haze he felt the tug on his tie what he managed in something like a croak the need for dignity had him clearing his throat and pressing her back whats all this you know she punctuated her words by feathering light kisses over his face he smelled expensive she realized all fine soap and starched linen ive always thought a tie a foolish thing a sort of punishment for a man for simply being a man doesnt it choke you it didnt unless his heart was in his throat no he shoved her hands away but the damage was already done under her quick fingers his tie was loose and his collar undone what are you about maggie that should be obvious enough even to a dubliner she laughed at him her eyes wickedly green i brought you flowers the latter were at that moment crushed between them rogan glanced down at the bruised petals very nice they could use some water i imagine she tossed back her head and laughed its always first things first with you isnt it but rogan from where im sitting im aware theres something on your mind other than fetching a vase he couldnt deny his obvious and very human reaction youd harden a dead man he muttered and put his hands firmly on her hips to lift her away she only wriggled closer torturing him now thats a pretty compliment to be sure but youre not dead are you she kissed him again using her teeth to prove her point are you thinking youve work to finish up and no time to waste no his hands were still on her hips but the fingers had dug in and had begun to knead she smelled of wildflowers and smoke all he could see was her face the white skin with its blush of rose dusting of gold freckles the depthless green of her eyes he made an heroic effort to level his voice but im thinking this is a mistake a groan sounded in his throat when she moved her lips to his ear that theres a time and a place and that you should choose it she murmured as her nimble fingers flipped open the rest of the buttons on his shirt yes no good god how was a man supposed to think that we should both choose it after weve set some priorities ive only one priority at the moment her hands cruised up his chest crushing wildflowers petals against his skin im going to have you now rogan her laugh came again low and challenging before her lips sank into his go ahead fight me off he hadnt meant to touch her that was his last coherent thought before his hands streaked up and filled themselves with her breasts her throaty moan spilled into his mouth like wine rich and drugging then he was tugging away her shirt and shoving back from the table all at once to hell with it he muttered against her greedy mouth and was lifting her her arms and legs wrapped around him like silken rope her shirt dangling from one wrist where the buttons held beneath she wore a plain cotton camisole as erotic to him as ivory lace she was small and light but with the blood trumpeting inhis brain he thought he could have carried a mountain her busy mouth never paused racing from cheek to jaw to ear and back while sexy little whimpers purred in her throat he started out of the kitchen stumbled over a loose throw rug and knocked her back against the doorjamb she only laughed breathlessly now and tightened the vise of her legs around his waist their lips fused again in a rough desperate kiss with the doorway and her own limbs bracing her he tore his mouth free to fasten it on her breast suckling greedily through cottonthe pleasure of it dark and damning lanced like a spear through her system this was more she realized as the blood sizzling through her veins began to hum like an engine more than shed expected more than she might have been ready for but there was no turning back he whirled away from the wall hurry was all she could say as he strode toward the stairs hurry her words pumped like a pulse of his blood hurry hurry against his thundering heart hers beat in furious response with maggie clinging like a bur he all but leaped up the stairs leaving a trail of broken flowers in their wake he turned unerringly to the left into the bedroom where the sun poured gold and the fragrant breeze lifted the open curtains he fell with her onto already tumbled sheets if it was madness that overcame him it ruled her as well there was no thought or need in either of them for gentle caresses for soft words or slow hands they tore at each other mindless as beasts dragging at clothes pulling tugging kicking off shoes all the while feeding greedily with violent kisses her body was like an engine fueled to race she bucked and rolled and reared while her breath seared out in burning gasps seams ripped needs exploded his hands were smooth another time they might have glided over her body like water but now they grasped and bruised and plundered bringing her unspeakable pleasure that tore through her overcharged system like lightning tears a darkened sky he filled his palms with her breast again and now without barriers drew the rigid tips into his mouth she cried out not in pain at the rough scrape of his teeth and tongue but in glory as the first harsh vicious orgasm struck like a blow she hadnt expected it to slap her so quick and hard nor had she ever experienced the utter helplessness that followed so fast on the heels of die storm before she could do more than wonder fresh needs coiled whiplike inside her she spoke in gaelic halfremembered words she hadnt known shed held in her heart shed never believed never that hunger could swallow her up and leave her trembling but she shook under his hands under the wild demand of his mouth for another dazed interlude she was totally vulnerable her bones molten and her mind reeling stunned into surrender by the punch of her own climax he never felt the change he knew only that she vibrated beneath him like a plucked bow she was wet and hot and unbearably arousing her body was smooth soft supple all the lovely dips and curves his to explore he knew only the desperate desire to conquer to possess and so gorged himself on the flavor of her flesh until it seemed the essence of her raced through his veins like his own blood he clasped her limp hand in his and ravaged until she cried out once again and his name was like a sob in the air with the room spinning like a carousel around her she dragged her hands from his tangled her fingers in his hair need spurted through her again voraciously she thrust her hips up now the demand broke from her throat rogan for gods sake but he had already plunged inside her deep and hard she arched back arched up in glorious welcome as fresh pleasure geysered through her in one lancing molten flash her body mated with his matching rhythms stroke for desperate stroke the bite of her nails on his back was unfelt with vision blurred and dimmed he watched her saw each stunning sensation flicker over her face it wont be enough he thought dizzily even as the sorrow nicked through the burnished shield of passion she opened her eyes and said his name again so he drowned in that sea of green and burying his face in the fire of her hair surrendered with one last flash of glorious greed he emptied himself into her in a war of any kind there are casualties no one maggie thought knew the glory the sorrow or the price of battle better than the irish and if as she was very much afraid at the moment her body was paralyzed for life as the result of this wonderful little war she wouldnt count the cost the sun was still shining now that her heart had ceased to crash like thunder in her head she heard the twitter of birds the roar of her furnace and the hum of a bee buzzing by the window she lay across the bed her head clear off the mattress and dragged down by gravity her arms were aching perhaps because they were still wrapped like vises around rogan who was splayed over her still as death she felt when she held her own breath the quicksilver race of his heart it was she decided a wonder they hadnt killed each other content with his weight and the drouzy feel of cobwebs in her brain she watched the sun dance on the ceiling his own mind cleared slowly the red haze mellowing then fading completely until he became aware again of the quiet light and the small warm body beneath his he shut his eyes again and lay still what were the words he should say he wondered if he told her that hed discovered to his own shock and confusion that he loved her why should she believe it to say those words now when they were both still sated and dazed from sex would hardly please a woman like maggie or make her see the bare truth of them what words were there after a man had tossed a woman down and plundered like an animal oh hed no doubt shed enjoyed it but that hardly changed the fact that hed completely lost control of his mind of his body of whatever it was that separated the civilized from the wild for the first time in his life hed taken a woman without finesse without care and he thought with a sudden start without a thought about the consequences he started to shift but she murmured in protest and tightened her already fierce grip dont go away im not he realized her head was unsupported and cupping a hand beneath it rolled to reverse their positions and nearly sent them over the other edge how do you sleep on a bed this size hardly big enough for a cat oh its done well enough for me but im thinking of buying another now that ive money to spare a fine big one like the one in your house he thought of a chippendale fourposter in the tiny loft and smiled then his thoughts veered back and wiped the smile away maggie her face was glowing her eyes halfshut there was a smug little smile on her face rogan she said in the same serious tone then laughed oh youre not going to start telling me youre sorry to have trampled my honor or some such thing if anyones honor was trampled after all it was yours and im not a bit sorry for it maggie he said again and brushed the tousled hair from her cheek what a woman you are its hard to be sorry for trampling or for being trampled when i he broke off hed lifted her hand as he spoke started to kiss her fingers when his gaze landed on the dark smudges on her arm appalled he started ive hurt you mmm now that you mention it im beginning to feel it she rolled her shoulder i must have hit the doorway pretty hard now you were about to say he shifted off of her im terribly sorry he said in an odd voice its inexcusable an apologys hardly adequate for my behavior her head tilted and she took a good long look at him breeding she thought again how else could a bucknaked man sitting on a rumpled bed appear so dignified your behavior she repeated id say it was more our behavior rogan and that it was well done on both parts laughing at him she pushed herself up and locked her arms around his neck do you think a few bruises will wilt me like a rose rogan they wont i promise you especially when i earned them the point is the point is we tumbled each other now stop acting as though im a fragile blossom that cant admit to having enjoyed a good hot bout of sex because i enjoyed it very much and so my fine fellow did you he trailed a fingertip over the faint bruise above her wrist id rather i hadnt marked you well its not a brand thats permanent no it wasnt but there was something else in his carelessness that could be maggie i wasnt thinking before and i certainly didnt leave dublin today planning on ending up like this its a little late to be thinking of being responsible now in frustration he dragged a hand through his hair could i have gotten you pregnant she blinked sat back on her haunches let out a long breath born in fire she remembered her father had told her shed been born in fire and this was what hed meant no she said it flatly her emotions too mixed and unsteady for her to explore the timings wrong and im responsible for myself rogan i should have seen to it he reached over to rub his knuckles down her cheek you dazzled me maggie sitting on my lap with your wildflowers you dazzle me now her smile came back lighting her eyes first then curving her lips i was coming across the fields away from my sisters and toward home the sun was bright murphy was haying in his field and there were flowers at my feet i havent felt so happy since my father died five years ago then i saw you in the kitchen working and it may be i was dazzled as well she knelt again rested her head on his shoulder must you go back to dublin tonight rogan all the minute and tedious details of his schedule ran like a river through his brain her scent mixed with his own settled over them like a mist i can rearrange some things leave in the morning she leaned back smiled and id rather not go out to dinner ill cancel the reservations he glanced around the room dont you have a phone up here tor what so it can ring in my ear and wake me up i cant think why i asked he eased away to tug on the wrinkled slacks of his suit ill go down make some calls he looked back to where she knelt in the center of the narrow rumpled bed very quick calls they could wait she shouted after him i dont intend to be interrupted by anything until morning he hurried down sentimentally scooping up a tattered meadowsweet as he went upstairs maggie waited five minutes then six before climbing out of bed she stretched wincing a bit at the aches she considered the robe that was tossed carelessly over a chair then humming to herself strolled downstairs without it he was still on the phone the receiver cocked on his shoulder as he made notes in his book the light softer now pooled at his feet reschedule that for eleven no eleven he repeated ill be back in the office by ten yes and contact joseph will you eileen tell him ive having another shipment sent from clare concannons work yes i he heard the sound behind him glanced back maggie stood like some flamecrowned goddess all alabaster skin sleek curves and knowing eyes his secretarys voice buzzed in his ear like an annoying fly what the what his eyes their expression dazed at first then heated skimmed up then down then up again to lock on maggies face ill deal with it when i get back his stomach muscles quivered when maggie stepped forward and jerked down the zipper of his slacks no he said in a strangled voice you cant reach me anymore today im the breath hissed between his teeth when maggie took him in her long artists fingers sweet jesus tomorrow he said with the last of his control ill see you tomorrow he slapped the receiver into the cradle where it jiggled then slipped off to crash against the counter i interrupted your call she began then laughed when he dragged her against him it was happening again he could almost stand outside himself and watch the animal inside take over with one desperate yank he pulled her head back by the hair and savaged her throat her mouth the need to take her was raging some fatal drug that stabbed into his veins speeding up his heartbeat and clouding his mind he would hurt her again even knowing it he couldnt stop with a sound part rage part triumph he pushed her back on the kitchen table he had the dark twisted satisfaction of seeing her eyes widen in surprise rogan your papers he jerked her hips from the edge of the wood raising them with his hands his eyes were warrior bright on hers as he drove himself into her her hand flailed out knocked the cup from its saucer and sent both flying to the floor china shattered even as the jolting table sent his open briefcase crashing to the ground stars seemed to explode in front of maggies eyes as she gave herself up to the delirium she felt the rough wood on her back the sweat that bloomed up to slicken her skin and when he braced her legs higher and thrust himself deep she could have sworn she felt him touch her heart then she felt nothing at all but the wild wind that tossed her up and up and over that jaggededged peak she gasped for air like a woman drowning then expelled it on a long languorous moan later sometime later when she found she could speak she was cradled in his arms did you finish your calls then he laughed and carried her out of the kitchen it was early when he left her a sunshower tossed wavering rainbows into the morning sky shed made some sleepy offer to brew him tea then had drifted off again so hed gone to the kitchen alone thered been a miserable jar of hardening instant coffee in her cupboard though hed winced rogan had settled for it and for the single egg in her refrigerator he was gathering up and trying to sort out his scattered papers when she stumbled into the kitchen she was heavyeyed and rumpled and barely grunted at him as she headed for the kettle so much he thought for loverlike farewells i used what appeared to be your last clean towel she grunted again and scooped out tea and you ran out of hot water in the middle of my shower this time she only yawned you dont have any eggs she muttered something that sounded like murphys hens he tapped his wrinkled papers together and stacked them in his briefcase ive left the clippings you wanted on the counter therell be a truck by this afternoon to pick up the shipment youll need to crate it before one oclock when she made no answer at all to this he snapped his briefcase closed i have to go annoyed he strode to her took her chin firmly in hand and kissed her ill miss you too he was out the front door before she could gather her wits and chase after him rogan for pitys sake hold up a moment ive barely got my eyes open he turned just as she launched herself at him off balance he nearly tumbled them both into the flower bed then she was caught close and they were kissing each other breathless in the soft luminous rain i will miss you damn it she pressed her face into his shoulder breathed deep come with me go throw some things in a bag and come with me i cant she drew back surprised at how sorry she was to have to refuse ive some things i need to do and i i cant really work in dublin no he said after a long moment i dont suppose you can could you come back take a day or two its not possible now in a couple of weeks perhaps i could well thats not so long it seemed like eternity we can both get what needs to be done done and then and then he bent to kiss her youll think of me margaret mary i will she watched him go carrying his briefcase to the car starting the engine backing out into the road she stood for a long time after the sound of the car had faded until the rain stopped and the sun gilded the morning chapter thirteen maggie walked across the empty living room took a long look out of the front window then retraced her steps it was the fifth house she had considered in a week the only one not currently occupied by hopeful sellers and the last one she intended to view it was on the outskirts of ennis a bit farther away than brianna might have liked and not far enough to maggies taste it was new which was in its favor a box of a house with the rooms all on one floor two bedrooms maggie mused as she walked through yet again a bath a kitchen with room for eating a living area with plenty of light and tidy brick hearth she took one last glance set her fists on her hips this is it maggie its certainly the right size for her brianna nibbled her lip as she scanned the empty room but shouldnt we have something closer to home why she hates it there in any case but and this is closer to more conveniences food shops the chemist places to eat out if shes of a mind to she never goes out its time she did and since she wont have you jumping at every snap of her finger shell have to wont she i dont jump spine stiff brianna walked to the window and the fact of the matter is shes likely to refuse to move here in any case she wont refuse not maggie thought with the ax i hold over her head if youll let go of that guilt you love wrapping about you for a moment youll admit this is best for everyone shell be happier in her own place or as happy as a woman of her nature can be you can give her whatever she wants out of the house if that eases your conscience or ill give her money to buy new which is what shed rather maggie the place is charmless and so is our mother before brianna could retort maggie crossed to her and swung an arm around the stiffened shoulders youll make a garden right outside the door there well have the walls painted or papered or whatever it takes it could be made nice no ones better suited to do that than you youll draw out whatever money it takes until the two of you are satisfied its not fair maggie that you should bear all this expense fairer than you might think the time had come maggie decided to speak to brianna about their mother did you know she used to sing professionally mother the idea was so farfetched brianna laughed where did you get a notion like that its true i learned of it by accident and ive checked to be sure reaching into her purse maggie pulled out the yellowed clippings you can see for yourself she was even written up a few times speechless brianna scanned the newsprint stared at the faded photo she sang in dublin she murmured she had a living a voice as clear and sweet as church bells on easter morning it says but how can this be shes never once spoken of it nor da either ive thought of it quite a lot in the last few days turning away maggie walked to the window again she lost something she wanted and got something she didnt all this time shes punished herself and all of us dazed brianna lowered the clipping but she never sang at home not a note ever im thinking she couldnt bear to or considered her refusal penance for her sin probably both a weariness came over maggie and she struggled to fight it back im trying to excuse her for it brie to imagine how devastated she must have been when she learned she was pregnant with me and being what she is thered have been nothing for her but marriage it was wrong of her to blame you maggie it always was thats no less true today perhaps still it gives me more of an understanding as to why shes never loved me never will have you carefully brianna folded the clippings and slipped them into her own purse have you spoken to her of it i tried to she wont talk about it it could have been different maggie whirled back hating the burden of guilt she couldnt shake it could have been if she couldnt have the career she wanted there could have been music still did she have to shut off everything because she couldnt have it all i dont know the answer some people arent content with less than all it cant be changed maggie said firmly but well give her this well give all of us this how quickly money dribbled away maggie thought a few days later it seemed the more you had the more you needed but the deed to the house was now in maeves name and the details the dozens of them that came from establishing a home were being dealt with one by one a pity the details of her own life seemed to hang in limbo shed barely spoken to rogan she thought as she sulked at her kitchen table oh thered been messages relayed through his eileen and joseph but he rarely bothered to contact her directly or to come back as hed said he would well that was fine she thought she was busy in any case there were any number of sketches that were begging to be turned into glass if she was a bit late getting started this morning it was only because shed yet to decide which project to pursue first it certainly wasnt because she was waiting for the blasted phone to ring she got up and started to the door when she saw brianna through the window the devoted wolfhound at her heels good i hoped id catch you before you started for the day brianna took the basket from her arm as she stepped into the kitchen you did just is it going well very brisk and efficient brianna uncovered the steaming muffins shed brought along finding lottie sullivans like a gift from god she smiled thinking of the retired nurse theyd hired as maeves companion shes simply wonderful maggie like part of the family already yesterday when i was working on the front flower beds mother was carrying on about how it was too late in the year for planting and how the paint on the outside of the house was the wrong color and oh just being contrary and lottie was standing there laughing disagreeing with everything she said i swear the two of them were having the time of their lives i wish id seen it maggie broke open a muffin the smell of it and the picture brianna had put in her head almost made up for postponing her mornings work you found a treasure there brie lottiell keep her in line its more than that she really enjoys doing it every time mother says something horrid lottie just laughs and winks and goes about her business i never thought id say it maggie but i really believe this is going to work of course its going to work maggie tossed a bit of muffin to the patiently hopeful con did you ask murphy if hed help move her bed and the other things she wants i didnt have to words out that youve bought her a house near ennis ive had a dozen people drop by in the last two weeks casuallike murphy already offered his back and his lorry then shell be moved tidily in with lottie before the next week is up ive bought us a bottle of champagne and were going to drink ourselves drunk when its done briannas lips twitched but her voice was sober its not something to celebrate then ill just drop in casual like maggie said with a sly grin with a bottle of bubbly under me arm though brianna smiled back her heart wasnt in it maggie i tried to talk to her about her singing she was sorry to see the light go out of her sisters eyes i thought i should of course you did losing her appetite for the muffin maggie tossed the rest to con did you have better luck than i no she wouldnt talk to me only got angry it wasnt worth recounting the verbal blows punch by punch brianna thought to do so would only serve to spread the unhappiness more thickly she went off to her room but she took the clippings with her well thats something perhaps theyll comfort her maggie jolted when the phone rang and scrambled out of her chair so quickly that brianna gaped hello oh eileen is it the disappointment in her voice was unmistakable yes ive the photos you sent for the catalog they look more than fine perhaps i should tell mr sweeney myself that oh a meeting no thats all right then you can tell him i approved of them youre welcome goodbye you answered the phone brianna commented of course i did it rang didnt it the waspish tone of her sisters voice had briannas brow arching were you expecting a call no why would you think so well the way you went leaping up like you were after snatching a child from in front of a car oh had she maggie thought had she done that it was humiliating i dont like the damn thing ringing my ears off thats all ive got to get to work with that as a faretheewell she stalked out of the kitchen it didnt matter a tinkers damn to her whether he called or not maggie told herself maybe it had been three weeks since hed gone back to dublin maybe shed only spoken to him twice in all that time but it hardly mattered to her she was much too busy to be bothered chattering over the phone or entertaining him if he came to see her as hed bloody well said he would she added silently and slammed the shop door behind her she didnt need rogan sweeneys company or anyones she had herself maggie picked up her pipe and went to work the connellys formal dining room would have reminded maggie of a set she had seen on the glossy soap opera that had been on television the day her father died everything gleamed and sparkled and shone wine of the very best vintage glimmered gold in the crystal shooting rainbows into the facets candles slim and white added to the elegance of light showered down from the fivetiered chandelier the people surrounding the lacedecked table were every bit as polished as the room anne in sapphire silk and her grandmothers diamonds was the picture of the gracious hostess dennis flushed from the good meal and better company beamed at his daughter patricia looked particularly lovely and as delicate as the pastel pink and creamy pearls she wore across from her rogan sipped at his wine and struggled to keep his mind from wandering west toward maggie its so nice to have a quiet family meal anne picked at the miserly portion of pheasant on her plate the scale had warned her that shed added two pounds in the last month and that would never do i hope youre not disappointed i didnt invite a party rogan of course not its a pleasure a rare one for me these days to spend a quiet evening with friends exactly what ive been telling dennis anne went on why weve hardly seen you in months you work much too hard rogan a man cant work too hard at something he loves dennis put in ah you and your mans work anne laughed lightly and barely resisted kicking her husband smartly under the table too much business makes a man tense i say especially if he has no wife to soothe him knowing just where this was leading patricia did her best to change the subject you had a wonderful success with miss concannons showing rogan and ive heard the american indian art has been very well received yes on both counts the american art is moving to the cork gallery this week and maggies miss concannons moves on to paris shortly shes finished some astonishing pieces this past month ive seen a few of them i believe joseph covets the globe the one with all the colors and shapes inside its quite fascinating really patricia folded her hands in her lap as the dessert course was served i wonder how it was done as it happens i was there when she made it he remembered the heat the bleeding colors the siz zling sparks and i still cant explain it to you the look in his eyes put anne on full alert knowing too much about the artistic process can spoil the enjoyment dont you think im sure its all routine to miss concannon after all patricia you havent told us about your little project how is the day school going its coming along nicely thank you imagine our little patricia starting a school anne smiled indulgently rogan realized with a guilty start that he hadnt asked patricia about her pet project in weeks have you found a location then yes i have its a house off mountjoy square the building will require some renovation of course ive hired an architect the grounds are more than suitable with plenty of space for play areas i hope to have it ready for children by next spring and she could imagine it the babies and toddlers whose mothers needed a reliable place to leave their children while they worked the older children who would come after school and before the close of business it would fill some of the ache she thought and the emptiness that throbbed inside her she and robert hadnt had children they had been so sure there was plenty of time so sure im sure rogan could help you with the business end of it patricia anne went on after all youve no experience shes my daughter isnt she dennis interjected with a wink shell do fine im sure she will again anne itched to connect her foot with her husbands shin she waited until she was in the parlor with her daughter and the men were lingering over glasses of port in the dining room a custom anne refused to believe was outdated she dismissed the maid who had wheeled in coffee and rounded on her daughter what are you waiting for patricia youre letting the man slip between your fingers please dont start this already patricia could feel the dull insistent throb of a headache in progress you want to be a widow all your life i suppose grimeyed anne added cream to her cup im telling you its been time enough youve been telling me that since a year after robbie died and its no more than the truth anne sighed shed hated to watch her daughter grieve had wept long and hard herself not only over the loss of the soninlaw shed loved but for the pain shed been unable to erase from patricias eyes darling as much as we all wish it wasnt so roberts gone i know that ive accepted it and im trying to move on by starting a daycare service for other peoples children yes in part im doing that for myself mother because i need work the satisfaction of it ive finished trying to talk you out of that in a gesture of peace anne raised her hands and if its what you want truly than its what i want as well thank you for that patricias face softened as she leaned over to kiss her mothers cheek i know that you only want the best for me i do which is exactly why i want rogan for you no dont close up on me girl you cant tell me you dont want him as well i care for him patricia said carefully very much i always have and he for you but youre standing back all too patiently and waiting for him to take the next step and while youre waiting hes becoming distracted a blind woman could see that hes interested in more than that concannon womans art and shes not the type to wait anne added with a wag of the finger oh no indeed shell see a man of rogans background and means and snap him up before he can blink i very much doubt rogan can be snapped up patricia said dryly he knows his own mind in most areas anne agreed but men need to be guided patricia allured you havent set yourself out to allure rogan sweeney youve got to make him see you as a woman not as his friends widow you want him dont you i think of course you do now see to it that he wants you too patricia said little when rogan drove her home home to the house shed shared with robert the house she couldnt give up she no longer walked into a room expecting to find him waiting for her or suffered those silvery slashes of pain at odd moments when she suddenly remembered their life together it was simply a house that held good memories but did she want to live in it alone for the rest of her life did she want to spend her days caring for other womens children while there were none of her own to brighten her life if her mother was right and rogan was what she wanted then what was wrong with a little allure wont you come in for a while she asked when he walked her to the door its early still and im restless he thought of his own empty house and the hours before the workday began if youll promise me a brandy on the terrace she agreed and walked inside the house reflected the quiet elegance and faultless taste of its mistress though hed always felt completely at home there rogan thought of maggies cluttered cottage and narrow rumpled bed even the brandy snifter reminded him of maggie he thought of the way shed smashed one against the hearth in a rage of passion and of the package that had come days later holding the one shed made to replace it its a lovely night patricia said and snagged his wandering attention what oh yes yes it is he swirled the brandy but didnt drink a crescent moon rode the sky misted by clouds then glowing white and thin as the breeze nudged them clear the air was warm and fragrant disturbed only by the muffled sound of traffic beyond the hedges tell me more about the school he began what architect have you chosen she named a firm he approved of they do good work weve used them ourselves i know joseph recommended them hes been wonderfully helpful though i feel guilty taking his mind off his work hes well able to do a halfdozen things at once he never seems to mind my dropping into the gallery testing him herself patricia moved closer ive missed you things have been hectic he tucked her hair behind her ear an old gesture an old habit he wasnt even aware of well have to make some time we havent been to the theater in weeks have we no she caught his hand held it but im glad we have time now alone a warning signal sounded in his head he dis missed it as ridiculous and smiled at her well make more why dont i come by that property youve bought look it over for you you know i value your opinion her heart beat light quick in her chest i value you before she could change her mind she leaned forward and pressed her mouth to his if there had been alarm in his eyes she refused to see it no sweet platonic kiss this time patricia curled her fingers into his hair and poured herself into it she wanted desperately wanted to feel something again but his arms didnt come around her his lips didnt heat he stood still as a statue it wasnt pleasure nor was it desire that trembled between them it was the chilly air of shock she drew back saw the astonishment and worse much worse the regret in his eyes stung she whirled away rogan set his untouched brandy down patricia dont she squeezed her eyes tight dont say anything of course i will i have to his hands hesitated over her shoulders and finally settled gently patricia you know how much i what words were there he thought frantically what possible words i care about you he said and hated himself leave it at that she gripped her hands together until her fingers ached im humiliated enough i never thought he cursed himself again and because he felt so miserable cursed maggie for being right patty he said helplessly im sorry im sure you are her voice was cool again despite his use of her old nickname and so am i for putting you in such an awkward position its my fault i should have understood why should you chilled she stepped away from his hands made herself turn in the dappled starlight her face was fragile as glass her eyes as blank im always there arent i dropping by available for whatever evening you might have free poor patricia at such loose ends dreaming up her little projects to keep herself busy the young widow whos content with a pat on the head and an indulgent smile thats not at all true its not the way i feel i dont know how you feel her voice rose cracked alarming them both i dont know how i feel i only know i want you to go before we say things that would embarrass us both more than we already are i cant leave you this way please come inside sit down well talk no she thought she would weep and complete her mortification i mean it rogan she said flatly i want you to go theres nothing for either of us to say but good night you know the way out she swept past him into the house damn all women rogan thought as he strode into the gallery the following afternoon damn them for their uncanny ability to make a man feel guilty and needy and idiotic hed lost a friend one who was very dear to him lost her he thought because hed been blind to her feelings feelings he remembered with growing resentment that maggie had seen and understood in the blink of an eye he stalked up the stairs furious with himself why was it he had no idea how to handle two of the women who meant so much to him hed broken patricias heart carelessly and maggie god cursed her had the power to break his did people never fall in love with anyone who was eager to return it well he wouldnt be fool enough to toss his feelings at maggies feet and have her crush them not now not after hed inadvertently done some crushing of his own he could get along very well on his own thank you he stepped into the first sitting room and scowled theyd put a few more pieces of her work on display a mere glimpse of what would be toured over the next twelve months the globe shed created in front of his eyes gleamed back at him seeming to contain all the dreams shed claimed were held inside dreams that now mocked at him as he stared into its depths it was just as well she hadnt answered the phone when hed called the night before perhaps hed needed her at that moment while the miserable guilt over patricia had clawed at him hed needed to hear her voice to soothe himself with it instead hed heard his own clipped and precise on the answering machine shed refused to make the recording herself so instead of a quiet perhaps intimate latenight conversation hed left a terse message that would no doubt annoy maggie as much as it annoyed him god he wanted her ah just the man i wanted to see cheerful as a robin joseph popped into the room ive sold carlottajosephs selfsatisfied smile faded into curiosity when rogan turned bad day is it ive had better carlotta you say to whom to an american tourist who strolled in this morning she was absolutely enthralled by carlotta were having her shipped the painting that is to someplace called tucson joseph sat on the corner of the love seat and lighted a celebratory cigarette the american claimed that she adores primitive nudes and our carlotta was certainly primitive im quite fond of nudes myself but carlotta was never my type too heavy at the hip and the brush strokes well the artist lacked subtlety shall we say it was an excellent oil rogan said absently of its type since i prefer something a bit less obvious i wont be sorry to ship carlotta off to tucson he pulled a little fliptop ashtray out of his pocket and tapped his cigarette in it oh and that watercolor series from the scotsman arrived an hour ago its beautiful work rogan i think youve discovered another star blind luck if i hadnt been checking on the factory in inverness i never would have seen the paintings a street artist joseph shook his head well not for long i can guarantee that theres a wonderfully mystical quality to the work rather fragile and austere his tooth flashed in a grin and a nude as well to make up for the loss of carlotta more to my taste ill have to say shes elegant rather delicate and just a bit sadeyed i fell hopelessly in love he broke off flushing a little around the collar as he saw patricia in the doorway his heart trembled hopelessly out of your reach boyo he reminded himself way out of your reach his smile was dashing as he rose hello patricia how lovely to see you rogan turned decided he should be flogged for putting those shadows under her eyes hello joseph i hope im not disturbing you not at all beauty is always welcome here he took her hand kissed it and called himself an idiot would you like tea no dont trouble its no problem no problem at all its near to closing i know id hoped patricia braced herself joseph would you mind i need to have a moment alone with rogan of course not fool dolt imbecile ill just go on down ill put the kettle on if you change your mind thank you she waited until hed gone then shut the door i hope you dont mind my coming since its so near closing no of course not rogan wasnt prepared again he discovered to handle himself im glad you came no youre not she smiled a little as she said it to ease the sting youre standing there frantically trying to think of what to say how to behave ive known you too long rogan can we sit yes of course he started to offer a hand then let it fall back to his side patricia lifted a brow at the movement she sat folded her hands in her lap ive come to apologize now his distress was complete please dont theres no need theres every need youll do me the courtesy of hearing me out patty he sat as well felt his stomach lurch ive made you cry it was all too obvious now that they were close however careful her makeup he could see the signs yes you did and after id finished crying i began to think for myself she sighed ive had much too little practice thinking for myself rogan mother and daddy took such close care of me and they had such expectations i was always afraid i couldnt meet them thats absurd ive asked you to hear me out she said in a tone that had him staring in surprise and you will you were always there from the time i was what fourteen fifteen and then there was robbie i was so in love there was no need to think no room for it it was all him and putting the house together making a home when i lost him i thought i would die too god knows i wanted to there was nothing else rogan could do but take her hand i loved him too i know you did and it was you who got me through it you who helped me grieve then move past the grieving i could talk about robbie with you and laugh or cry youve been the best of friends to me so it was natural that id love you if seemed sensible for me to wait until you began to see me as a woman instead of an old friend then wouldnt it be natural enough for you to fall in love with me ask me to marry you his fingers moved restlessly under hers if id paid closer attention youd have still seen nothing i didnt wish you to see she finished for reasons id rather not dis cuss i decided id take the next step myself last night when i kissed you i expected to feel oh stardust and moonbeams i threw myself into kissing you expecting it to be everything id been waiting for all those wonderful terrifying tugs and pulls i wanted so much to feel them again but i didnt patricia its not that i he broke off eyes narrowing i beg your pardon she laughed confusing him all the more when id finished my welldeserved bout of weeping i thought through the whole episode it wasnt just you who was taken by surprise rogan i realized id felt nothing at all when id kissed you nothing at all he repeated after a moment nothing more than embarrassment for having put us both in such a potentially dreadful situation it came to me that while i love you dearly im not in love with you at all i was simply kissing my closest friend i see it was ridiculous to feel as though his manhood had been impugned but he was after all a man thats lucky isnt it she did know him well laughing she pressed his hand to her cheek now ive insulted you no you havent im relieved weve sorted this out her bland look had him cursing all right damn it you have insulted me or at least nicked my masculine pride he grinned back at her friends then always she let out a long breath i cant tell you how relieved i am that thats over you know i think ill take joseph up on that tea can you join us sorry weve just gotten in a shipment from inverness i want to look over she rose you know i have to agree with mother on one thing youre working too hard rogan its beginning to show you need a few days to relax in a month or two shaking her head she leaned down to kiss him you always say that i wish i thought you meant it this time she tilted her head smiled i believe your villa in the south of france is an excellent place not only to relax but for creative inspiration the colors and the textures would undoubtedly appeal to an artist he opened his mouth closed it again you do know me too well he murmured i do give it some thought she left him brooding and went down to the kitchen since joseph was in the main gallery with a few lingering clients she began to brew the tea herself joseph came in just as she was pouring the first cup im sorry he said they wouldnt be hurried along nor could they be seduced into parting with a single pound here i thought id end the day by selling that copper sculpture you know the one that looks a bit like a holly shrub but they got away from me have some tea and console yourself i will thanks have you he stopped when she turned to him and he saw her face in the full light what is it whats wrong why nothing she brought the cups to the table nearly dropping them both when he caught her by the arms youve been crying he said in a tight voice and therere shadows under your eyes on an impatient breath she set the jostling cups down why are cosmetics so damn expensive if they dont do the job a woman cant indulge herself in a good weeping spell if she cant depend on her powder she started to sit but his hands remained firm on her shoulders surprised she looked up at him what she saw in his eyes had her fumbling its nothing really nothing just some foolishness im im fine now he didnt think hed held her before of course theyd danced together but there was no music now only her slowly he lifted a hand brushed a thumb gently over the faint smudges under her eyes you still miss him robbie yes i always will but her husbands face so well loved blurred she saw only joseph i wasnt crying for robbie not really im not sure exactly what i was crying for she was so lovely he diought her eyes so soft and confused and her skin hed never dared touch her like this before was like silk you mustnt cry patty he heard himself say then he was kissing her his mouth homing to hers like an arrow his hand scooping up into that soft swing of hair he lost himself drowning in the scent of her aching at the way her lips parted in surprise to allow him one long fullbodied taste of her her body gave to his a delicate sway of fragility that aroused unbearable and conflicting needs to take to protect to comfort and to possess it was her sigh part shock part wonder that snapped him back like a faceful of ice water i i beg your pardon he fumbled over the words then went rigid with regret when she only stared at him emotions churned sickly inside of him as he stepped back that was inexcusable he turned on his heel and walked away before her head stopped spinning she took one step after him his name on her lips then she stopped pressed her hand to her racing heart and let her shaking legs buckle her into a chair joseph her hand crept up from her breast to her flushed cheek joseph she thought again staggered why it was ridiculous they were no more than casual friends who shared an affection for rogan and for art he was well the closest thing she knew to a bohemian she decided charming certainly as every woman who walked into the gallery would attest and it had only been a kiss just a kiss she told herself as she reached for her cup but her hand trembled and spilled tea onto the table a kiss she realized with a jolt that had given her those moonbeams the stardust and all the wonderful and terrifying tugs and pulls she had hoped for joseph she thought again and raced out of the kitchen to find him she caught a glimpse of him outside and darted past rogan with barely a word joseph he stopped swore here it was he thought bitterly shed slap him down good and proper and since he hadnt made a quick enough exit in public as well resigned to facing the music he turned tossed his streaming hair back over his shoulder she skidded to a halt inches in front of him i she completely forgot what shed hoped to say youve every right to be angry he told her it hardly matters that i never meant that is id only wanted to goddamn it what do you expect you come in looking so sad and beautiful so lost i forgot myself and ive apologized for it she had been feeling lost she realized she wondered if he would understand what it was like to know just where you were and to believe you knew where you were going but to be lost just the same she thought he might will you have dinner with me he blinked stepped back stared what will you have dinner with me she repeated she felt giddy almost reckless tonight now you want to have dinner he spoke slowly spacing each word with me tonight he looked so baffled so leery that she laughed yes actually no that isnt what i want at all all right then he nodded stiffly and headed down the street i dont want dinner she called out loudly enough to have heads turn almost reckless she thought oh no completely reckless i want you to kiss me again that stopped him he turned back ignored the wink and encouraging word from a man in a flowered shirt like a blind man feeling his way he walked toward her im not sure i caught that then ill speak plainly she swallowed a foolish bubble of pride i want you to take me home with you joseph and i want you to kiss me again and unless ive very much mistaken what were both feeling i want you to make love with me she took the last step toward him did you understand that and is it agreeable to you agreeable he took her face in his hands stared hard into her eyes youve lost your mind thank god he laughed and swooped her against him oh its more than agreeable patty darling much more chapter fourteen maggie dozed off at her kitchen table her head on her folded arms moving day had been sheer hell her mother had complained constantly relent lessly about everything from the steady fall of rain to the curtains brianna had hung at the wide front window of the new house but it was worth the misery of the day to see maeve at last settled in her own place maggie had kept her word and brianna was free still maggie hadnt expected the wave of guilt that swamped her when maeve had wept her back bent her face buried in her hands and the hot fast tears leaking through her fingers no she hadnt expected to feel guilty or to feel so miserably sorry for the woman whod barely finished cursing her before she collapsed into sobs in the end it was lottie with her brisk unflap pable cheerfulness who had taken control she scooted both brianna and maggie out of the house telling them not to worry no not to worry a bit as the tears were as natural as the rain and what a lovely place it was shed gone on to say all the while nudging and pushing them along like a dollhouse and just as tidy theyd be fine theyd be cozy as cats shed all but shoved them into maggies lorry so it was done and it was right but there would be no opening of champagne bottles that night maggie had downed one bracing whiskey and simply folded into a heap of exhausted emotions at the table while the rain drummed on the roof and dusk deepened the gloom the phone didnt awaken her it rang demandingly while she dozed but rogans voice stabbed through the fatigue and had her jolting up shaking off sleep ill expect to hear from you by morning as ive neither the time nor the patience to come fetch you myself what groggy she blinked like an owl and stared around the darkened room why shed have sworn hed been right there badgering her annoyed that her nap had been interrupted and that the interruption reminded her she was hungry and there was no more to eat in the house than would satisfy a bird she pushed away from the table shed go down to eries she decided raid her kitchen perhaps they could cheer each other up she was reaching for a cap when she saw the impatient red blip on the answering machine bloody nuisance she muttered but stabbed the buttons until the tape rewound then played maggie again rogans voice filled the room it made her smile as she realized he had been the one to wake her after all why the devil dont you ever answer this thing its noon i want you to call the moment you come in from your studio i mean it theres something i need to discuss with you so i miss you damn you maggie i miss you the message clicked off and before she could feel too smug about it another began do you think ive nothing better to do than spend my time talking to this blasted machine i dont she answered back but youre the one who put it here its half four now and i need to go by the gallery perhaps i didnt make myself clear i need to speak with you today ill be at the gallery until six then you can reach me at home i dont give a damn how wrapped up you are in your work damn you for being so far away the man spends more time damning me than anything else she muttered and youre just as far away from me as i am from you sweeney as if in answer his voice came again you irresponsible idiotic insensitive brat am i supposed to worry now that youve blown yourself up with your chemicals and set your hair on fire thanks to your sister who does answer her phone i know perfectly well youre there its nearly eight and i have a dinner meeting now you listen

from you by morning as ive neither the time nor the patience to fetch you myself fetch me as if you could she stood for a moment scowling at the machine so she was supposed to get herself to dublin was she just because he demanded it never a please or a will you just do what youre told ice would flow in hell before shed give him the satisfaction forgetting her hunger she stormed from the room and up the stairs get herself to dublin she fumed the nerve of the man ordering her about she yanked the suitcase out of her closet and heaved it onto the bed did he think she was so eager to see him that shed drop everything and scramble off to do his bidding he was going to find out differently oh yes she decided as she tossed clothes into the case she was going to tell him differently in person facetoface she doubted hed thank her for it eileen ill need limerick to fax me those adjusted figures before the end of the day behind his desk rogan checked off a line of his list rubbed at the tension at the base of his neck and ill want to see the report on the construction there the moment it comes in it was promised by noon eileen a trim brunette who managed the office as skillfully as

olives should i see about a cheese tray to keep him from staggering out youd better rogan drummed his fingers on the desk has there been no call from clare none this morning she shot a quick interested look from under her lashes ill be sure to let you know the moment miss concannon calls he made a sound the vocal equivalent of a shrug go ahead and put that call through to rome if you will right away oh and i have that draft of the letter to inverness on my desk if you want to approve it fine and wed best send a wire to boston whats the time there he started to check his watch when a blur of color in the doorway stopped him maggie aye maggie she tossed her suitcase down with a thud and fisted her hands on her hips ive a few choice words for you mr sweeney she bit down on her temper long enough to nod at the woman rising from the chair in front of rogans desk youd be eileen yes its a pleasure to meet you at last miss concannon its nice of you to say so i must say you look remarkably well for a woman who works for a tyrant her voice rose on the last word eileens lips twitched she cleared her throat closed her steno pad its nice of you to say so is there anything else mr sweeney no hold my calls please yes sir eileen walked out closing the door discreetly behind her so rogan leaned back in his chair tapped his pen against his palm you got my message i got it she walked across the room no rogan thought she swaggered across it hands still fisted on hips eyes flashing he wasnt ashamed to admit that his mouth watered at the sight of her who in this wide world do you think you are she slapped her palms on his desk rattling pens i signed my work to you rogan sweeney and aye i slept with you to my undying regret but none of it gives you the right to order me about or swear at me every five minutes i havent spoken to you in days he reminded her so how can i have sworn at you over your hideous machine which i tossed into the garbage this very morning very calmly he made a note on a pad dont start that im merely noting down that you need a replacement for your answering machine you had no trouble getting a flight in i see no trouble youve been nothing but trouble to me since the moment you walked into my glass house nothing but you think you can just take over everything not just my work which is bad enough but me as well im here to tell you that you cant i wont where in the hell are you going i havent finished i never thought you had he continued to the door locked it turned back unlock that door no the fact that he was smiling as he came back toward her didnt help her nerves dont you put your hands on me im about to in fact im about to do something i havent done in the twelve years ive worked in this office her heart began a fast hard tattoo in her throat you are not so he thought hed finally shocked her he watched her gaze slide to the door then made his grab you can rage at me once ive finished with you finished with me even as she took a swing at him he was crushing his mouth to hers get off me you hamhanded brute you like my hands and he used them to tug her sweater up you told me so thats a lie i wont have this rogan but the denial ended in a moan as his lips skimmed hot over her throat then ill shout down the roof once she got her breath back go ahead he bit her none too gently i like it when you shout curse you she muttered and went willingly when he lowered her to the floor it was fast and hot a frantic coupling that was over almost as soon as it had begun but the speed didnt diminish the power they lay tangled together a moment longer limbs vibrating rogan turned his head to press a kiss to her jaw nice of you to drop by maggie she summoned up the strength to bounce her fist off his shoulder get off of me you brute she would have shoved him but he was already shifting drawing her with him until she was straddled across his lap better than what she grinned then remembered she was furious with him pushing away she sat on the rug and tidied her clothes youve a nerve you do rogan sweeney because i dragged you to the floor no she snapped her jeans itd be foolish to say that when its obvious i enjoyed it very obvious she sent him a steely look as he rose and offered her a hand thats neither here nor there who do you think you are ordering me about telling me what to do without a will you or a wont you he bent down and pulled her to her feet youre here arent you im here you swine to tell you that i wont tolerate it here its been nearly a month since you walked away from my door whistling and you missed me she hissed at him i did not i have more than enough to keep my time filled oh straighten that silly tie you look like a drunkard he obliged her you missed me margaret mary though you never bothered to say so whenever i managed to reach you by phone i cant talk on the phone how am i supposed to say anything to someone i cant see and youre evading the issue what is the issue he leaned back comfortably against his desk i wont be given orders im not one of your servants or one of your staff so get that through your head mark it down in that fancy leather notebook of yours if you need reminding but dont you ever tell me what to do again she let out a short satisfied breath now that ive made that clear ill be on my way maggie if youd no intention to stay why did you pack a suitcase he had her there patiently he waited while annoyance dismay and confusion flitted across her face maybe ive a mind to stay in dublin for a day or two i can come and go as i please cant i mmm did you bring your passport she eyed him warily and what if i did good he circled around his desk sat itll save time i thought you might have been stubborn and left it at home it would have been a nuisance to go back and get it he leaned back smiling why dont you sit down shall i ask eileen to bring in some tea i dont want to sit and i dont want tea folding her arms she turned away from him and stared hard at the georgia okeeffe on the wall why didnt you come back there were a couple of reasons one ive been swamped here i had several matters i wanted to clear up so id have a block of free time second i wanted to stay away from you for a while oh did you she kept her eyes trained on the bold colors did you now because i didnt want to admit how much i wanted to be with you he waited shook his head no response to that i see no iwantedtobewithyouaswell i did not that i dont have a life of my own but there were odd moments when i would have liked your company and he would it seemed have to settle for that youre about to get it would you sit now maggie there are some things we need to discuss all right then she turned back sat in front of his desk he looked perfect there she thought dignified competent in charge not at all like a man who would have indulged in a wild tussle on the office rug the idea made her smile what i was just wondering what your secretary might be thinking out there he lifted a brow im sure she assumes were having a civilized business discussion hah she looked like a sensible woman to me but you go right on believing that pleased by the way his eyes flickered to the door she propped her ankle on her knee so what business are we about to discuss ah your work over the last few weeks has been exceptional as you know we held back ten pieces from the first showing with the purpose of touring them over the next year i would like to keep a few of your newest pieces in dublin but the rest is already on its way to paris so your very efficient and very sensible eileen told me she began to tap her fingers on her ankle you didnt call me all the way to dublin to tell me again nor do i think you called me here for a spot of hot sex on the office rug no i didnt i would have preferred discussing the plans with you over the phone but you never bothered to return my calls i was out a good deal of the time you may have exclusive rights to my work but not to me rogan i do have my own life as ive already explained a number of times he could feel the temper seeping back into him im not interfering with your life im managing your career and to that purpose ill be traveling to paris to oversee the display and the showing paris shed barely had an hour with him and he was already talking about leaving distressed by her own plummeting heart she spoke crisply tis a wonder you keep your business thriving rogan id think youd be hiring people capable of handling details like that without you feeling the need to peek over their shoulders i assure you i have very competent people as it happens i have a vested interest in your work and i want to handle those details myself i want it done right which means you want it done your way precisely and i want you to come with me the sarcastic little comment that had sprung to her lips slipped off with you to paris i realize you have some artistic or possibly moral objection to promoting your own work but you did well enough at the dublin show it would be advantageous to have you appear however briefly at your first international show my first international show she repeated dumbfounded as the phrase sank into her head i dont i dont speak french that wont be a problem youll have a look at the paris gallery dispense a bit of charm and have plenty of time to see the sights he waited for her answer received nothing but a blank stare well when tomorrow tomorrow the first skitter of panic had her pressing a hand to her stomach you want me to go with you to paris tomorrow unless youve some pressing previous engagement i dont no then its settled the relief was almost brutal after weve satisfied ourselves that the paris show is successful id like you to go south with me south ive a villa on the mediterranean i want to be alone with you maggie no distractions no interruptions just you her eyes lifted to his the block of time youve been working on for these weeks yes i wouldnt have shouted at you if youd explained it to me i had to explain it to myself first will you come yes ill come with you she smiled youd only to ask an hour later she burst into the gallery only to stop and simmer with frustration as she waited for joseph to finish with a client while he charmed a woman old enough to be his mother maggie wandered around the main room noting that the american indian display had been replaced by a selection of metal sculptures intrigued by the shapes she lost her sense of urgency in admiration a german artist joseph said from behind her this particular work is i feel both visceral and joyous a celebration of elemental forces earth fire water the suggestion of wind in the feathering of the copper she put on an airy accent to match his powerful indeed in scope but with an underlying mischief that suggests satire and it can be yours for a mere two thousand pounds a bargain a pity im without a farthing to me name she turned laughing and kissed him youre looking fit joseph how many hearts have you broken since i left you nary a one since mine belongs to you hah a good thing for us both that i know youre full of blarney have you a minute to spare for you days weeks he kissed her hand years a minute will do me joseph what do i need for paris a tight black sweater a short skirt and very high heels thatll be the day really im to go and i havent a clue what ill need i tried to reach mrs sweeney but shes out today so im your second choice you devastate me he signaled to one of his staff to take the room all you need for paris maggie is a romantic heart where can i buy one you have your own you cant hide it from me ive seen your work she grimaced then slipped her arm through his listen now id not admit this to just anyone but ive never traveled in venice i only had to worry about learning and not wearing anything that would catch fire and paying the rent if im going to have a trip to paris i dont want to make a fool of myself you wont youll be going with rogan i take it and he knows paris as well as a native youve only to act a bit arrogant a bit bored and youll fit right in ive come to you for fashion advice oh its humiliating to say it but i cant go looking like this not that i want to paint myself up like a mannequin but i dont want to look like rogans country cousin either hmm joseph took the question seriously drawing her back to arms length for a slow careful study youd do just fine as you are but but buy yourself a silk blouse very tailored but soft vivid colors my girl no pastels for you slacks of the same type use your eye for color go for the clash and that short skirt is a must youve got that black dress i didnt bring it with me he clucked his tongue like a maiden aunt you should always be prepared all right thats out so go for glitter this time something that dazzles the eye he tapped the sculpture beside them these metal tones would suit you dont go for classic go for bold pleased with the thought he nodded hows that confusing im ashamed to find it matters to me theres nothing shameful about it its simply a matter of presentation that may be but id be grateful to you if you didnt mention this to rogan consider me your confessor darling he looked over her shoulder and maggie saw joy leap into his eyes patricia came in hesitated then crossed the glossy tiles hello maggie i didnt know you were coming to dublin neither did i what change was this maggie wondered gone was the shadowed sadness the fragile reserve it only took a moment seeing the way patricias eyes lighted on josephs to give her the answer aha she thought so theres where the wind blows im sorry to interrupt i just wanted to tell joseph patricia sputtered to a halt ah that is i was passing by and remembered the business wed discussed the seven oclock appointment yes joseph dipped his hands into his pockets to keep them from reaching for her seven oclock im afraid i have to make it seventhirty ive a bit of a conflict i wanted to be sure that wouldnt upset the schedule ill adjust it good thats good she stood for a moment staring foolishly at him before she remembered maggie and her manners will you be in town long no actually im leaving tomorrow the way the air was sizzling maggie thought it was a wonder the sculptures didnt melt in fact im leaving now oh no please dont run off on my account ive got to go patricia sent one more longing look in josephs direction ive people waiting for me i just wanted to well goodbye maggie waited one beat are you just going to stand here she hissed at joseph as patricia headed for the door hmm what excuse me he made the dash to the door in two seconds flat she watched patricia turn blush smile then they were in each others arms the romantic heart maggie refused to believe she had swelled she waited until patricia hurried out and joseph stood staring after her like a man recently struck by lighting so your heart belongs to me does it the dazed look cleared from his eyes shes beautiful isnt she theres no denying it ive been in love with her so long even before she married robbie i never thought never believed he laughed a little still dazzled by love i thought it was rogan so did i its plain to see you make her happy she kissed his cheek im glad for you its were trying to keep it between us at least until for a while her family i can guarantee her mother wont approve of me the hell with her mother patricia said nearly the same thing it brought a smile to his lips to remember it but ill not be the cause of any trouble there so id appreciate it if youd say nothing not to rogan either i work for him maggie hes a friend yes but i work for him patricias the widow of one of his oldest friends a woman hes escorted himself a great many people thought shed become his wife i dont believe rogan was among them be that as it may id rather tell him myself when the times right its your business joseph yours and patricias so well trade confession for confession im grateful to you no need if rogans stiffnecked enough to disapprove he deserves to be fooled chapter fifteen paris was hot muggy and crowded the traffic was abominable cars buses motorbikes screeched and swerved and sped their drivers seemingly bent on challenging each other to endless roadway duels along the sidewalks people strolled and swaggered in a colorful pedestrian parade women in those short skirts joseph seemed so fond of looked lean and bored and impossibly chic men equally fashionable watched them from little cafe tables where they sipped red wine or strong black coffee flowers bloomed everywhere roses gladiolus marigolds snapdragons begonias tumbling out of vendors stalls sunning on banks spilling out of the arms of young girls whose legs flashed bright as blades in the sunshine boys skated by with yards of golden bread spearing up out of bags packs of tourists aimed cameras like so many shotguns to blast away at their shutter view of paris life and there were dogs the city seemed a veritable den of them prancing on leashes skulking in alley ways darting by shops even the lowliest cur ap peared exotic wonderfully foreign and arrogantly frenchmaggie took it all in from her window overlooking the place de la concorde she was in paris the air was full of sound and scent and gaudy light and her lover was sleeping like a stone in the bed behind her or so she thought hed been watching her watch paris for some time she leaned out of the grand window heedless of the cotton nightshirt falling off her left shoulder shed acted wholly indifferent to the city when theyd arrived the evening before her eyes had widened at the lush lobby of the hotel de crillon but shed made no comment when theyd checked in shed said little more when they entered the plush and lofty suite and wandered away when rogan tipped the bellman when he asked her if the room suited her shed simply shrugged and said it would do well enough it made him laugh and drag her off to bed but she wasnt quite so blase now he noted he could all but see the excitement shimmering around her as she stared out at the street and absorbed die bustling life of the city nothing could have pleased him more than to give her paris if you lean out much farther youll stop traffic she jolted and dragging her hair from her eyes looked around to where he lay among rumpled sheets and a mountain of pillows a bomb couldnt stop that traffic why do diey want to kill each other its a matter of honor what do you think of the city in daylight its crowded worse than dublin then she relented and grinned at him its lovely rogan like an old badtempered woman holding court theres a vendor down there with an ocean of flowers and every time someone stops to look or buy he ignores them like its beneath his dignity to notice them but he takes their money and counts every coin she crawled back into bed and stretched herself over him i know exactly how he feels she murmured nothing makes you more irritable than selling what you love if he didnt sell them theyd die he tipped up her chin if you didnt sell what you love part of you would die too well the part that needs to eat would without a doubt are you going to call up one of those fancy waiters and have him bring us breakfast what would you like her eyes danced oh everything starting with this she tugged the sheets away and fell on him quite a bit later she stepped out of the shower wrapping herself in the plush white robe that had hung on the back of the door she found rogan at a table by the parlor window pouring coffee and reading the paper that newspapers in french she sniffed at a basket of croissants you read french and italian mmm his brows were knit over the financial pages he was thinking of calling his broker what else what else what what else do you read speak language i mean some german enough spanish to get by gaelic no he turned the page scanning for news of art auctions do you my fathers mother spoke it so i learned her shoulders moved restlessly as she slathered jam onto a steaming croissant its not much good i suppose except for cursing it wont get you the best table in a french restaurant its valuable weve lost a considerable amount of our heritage which was something he thought about often its a pity that there are only pockets in ireland where you can hear irish spoken because this reminded him of an idea hed been toying with he folded his paper and set it aside say something in gaelic im eating say something for me maggie in the old tongue she made a little sound of impatience but obliged him it was musical exotic and as foreign to him as greek what did you say that youve a pleasing face to see of a morning she smiled you see its a language as useful for flattery as it is for cursing now say something to me in french he did more than speak he leaned over touched his lips softly to hers then murmured me reveiller a cote de toi cest le plus beau de tons les reves her heart did a long slow swirl in her chest what does it mean that waking beside you is more lovely than any dream she lowered her eyes well it seems french is a tongue more given to pretty sounds than plain english her quick unplanned feminine reaction both amused and allured ive touched you i should have tried french before dont be foolish but he had touched her deeply she combated the uneasy weakness by attacking her meal what am i eating eggs benedict its good she said with her mouth full a bit on the rich side but good what are we after doing today rogan youre still blushing maggie im not she met his eyes narrowly in a dare id like to know what the plans are im assuming this time youll discuss them with me first instead of just tugging me along like an idiot dog im growing very fond of that wasp you call a tongue he said pleasantly im probably losing my mind and before you sting me again i thought youd enjoy seeing some of the city youd no doubt enjoy the louvre so ive left the morning quite clear for sightseeing or shopping or whatever youd like then well go by the gallery later this afternoon the notion of strolling through the great museum pleased her she topped off rogans coffee then heated up her own cup of tea id like to wander about i suppose as for shopping ill want to find something to take back for brie you should have something for maggie as well maggie doesnt need anything besides i cant afford it thats absurd youve no need to deny yourself a present or two youve earned it ive spent what ive earned she grimaced over her cup do they have the nerve to call this tea what do you mean youve spent it he set down his fork only a month ago i gave you a check in the six figures you can hardly have frittered that away frittered she gestured dangerously with her knife do i look like a fritterer good god no and whats that supposed to mean that i havent the taste or style to spend my money well he held up a hand for peace it means nothing more than no but if youve wasted the money i gave you id like to know how i wasted nothing as if it were your business to begin with you are my business if you cant manage your money ill do it for you youll not why you pompous pennypinching ass tis mine isnt it and its gone or most of it so youll just have to see that you sell my work and get me more thats precisely what ill do now where did it go away infuriated embarrassed she shoved back from the table ive expenses dont i i needed supplies and i was foolish enough to buy a dress he folded his hands you spent in a months time nearly two hundred thousand pounds on supplies and a dress i had a debt to pay she raged at him and why should i have to explain to you it says nothing of how i spend my money in your bloody contract the contract has nothing to do with it he said patiently because he could see it wasnt anger so much as mortification that was driving her im asking you where the money went but youre certainly under no legal obligation to tell me his reasonable tone only pinched harder at her humiliation i bought my mother a house though shell never thank me for it and i had to furnish it for her didnt i shed have taken every stick and cushion from brianna otherwise frustrated she dragged both hands through her hair and sent it into fiery tufts and i had to hire lottie and see they had a car and shell have to be paid every week so i gave brie enough for six months in salary and for food and such then there was the lien though brie will be furious when she finds ive paid it off but it was mine to pay as da took it out for me so its done i kept my word to him and i wont have you telling me what i should or shouldnt do with my own money shed stormed around the room while she spoke and came to a halt now by the table where rogan continued to sit silently patiently if i might summarize he said you bought a house for your mother furnished it purchased a car and hired a companion for her youve paid off a lien which will displease your sister but which you felt was your responsibility youve given brianna enough to keep your mother for six months bought supplies and with what was left you bought yourself a dress thats right thats what i said what of it she stood there trembling with fury her eyes sharp and bright and eager for battle he could he mused tell her he admired her incredible generosity her loyalty to her family but he doubted that shed appreciate the effort that explains it he picked up his coffee again ill see that you get an advance she wasnt at all sure she could speak when she did her voice came out in a dangerous hiss i dont want your bloody advance i dont want it ill earn my own keep which youre doing and quite well its not charity maggie or even a loan its a simple business transaction be damned to your business her face was pink with embarrassment now ill not take a penny until ive earned it ive just gotten myself out of debt i wont go into it again god youre stubborn he tapped his fingers on the table as he thought her reaction through trying to understand her display of passion if it was pride she needed so badly he could help her keep it very well well do this another way entirely weve had several offers on your surrender which ive turned down turned down mmm the last i believe was thirty thousand pounds the word erupted from her i was offered thirty thousand pounds for it and you turned it down are you mad it may seem like little or nothing to you rogan sweeney but i could live handsomely on that amount for more than a year if this is how you manage be quiet and because he said it so casually so absently she did just that i refused the offer because i intended to buy the piece myself after wed toured it ill simply buy it now and it will continue on the tour as part of my collection well make it thirtyfive thousand he tossed off the amount as though it was loose change casually dropped on a bureau something inside her was trembling like the heart of a frightened bird why i cant ethically purchase it for myself at the same amount offered by a client no i mean why do you want it he stopped his mental calculations and looked up at her because its beautiful work intimate work and because whenever i look at it i remember making love with you the first time you didnt want to sell it did you think i couldnt see that in your face the day you showed it to me did you really think i couldnt understand how much it hurt you to give it up unable to speak she simply shook her head and turned away it was mine maggie even before you finished it as much i think as it was yours and itll go to no one else i never intended it to go to anyone else still silent she walked to the window i dont want you to pay me for it dont be absurd i dont want your money she said quickly while she could youre right that piece was terribly special to me and id be grateful if youd accept it she let out a long breath staring hard through the glass id be pleased to know it was yours ours he said in a tone that drew her gaze back to his like a magnet as it was meant to be ours then she sighed how can i stay angry with you she said quietly how can i fight what you do to me you cant she was afraid he was right about that but she could at least take a stand on a smaller matter im grateful to you for offering an advance but i dont want it its important to me to take only what i make when i make it ive enough left to get by i want no more than that for now what needed to be done is done from this point on what comes will be mine its only money maggie so easy to say when youve more than youve ever needed the edge in her voice so much like her mothers stopped her cold she took a deep breath and let out what was in her own heart money was like an open wound in my house the lack of it my fathers skill for losing it and my mothers constant nagging for more i dont want to depend on pounds for my happiness rogan and it frightens and shames me that i might so he thought studying her this was why shed fought him every step of the way didnt you tell me once that you didnt pick up your pipe each day thinking about the profit on the other end of it yes but do you think of it now no rogan youre arguing against shadows maggie he rose to cross to her the woman you are has already decided that the future will be very different from the past i cant go back she murmured even if i wanted to i couldnt go back no you cant youll always be one to go forward he kissed her softly on the brow will you get dressed now maggie let me give you paris he did for nearly a week he gave her everything the city had to offer from the magnificence of notre dame to the intimacy of dim cafes he bought her flowers from the tightlipped street vendor every morning until the suite smelled like a garden they strolled along the seine in the moonlight maggie with her shoes in her hand and the rivers breeze on her cheeks they danced in clubs to poorly played american music and dined on glorious food and wine at maxims she watched him pore over the sidewalk art searching always for another diamond in the rough and though he winced when she bought an undoubtedly bad painting of the eiffel tower she only laughed and told him art was in the soul not always in the execution the hours she spent in the paris gallery were just as exciting to her while rogan ordered directed and arranged she saw her work shine under his vigilant eye a vested interest hed said she couldnt deny that he tended his interests well he was as passionate and attentive to her art during those afternoons as he was to her body during the nights when it was done and the last piece was set to shine under the lights she thought that the show was every bit as much a result of his efforts as of her own but partnership didnt always equal harmony damn it maggie if you keep fussing in there well be late for the third time in as many minutes rogan knocked on the bedroom door shed locked and if you keep bothering me well be later still she called out go away better yet go on to the gallery yourself i can get myself there when im ready you cant be trusted he muttered but her ears were sharp i dont need a keeper rogan sweeney she was breathless from struggling to reach the low zipper of her dress ive never seen a man so ruled by the hands of a clock and ive never seen a woman more careless of time would you unlock this door its infuriating to have to shout through it all right all right by nearly dislocating her arm she managed to fasten the dress she wriggled her feet into ridiculously high bronze heels cursed herself for being fool enough to take josephs advice then twisted the lock i wouldnt have taken so long if they made womens clothes with the same consideration they make mens your zippers are within easy reach she stopped tugged once on the short hem of the dress well is it all right or not he said nothing at all only twirled his finger to indicate he wanted her to circle rolling her eyes to heaven she complied the dress was strapless nearly backless with a skirt that halted teasingly at midthigh it glittered bronze copper gold sparking fire at every breath her hair echoed the tone so that she seemed like a candle flame slim and bright maggie you take my breath away the seamstress wasnt generous with material i admire her parsimony when he continued to stare she lifted her brows you said we were in a hurry ive changed my mind her brows lifted higher as he started toward her im warning you if you get me out of this dress itll be your responsibility to get me back in as attractive as that sounds itll have to wait ive a present for you and it seems that the fates guided my hand i believe this will complement your dress nicely he reached into the inside pocket of his tux and took out a slim velvet box youve already bought me a present that huge bottle of scent that was for me he leaned over to sniff her bare shoulder the smoky perfume might have been created with her in mind very much for me this is for you well since its too small to be another answering machine ill take it but when she opened the box the chuckle died in her throat rubies square flames of them simmered with whitehot diamonds in a threetiered choker tied together by twists of glinting gold no delicate bauble but a bold flash a lightning flash of color arid heat and gleam something to remember paris by rogan told her as he slipped it from the box the necklace ran like blood and water through his fingers its diamonds rogan i cant wear diamonds of course you can he brought it to her throat his eyes on hers as he fastened the clasp not alone perhaps theyd be cold and wouldnt suit you but with the other stones he stepped back to take in the effect yes exactly right you look like a pagan goddess she couldnt stop her hand from reaching up from running across the gems they felt warm against her skin i dont know what to say to you say thank you rogan its lovely thank you rogan her smile bloomed and spread its a great deal more than lovely its dazzling and so are you he leaned into the kiss then patted her bottom now get a move on or well be late wheres your wrap i havent got one typical he murmured and pulled her out the door maggie thought she handled her second showing with a great deal more panache than she had the first her stomach wasnt nearly as jittery her temper not nearly as short if she did once or twice think wistfully of escape she covered it well and if she pined for something she couldnt have she reminded herself that success sometimes had to be enough in itself maggie she turned from the heavily accented ramblings of a frenchman whose eyes had rarely left her cleavage and stared dumbstruck at her sister brianna it certainly is smiling brianna gathered her astonished sister in an embrace i would have been here an hour ago but there was a delay at the airport but how how are you here at all rogan sent his plane for me rogan baffled maggie scanned the room until she found him he only smiled at her then at brianna before returning his attention to an enormous woman in fuchsia lace maggie nudged her sister to a corner of the room you came on rogans plane i thought i would have to let you down again maggie more than a little overwhelmed by the sight of maggies work glittering in a roomful of exotic strangers brianna slipped her hand into her sisters i was trying to think of how to manage it mothers fine with lottie of course and i knew i could leave con with murphy i even asked mrs mcgee if shed look after blackthorn for a day or two but then there was the how to get here you wanted to come maggie said softly you wanted to of course i did i wanted nothing more than to be with you but i never imagined it would be like this brie stared at the whitecoated waiter who offered her champagne from his silver tray thank you i didnt think it mattered to you to clear the emotion from her throat maggie drank deeply i was just now standing here thinking i wished it mattered to you im proud of you maggie so proud ive told you i didnt believe you oh god she felt the tears well up and blinked them furiously away you should be ashamed of yourself thinking so little of my feelings brie scolded you never showed any interest maggie fired back i showed all the interest i could i dont understand what you do but that doesnt mean it doesnt make me proud that you do it coolly brianna tipped back her glass oh she murmured staring at the bubbling wine but thats lovely whod have thought anything could taste like that with a hoot of laughter maggie kissed her sister hard on the mouth jesus save us brie what are we doing here the two of us drinking champagne in paris i for one am going to enjoy it i have to thank rogan do you think i could interrupt him for a moment after youve told me the rest when did you call him i didnt he called me a week ago he called you aye and before i could wish him good morning he was telling me what i would do and how i would do it thats rogan he said hed be sending the plane and that i was to meet his driver at the airport in paris i tried to get a word in but he rolled right over me the driver would take me to the hotel have you ever seen the like of that place maggie its like a palace i nearly swallowed my tongue when i walked in go on then i was to get myself ready and the driver would bring me here which he did though i thought for certain hed kill me along the way and there was this in the hotel room with a note from him telling me it would please him if id wear it she brushed a hand down the misty blue silk of the evening suit she wore i wouldnt have taken it but he put the request in such a way id have felt rude not to hes good at that and you look wonderful in it i feel wonderful in it i confess my heads still spinning from planes and cars and all this all of this she said again staring around the room these people maggie theyre all here for you im glad you are shall i take you around so you can charm them for me theyre charmed already just seeing the two of you rogan stepped beside them and took briannas hand its delightful to see you again im grateful to you for arranging it i cant begin to thank you you just have you dont mind if i introduce you around mr leclair there the rather flamboyantlooking man by maggies momentum hes just confessed to me that hes fallen in love with you he certainly falls easily but ill be pleased to meet him id like to wander about as well ive never seen maggies work shown like this it took only minutes before maggie was able to draw rogan aside again dont tell me i need to circulate she said before he could do just that i have something i need to say to you to monopolize the artist it wont take long for me to tell you that this was the kindest thing anyone has every done for me ill never forget it he ignored the distraction of the rapid french a woman chattered at his shoulder and took maggies hand to his lips i didnt want you unhappy again and it was the simplest thing in the world to arrange for brianna to be here it might have been simple she remembered the ragged artist hed escorted up the elegant steps of the gallery that too had been simple that doesnt make it any less kind and to show you what it means to me ill not only stay through the whole evening until the last guest toddles out the door ill talk to every one of them nicely nicely no matter how often i hear the word visceral thats my girl he kissed the tip of her nose now get to work chapter sixteen if paris had staggered her the south of france with its sweep of beaches and snowcovered mountains left maggie awestruck there was no rattle of traffic here in rogans sparkling villa overlooking the searing blue waters of the mediterranean no crowds bustling toward shops or cafes the people who dotted the beach were no more than part of the painting that encompassed water and sand bobbing boats and an endless cloudless sky the countryside which she could see from one of the many terraces that graced the villa spread out in neat square fields bordered by stone fences like the ones she saw from her own doorway in clare but here the ground rose up in terraced slopes from orchards on sunny embankments to the higher green of the forests and on to the foothills of the magnificent alps rogans grounds were lush with blooms and flowering herbs exotic with olive and box trees and the sparkle of fountains the quiet was disturbed only by the call of gulls and the music of falling water content maggie lounged in one of the padded chaises on a sunwashed terrace and sketched i thought id find you here rogan stepped out and dropped a kiss both casual and intimate on the top of her head its impossible to stay inside on such a day she squinted up at him until he took the shaded glasses shed tossed on a table and slipped them on her nose did you finish your business for now he sat beside her shifting so as not to block her view im sorry ive been so long one call seemed to lead to another no matter i like being on my own ive noticed he peeked into the sketchbook a seascape its irresistible and i thought id draw some of the scenery so brie could see it she had such a wonderful time in paris im sorry she could only stay one day one lovely day its hard to believe i strolled along the left bank with my sister the concannon sisters in paris it still made her laugh to think of itshell not forget it rogan tucking her pencil behind her ear maggie took his hand neither will i youve thanked me both of you and the truth is i did nothing more than make a few calls speaking of calls one that kept me away just now was from paris reaching over rogan selected a sugared grape from the basket of fruit beside them youve an offer maggie from the comte de lorraine de lorraine lips pursed she searched her memory ah the skinny old man with a cane who talked in whispers yes rogan was amused to hear her describe one of the wealthiest men in france as a skinny old man hed like to commission you to make a gift for his granddaughters wedding this december her hackles rose instinctively ill take no commissions rogan i made that clear from the start you did yes rogan took another grape and popped it into maggies mouth to keep her quiet but its my obligation to inform you of any requests im not suggesting you agree though it would be quite an impressive feather in your and worldwides cap im simply fulfilling my duties as your manager eyeing him maggie swallowed the grape his tone she noted was as sugarcoated as the fruit ill not do it your choice naturally he waved the entire matter away shall i ring for something cold lem onade perhaps or iced tea no maggie took the pencil from behind her ear tapped it on her pad im not interested in madetoorder and why should you be he responded all reason your paris showing was every bit as successful as the one in dublin i have every confidence that this will continue in rome and beyond youre well on your way margaret mary he leaned down and kissed her not that the comtes request has anything to do with madetoorder hes quite willing to leave it completely in your hands cautious maggie tipped down her glasses and studied him over the tip youre trying to sweettalk me into it hardly but of course he was i should add however that the comte a very wellrespected art connoisseur by the way is willing to pay hand somely im not interested she shoved her glasses in place again then swore how much is handsome up to the equivalent of fifty thousand pounds but i know how adamant you are about the money angle so you neednt give it a thought i told him it was unlikely youd be interested would you like to go down to the beach take a drive before he could rise maggie snagged his collar oh youre a sneaky one arent you sweeney when needs be it would be whatever i choose to make whatever came to me it would he traced a finger over her bare shoulder which was beginning to turn the color of a peach in the sun except ah here we are blue rogan said and grinned he wants blue blue is it the laugh began to shake her any particular shade the same as his granddaughters eyes he claims they are as blue as the summer sky it seems shes his favorite and after he saw your work in paris nothing would do but that she have something made for her alone from your lovely hands his words or yours a bit of both rogan answered kissing one of those lovely hands ill think about it id hoped you would no longer concerned with blocking her view he leaned over to nibble at her lips but think about it later will you excusezmoi monsieur a blandfaced servant stood on the edge of the terrace his hands at his sides and his eyes discreetly aimed toward the sea oui henri vous et mademoiselle voudriezvous dejeuner sur la terrasse maintenant non nous allons dejeuner plus tard tres bien monsieur henri faded away silent as a shadow into the house and what was that about maggie asked he wanted to know if we wanted lunch i said wed eat later when rogan started to lean down again maggie stopped him with a hand slapped to his chest problem rogan murmured i can call him back and tell him were ready after all no i dont want you to call him it made her uneasy to think of henri or any of the other servants lurking in a corner waiting to serve she wriggled off the chaise dont you ever want to be alone we are alone thats exactly why i wanted to bring you here alone you must have six people puttering around the house gardeners and cooks maids and butlers if i were to snap my fingers right now one of them would come running which is exactly the purpose in having servants well i dont want them do you know one of those little maids wanted to wash out my underwear thats because its her job to tend to you not because she wanted to riffle your drawers i can tend to myself rogan i want you to send them away all of them he rose at that you want me to fire the help no for pity sakes im not a monster tossing innocent people out on the street i want you to send them off thats all on a holiday or whatever youd call it i can certainly give the staff a day off if youd like not a day the week she blew out a breath seeing his puzzlement it doesnt make any sense to you and why should it youre so used to them you dont even see them his name was henri the cook is jacques the maid who so cheekily offered to wash your lingerie is marie or possibly he thought monique i wasnt after starting a quarrel she came forward her hands reaching for his i cant relax as you do with all these people hovering about im just not used to it i dont think i want to be do this for me please rogan give them a few days off wait here a moment when he left she stood on the terrace feeling foolish here she was she mused lounging in a mediterranean villa with anything she could ask for within her reach and she still wasnt satisfied shed changed she realized in the few short months since she met rogan she had changed she not only wished for more now she coveted more of what she didnt have she wanted the ease and the pleasure money could bring and not just for her family she wanted it for herself shed worn diamonds and had danced in paris and she wanted to do so again yet deep within her there remained that small hot need to be only herself to need nothing and no one if she lost that maggie thought with a whip of panic she would have lost everything she snatched up her sketch pad flipped pages but for a moment a terrifying moment her mind was as blank as the sheet in front of her then she began to draw frantically with a violent intensity that burst from her like a gale it was herself she drew the two parts twisted together pulled apart and so desperately trying to meet again but how could they when one was so completely opposed to the other art for arts sake solitude for sanity independence for pride and on the other side ambition hungers and needs she stared at the completed sketch dumbfounded that it had poured out of her so swiftly and now that it had she was oddly calm perhaps it was those two opposing forces that made her what she was and perhaps if she were ever really at peace shed be less than she could be theyve gone her mind still drifting she looked blankly up at rogan what whos gone on a half laugh he shook his head the staff thats what you wanted isnt it the staff oh her mind cleared settled youve sent them off all of them i did though god alone knows how well eat over the next few days still he broke off when she leaped into his arms as shed shot at him like a bullet from a gun he staggered back overbalancing to keep them from crashing through the beveledglass door behind him and nearly tumbling them over the railing youre a wonderful man rogan a prince of a man he shifted her in his arms and looked wearily at the drop over the rail i was nearly a dead man were alone completely we are and ive earned the undying gratitude of everyone from the butler down the parlor maid wept with joy as he supposed she should with the holiday bonus hed given her and the rest of the servants so now theyre off to the beach or to the country or to wherever their hearts lead them and weve the house to ourselves she kissed him hard and were about to use every inch of it well start with that sofa in the room just through there will we amused he made no protest as she began unbuttoning his shirt youre full of demands today margaret mary the business with the servants was a request the sofas a demand he cocked a brow the chaise is closer so it is she laughed as he lowered her to it so it is over the next few days they sunned on the terrace walked on the beach or swam lazy laps in the lagoonlike pool to the music of the fountains there were illprepared meals to be eaten in the kitchen and afternoon drives through the countryside there were also to maggies mind entirely too many telephones it might have been a holiday but rogan was never farther than a phone or a fax away from business there was something about a factory in limerick something else about an auction in new york and unintelligible mutters about property he was looking for in order to add another branch to worldwide galleries it might have annoyed her if she hadnt begun to see that his work was as much a part of his identity as her work was to hers all differences aside she could hardly complain about him spending an hour or two closeted in his office when he took her absorption in her sketches in stride if she had believed in a man and woman finding the kind of harmony that was needed to last a lifetime she might have believed shed found it with rogan let me see what youve done with a contented yawn maggie offered him her sketchbook the sun was setting drowning colors sweeping the western sky between them the bottle of wine hed chosen from his cellar nestled in a silver bucket frosty with ice maggie lifted her glass sipped and settled back to enjoy her last evening in france youll be busy when you get home rogan commented as he studied each sketch how will you choose which one to work on first it will choose me and as much as ive enjoyed being lazy im itching to get back and fire up my furnace i can have the ones youve drawn up for brianna matted and framed for simple pencil sketches theyre quite good i particularly like he trailed off when he turned a page and came across something entirely different from a sketch of the sea or a landscape and what have we here almost too lazy to move she glanced over oh yes that i dont do portraits often but that one was irresistible it was himself stretched over the bed his arm flung out as if hed been reaching for something for her taken by surprise and not entirely pleased he frowned down at the sketch you drew this while i was asleep well i didnt want to wake you and spoil the moment she hid her grin in her glass you were sleeping so sweetly perhaps youd like to hang that one in your dublin gallery im naked nude is the word ill remind you when its art and you look very artistic nude rogan ive signed it you see so you may get a nice price for it i think not she tucked her tongue in her cheek as my manager its your duty to market my work youre always saying so yourself and this if i do say so is one of my finest drawings youll note the light and the way it plays on the muscles of your i see he said in a strangled voice and so would everyone else no need to be modest youve a fine form i think i captured it even better in this other one his blood quite simply ran cold other one aye lets see now she reached over to flip pages herself here we are shows a bit more contrast when youre standing i think and a bit of that arrogance comes through as well words failed him shed drawn him standing on the terrace one arm resting on the rail behind him the other cupping a brandy snifter and a smile a particularly smug smile on his face it was all he was wearing i never posed for this and ive never stood naked on the terrace drinking brandy artistic license she said airly delighted that shed flummoxed him so completely i know your body well enough to draw it from memory it would have spoiled the theme to bother with clothes the theme which is master of the house i thought thats what id title it both of them actually you might offer them as a set i wont be selling them and why not id like to know youve sold several of my other drawings that arent nearly as well done those i didnt want you to sell but id signed on the dotted line so you did i want you to market these her eyes danced in fact i insist as i believe is my right contractually speaking ill buy them myself then whats your offer my dealer tells me my price is rising youre blackmailing me maggie oh aye she toasted him then sipped more wine youll have to meet my price he glanced at the sketch again before firmly closing the book which is lets see now i think if i was taken upstairs and made love to until moonrise we might have a deal youve a shrewd business sense ive learned it from a master she started to stand but he shook his head and scooped her into his arms i want no slipping through loopholes on this deal i believe your terms were that you be taken upstairs right you are i suppose thats why i need a manager she wound a lock of his hair around her fingers as he carried her into the house you know of course if im not satisfied with the rest of the terms the deals off youll be satisfied at the top of the stairs he stopped to kiss her her response was as always fast and urgent and as always it quickened his blood he stepped into the bedroom where the softened light of sunset swam through the windows soon the light would go gray with dusk their last night alone would not be spent in the dark thinking this he laid her on the bed and when she reached for him he slipped away to light candles they were scattered through the room some stubs some slim tapers all burned down to varying lengths maggie knelt on the bed while rogan struck the flames and sent the light dancing gold romance she smiled and felt oddly touched it seems a spot of blackmails been well worth the effort he paused a flaring match between his fingers have i given you so little romance maggie i was only joking she tossed back her breezeruffled hair his voice had been much too serious ive no need for romance honest lust is quite good enough for me is that what we have thoughtfully he set the match to the wick then shook it out lust laughing she held out her arms if youd stop wandering about the room and come over here ill show you exactly what we have she looked dazzling in the candle glow with the last colors of day bleeding through the windows beside the bed her hair afire her skin kissed by her days in the sun and her eyes aware mocking and unquestionably inviting on other days and other nights he would have dived into that invitation accepted it reveled in it and the firestorm they could make between them but his mood had shifted he crossed slowly to her taking her hands before they could tug him eagerly into the bed with her lifting them to his lips as his eyes watched her that wasnt the bargain margaret mary i was to make love to you its time i did he kept her hands in his drawing her arms down to her sides as he leaned forward to toy with her lips its time you let me what foolishness is that her voice wasnt steady he was kissing her as he had once before slowly gently and with the utmost concentration ive done more than let you a great many times before not like this he felt her hands flex against his her body draw back are you so afraid of tenderness maggie of course im not she couldnt get her breath yet she could hear it feel it coming slow and heavy through her lips her whole body was tingling yet he was barely touching her something was slipping away from her rogan i dont want to to be seduced he took his lips from hers let them roam leisurely over her face no i dont but her head tilted back as he skimmed his mouth down her throat youre about to be he released her hands then to draw her closer no fevered embrace this time but an inescapable possession her arms seemed impossibly heavy as she wound them round his neck she could do no more than cling as he stroked her hair her face with gentle fingertips that felt no more substantial than a whisper on the air his mouth came back to hers in a moist deep sumptuous kiss that went on endlessly endlessly until she was as pliant as wax in his arms hed cheated both of them rogan realized as he laid her back on the bed by letting only the fire take them hed kept them both from experiencing all the warm waiting wells of tenderness tonight it would be different tonight he would take her through a labyrinth of dreams before the flames the taste of him seeped into her stunning her staggering her with tenderness the greed that had always been so much a part of their lovemaking had mellowed into a lazy patience she could neither resist nor refuse long before he opened her blouse and skimmed those smooth clever fingertips over her skin she was floating limply her hands slid from his shoulders her breath caught and expelled as he laved his tongue over her seeking small secret tastes lingering over them savoring drifting on that slow sweep of sensation she was aware of every pulse point he awakened of the long quiet pull from deep inside her so different from an explosion so much more devastating she murmured his name when he cupped a hand under her head and lifted her melting body to his youre mine maggie no one else will ever take you here she should have objected to this new demand for exclusivity but she couldnt for his mouth was journeying over her again as if he had years decades to complete the exploration the candlelight flickered dreamily against her heavy lids she could smell the flowers shed picked only that morning and had placed in a blue vase by the window she heard the breeze heralding the mediterranean night with the scents of blossoms and water in its wake beneath his fingers and lips her skin softened and her muscles quivered how could he not have known hed wanted her like this all the fires banked only glowing embers and drifting smoke she moved under his hands helplessly unable to do anything but absorb what he gave her follow where he led even as the blood pounded in his head in his loins he kept the caresses light teasing waiting for her watching her slide from one into the next melting sensation when she trembled when a new sighing moan slipped through her lips he took her hands again braceleting them in one of his so that he was free to urge her over the first edge her body bowed her lashes fluttered he watched as that first velvet fist took her breath then she went fluid again languid and limp her pleasure welled inside of him the sun sank candles guttered he guided her up again a higher peak that made her cry out weakly the sound echoed away into sighs and murmurs when her heart was so full that it too seemed to weep he slipped into her taking her tenderly while the moon rose perhaps she slept she knew she dreamed when she opened her eyes again the moon was up and the room was empty languid as a cat she considered curling up again but even as she nuzzled into the pillow she knew she would not sleep without him she rose floating a little as though her mind was dazed with wine she found a robe a thin swatch of silk that rogan had insisted on giving her it settled smoothly against her skin as she went to find him i should have known youd be here he was in the kitchen standing shirtless in front of the gleaming stove in the brilliant whiteandblack kitchen thinking of your stomach and of yours my girl he turned off the fire under the skillet before he turned eggs what else it was all either of them could competently cook i wont be surprised if were cackling when we get back to ireland tomorrow because she felt unexpectedly awkward she raked a hand through her hair once then twice you should have made me get up and fix it made you he reached up for plates that would be a first what i mean is id have done it after all i dont feel i did my part before before upstairs in bed i didnt exactly do my share a bargains a bargain he scooped eggs into plates and from my point of view you did very well indeed watching you unravel was an incredible pleasure for me one he intended to experience again very soon why dont you sit down and eat the moon be up for some time yet i suppose it will more at ease she joined him at the table and this may just give me my energy back do you know she said with her mouth full id no idea that sex could make you so weak it wasnt just sex her fork paused halfway to her lips at his tone there was hurt beneath the sharp annoyance and she was sorry to have caused it amazed that she could i didnt mean it that way rogan not so impersonally when two people are fond of each other im a great deal more than fond of you maggie im in love with you the fork slipped from her fingers and clattered on the plate panic tore at her throat in sharp hungry fangs youre not i am he said it calmly though he was cursing himself for making his declaration in a brightly lit kitchen over badly cooked eggs and youre in love with me its not im not you cant tell me what i am i can when youre too foolish to say so yourself whats between us is far more than physical attraction if you werent so pigheaded youd stop pretending it was im not pigheaded you are but i find thats one of the things i like about you he was thinking coolly now pleased to be back in control we might have discussed all this under more atmospheric circumstances but knowing you it hardly matters im in love with you and i want you to marry me chapter seventeen marriage the word stuck in her throat threatened to choke her she didnt dare repeat it youre out of your mind believe me ive considered the possibility he picked up his fork and ate with the appearance of sanity but the hurt unexpected and raw scraped at him youre stubborn often rude more than occasionally selfabsorbed and not a little temperamental for a moment her mouth worked like a guppys oh am i you most certainly are and a man would have to have taken leave of his senses to want that sort of baggage for a lifetime but he poured out the tea hed had steeping there you are i believe its customary to use the brides church so well be married in clare customary hang your customs rogan and you with them was this panic she felt skidding along her spine like jagged ice surely not she told herself it had to be temper she had nothing to fear im not marrying you or anyone ever thats absurd of course youll marry me were amazingly well suited maggie a moment ago i was stubborn and temperamental and rude so you are and it suits me he took her hand ignored her resistance and tugged it to his lips and it suits me beautifully well it doesnt suit me not at all perhaps ive softened toward your arrogance rogan but thats changing by the second understand me she yanked her hand free of his ill be no mans wife no mans but mine she hissed out a curse when he only grinned at that she took a hard grip on her temper a fight she thought might be satisfying but it would solve nothing you brought me here for this didnt you no actually i didnt id thought to take more time before tossing my feelings at your feet very carefully very deliberately he shifted his plate aside knowing very well youd kick them back at me his eyes stayed on hers level patient you see i know you very well margaret mary you dont temper and the panic she didnt want to admit leaked out of her leaving room for sorrow ive reasons for keeping my heart whole rogan and for not ever considering the possibility of marriage it interested and soothed him to understand that it wasnt marriage to him that seemed to appall her but marriage itself what are they she lowered her gaze to her cup after a moments hesitation she added her usual three cubes of sugar and stirred you lost your parents yes his brow furrowed this certainly wasnt the tack hed expected her to take almost ten years ago its hard losing family it strips away a whole layer of security exposes you to the simple cold fact of mortality you loved them very much maggie no id like to hear what you have to say about this its important they loved you yes they did how did you know it she drank now holding the cup in two hands was it because they gave you a good life a fine home it had nothing to do with material comfort i knew they loved me because i felt it because they showed it and i could see they loved each other as well there was love in your house and laughter was there laughter rogan quite a bit of it he could remember it still i was devastated when they died so sudden so brutally sudden his voice tapered off then strengthened again but after when the worst of it had passed i was glad theyd gone together each of them would have been only halfalive without the other youve no notice how lucky you are what a gift you were given growing up in a loving happy home ive never known that i never will there was no love between my parents there was anger and blame and guilt and there was duty but no love can you imagine what it was like growing up in a house where the two people who had made you cared nothing for each other were only there because their marriage was a prison barring them in with conscience and church law no i cant he covered her hand with his im sorry you can i swore when i was still a girl i swore id never be locked in a prison like that marriage isnt only a prison maggie he said gently my own parents was a joy and you may make one for yourself one day but not i you make what you know rogan and you cant change what youve come from my mother hates me he would have protested but shed said it so matteroffactly so simply he could not even before i was born she hated me the fact that i grew inside her ruined her life which she tells me as often as possible all these years i never knew how deep it truly went until your grandmother told me my mother had had a career a career he cast his mind back the singing what does that have to do with you everything what choice did she have but to give up her career what career would she have had left as a single pregnant woman in a country like ours none cold she shivered and let out a shaky breath it hurt to say it aloud this way to say it all aloud she wanted something for herself i understand that rogan i know what it is to have ambitions and i can imagine all too well what it would be like to have them dashed you see they never would have married if i hadnt been conceived a moment of passion of need that was all my father more than forty and she past thirty she dreaming i suppose of romance and he seeing a lovely woman she was lovely then there are pictures she was lovely before the bitterness ate it all away and i was the seed of it me sevenmonth baby that humiliated her and ruined her dreams and his too aye and his you can hardly blame yourself for being born maggie oh i know that dont you think i know up here suddenly fierce she tapped her head but in my heart cant you see i know that my very existence and every breath i take burdened the lives of two people beyond measure i came from passion only and every time she looked at me it reminded her that shed sinned thats not only ridiculous its foolish perhaps it is my father said hed loved her once and perhaps it was true she could imagine him walking into omalleys seeing maeve hearing her and letting his romantic heart take flight but it had crashed soon enough for both of them i was twelve when she told me that i hadnt been conceived within marriage thats how she puts it perhaps shed begun to see that i was making that slow shift from girl to woman id begun to look at boys you see had practiced my flirting on murphy and one or two others from the village she caught me at it standing by the hay barn with murphy trying out a kiss just a kiss that was all beside the hay on a warm summer afternoon both of us young and curious it was my first kiss and it was lovely soft and shy and harmless and she found us when maggie shut her eyes the scene played back vividly she went white bone white and screamed and raged dragged me into the house i was wicked she said and sinful and because my father wasnt home to stop her she whipped me whipped you shock had him rising out of his chair are you telling me she hit you because youd kissed a boy she beat me maggie said flatly it was more than the back of her hand that id been used to she took a belt and laid into me until i thought shed kill me while she did she shouted scripture and raged about the branding of sin she had no right to treat you so he knelt in front of her cupped her face in his hands no no one has such a right but it doesnt stop them i could see the hate in her then and the fear too the fear i came to understand was that i would end up as she had with a baby in my belly and emptiness in my heart id known always that she didnt love me as mothers were meant to love their children id known that she was easier a bit softer on brie but until that day i hadnt known why she couldnt sit any longer rising she went to the door that led out to a little stone patio decked with clay pots filled with brilliant geraniums theres no need for you to talk about this anymore rogan said from behind her ill finish the sky was studded with stars the breeze a gentle whisper through the trees she told me that i was marked and she beat me so that the mark would be on the outside as well so that i would understand what a burden a woman bears because its she who carries the child thats vile maggie unable to clamp down on his own emotions he whirled her around his hands hard on her shoulders his eyes icy blue and furious you were just a girl if i was i stopped being one that day because i understood rogan that she meant exactly what she said it was a lie a pitiful one not to her to her it was sterling truth she told me i was her penance that god had punished her for her night of sin with me she believed that fully and every time she looked at me she was reminded of it that even the pain and misery of birthing me wasnt enough because of me she was trapped in a marriage she despised bound to a man she couldnt love and mother to a child shed never wanted and as ive found out just recently the ruin of everything she really wanted perhaps the ruin of everything she was shes the one who should have been whipped no one has the right to abuse a child so and worse to use some warped vision of god as the strap funny my father said nearly the same thing when he came home and saw what shed done i thought he would strike her its the only time in my life id ever seen him close to violence they had a horrible fight it was almost worse than the beating to listen to it i went up to the bedroom to get away from the worst of it and brie came in with salve she tended to me like a little mother talking nonsense all the while the shouts and curses boomed up the stairs her hands were shaking she didnt object when rogan drew her into his arms but her eyes remained dry her voice calm i thought he would go then they said such vicious things to each other i thought no two people could live under the same roof after i thought if hed just take us with him if brie and i could just go with him anywhere at all it would be all right again then i heard him say that he was paying too that he was paying for ever having believed that he loved and wanted her that hed go to his grave paying of course he didnt go maggie pulled away again stepped back he stayed more than ten years longer and she never touched me again not in any way but neither of us forgot that day i think neither of us wanted to he tried to make up for it by giving me more loving me more but he couldnt if hed left her if he taken us and left her it would have changed things but that he couldnt do so we lived in that house like sinners in hell and i knew no matter how he loved me that there were times he must have thought if it hadnt been if i hadnt been hed have been free do you honestly blame the child maggie the sins of the fathers she shook her head one of my mothers favorite expressions that no rogan i dont blame the child but it doesnt change the results she took a deep breath she was better for having said it all ill never risk locking myself in that prison youre too smart a woman to believe what happened to your parents happens to everyone not to everyone no one day now that shes not hobbled by my mothers demands brie will marry shes a woman who wants family and you dont i dont she said but the words sounded hollow ive my work and a need to be alone he caught her chin in his hand youre afraid if i am ive a right to be she shook free of him what kind of wife or mother would i make with what ive come from yet youve just said your sister will be both it affected her differently than it did me she has as much need for people and for a home as i have to do without them you were right enough when you said i was stubborn and rude and selfabsorbed i am maybe youve had to be but thats not all you are maggie youre compassionate and loyal and loving its not just part of you i fell in love with but the whole i want to spend my life with you something trembled inside her fragile as crystal struck by a careless hand havent you listened to a word ive said every word now i know that you dont just love me you need me she dragged both hands through her hair fingers digging in and pulling in frustration i dont need anyone of course you do youre afraid to admit it but thats understandable he was sorry bitterly for the child shed been but he couldnt allow that to change his plans for the woman youve locked yourself in a prison maggie once you admit those needs the door will open im happy with the way things are why do you have to change them because i want more than a few days a month with you i want a life with you children with you he skimmed a hand over her hair to cup the back of her neck because youre the first and only woman ive ever loved i wont lose you maggie and i wont let you lose me ive given you all i can give rogan her voice was shaky but she held her ground its more than ive given anyone else be content with what im able to give for if you cant ill have to end it can you ill have to his hand squeezed once at the base of her neck then released and fell away stubborn he said with a trace of amusement to hide the ache well so am i i can wait for you to come to me no dont tell me you wont he went on as she opened her mouth to protest it will only make it more difficult on you when you do well leave things as they are maggie with one alteration the relief shed felt shifted into wariness which is i love you he pulled her into his arms covered her mouth with his youll have to get used to hearing it she was glad to be home at home she could savor the solitude enjoy her own company and the long long days where the light clung to the sky until ten at home she didnt have to think of anything but work to prove it she gave herself three days in her glass house three days without interruption she was productive pleased with the results she saw cooling in the annealing oven and she was for the first time in her memory lonely that was on his head she thought as she watched the twilight grow and deepen and slip beautifully toward night hed tricked her into enjoying his company into enjoying the whirl of cities and people hed made her want too much she wanted him too much marriage the thought made her shudder as she gathered what she wanted from the kitchen table that at least he could never make her want she was certain given a little time he would see it her way if not she stepped outside shut the door it was best not to think about any ifnots rogan was above all a sensible man she took the walk to briannas slowly as night settled around her a slow mist gathered at her feet and a breeze holding a warning chill whispered through the trees like a welcoming beacon the light in briannas kitchen glowed against the night maggie shifted the sketches shed framed and quickened her steps as she approached a low growl sounded out of the shadows of the sycamore maggie called out softly and was answered by a happy bark con leaped out of the shadows through the mist and would have jumped on her to show his love and devotion had she not held out a hand to stop him id rather not be knocked over thank you she rubbed his head his neck while his swinging tail tore the thin fog like rags guarding your princess tonight are you well lets go in and find her the moment maggie opened the kitchen door con shot through in a blur of fur and muscle he paused across the room at the door that led into the hallway tail thumping out there is she maggie set the sketches aside and walked to the door she heard voices through it a soft laugh a british accent she has guests she said to con and disappointed the dog thoroughly when she backed away from the door we wont disturb her so youre stuck with me to make the prospect a bit more hopeful she went to the cupboard where brianna kept cons biscuits well what trick will you do for me boyo con eyed the biscuit she was holding smacked his lip with restrained dignity he padded to maggie sat and lifted a paw well done lad once he had the treat between his teeth con pranced to the rug in front of the kitchen hearth circled three times then settled down with a sigh to enjoy himself i could do with something myself a quick snoop around the kitchen revealed a treasure a square of gingerbread halfgone rested under a protecting cloth maggie ate one slice while the kettle was heating and sat down to another with a homey pot of tea when brianna came in maggie was scraping crumbs from the plate i wondered when youd come by brianna reached down to pet the dog whod risen to press himself against her legs it would have been sooner if id known this was waiting youve guests i see yes a couple from london a student from derry and two sweet ladies down from edinburgh how did you enjoy your holiday it was a beautiful place hot sunny days warm nights i drew you some pictures so youd see for yourself she gestured to them brie lifted the pictures and her face lit up with joy oh theyre wonderful i thought youd like them more than a postcard i do thank you maggie ive some clippings about your show in paris maggie was surprised oh how did you get them i asked rogan to send them to me would you like to see not now no theyll just give me a nervous stomach and my works going too well will you be going to rome when the show moves on i dont know i havent thought about it all that part of it seems a long way from here like a dream brianna sighed as she sat down i can hardly believe i was in paris you could travel more now if youd like mmm perhaps there were places shed like to see but home held her alice quinn had a boy david theyre calling him he was christened just yesterday he wailed all through the service and alice probably fluttered around like a bird no she held little david and soothed him then took him off to nurse marriage and motherhood have changed her you wouldnt think it was the same alice marriage always changes people often for the better but brianna knew what maggie was thinking mothers getting along well i didnt ask no brianna said evenly but im telling you lotties badgered her into sitting out in the garden every day and into taking walks walking despite herself maggies interest was snagged mother walking i dont know how she does it but lottie has a way with her the last time i visited mother was holding yarn while lottie balled it when i came in she tossed it down and began to rant about how the woman would drive her into the grave claimed she fired lottie twice but lottie wouldnt go all the while mother complained lottie rocked in her chair smiling and rolling her yarn if the woman drives lottie away no let me finish brianna leaned forward her eyes dancing i stood there making excuses and apologies and waiting for the worst and after a while lottie stopped rocking maeve she said stop pestering the girl you sound like a magpie and she handed the yarn back to her and told me how she was after teaching mothing to knit teaching her to oh thatll be the day the thing was mother kept muttering under her breath and arguing with lottie but she seemed to be enjoying it you were right about her having her own place maggie she may not realize it yet but shes happier there than shes been most of her life the point is shes out of here restless maggie rose to prowl around the kitchen i dont want you deluding yourself into thinking i did it out of the goodness of my heart but you did brianna said quietly if you want no one but me to know it thats your choice i didnt come here to talk about her but to see how you were getting on have you moved into the room off the kitchen yes it gives me another room upstairs free for guests it gives you some privacy theres that ive a place for a desk in there so i can do the books and the paperwork i like having a window right over the garden murphy said i could have a door put in if i want so i could come in and out without going through the rest of the house good maggie lifted ajar of currants set it down again have you enough for the labor ive enough its been a good summer maggie wont you tell me whats troubling you nothing is maggie answered abruptly ive a lot on my mind thats all have you quarreled with rogan no it couldnt be called a quarrel she thought why should you assume id be thinking of him because i saw you together saw how much you care for each other that should be enough shouldnt it maggie demanded i care for him and he for me the business we have together is successful and will likely continue to be that should be enough i dont know the answer to that are you in love with him im not wouldnt be he thinks i am but i cant be responsible for what the man thinks nor will i change my life for him or anyone hes already made it change she hugged her arms close feeling suddenly cold and damn him i cant go back back to what to being what i was what i thought i was hes made me want more i know i always did but hes made me admit it its not enough for me to believe in my work i need him to hes made himself a part of it and if i fail i dont fail alone when i succeed the satisfaction isnt mine alone either and i think ive compromised myself because ive given part of me the best of me into his hands is it your art youre talking about maggie or is it your heart brianna stared hard at her sister as she asked the question maggie sat again defeated i dont have one without the other so it seems ive given him a piece of both rogan would have been surprised to hear it hed decided after a great deal of thought to treat his relationship with maggie as he would any business merger with a reluctant company hed made his offer now it was time to stand back to distance himself while the other party considered there was no professional reason to contact her the show in paris would remain for another two weeks before moving to rome the pieces had been chosen the groundwork laid for the foreseeable future she had her work and he had his any business contact could be made through his staff he would in other words let her stew it was important to his pride and his plans not to let her know how much her rejection of his feelings had hurt apart they could each evaluate their future objectively together they would simply end up in bed that was no longer enough patience and a firm hand was what was required rogan was sure of it and if maggie remained so foolishly obstinate after a reasonable amount of time hed use whatever means were at his disposal rogan knocked briskly on his grandmothers door it wasnt their usual time for visiting but after being back in dublin for a week he needed the comfort of family he nodded at the maid who opened the door is my grandmother at home yes mr sweeney shes in the front parlor ill tell her youre here no need he strode down the hall and through the open parlor doors christine rose immediately and opened her arms to him rogan what a lovely surprise i had a meeting canceled so i thought id drop in and see how you were he drew her back lifting a brow as he studied her face you look exceptionally well i feel exceptionally well she laughed and led him to a chair shall i get you a drink no i dont have very long and i only came for the company ive heard how well it went in paris christine sat beside him soothed down the skirt of her linen dress i had lunch with patricia last week and she told me it was a rousing success it was though i cant say how patricia would know he thought of his friend with a lingering trickle of guilt shes well oh very blooming you could say and i believe she said joseph had told her about the paris business shes working very hard on her day school and joseph is giving her a bit of help good i havent had much time at the gallery this past week im afraid the fact is the expansion in limerick is taking most of my efforts how is that going well enough ive had some complications so ill have to take a trip down to sort them out but youve hardly gotten back it shouldnt take more than a day or two he cocked his head watching his grandmother tug at her skirt brush at her hair is something wrong no she smiled brightly and forced her hands to still not at all though there is something i want to discuss with you you see she trailed off calling herself a miserable coward how is maggie did she enjoy france she seemed to its a beautiful time of year to holiday at the villa was the weather good it was is it weather you want to discuss grandmother no i was just are you sure you dont want that drink a trickle of alarm skidded down his back if somethings wrong i want you to tell me theres nothing wrong darling nothing at all wrong to his amazement she blushed like a schoolgirl grandmother he was interrupted by a clatter on the stairs and a shout chrissy where have you gone off to girl rogan stood slowly as a man popped into the doorway he was burly of chest bald as an egg and dressed in an illfitting suit the color of marigolds his face was round and wrinkled it beamed like a moon there you are my darling girl i thought id lost you i was about to ring for tea christines blush deepened as the man strode into the room and kissed both her fluttering hands rogan this is niall feeney niall my grandson rogan so this be himself rogan found his hand enveloped and pumped heartily well its delighted i am to be meeting you at long last chrissys told me all about you lad why youre the very apple of her eye im pleased to meet you mr feeney no no now none of that formality between us not with all our family connections he winked and laughed until his belly jiggled connections rogan said weakly aye with me growing up no farther than a toad could spit from chrissy here fifty years pass begad and now fate has it that youre handling all that pretty glass my niece makes your niece realization struck like a fist youre maggies uncle i am indeed niall sat very much at home his substantial belly sagging over his belt proud as a peacock of the girl ill say though i dont understand a bloody thing about what shes doing i have to take chrissys word that its fine chrissy rogan repeated in a small voice isnt it lovely rogan christines nervous smile hurt her face it seems brianna wrote to niall in galway to tell him maggie and you were working together of course she mentioned that you were my grandson niall wrote me back and one thing led to another hes come to visit awhile visit in dublin a fine city it is to be sure niall smacked a hand on the delicate arm of the sofa with the prettiest girls in all of ireland he winked at christine though in truth ive only eyes for one go on with you niall rogan stared at the pair of them all but billing and cooing before his eyes i believe ill have that drink after all he said a whiskey chapter eighteen it was a very subdued rogan who left his grandmothers parlor and swung by the gallery just past closing he didnt want to believe hed seen what he knew hed seen just as maggie had once said when a couple is intimate they throw off signals his grandmother for gods sake was flirting with maggies moonfaced uncle from galway no he decided as he let himself into the gallery it didnt bear thinking of signals there might have been but undoubtedly hed read them incorrectly his grandmother was after all over seventy a woman of faultless taste unblemished character impeccable style and niall feeney was was simply indescrib able rogan decided what he needed was a couple of hours of perfect peace and quiet in his gallery office away from people and phones and anything remotely personal he shook his head as he crossed the room he was sounding entirely too much like maggie the raised voices stopped him before his hand met the knob an argument was in full swing on the other side of the door while manners might have urged him to retreat curiosity turned the tide he opened the door on joseph and patricia in full steam i tell you youre not using the head god gave you joseph shouted i wont be the cause of an estrangement between you and your mother i dont give a bloody pin for what my mother thinks patricia shouted right back causing rogans mouth to fall open this has nothing to do with her the fact that you could say so proves my point youre not using your head shes rogan josephs furious face went still as a stone i didnt expect you in obviously rogan looked cautiously from joseph to patricia i seem to have interrupted perhaps you can talk your way through that pride of his eyes glinting with emotion patricia tossed back her hair i cant this has nothing to do with rogan josephs voice was quiet with the steel of warning beneath oh no we mustnt let anyone know the first tear spilled over patricia dashed it away we should keep sneaking around like like adulterers well i wont do it any longer joseph im in love with you and i dont care who knows she whirled on rogan well what do you have to say about it he held up a hand as if to regain his balance i think i should leave you alone no need she fumbled for her purse he wont listen to me it was my mistake to believe he would that he was the only one who really would patricia dont patricia me in that tone she snapped at joseph all my life ive been told what to do and how to do it whats proper whats acceptable and im sick to death of it i tolerated the criticism over opening my school and the damnable unspoken belief of my friends and family that id fail well i wont fail she whirled on rogan again as if hed spoken do you hear i wont fail ill do exactly what i wish and ill do it well what i wont tolerate is criticism of my choice of lovers not from you not from my mother and most certainly not from the lover ive chosen chin up she looked back at joseph with teardrenched eyes if you dont want me then be honest and say so but dont you dare tell me whats best for me joseph stepped toward her but she was already darting out the door patty damn it better to let her go joseph told himself better for her im sorry rogan he said stiffly i would have found a way to have avoided that scene if id known you were coming in since you didnt perhaps you might explain it equally stiff rogan rounded his desk and sat assum ing the position of authority in fact i insist joseph didnt bat an eye at rogans seamless switch from friend to employer its obvious ive been seeing patricia i believe the term she used was sneaking about the color washed back into josephs face we i thought it best if we were discreet did you a fire kindled in rogans eyes and treating a woman like patricia like one of your casual affairs was your idea of discretion i was prepared for your disapproval rogan beneath his tailored jacket josephs shoulders were rigid as steel i expected it and well you should have rogan said evenly so i did just as i expected the reaction i got from her mother when patricia talked me into dining with them last evening his hands tightened into fists a gallery manager without a drop of blue in his blood she might as well have said it for it was in her eyes her daughter could do better and by christ she can but i wont stand here and have you say that whats between us is a casual affair his voice had risen to a shout by the time he was finished then what is it im in love with her ive been in love with her since the first time i saw her nearly ten years ago but then there was robert and there was you there was never me baffled rogan rubbed his hands over his face was the world going mad he wondered his grandmother and maggies uncle himself and maggie and now joseph and patricia when did this happen the week before you left for paris joseph re membered those giddy hours those wonderful days and nights before reality had set in i didnt plan it but that hardly changes anything i realize you may want to make other arrangements now rogan dropped his hands what other arrange ments for managing the gallery what he needed rogan thought was to go home and find a bottle of aspirin why he asked wearily im your employee you are and i hope youll remain so your private life has nothing to do with your work here good christ do i look like some kind of monster who would fire you for claiming to be in love with a friend of mine he indulged his now throbbing head a moment by pressing the heels of his hands to his eyes i walk in here into my own office ill remind you and find the two of you snapping like terriers before i can take the next breath patricias clawing at me for not believing her capable of running a school he shook his head and dropped his hands i never thought she was incapable of anything shes one of the most intelligent women i know you just got caught in the backlash joseph murmured and gave in to the desperate need for a cigarette so it seems youve a right to tell me its none of my business but as someone whos known you for ten years and patricia longer than that i do take an interest what the devil were you fighting about joseph huffed out smoke she wants to elope elope if joseph had told him patricia wanted to dance naked in st stephens square hed have been no more staggered patricia shes cooked up some mad scheme about us driving up to scotland it seems she had a row with her mother and came storming straight over here ive never known patricia to storm anywhere her mothers not in favor of the relationship i take it anything but he offered a weak smile the truth is she thinks patricia should hang out for you rogan was hardly surprised at this news shes doomed to disappointment there he said ive other plans if it helps matters ill make them clear to her i dont know as it could hurt joseph hesitated then sat as he was used to on the corner of rogans desk you dont mind then it doesnt bother you why should it and as far as annes concerned dennis will bring her around thats what patricia said joseph studied the cigarette smoldering between his fingers then pulled out his little fliptop ashtray and crushed it out she seemed to think if we just ran off and got married her mother would soon fall in with the idea as if it had been hers all along id lay odds on it she wasnt keen on robbie at first either wasnt she joseph had the look of a man who was beginning to see the light not at all sure he was good enough for her darling daughter speculating rogan rocked back in his chair it didnt take long for her to begin to dote on him of course he didnt wear an earring josephs grin flashed as he lifted a hand to his ear patty likes it hmm was all rogan could think of to say anne might be a bit difficult he ignored josephs rude snort but in the end all she wants is her daughters happiness if youre the answer to that anne will want you as well you know we could manage well enough around here if you took a sudden trip to scotland i couldnt it wouldnt be fair to her your business of course but rogan stretched back in his chair again it seems to me a woman might find a wild ride over the border a ceremony in some musty chapel and a honeymoon in the highlands very romantic i dont want her to regret it joseph was begin ning to sound less certain the woman who walked out of here just now looked to me to know her own mind she does and shes come to know mine all too quickly he pushed away from the desk id better go find her he stopped at the door tossed a grin over his shoulder rogan can you spare me for a week take two and kiss the bride for me the wire that came three days later telling rogan that mr and mrs joseph donahoe were well and happy proved to him that he wasnt a hardhearted man in fact he liked to believe hed done his part to speed the two lovers on their way but there were two other lovers hed have given much to see go their separate paths in fact he fantasized daily about booting niall feeney all the way back to galway at first rogan tried to ignore the situation when more than a week had passed and niall was still cozily ensconced in christine sweeneys home he tried patience after all he told himself how long would a woman of his grand mothers taste and sensibilities be duped by a charm less borish westcounty sharpie after two weeks he decided it was time to try reason rogan waited in the parlor the parlor he re minded himself that reflected the style and breeding of a lovely sensible and generous woman why rogan christine glided into the room looking her grandson thought entirely too attractive for a woman of her age what a lovely surprise i thought you were on your way to limerick i am ive just stopped in on the way to the airport he kissed her glanced over her shoulder to the doorway so youre alone yes nialls out running some errands do you have time for a bite to eat before you go cooks baked some lovely tarts nialls charmed her so that shes been baking treats daily charmed her as his grandmother sat rogan rolled his eyes oh yes hes always popping into the kitchen to tell her what a way she has with soup or the duck or some dish or other she cant do enough for him he certainly looks like a man who eats well christines smile was indulgent oh he loves his food niall does im sure it goes down easy when its free the comment had christine raising a brow would you have me bill a friend for a meal rogan of course not hes been in town some time now he said changing tacks im sure he must miss his home and his business oh hes retired as niall says a man cant work all his life if hes worked at all rogan said under his breath grandmother im sure its been nice for you to visit with a friend from your childhood but it has its been truly wonderful why i feel young again she laughed like a girl just last night we went dancing id forgotten what a fine dancer niall is and when we go to galway we rogan felt himself pale we go to galway yes next week were planning to take a long drive back to the west a bit of nostalgia for me of course im interested in seeing nialls home but you cant its absurd you cant go traisping off to galway with the man why ever not because its youre my grandmother for gods sake i wont have you wont have me what she asked very quietly the tone reflecting the sort of anger she rarely directed at him had rogan reining in grand mother i realize youve let yourself be swept away by the man by the memories im sure theres no harm in it but the idea of you going off with a man you havent seen for more than fifty years is ludicrous how young he was christine thought and how distressingly proper i believe at my age id enjoy doing something ludicrous however i dont believe taking a trip back to my childhood home with a man im very fond of a man i knew long before you were born fits into that category now perhaps she said holding up a hand before he could speak you find that the idea of my having a relationship an adult satisfying relationship with niall does fit that cat egory youre not telling me youre not saying you havent actually slept with him christine leaned back tapping her wellmanicured nails on the arm of the love seat thats certainly my business isnt it and i dont require your approval of course not he heard himself beginning to babble im just concerned naturally your concern is noted she rose regally im sorry that youre shocked by my behavior but it cant be helped im not shocked damn of course im shocked you cant just he could hardly say the words could he in his grandmothers parlor darling i know nothing about the man i know about him i havent any definite plans on how long well be in galway but we will be stopping in to see maggie and her family on the way shall i give her your regards you cant have thought this through i know my own mind and heart better it seems than you think have a safe trip rogan dismissed he had no choice but to kiss her cheek and leave the moment he was in the car he yanked at the phone eileen reschedule limerick for tomor row yes theres a problem he muttered i have to go to clare when the first touch of fall caressed the air and gilded the trees it seemed a sin not to enjoy it after two solid weeks of work maggie decided she de served a day off she spent the morning in the garden weeding with a vigor that would have made brianna proud to reward herself she decided to bike to the village for a late lunch at omalleys there was a bite to the air and the layered clouds to the west promised rain before nightfall she pulled on her cap pumped up her rear tire which was going flat then guided the bike around the house and through the gate she set off at a leisurely pace dreaming a bit over the harvesting in the fields the fuchsia continued to bloom in teardrops of red despite the threat of early frost the landscape would change as soon as winter set it become barren and swept by a bitter wind but it would still be beautiful the nights would lengthen urging people to their fires the rains would come sweeping across the atlantic with the wail of the wind she looked forward to it and to the work she would do in the chilly months ahead she wondered if she could convince rogan to come west during the winter and if she did would he find charm in the rattling windows and smoky fires she hoped that he would and when he stopped punishing her she hoped that they could go back to the way things had been before that last night in france hed see reason she told herself and leaned low over the bike against the wind shed make him see it shed even forgive him for being highhanded overconfident and dictatorial the moment they were together again she would be calm and cool and sweettongued theyd put this foolish disagreement behind them and she had time to squeal barely and to swerve into the hedgerows as a car barreled around the curve brakes screamed the car veered and maggie ended up bottom first in the blackthorn jesus mary and joseph what kind of a blind ignorant fool is it who tries to run down innocent people she shoved the cap back that had fallen over her eyes and glared oh of course it would be you are you hurt rogan was out of the car and beside her in an instant dont try to move i can move curse you she batted his exploring hands away what do you mean driving at that horrible speed this isnt a raceway the heart that had lodged hard in his throat freed itself i wasnt driving that fast you were in the middle of the road daydreaming if id come around that turn a second sooner id have flattened you like a rabbit i wasnt daydreaming minding my own business was what i was doing not expecting some jackeen to come speeding along in a fancy car she brushed off the seat of her pants then kicked her bike now see what youve done ive a puncture youre lucky its the tire thats flat and not yourself what are you doing she demanded im putting this excuse for transportation in the car once hed done so he turned back to her come on ill drive you back home i wasnt going home if you had any sense of direction youd see was going to the village where i was going to have a meal thatll have to wait he took her arm in the proprietary manner she forgot shed found amusing oh will it well you can drive me to the village or nowhere at all because im hungry ill drive you home he said again i have something to discuss with you privately if id been able to get through to you this morning i could have told you i was coming and you wouldnt have been riding that bike in the middle of the road with this he slammed the car door behind her and skirted the hood if youd been able to get through this morning and had had this nasty way about you id have told you not to bother to come at all ive had a difficult morning maggie he resisted the urge to rub at the headache drumming behind his temples dont push me she began to then saw that hed said no more than the truth there was trouble in his eyes is it a problem at work no actually i do have some complications with a project in limerick im on my way there so youre not staying no he glanced at her im not staying but it isnt the factory expansion i need to speak with you about he stopped at her gate shut off the car if youve nothing to eat ill run into the village and bring something back its not a problem i can make do she relented enough to close a hand over his im glad to see you even though you nearly ran me down im glad to see you he lifted the hand to his lips even though you nearly ran into me ill get your bike out just leave it in front after striding up the walk she turned have you a proper kiss for me it was hard to resist that quick flash of smile or the way she reached up to link her hands behind his head ive a kiss for you proper or not it was easy to meet the heat to draw the energy in what was difficult was to check the need that instant desire to back her through the door and take it all perhaps i was daydreaming a bit before she said tugging on his lips was thinking of you and wondering how much longer youd punish me how do you mean by staying away from me she spoke airily as she pushed through the door i wasnt punishing you just staying away then distancing myself to give you time to think and time to miss you to miss me and to change your mind i have missed you but i havent changed my mind or anything else why dont you sit i need to get some more turf for the fire i love you maggie that stopped her had her closing her eyes a moment before she turned back i believe you might rogan and though something in me warms to it it changes nothing she hurried out he hadnt come to beg he reminded himself hed come to ask her to help him with a problem though from her reaction he believed things were changing more than she was ready to admit he paced to the window to the sagging sofa back again will you sit she demanded when she came back with her arms piled with turf blocks youll wear out the floor whats this business in limerick a few complications thats all he watched as she knelt at the hearth and expertly stacked fuel it occurred to him that hed never seen anyone build a turf fire before a restful sight he mused that drew a man close to seek that warm red heart were expanding the factory oh and what do you make at your factory china for the most part the inexpensive sort thats fashioned into mementos mementos she paused at her work leaned back on her haunches souvenirs you mean not those little bells and teacups and such in the tourist shops theyre very well done she tossed back her head and laughed oh its rich ive hired myself a man who makes little plates with shamrocks all over them have you any idea what percent of our economy depends on tourism on the sale of little plates with shamrocks on them or handknit sweaters linen lace bloody postcards no she snorted behind her hand but im sure you can tell me down to the pence tell me rogan do you do much business in plaster leprechauns or plastic shillelaghs i didnt come here to justify my business to you or to discuss the fact that this expansion which will allow us to manufacture some of the finest china produced in ireland will create more than a hundred new jobs in a part of the country that desperately needs them she waved a hand to stop him im sorry ive insulted you im sure theres a rising need for thimbles and ashtrays and cups that say erin go bragh its just hard for me you see to picture a man who wears such wonderful suits owning a place that makes them the fact that i do makes it possible for worldwide to subsidize and offer grants to a number of artists each year even if they are snobs she rubbed the back of her hand over her nose that puts me in my place and since i dont want to waste what time we have arguing well say no more about it are you going to sit or just stand there and glower at me not that you dont look fine even with a scowl on your face he surrendered on a long breath your works going well very well she shifted crossing her legs on the rug ill show you whats new before you go if theres time were a little behind at the gallery i suppose i should tell you that joseph and patricia have eloped yes i know ive had a card from them he tilted his head you dont seem at all sur prised im not they were crazy in love with each other i seem to recall you claiming patricia was crazy in love with me not at all i said she was half in love with you and ill stand by that i imagine she wanted to be in love with you it would have been so convenient after all but it was joseph all along thats not whats troubling you is it no i admit it took me by surprise but it doesnt trouble me ive come to realize i took josephs skills for granted hell be back tomorrow and im grate ful for it then what is it have you had a letter from your uncle niall brianna has shes the one who gets them as shes the one wholl remember to answer back he wrote to tell her hed be visiting dublin and might pass through on his way back home have you seen him seen him on a sound of disgust rogan pushed out of the chair again i cant get near my grand mother without stepping all over him hes settled himself in her house for two weeks past weve got to decide what to do about it why should we do anything are you listening to me maggie theyve been living together my grandmother and your uncle greatuncle actually whatever the devil he is to you theyve been having a flaming affair have they maggie let out a roar of approving laughter well thats wonderful wonderful its insane shes been acting like some giddy girl going dancing staying out half the night sharing her bed with a man whose suits are the color of fried eggs so you object to his taste in clothes i object to him ill not have him waltzing into my grandmothers house and planting himself in the parlor as if he belongs there i dont know what his game is but i wont have him exploiting her gener ous heart her vulnerability if he thinks hell get his hands on one penny of her money hold that she sprang up like a tiger tis my blood youre speaking of sweeney this is no time to be overly sensitive overly sensitive she jabbed him in the chest look whos talking youre jealous because your grannys got someone besides you in her life thats ridiculous its true as the day do you think a man couldnt be interested in her but for her money familial pride stiffened his spine my grand mother is a beautiful intelligent woman ill not disagree with that and my uncle niall is no fortune hunter he retired from his business most comfortably set he may not have a villa in france or wear suits tailored by the bloody british but hes done well enough and has no need to play gigolo and i wont have you speak of me kin in such a way in me own house i didnt mean to offend you ive come to you because as their family its up to us to do something about the situation since theyre planning a trip to galway within the next few days and passing by here on the way id hoped you might speak with him certainly ill speak with him hes my kin isnt he id hardly ignore him but i wont help you interfere youre the snob rogan and a prude as well prude youre offended by the idea of your grandmother having a rich and full sex life he winced hissed through his teeth oh please i dont want to imagine it nor should you since its her private business her mouth twitched still its interesting dont defeated he sank into the chair again if theres one picture i dont want in my mind its that actually i cant quite get it there myself now wouldnt it be a strange thing if they married then wed be in the way of cousins after all laughing she slapped his back when he choked could you use a whiskey darling i could maggie he took several deep breaths maggie he called again as she rummaged through in the kitchen i dont want her to be hurt i know she came back holding two glasses its knowing that that kept me from bloodying your nose when you spoke so of uncle niall your grans a fine woman rogan and a wise one shes finally he said it aloud shes all i have left of my family maggies eyes gentled youre not losing her he let out a breath stared into his glass i suppose you think im being a fool no i dont exactly she smiled when his eyes lifted to hers a man can be expected to be a bit jittery when his granny takes on a boyfriend rogan winced she laughed why not let her be happy if it eases your mind ill look the situation over when they stop here thats something at least he touched his glass to hers and they tossed the whiskey back together i have to go youve hardly been here why dont you come to the pub with me and well have a meal together or she slipped her arms around him well stay here and go hungry no he thought as he lowered his mouth to hers they wouldnt be hungry for long i cant stay he set the empty glass aside to take her by her shoulders if i did wed only end up in bed that wouldnt solve anything there doesnt have to be anything to solve why must you make it complicated were good to gether we are he framed her face in his hands very good together thats only one of die reasons i want to spend my life with you no dont draw away nothing you told me changes what we can have once you realize that youll come to me i can wait youll just go then stay away again so its marriage or nothing its marriage he kissed her again and every thing ill be in limerick for almost a week the office knows where to reach me i wont call he traced a thumb over her lips but youll want to thats enough for now chapter nineteen youre being pigheaded maggie you know im tired of having that particular word applied to me with goggles protecting her eyes maggie experimented with lamp work for nearly a week everything shed freeblown had dis satisfied her for a change of pace she had set up a halfdozen torches three clamped to each side of a bench and was heating a tube of glass in the cross fire well if its applied to you often enough it may be true brianna shot back its family you can spare one evening for family it isnt a matter of time she meant this though for some reason maggie felt time was breathing down her neck like a snarling dog why should i subject myself to having dinner with her carefully brows knit she began to pull and rotate the softened glass i can tell you i have no appetite for it nor will she tisnt just mother wholl be coming uncle niall and mrs sweeney will be there and lottie of course it would be rude of you not to come ive been told im that as well as pigheaded as with everything else shed touched over the last few days the glass refused to follow the vision in her head the vision itself blurred infuriating her as much as it frightened her pure obstinancy kept her working you havent seen uncle niall since das wake and hes bringing rogans grandmother for heav ens sake you told me you liked her very much i do damn it what was wrong with her hands what was wrong with her heart she fused one rod to the other burned it off returned burned it off perhaps one of the reasons i dont want to be there is so shell not be subjected to one of our happy family meals the sarcasm was as hot as one of maggies points of flame brianna faced it down with ice it wouldnt cost you much to put aside your feelings for one night if uncle niall and mrs sweeney are going out of their way to visit us before going on to galway well welcome them all of us stop badgering me will you youre pecking away at me like a damn duck cant you see im working you hardly do anything else so its necessary to interrupt you if i want a word theyll be here shortly maggie and ill not make excuses for you in a gesture similar to her sisters habitual stance brianna folded her arms ill stand right here and keep pecking until you do whats expected of you all right all right jesus ill come to the damn dinner brianna smiled serenely shed never expected less at half seven im serving my guests earlier so well have a private family meal and oh what a jolly time that will be itll go well enough if you promise to hold that nasty tongue of yours im only asking for the smallest of efforts ill smile ill be polite i wont eat with me fingers with a bitter sigh maggie shoved up her goggles and held the figure on the end of the tube out of the flames what have you done there curious brianna stepped closer gone mad its pretty is it a unicorn aye a unicorn only needs a touch of gold on the horn to make it complete she laughed turning the mythical figure in the air its a joke brie a poor one on me itll be swans next im sure or those little dogs with puffs for tails she set her work aside briskly turned off her torches well thats that i suppose ill hardly do anything worthwhile today so ill be along to your dinner party god help you why dont you rest awhile maggie you look awfully tired perhaps i will after i crate up a few pieces she tossed the goggles aside rubbed her hands over her face she was tired maggie realized outrageously so you neednt worry brie youll not have to send out the dogs for me ive said ill be there im grateful brianna reached down to squeeze her sisters hand i have to go back make certain everythings in place half seven maggie i know she waved her sister out to keep her mind on practical matters she took one of the crates shed made and packed it with padding after spreading bubble wrap over a table she turned to the shelves at the back of the shop there was only one piece there the last shed completed before rogans visit tall and sturdy the trunk speared up then curved flooding down in slim graceful limbs mat almost seemed to sway it would stand she thought like the willow that had inspired it and it would bend yielding even as it remained true to itself the color was a deep pure blue mat flooded up from the base and paled gently to the delicate tips she wrapped it carefully for it was more than a sculpture this was the last work shed been able to draw successfully from her heart nothing she had attempted since then had gelled day after day she had labored only to remelt and remelt day after day she came closer to releasing the panic that jittered inside her his fault she told herself as she secured the top of the crate his fault for tempting her with fame and fortune for exposing her vanity to such a stunning and fast success now she was blocked dried up as hollow as the tube shed fashioned into a unicorn hed made her want too much want him too much then he had walked away and let her see brutally what it was like to have nothing she wouldnt give up nor would she give in maggie promised herself she would have her pride at least while her furnace roared mockingly she sat in her chair felt the familiarity of its shape it was only that shed been working too hard surely shed been pushing herself to do better and better work with each piece the pressure of holding on to success had blocked her that was all she couldnt suppress the idea that as the tour moved on from paris it would be found wanting that she would be found wanting that she would never again pick up the pipe just for herself just for the pleasure of it rogan had changed all that he had as shed told him he would changed her and how was it she thought closing her eyes how could it be that a man could make you love him by going away youve done well for yourself havent you darling niall stuffed into one of his brighthued suits like a happy sausage beamed at brianna i always you were a clever lass takes after me dear sister does brianna chrissy you have a lovely home christine accepted die i brianna offered and your gardens are simply breathtaking thank you they give me pleasure rogan told me how he enjoyed his brief stay christine sighed content with the warmth of the fire and the glow of the lamp i can see why shes got the touch niall gave brianna a bonecrushing squeeze around the shoulders in the blood you know blood runs true so it seems i knew your grandmother quite well chrissy was underfoot all the time niall winked thought i didnt notice her shy was what i was never had a shy moment in your life christine said with a laugh you thought i was a nuisance if i did ive changed me mind he leaned over and under briannas curious eye kissed christine firmly on the mouth it took you more than fifty years seems like yesterday well disconcerted brianna cleared her throat i suppose i should check on i believe thats mother and lottie she continued when raised voices boomed down the hallway you drive like a blind woman maeve com plained ill walk back to ennis before i get into that car with you again if you can do better you should drive yourself then youd have a sense of independence obvi ously unconcerned lottie strolled into the parlor unwrapping a thick scarf from around her neck its a chilly night she announced rosycheeked and smiling and you dragging me out in itll put me in bed for a week mother shoulders braced against embarrass ment brianna helped maeve off with her coat id like you to meet mrs sweeney mrs sweeney this is my mother maeve concannon and our friend lottie sullivan im delighted to meet you both christine rose to offer her hand to both women i was a friend of your mothers mrs concannon we were girls to gether in galway i was christine rogan then she spoke of you maeve said shortly im pleased to meet you her gaze shifted to her uncle narrowed well uncle niall is it you havent graced us with your presence for many a day it warms my heart to see you maeve he envel oped her in an embrace patting her stiff back with a beefy hand i hope the years have been kind to you why would they the moment she was freed maeve sat in a chair by the fire this fires drawing poorly brianna it wasnt but brianna walked over to make minute adjustments to the flue stop fussing niall ordered with a casual wave of his hand its drawing fine we all know maeve lives to complain doesnt she now lottie spoke pleasantly while she pulled her knitting needles from the basket shed brought along i pay no mind to it myself but that comes from raising four children i suppose unsure what step to take christine focused on lottie what lovely wool mrs sullivan thank you im partial to it myself had you a nice trip from dublin then a lovely one yes id forgotten how beautiful this part of the country was nothing but fields and cows maeve tossed out annoyed that the conversation was circling out of her control its fine to live in dublin and pass through on a fine autumn day come winter you wouldnt think it so lovely she might have continued the acme but maggie came in why its uncle niall big as life with a laugh she went into his arms little maggie mae all grown up as ive been for some time she stepped back sighed again well youve lost nearly all of it now rubbed an affectionate hand over his head it was such a fine head you see the good lord saw no need to cover it with hair ive heard about how well youre doing darling im proud of you mrs sweeneys telling you that so she can brag upon her grandson its lovely seeing you maggie said to christine i hope you wont let this one run you ragged in galway i find i can keep up i was hoping if its not inconvenient to you that i could have a look at your glass house tomorrow before we go sure id be glad to show you hello lottie are you well fit as a fiddle her needles clacked musically i was hoping youd come by the house and tell us about your trip to france this statement drew an audible sniff from maeve schooling her features maggie turned mother margaret mary youve been busy with your own doings as usual i see i have brianna finds time to come by twice a week to see that i have all i need maggie nodded then it isnt necessary for me to do the same ill serve dinner now if everyones ready brianna cut in im always ready for a meal niall kept chris tines hand in his using his free one to give maggies shoulder a squeeze as they went into the dining room there was linen on the table and fresh flowers with the warmth of candles flickering on the side board the food was beautifully prepared and plentiful it should have been a pleasant congenial evening but of course it wasnt maeve picked at her food the lighter the mood at the table became the darker grew her own she envied christine her fine wellcut dress the gleam of pearls around her throat the quiet expensive scent that drifted from her skin and the skin itself soft and pampered by wealth her mothers friend maeve thought her childhood playmate class to class the life christine sweeney had led should have been hers she thought would have been hers but for one mistake but for maggie she could have wept from the rage of it from the shame of it from the helpless loss of it all around her the conversation bubbled like some expensive wine frothy and foolish talk about flowers and old times about paris and dublin about children how lovely for you to have such a large family christine was saying to lottie i was always sorry that michael and i couldnt have more children though we doted on our son then on rogan a son maeve muttered a son doesnt forget his mother its true its a special bond christine smiled hoping to soften the harshness around maeves mouth but i confess i always wanted a daughter of ray own youre blessed with two mrs concannon cursed more like try the mushrooms maeve deliberately lottie spooned some onto maeves plate theyre fried to a turn youve a fine hand brianna learned the knack of these from my gran brianna began i was always pestering her to show ok how to cook and blaming me because i didnt chose to strap myself to the stove maeve tossed back her head id no liking for it ill wager you dont spend much time in the kitchen mrs sweeney not a great deal im afraid aware her voice had chilled christine made the effort to lighten it again and ill have to admit that none of my efforts there can come close to what youve served us tonight brianna rogan was right to praise your cooking she makes a living from it bedding and boarding strangers leave her alone maggie spoke quietly but the look in her eyes was as sharp as a shout god knows she bedded and boarded you as well as was her duty theres no one at this table would deny that its a daughters obligation to tend to her mother which is more than youve ever done margaret mary or ever will do so count your blessings that brie tolerates you i havent a blessing to count with my own children tossing me out of my own house then leaving me sick and alone why you havent been sick a day maeve lottie said complacently and how can you be alone when im there day and night and you draw a weekly wage to be there it should be my own blood tending me but no my daughters turn their backs and my uncle with his fine house in galway pays no mind at all enough to see you havent changed maeve niall regarded her with pity not a whit i apologize chrissy for my nieces poor behavior i think well have our dessert in the parlor pale and quiet brianna rose if youd like to go in and sit ill serve it much cozier lottie agreed ill help you brianna if youll excuse me uncle niall mrs sweeney id like a word with my mother before we join you maggie kept her seat waiting until the room emp tied out why would you do it maggie asked maeve why would you spoil it for her would it have been so hard to give her the illusion for one evening that we were a family embarrassment only sharpened maeves tongue ive no illusions and no need to impress mrs sweeney from dublin you impressed her just the same badly it re flects on us all do you think you can be better than the rest of us margaret mary better because you traipse off to venice or paris with her knuckles whitening on the edge of the table maeve leaned forward do you think i dont know what youve been doing with that womans grandson whoring yourself without an ounce of shame ah he sees youve got the money and the glory you always wanted youve only had to sell body and soul to get it maggie clasped her hands beneath the table to try to stem the shaking my works what i sell so perhaps youve a point about my soul but my bodys mine ive given it to rogan freely maeve paled as her suspicions were confirmed and youll pay for it as i did a man of his class wants nothing more from the likes of you than what he finds in the dark you know nothing about it nothing about him but i know you what will happen to your fine career when you discover a baby in your belly if i found myself with a child to raise i pray god id do a better job than you i wouldnt give every thing up and wrap myself and the child in sackcloth for the rest of my days and that you know nothing about maeve said sharply but go on this way and you will youll know what its like to see your life stop and your heart break but it didnt have to other musicians have families i was given a gift to her own misery maeve felt tears burn her eyes and because i was arrogant as you are it was taken from me theres been no music in me since the moment i made you there could have been maggie whispered if youd wanted it badly enough wanted it even now maeve could feel the old scar throb over her heart what good is wanting she demanded all your life youve wanted and now you risk having it taken away for the thrill of having a man between your legs he loves me maggie heard herself say a man speaks easily of loving in the dark youll never be happy born in sin live in sin die in sin and alone just as im alone youve made hating me your lifes work and a fine job youve done of it slowly unsteadily maggie rose do you know what frightens me frightens me down to the bone you hate me because you see yourself when you look at me god help me if youre right she fled out of the room and into the night the hardest pill to swallow was apology maggie postponed downing it distracting herself by showing christine and niall her studio in the cool light of morning the nastiness of the previous evening blurred a little she was able to soothe herself by explaining various tools and techniques even when niall insisted trying to coach him through blowing his first bubble its not a trumpet maggie clasped a hand on the pipe as he started to lift it high showing off like that will do no more than have hot glass spilling all over you i believe ill stick with me golf he winked and turned the pipe back to her one artist in the familys enough and you really make your own glass christine wandered around the shop in tailored slacks and a silk blouse from sand and a few other things sand soda lime feld spar dolomite a bit of arsenic arsenic christines eyes widened and this and that maggie said with a smile i guard my formulas closely like a sorcerer with a spell depending on what color you want you add other chemicals various colorants change in differ ent base glasses cobalt copper manganese then there are the carbonates and the oxides the ar senics an excellent oxide christine looked dubiously at the chemicals mag gie showed her id think it would be simpler to melt down used or commercial glass but its not yours then is it i didnt realize you had to be a chemist as well as an artist our maggie was always a bright one niall swung an arm over her shoulder sarah was always writing me with how bright she was in school how sweet briannas disposition that was it maggie said with a laugh i was bright brie was sweet she said brie was bright as well niall said staunchly but ill wager she never said i was sweet maggie turned to nuzzle her face in his coat im so glad to see you again i didnt realize how glad i would be ive neglected you since tom died maggie mae no we all had our own lives and brie and i both understood that mother didnt make it easy for you to visit as to that she pulled back took a deep breath id like to apologize for last evening i shouldnt have provoked her and i certainly shouldnt have left without saying good night theres no need for apologies from you or from brianna as ive told her already today niall patted maggies cheek maeve had settled on her mood before she arrived you provoked nothing youre not to blame for the way shes chosen to go through life maggie whether i am or not im sorry the evening was uncomfortable i would have called it illuminating christine said calmly i suppose it was maggie agreed uncle niall did you ever hear her sing i did lovely as a nightingale to be sure and restless like one of those big cats you see caged in the zoo she was never an easy girl maggie happy only when the people would hush and listen to her music then there was my father then there was tom from what im told they were blind and deaf to everything but each other maybe to each other as well he stroked the big hand down her hair it could be neither of them saw what was inside until they were bound and when they did what they saw was different than theyd hoped she let that sour her do you think if they hadnt met shed have been different he smiled a little and kept his hand gentle were tossed by the winds of fate maggie mae once we end where they blow us we make of ourselves what we will im sorry for her maggie said softly i never thought i could be and youve done well by her he kissed maggies brow now its time to make yourself what you will im working on it she smiled again very hard on it satisfied that the timing was right christine spoke up niall would you be a darling and give me a moment with maggie girl talk is it his round face creased in smiles take your time ill go for a walk now then christine began as soon as the door shut behind niall i have a confession i didnt go into the parlor right after last night i came back thinking i might be able to smooth things over maggie lowered her eyes to stare at the floor i see what i did rudely was listen it took all my control not to barge into that room and give your mother a piece of my mind it would only have made things worse which was why i didnt give in to the urge though it would have been greatly satisfying chris tine took maggie by the arms gave her a little shake she has no idea what she has in you perhaps she knows too well ive sold part of what i am because theres a need in me just as there is in her for more youve earned more if ive earned it or been given it as a gift it doesnt change things i wanted to be content with what i had mrs sweeney i wanted so much to be because otherwise id be admitting there hadnt been enough that my father had failed us and he didnt before rogan walked through that door i was content or id talked myself into believing i could be but the doors open now and ive had a taste of it i havent done a decent hours work in a week why do you think that is hes pushed me into a corner thats why it cant be for myself anymore i cant be for myself anymore hes changed that i dont know what to do i always know what to do your work comes through your heart thats plain for anyone whos seen in maybe youre blocking off your heart maggie if i am its because i have to i wont do what she did nor what my father did i wont be the cause of misery or the victim of it i think you are the victim of it my dear maggie youre letting yourself feel guilty for succeeding guiltier yet for harboring the ambition to succeed and i think youre refusing to let out whats in your heart because once you do you wont be able to take it back again even though holding it in is making you unhappy youre in love with rogan arent you if i am he brought it on himself im sure hell deal with it admirably maggie turned away to shuffle tools on a bench hes never met her i think i made sure he wouldnt so he couldnt see i was like her moody and mean dissatisfied lonely christine said softly and drew maggies eyes back to hers shes a lonely woman maggie through no ones fault but her own itll he no ones but yours if youre lonely too coming forward she took maggies hands i didnt know your father but there must be some of him in you as well he dreamed so do i and your grandmother with her quick mind and ready temper shes in you as well niall with his wonderful lust for life all of thats in you none of it makes up the whole malls right about that maggie so right youll make yourself what you will i thought i had i thought i knew exactly who i was and wanted to be now its all mixed up in my head when your head wont give you the answer its best to listen to your heart i dont like the answer its giving me christine laughed then my dear child you can be absolutely sure its the right one chapter twenty by midmorning her solitude tucked around her maggie took up her pipe again two hours later the vessel she had blown was tossed back into the melt for cullet she pored over her sketches rejected them tried others after scowling at the unicorn shed set on a shelf she turned to her torches for lamp work but shed hardly taken up a rod of glass before the vision faded she watched the tip of the rod dip melt begin to droop hardly thinking of what she was doing she began dropping the bits of molten glass into a container of water some broke others survived she took one out by the tip to study though it had been formed by fire it was cool now shaped like a tear a prince ruperts drop no more than a glass artists novelty one a child could create rubbing the one drop between her fingers she took it to her polariscope through the lens the internal stresses in the drop exploded into a dazzling rainbow of colors so much she thought inside so little she slipped the drop into her pocket fished several more out of the bucket moving with studied care she shut down her furnaces ten minutes later she was striding into her sisters kitchen brianna what do you see when you look at me blowing a stray hair out of her eyes brianna looked up and continued to knead her bread dough my sister of course no no try for once not to be so literalminded what is it you see in me a woman who seems to be on the edge of something always one who has enough energy to tire me to the bone and anger brianna stared down at her hands again anger that makes me sad and sorry selfishness startled brianna glanced up again no not that not ever thats one flaw ive never seen in you but others youve enough of them what do you want to be perfect the dismissive tone had maggie wincing youre still upset with me about last evening im not no with renewed vigor brianna began to pound the dough with myself with circum stances with fate if you like but not with you it wasnt your doing and god knows you warned me it wouldnt work but i wish you wouldnt always leap to defend me i cant help it i know brianna smoothed the dough into a mound and slipped it into a bowl for a second rising she was better behaved after youd gone and a little embarrassed i think before she left she told me id cooked a nice meal not that she ate any of it but at least she said it weve had worse evenings thats gods truth maggie she said something else she says lots of things i didnt come to go over all of that it was about the candlesticks brianna contin ued and had maggie lifting both brows what of them the ones i had on the sideboard the ones youd made me last year she said what pretty work they were with a laugh maggie shook her head youve been dreaming i was awake and standing in my own hallway she looked at me and she told me and she kept standing there looking at me until i understood that she couldnt say it to you herself but she wanted you to know why should she maggie said unsteadily i think it was a kind of apology for whatever passed between you in the dining room the best she could make when she saw i understood her she started in on lottie again so the two of them left the way theyd come in arguing well maggie had no idea how to react how to feel restlessly her fingers reached into her pocket to toy with the smooth glass drops its a small step but a step it is brisk brianna began to dust flour on her hands in preparation for kneading the next loaf shes happy in the house you gave her even if she doesnt know it yet you could be right her breath hitched a bit as she released it i hope you are but dont be planning any more family meals in the near future that i wont brianna maggie hesitated ended by look ing helplessly at her sister im driving to dublin today oh youll have a long day then youre needed at the gallery no im going to see rogan im either going to tell him im not going to see him again or that ill marry him marry him brianna hobbled the next ball of dough hes asked you to marry him the last night we were in france i told him no absolutely no i meant it i might still thats why im driving to give myself time to think it through ive realized that it has to be one or the other she fingered the glass drops in her pocket so im going and i wanted to tell you maggie brianna was left with her hands full of dough staring at the swinging back door the worst part was not finding him home and knowing she should have checked before making the drive at the gallery his butler had said but when she arrived there cursing dublin traffic all the way he was already gone and on the way to his office again she missed him by no more than five minutes she was informed he was heading to the airport and a flight to rome would she care to put through a call to his car phone she would not maggie decided stumble through one of the biggest decisions of her life over the telephone in the end she got back in her lorry and made the long lonely drive back to clare it was easy to call herself a fool and to tell herself she was better off not having found him at all exhausted by the hours of driving she slept like the dead until noon the next day then she tried to work i want the seeker in the forefront and the triad centered precisely rogan stood in the sunwashed showroom of worldwide gallery rome watching his staff arrange maggies work the sculptures stood up well in the gilded rococo decor the heavy red velvet hed chosen to drape the pedestals and tables added a royal touch something he was sure maggie would have complained about but which suited the clien tele of this particular gallery he checked his watch muttered to himself under his breath he had a meeting in twenty minutes there was no help for it he thought as he called out another order for a minute adjustment he was going to be late maggies influence he supposed shed corrupted his sense of time the gallery opens in fifteen minutes he re minded the staff expect some press and see that they each receive a catalog he scanned the room one last time noting the placement of each piece the fold of every drape well done he stepped outside into the bright italian sun where his driver waited im running late carlo rogan shifted into his seat and opened his briefcase carlo grinned tucked the chauffeurs cap lower on his brow and flexed his fingers like a concert pianist preparing to launch into an arpeggio not for long signore to rogans credit he barely lifted a brow as the car leaped like a tiger from the curb snarling and growling at the cars it cut off bracing himself in the corner of the seat rogan turned his attention to a printout of figures from his roman branch it had been an excellent year he decided far from the staggering boom of the mideighties but quite good enough he thought perhaps it was best that the days when a painting could demand hun dreds of millions of pounds at auction were over art with so high a price tag was too often hidden away in a vault until it was as soulless as gold bullion still it had been a profitable year profitable enough he thought that he could implement his idea of opening another smaller branch of world wide one that displayed and sold only the works of irish artists it had been a germ in his mind for the last few years but lately just lately it had grown a small even cozy gallery very accessible from the decor to the art itself a place that invited browsing with goodquality art priced in a range that invited owning yes he thought the time was perfect absolutely perfect the car screeched to a halt all but rearing up like a stallion carlo hurried out to open rogans door you are on time signore you are a magician carlo rogan spent thirty minutes with the head of the roman branch twice that in a board meeting then granted backtoback interviews to promote the concannon tour several hours were devoted to studying romes proposed acquisitions and to meeting artists he planned to fly to venice that evening and lay the groundwork for the next stop of the tour gauging his time he slipped away to place a few calls to dublin joseph rogan hows rome sunny ive finished up here i should be in venice by seven at the latest if theres time ill go by the gallery there tonight otherwise ill do the preliminaries tomorrow i have your schedule here youll be back in a week sooner if i can manage it anything i should know aiman was in i bought two of his street sketches theyre reasonably good thats fine ive an idea we might be able to sell more of his work after the first of the year oh a project ill discuss with you when i get back anything else i saw your grandmother and her friend off to galway rogan grunted brought him by the gallery did she he wanted to see some of maggies work in the proper setting hes quite the character he certainly is oh and speaking of maggie she was by earlier this week by there in dublin what for didnt say she sort of dashed in and out i didnt even speak with her myself she did send a shipment with what seems to be a message for you what message its blue rogans fingers paused on his notebook the message is blue no no the message reads its blue its a gorgeous piece rather delicate and willowy appar ently she thought youd know what she meant i do he smiled to himself rubbing the bridge of his nose its for the comte de lorraine paris a wedding present for his granddaughter youll want to contact him i will then oh and it seems maggie was by your office and the house as well i suppose she was looking for you for some reason it would seem so he debated a moment then acted on instinct joseph do me a favor contact the gallery in venice tell them ill be delayed a few days ill be glad to any reason ill let you know give patricia my best ill be in touch maggie drummed her fingers on a table in omal leys tapped her foot blew out a long breath tim will you give me a bookmakers sandwich to go with this pint i cant wait for murphy all bloody after noon on an empty stomach happy to do it got a date do you he grinned at her from over the bar wriggled his eyebrows hah the day when i date murphy muldoons the day i lose whats left of my mind he said he had some business in the village and would i meet him here she tapped the box on the floor with her ive got his birthday present for his mother something you made then aye and if hes not here by the time ive finished eating hell have to come fetch it himself alice muldoon said david ryan who sat at the bar puffing a cigarette she be living down to killarney now wouldnt she she would maggie agreed and has been these past ten years or more didnt think id seen her about married again did she after rory muldoon passed over she did tim took up the story while he built a pint of guinness married a rich doctor name of golin brennan kin to daniel brennan another patron picked up the tale musing over his bowl of stew you know he that runs a food store in clarecastle no no tim shook his head as he walked over to serve maggie her sandwich tisnt kin to daniel brennan but to bobby brennan from newmarket on fergus i think youre wrong about that david pointed with the stub of his cigarette ill wager two pounds on it done well ask murphy himself if he ever gets here maggie muttered and bit into her sandwich youd think i have nothing better to do than to sit here twiddling my thumbs i knew a brennan once the old man at the end of the bar spoke up paused blew a lazy smoke ring frankie brennan he was from ballybunion where i lived as a boy one night he was walking home from the pub had a fill of porter he did and never had head for it he blew another smoke ring time passed but no one spoke a story was in the making so he went walking home reeling a bit and cut across a field to shorten the way there was a fairy hill and in his drunken state he trod right over it well a man should know better drunk or sober but frankie brennan got less than his share when the lord passed out sense now of course the fairies had to teach him manners and respect and so they tugged off all his clothes as he went staggering across the field and he arrived home stark naked but for his hat and one shoe he paused again smiled never did find the other shoe maggie gave an appreciative hoot of laughter and propped her feet on the empty chair across from her they could keep paris and rome and the rest she thought she was just where she wanted to be then rogan walked in his entrance gained him some glances appraisals it wasnt often a man in so fine a suit strolled into omalleys on a cloudy afternoon maggie the pint glass nearly to her lips froze like stone good day to you is there something i can get you tim asked a pint of guinness thank you rogan leaned back against the bar smiled at maggie while tim turned the tap good day to you margaret mary what are you doing here why im about to have a pint still smiling he slid coins across the bar youre looking well i thought you were in rome i was your work shows well there would you be rogan sweeney then tim slid the glass to rogan i would yes im omalley tim omalley after wiping his hand over his apron tim took rogans and pumped i was a great friend of maggies father hed have been pleased with what youre doing for her pleased and proud weve a scrapbook started my deirdre and i i can promise you youll be adding to it mr omalley for some time to come if youve come to see if ive work to show you maggie called out i havent and i wont if you breathe down my neck i havent come to see your work with a nod to tim rogan walked to maggie he sat beside her took her chin in his hand and kissed her softly and kissed her long ive come to see you she let out the breath shed forgotten she was holding a frowning glance at the bar had the curious onlookers turning their attention elsewhere or pretending to you took your sweet time time enough for you to miss me ive hardly worked at all since you left because it was difficult to admit she kept her eyes trained on her glass ive started and stopped started and stopped nothings coming out the way i want it to i dont care far this feeling rogan i dont care for it at all what feeling is that she shot him a look from under her lashes ive been missing you i came to dublin i know he toyed with the ends of her hair it had a bit he noted and wondered how long it would be before she whacked away again with her i as she said she sometimes did was it so hard to come to me maggie yes it was as hard as anything ive done then you werent there im here now he was and she wasnt sure she could speak for the pounding of her heart there are things i want to tell you i dont she broke off as the door opened and murphy came in oh his timings perfect murphy signaled to tim before heading toward maggie youve had lunch then in a casual ges ture he scraped up a chair and snatched one of her chips did you bring it i did and youve kept me waiting half the day its barely one oclock eyeing rogan murphy ate another of maggies chips youd be sweeney would you i would twas the suit murphy explained maggie said how it was you dressed like every day was sunday im murphy muldoon maggies neighbor the first kiss rogan remembered and shook hands as cautiously as murphy its good to meet you and you murphy leaned his chair on its back legs as he did his measuring you could almost say im a brother to maggie as shes no man to look out for her and shes not needing one maggie tossed out she would have kicked murphys chair out from under him if he hadnt been quick enough to drop it in place again ill look out for myself very well thank you so shes often told me rogan addressed murphy but need or not she has one the message passed male to male after a moments consideration murphy nodded thats fine then did you bring it or not maggie i said i did in an impatient move she bent to grab the box from the floor and set it on the table between them if it wasnt for my fondness of your mother id bash it over your head shell be grateful you restrained yourself as tim plunked down another beer murphy opened the box this is grand maggie shell be pleased rogan imagined so the pale pink bowl was as fluid as water its sides waving up to end in delicate crests the glass was so thin so fragile he could see the shadow of murphys hands through it youll wish her a happy birthday for me as well i will murphy skimmed a callused finger over the glass before setting it back in the box fifty pounds was it it was maggie held out a hand palm up cash feigning reluctance murphy scratched his cheek it seems mighty dear for one little bowl maggie mae that you cant even eat from but my mother likes foolish useless things keep talking murphy and the pricell go up fifty pounds shaking his head murphy reached for his wallet he counted out the bills in her outstretched hand you know i couldve gotten her a whole set of dishes for that and maybe a fine new skillet and shed have knocked you in the head with it satisfied maggie tucked the bills away no woman wants a skillet for her birthday and any man who thinks she does deserves the consequences murphy david ryan shifted on his stool if youve finished your transaction there weve a ques tion for you then ill have to answer it taking up his beer murphy rose tis a fine suit mr sweeney he walked away to settle the wager of the brennans fifty pounds rogan murmured nodding to ward the box murphy had left on the table you and i are both aware that you could get more than twenty times that what of it instantly defensive she shoved her glass aside its my work and ill ask for it what i please youve got your damned exclusive clause sweeney so you can sue me if you like for breaking it but youll not have the bowl i didnt i gave my word to murphy she barreled on and a deals done you can have your cursed twentyfive percent of the fifty pounds but if i choose to make something for a friend it wasnt a complaint he wrapped his hand around her fisted one it was a compliment you have a generous heart maggie with the wind so successfully stripped from her sails she sighed the papers say im not to make anything that doesnt go to you the papers say that he agreed i imagine youll go on snarling about it and youll go on slipping your friends gifts when it suits you she shot him a look from under her lashes so blatantly guilty he laughed i see i could have sued you a time or two over the last few months we can make what wed call a side deal i wont take my percentage of your fifty pounds and youll make something for my grandmother for christmas she nodded lowered her lashes again it isnt just about money is it rogan im afraid sometimes that it is that ive let it be because i like the money you see i like it very much and all that goes with it its not just about money maggie its not just about champagne showings or newspaper clippings or parties in paris those are just trimmings what its about really is whats inside you and all that you are that goes into creating the beautiful the unique and the startling i cant go back you see i cant go back to the way things were before you she looked at him then studying his face feature by feature while his hand lay warm over hers will you take a drive with me theres something i want to show you i have a car outside ive already put your bike in it she had to smile i should have known you would with a fall wind in the air and the leaves a riot of color they drove toward loop hea away from the narrow road spilling back like the sea itself were harvested fields and the deep sweet green so special to ireland maggie saw the tumbled stone sheds that looked no different than they had when she had traveled this road nearly five years before the land was there and the people tended it as they always had always would when she heard the sea smelled the first sharp sting of it on the air her heart lurched she squeezed her eyes tight opened them again and read the sign last pub until new york shall we sail over to new york maggie and have a pint when the car stopped she said nothing only got out to let the wind slap cool over her skin reaching for rogans hand she held it as they walked down the beaten path to the sea the war continued wave against rock in the echoing crash and hiss that was eternal the mist had rolled in so that there was no border between sea and sky just a wide wide cup of soft gray i havent been here in almost five years i didnt know id ever come again to stand like this she pressed her lips together wishing the fist around her heart would loosen just a little my father died here wed come out together just us two it was winter and bitter cold but he loved this spot more than any other i can think of id sold some pieces that day to a merchant in ennis and wed celebrated in oma lleys you were alone with him the horror of it slashed rogan like a rapier he could do nothing for her but pull her into his arms and hold on im sorry maggie so sorry she brushed her cheek over the soft wool of rogans coat caught the scent of him in it she let her eyes close we talked about my mother their marriage id never understood why he stayed maybe i never will but there was something in him that yearned and that wanted for me and brianna what ever that yearning was i think i have the same longing but diat i might have the chance to grab hold of it she drew back so that she could look at his face as she spoke ive something for you watching him she took one of the glass drops from her pocket held it out in her palm it looks like a tear aye she waited while he held it to the light and studied it he rubbed a thumb over the smooth glass are you giving me your tears maggie perhaps i am she took another one out of her pocket it comes from dropping hot glass in water when you do some shatter right away but others hold and form strong she crouched and chose a rock while rogan watched she struck the glass with rock strong enough that it wont break under a hammer she rose again holding the undamaged drop it holds you see does nothing more than bounce away from the blow and shine but theres this thin end here and it only takes a careless twist she took the slim trailing end between her fingers the glass turned to harmless dust its gone you see like it never was a tear comes from the heart rogan said and neither should be handled carelessly i wont break yours maggie nor you mine no she took a long breath but well hammer away often enough were as different as that water and hot glass rogan and as able to make something strong between us i think we might yet i wonder how long youd last in a cottage in clare or i in a house full of servants in dublin we could move to the midlands he said and watched her smile actually ive given that particu lar matter some thought the idea maggie is nego tiation and compromise ah the businessman even at such a time he ignored the sarcasm ive plans to open a gallery in clare to spotlight irish artists in clare pushing back her windblown hair she stared at him a branch of worldwide here in clare youd do that for me i would im afraid ill spoil the heroics by telling you id thought of the idea long before i met you the conception had nothing to do with you but the location does or i should say it has to do with us as the wind picked up he pulled her jacket together and buttoned it i believe i can live in a westcounty cottage for part of the year just as you could live with servants for the other youve thought this all through i have yes certain aspects are of course nego tiable he studied the glass drop again before slipping it into his pocket there is one however that is not and that would be exclusivity again maggie in the form of a mar riage contract a lifetime term with no escape clauses the fist around her heart squeezed all the tighter youre a hard bargainer sweeney i am she looked out to sea again the ceaseless rush of water the indominable rock and the magic they made between them ive been happy alone she said quietly and ive been unhappy without you i never wanted to depend on anyone or to let myself care so much i could be made unhappy but i depend on you rogan gently she lifted a hand to his cheek and i love you the sweetness of hearing it swarmed through him he guided her palm over his lips i know and the fist so tight around her heart loosened you know she laughed shook her head oh it must be a fine thing to always be right its never been a finer thing he lifted her off her feet spun her around once before their lips met and clung the wind swooped down ribboned around them smelling of die sea if i can make you unhappy maggie then i can make you happy as well she squeezed her arms tight around him if you dont ill make your life hell i swear it god i never wanted to be a wife youll be mine and glad of it ill be yours she lifted her face to the wind and glad of it
