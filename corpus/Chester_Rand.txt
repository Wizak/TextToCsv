nestling among the pennsylvania mountains was silas tripp he kept the village store occasionally entertained travelers having three spare rooms was town treasurer and conspicuous in other local offices the store was in the center of the village nearly opposite the principal church there were two and here it was that the townspeople gathered to hear and discuss the news silas tripp had one assistant a stout pleasantlooking boy of fifteen who looked attractive despite his wellworn suit chester rand was the son of a widow who lived in a tiny cottage about fifty rods west of the presbyterian church of which by the way silas tripp was senior deacon for he was a leader in religious as well as secular affairs chesters father had died of pneumonia about four years before the story commences leaving his widow the cottage and about two hundred and fifty dollars this sum little by little had melted and a month previous the last dollar had been spent for the winters supply of coal mrs rand had earned a small income by plain sewing and binding shoes for a shoe shop in the village but to her dismay the announcement had just been made that the shop would close through the winter on account of the increased price of leather and overproduction during the year what shall we do chester she asked in alarm when the news came we cant live on your salary and i get very little sewing to do no mother said chester his own face reflecting her anxiety we cant live on three dollars a week i have been earning two dollars by binding shoes said mrs rand it has been hard enough to live on five dollars a week but i dont know how we can manage on three ill tell you what ill do mother ill ask mr tripp to raise my pay to four dollars a week but will he do it he is a very close man and always pleading poverty but i happen to know that he has ten thousand dollars invested in pennsylvania railroad stock i overheard him saying so to mr gardner ten thousand dollars it seems a fortune sighed mrs rand why do some people have so much and others so little it beats me mother but i dont think either of us would exchange places with silas tripp with all his money by the way mother mr tripp is a widower why dont you set your cap for him mrs rand smiled as her imagination conjured up the weazened and wrinkled face of the village storekeeper with his gray hair standing up straight on his head like a natural pompadour if you want mr tripp for a stepfather she said i will see what i can do to ingratiate myself with him no a thousand times no replied chester with a shudder id rather live on one meal a day than have you marry him i agree with you chester we will live for each other and hope for something to turn up i hope the first thing to turn up will be an increase of salary tomorrow is new years day and it will be a good time to ask accordingly that evening just as the store was about to close chester gathered up courage and said mr tripp well thats my name said silas looking over his ironbowed spectacles tomorrow is new years day what if tis i reckon i knew that without your tellin me i came here last new years day ive been here a year what if you have and i thought perhaps you might be willing to raise my salary to four dollars a week continued chester hurriedly oho thats what youre after is it said silas grimly you think im made of money i reckon now dont you no i dont but mr tripp mother and i find it very hard to get along really we do she wont have any more shoes to bind for three months to come on account of the shoe shops closing its going to hurt me too said silas with a frown when one business suspends it affects all the rest ill have mighty hard work to make both ends meet this struck chester as ludicrous but he did not feel inclined to laugh here was silas tripp gathering in trade from the entire village and getting not a little in addition from outlying towns complaining that he would find it hard to make both ends meet though everyone said that he did not spend onethird of his income on the whole things did not look very encouraging perhaps he said nervously you would raise me to three dollars and a half what is the boy thinkin of you must think im made of money why three dollars is hansome pay for what little you do why i work fourteen hours a day retorted chester im afraid youre gettin lazy boys shouldnt complain of their work the fact is chester i feel as if i was payin you too much too much three dollars a week too much too much considerin the state of business and yourself bein a boy ive been meanin to tell you that ive got a chance to get a cheaper boy who is it asked chester in dismay its abel wood abel wood is every mite as big and strong as you are and he come round last evenin and said hed work for two dollars and a quarter a week i couldnt work for that said chester i dont mind bein generous considerin youve been working for me more than a year ill give you two dollars and a half thats twentyfive cents moren the wood boy is willin to take abel wood doesnt know anything about store work ill soon learn him sitooated as i am i feel that i must look after every penny and mr tripps face looked meaner and more weazened than ever as he fixed his small beadlike eyes on his boy clerk then i guess ill have to leave you mr tripp said chester with a deep feeling of disgust and dismay do just as you like said his employer youre onreasonable to expect to get high pay when business is dull high pay repeated chester bitterly three dollars a week its what i call high pay when i was a boy i only earned two dollars a week money would go further when you were a boy yes it did boys wasnt so extravagant in them days i dont believe you were ever extravagant mr tripp said chester with a tinge of sarcasm which his employer didnt detect no i wasnt i dont want to brag but i never spent a cent foolishly do you know how much money i spent the first three months i was at work a dollar guessed chester a dollar repeated mr tripp in a tone of disapproval no i only spent thirtyseven cents then i dont wonder you got rich said chester with a curl of the lip i aint rich said silas tripp cautiously who told you i was everybody says so then everybody is wrong im a leetle forehanded thats all ive heard people say you could afford to give up work and live on the interest of your money silas tripp held up his hands as if astounded taint so he said sharply if i gave up business id soon be in the poorhouse well what do you say will you stay along and work for two dollars and a half a week i couldnt do it said chester troubled all right its jest as you say your week ends tomorrow night if you see abel wood you can tell him i want to see him i will answered chester bitterly as he walked home he felt very despondent wouldnt it have been better he asked himself to accept reduced wages than to give up his job it would have been hard enough to attempt living on two dollars and a half a week but that was better than no income at all and yet it looked so mean in silas tripp to present such an alternative when he was abundantly able to give him the increase he asked for i must tell mother and see what she thinks about it he said to himself chapter ii out of work chester had a talk with his mother that evening she felt indignant at silas tripps meanness but advised chester to remain in the store for the present id rather work anywhere else for two dollars said chester bitterly it would be humiliating enough to accept the reduction but he felt that duty to his mother required the sacrifice he started on his way to the store in the morning prepared to notify mr tripp that he would remain but he found that it was too late just before he reached the store he met abel wood a loosejointed towheaded boy with a stout body and extraordinarily long legs who greeted him with a grin im goin to work in your place monday mornin he said has mr tripp spoken to you asked chester his heart sinking yes he said you was goin to leave whats up mr tripp cut down my wages said chester i couldnt work for two dollars and a half hes only goin to give me two and a quarter you can afford to work for that your fathers got steady work yes but all the same ill ask for more in a few weeks where are you goin to work i dont know yet answered chester sadly its awful hard to get a place in wyncombe i suppose it is i hope something will turn up he tried to speak hopefully but there was very little hope in his heart he went about his work in a mechanical way but neglected nothing when the time came for the store to close silas tripp took three dollars from the drawer and handed it to him saying theres your wages chester i expect its the last ill pay you yes sir i suppose so i dont know how ill like the wood boy he haint no experience hell get it sir if you want to stay for two and a quarter the same im going to give him ill tell him ive changed my mind no sir it wouldnt be right to put him off now i guess ill get something else to do he turned and left the store walking with a slower step than usual his heart was heavy for he felt that poorly as they lived hitherto they must live more poorly still in the days to come he reached home at last and put the three dollars in his mothers hands i dont know when i shall have any more money to give you mother he said it looks dark chester but the lord reigns he will still be our friend there was something in these simple words that cheered chester and a weight seemed lifted from his heart he felt that they were not quite friendless and that there was still one kinder and more powerful than any earthly friend to whom they could look for help when monday morning came he rose at the usual hour and breakfasted ill go out and take a walk mother he said perhaps i may find some work somewhere almost unconsciously he took the familiar way to the store and paused at a little distance from it he saw abel come out with some packages to carry to a customer it pained him to see another boy in his place and he turned away with a sigh during the night four or five inches of snow had fallen this gave him an idea as he came to the house of the misses cleveland two maiden sisters who lived in a small cottage set back fifty feet from the road he opened the gate and went up to the front door miss jane cleveland opened it for him goodmorning chester she said goodmorning miss cleveland i thought you might want to get a path shoveled to the gate so i would hannah tried to do it last time it snowed but she caught an awful cold but aint you working up at the store not now mr tripp cut down my wages and i left do tell have you got another place not just yet i thought id do any little jobs that came along till i got one thats right whatll you charge to shovel a path chester hesitated fifteen cents he answered at last ill give you ten moneys skerce chester reflected that he could probably do the job in half an hour and he accepted it cheered him to think he was earning something however small he worked with a will and in twentyfive minutes the work was done youre spry said jane cleveland when he brought the shovel to the door it took hannah twice as long and she didnt do it as well it isnt the kind of work for ladies replied chester wait till i fetch the money miss cleveland went into the house and returned with a nickel and four pennies im reely ashamed she said ill have to owe you a cent but heres a mince pie ive just baked take it home to your ma maybe itll come handy ill try to think of the other cent next time you come along dont trouble yourself about it miss cleveland the pie is worth a good deal more than the cent motherll be very much obliged to you shes very welcome im sure said the kindly spinster i hope youll get work soon chester thank you chester made his way homeward as he did not care to carry the pie about with him his mother looked at him in surprise as he entered the house what have you there chester she asked a pie from miss cleveland but how came she to give you a pie i shoveled a path for her and she gave me a pie and ten cents no nine so you see mother ive earned something this week i take it as a good omen a willing hand will generally find work to do how are you off for wood mother there is some left chester ill go out in the yard and work at the wood pile till dinner time then this afternoon i will go out again and see if i can find some more paths to shovel but chester was not destined to earn any more money that day as a general thing the village people shoveled their own paths and would regard hiring such work done as sinful extravagance chester did however find some work to do about halfpast three he met abel wood tugging a large basket filled with groceries to the ministers house he had set it down and was resting his tired arms when chester came along give me a lift with this basket chester thats a good fellow said abel chester lifted it yes it is heavy he said the ministers got some company went on abel and hes given an extra large order how do you like working in the store abel its hard work harder than i thought but remember what a magnificent salary you will get said chester with a smile it aint half enough say chester old tripp is rich aint he i should call myself rich if i had his money hes a miserly old hunks then to give me such small pay dont let him hear you say so ill take care of that come youll help me wont you yes answered chester goodnaturedly i might as well as i have nothing else to do between the two the basket was easily carried in a short time they had reached the ministers house they took the basket around to the side door just as mr morris the minister came out accompanied by a young man who was evidently a stranger in the village as chester did not remember having seen him before chester said the minister kindly how does it happen that you have an assistant today i am the assistant mr morris abel is mr tripps new boy indeed i am surprised to hear that when did you leave the store last saturday night have you another place not yet are you at leisure this afternoon yes sir then perhaps you will walk around with my friend mr conrad and show him the village i was going with him but i have some writing to do and you will do just as well i shall be very happy to go with mr conrad said chester politely and i shall be very glad to have you said the young man with a pleasant smile come back to supper chester said the minister that is if your mother can spare you thank you sir i suppose you will be able to carry back the empty basket abel added chester as his successor emerged from the side door relieved of his burden i guess so answered abel with a grin i was never in wyncombe before began mr conrad though i am a second cousin of your minister mr morris i have to go away tomorrow morning and wish to see a little of the town while i am here where do you live mr conrad in the city of new york are you a minister too oh no laughed the young man i am in a very different business i am an artist in a small way i make sketches for books and magazines and does that pay fairly well i earn a comfortable living i didnt know one could get money for making pictures i like to draw myself i will see what you can do this evening that is if you accept my cousins invitation before the walk was over chester had become much interested in his new friend he listened eagerly to his stories of the great city and felt that life must be much better worth living there than in wyncombe chapter iii a noteworthy evening chester enjoyed his supper mr morris though a minister had none of the starched dignity that many of his profession think it necessary to assume he was kindly and genial with a pleasant humor that made him agreeable company for the young as well as the old mr conrad spoke much of new york and his experiences there and chester listened to him eagerly you have never been to new york chester said the young artist no sir but i have read about it and dreamed about it sometime i hope to go there i think that is the dream of every country boy well it is the country boys that make the most successful men how do you account for that herbert asked the minister generally they have been brought up to work and work more earnestly than the city boys when the supper table was cleared mr conrad took from his valise two or three of the latest issues of puck judge and life he handed them to chester who looked over them eagerly do you ever contribute to these papers mr conrad he asked yes here is a sketch in judge and another in life which i furnished and do you get good pay for them i received ten dollars for each chesters eyes opened with surprise why he said they are small it couldnt have taken you long to draw them probably half an hour for each one and you received ten dollars each yes but dont gauge such work by the time it takes it is the idea that is of value the execution is a minor matter chester looked thoughtful i should like to be an artist he said after a pause wont you give me a specimen of your work you have seen mine i have not done any comic work but i think i could here is a piece of drawing paper now let me see what you can do chester leaned his head on his hand and began to think he was in search of an idea the young artist watched him with interest at last his face brightened up he seized the pencil and began to draw rapidly in twenty minutes he handed the paper to mr conrad the latter looked at it in amazement why you are an artist he said i had no idea you were capable of such work i am glad you like it said chester much pleased how long have you been drawing ever since i can remember i used to make pictures in school on my slate some of them got me into trouble with the teacher i can imagine it if you caricatured him did you ever take lessons no there was no one in wyncombe to teach me but i got hold of a drawing book once and that helped me do you know what i am going to do with this sketch of yours chester looked an inquiry i will take it to new york with me and see if i can dispose of it i am afraid it wont be of much use mr conrad i am only a boy if a sketch is good it doesnt matter how old or young an artist is i should like very much to get something for it even fifty cents would be acceptable you hold your talent cheap chester said mr conrad with a smile i shall certainly ask more than that for it as i dont approve of cheapening artistic labor the rest of the evening passed pleasantly when chester rose to go mr conrad said take these papers chester you can study them at your leisure and if any happy thoughts or brilliant ideas come to you dash them off and send them to me i might do something with them thank you sir what is your address number one ninetynine west thirtyfourth street well goodby i am glad to have met you sometime you may be an artist chester flushed with pride and a new hope rose in his breast he had always enjoyed drawing but no one had ever encouraged him in it even his mother thought of it only as a pleasant diversion for him as to its bringing him in money the idea had never occurred to him it seemed wonderful indeed that a little sketch the work of half an hour should bring ten dollars why compare with this the hours of toil in a grocery store seventy at least which had been necessary to earn the small sum of three dollars for the first time chester began to understand the difference between manual and intelligent labor it was ten oclock when chester left the ministers house a late hour in wyncombe and he had nearly reached his own modest home before he met anyone then he overtook a man of perhaps thirty thinly clad and shivering in the bitter wintry wind he was a stranger evidently for chester knew everyone in the village and he was tempted to look back the young man encouraged perhaps by this evidence of interest spoke hurriedly do you know he asked where i can get a bed for the night mr tripp has a few rooms that he lets to strangers he is the storekeeper the young man laughed but there was no merriment in the laugh oh yes i know silas tripp he said then you have been in wyncombe before i never lived here but i know silas tripp better than i want to he is my uncle your uncle exclaimed chester in surprise yes i am his sisters son my name is walter bruce then i should think your uncles house was the place for you i have no money to pay for a bed but if you are a relation that makes no difference to silas tripp he has no love for poor relations you dont know him very well i ought to for i have worked for him in the store for a year i didnt see you in there this evening i left him last saturday evening there is another boy there now why did you leave him because he wanted to cut down my wages from three dollars to two dollars and a quarter just like uncle silas i see you know him have you seen him since you came to wyncombe i was in the store this evening did you make yourself known to him yes didnt he invite you to spend the night in the house not he he saw by my dress that i was poor and gave me a lecture on my shiftless ways still he might have taken care of you for one night he wouldnt he told me he washed his hands of me chester looked sober he was shocked by silas tripps want of humanity you asked me where you could find a bed he said come home with me and i can promise you shelter for one night at least thank you boy said bruce grasping chesters hand you have a heart but perhaps your parents might object i have no father my mother is always ready to do a kind act then i will accept your kind offer i feared i should have to stay out all night and without an overcoat said chester compassionately yes i had to part with my overcoat long since i could not afford such a luxury i suppose you understand you sold it no i pawned it i didnt get much for it only three dollars but it would be as easy for me to take the church and move it across the street as to redeem it you appear to have been unfortunate yes fortune and i are at odds yet i ought to have some money hows that when my mother died uncle silas acted as executor of her estate it was always supposed that she had some money probably from two to three thousand dollars but when uncle silas rendered in his account it had dwindled to one hundred and twentyfive dollars of course that didnt last me long do you think that he acted wrongfully asked chester startled do i think so i have no doubt of it you know money is his god yet to cheat his own nephew would be so base is there anything too base for such a man to do to get money the young man spoke bitterly by this time they had reached chesters home his mother was still up she looked up in surprise at her sons companion mother said chester this is mr bruce do you think we can give him a bed why certainly replied mrs rand cordially have you had supper sir i wouldnt like to trouble you maam it will be no trouble i can make some tea in five minutes chester take out the bread and butter and cold meat from the closet so before he went to bed the homeless wayfarer was provided with a warm meal and the world seemed brighter and more cheerful to him chapter iv a dying gift in the morning walter bruce came down to breakfast looking pale and sick he had taken a severe cold from scanty clothing and exposure to the winter weather you have a hard cough mr bruce said mrs rand in a tone of sympathy yes madam my lungs were always sensitive when breakfast was over he took his hat and prepared to go i thank you very much for your kind hospitality he began then he was attacked by a fit of coughing where are you going mr bruce asked chester i dont know he answered despondently i came to wyncombe to see my uncle silas but he will have nothing to say to me chester and his mother exchanged looks the same thought was in the mind of each stay with us a day or two said mrs rand you are not fit to travel you need rest and care but i shall be giving you a great deal of trouble we shall not consider it such said mrs rand then i will accept your kind offer for indeed i am very unwell before the end of the day the young man was obliged to go to bed and a doctor was summoned bruce was pronounced to have a low fever and to be quite unfit to travel mrs rand and chester began to feel anxious their hearts were filled with pity for the young man but how could they bear the expense which this sickness would entail upon them silas tripp is his uncle said mrs rand he ought to contribute the expense of his sickness i will go and see him said chester so he selected a time when business would be slack in the store and called in he found mr trip in a peevish mood how are you chester he said i wish you was back why mr tripp youve got abel wood in my place he aint of much account grumbled silas what do you think he done this mornin i dont know sir he smashed two dozen eggs and eggs twentytwo cents a dozen but ill take it out of his salary hes dreadful awkward that boy poor abel thought chester i am afraid he wont have much salary coming to him at the end of the week you never broke no eggs while you was here chester no i dont think i did youd ought to have stayed i couldnt stay on the salary you offered but mr tripp ive come here on business hey what about your nephew walter bruce is staying at our house is he returned silas tripp indifferently and he is sick i dont feel no interest in him said silas doggedly are you willing to pay his expenses he has no money no i aint snarled silas ef you take him you take him at your own risk you wouldnt have us turn him into the street said chester indignantly you can do as you like it aint no affair of mine i spose he sent you here no he didnt and i wouldnt have come if we had been better fixed but we havent enough money to live on ourselves then tell him to go away i never wanted him to come to wyncombe it seems to me you ought to do something for your own nephew i cant support all my relations and i wont said silas testily it aint no use talkin walter bruce is shifless and lazy or hed take care of himself i aint no call to keep him then you wont do anything for him even two dollars a week would help him very much two dollars a week ejaculated silas you must think i am made of money why two dollars a week would make a hundred and four dollars a year that wouldnt be much for a man of your means mr tripp you talk foolish chester i have to work hard for a livin if i helped all my shifless relations id end my days in the poorhouse i dont think youll go there from that cause chester could not help saying i guess not i aint a fool let every tub stand on its own bottom i say but i wont be too hard heres twentyfive cents and silas took a battered quarter from the money drawer take it and use it careful i think we will try to get along without it said chester with a curl of the lip im afraid you cant afford it do just as you like said silas putting back the money with a sigh of relief but dont say i didnt offer to do something for walter no i will tell him how much you offered to give thats a queer boy said mr tripp as chester left the store seems to want me to pay all walter bruces expenses what made him come to wyncombe to get sick hed better have stayed where he lived and then hed have had a claim to go to the poorhouse he cant live on me i tell him that them rands are foolish to take him in theyre as poor as poverty themselves and now theyve taken in a man who aint no claim on them i expect they thought theyd get a good sum out of me for boardin him theres a great many onrasonable people in the world i will go and see mr morris the minister decided the perplexed chester he will tell me what to do accordingly he called on the minister and unfolded the story to sympathetic ears you did right chester said mr morris the poor fellow was fortunate to fall into your hands but wont it be too much for your mother its the expense i am thinking of mr morris you know i have lost my situation and mother has no shoes to bind i can help you chester a rich lady of my acquaintance sends me a hundred dollars every year to bestow in charity i will devote a part of this to the young man whom you have so kindly taken in say at the rate of eight dollars a week that will make us feel easy said chester gratefully how much do you think his uncle offered me i am surprised that he should have offered anything he handed me twentyfive cents but i told him i thought we could get along without it and you will silas tripp has a small soul hardly worth saving he has made money his god and serves his chosen deity faithfully i wouldnt change places with him for all his wealth some day you may be as rich as he but i hope if you are you will use your wealth better at the beginning of the third week walter bruce became suddenly worse his constitution was fragile and the disease had undermined his strength the doctor looked grave do you think i shall pull through doctor asked the young man while there is life there is hope mr bruce that means that the odds are against me yes i am sorry to say that you are right walter bruce looked thoughtful i dont think i care much for life he said i have had many disappointments and i know that at the best i could never be strong and enjoy life as most of my age do i am resigned how old are you walter asked chester twentynine it is a short life is there anyone you would wish me to notify if the worst comes no i have scarcely a relative except silas tripp he added with a bitter smile you have no property to dispose of by will asked the doctor yes was the unexpected answer but i shall not make a will a will may be contested i will give it away during my life chester and the doctor looked surprised they thought the other might refer to a ring or some small article i want everything to be legal resumed bruce is there a lawyer in the village yes lawyer gardener send for him i shall feel easier when i have attended to this last duty within half an hour the lawyer was at his bedside in the inside pocket of my coat said walter bruce you will find a document it is the deed of five lots in the town of tacoma in washington territory i was out there last year and having a little money bought the lots for a song they are worth very little now but some time they may be of value to whom do you wish to give them asked mr gardner to this boy answered bruce looking affectionately toward chester he and his have been my best friends but your uncle he is a relative suggested chester he has no claim upon me lawyer make out a deed of gift of these lots to chester rand and i will sign it the writing was completed bruce found strength to sign it and then sank back exhausted two days later he died of course the eight dollars a week from the ministers fund ceased to be paid to the rands chester had not succeeded in obtaining work to be sure he had the five lots in tacoma but he who had formerly owned them had died a pauper the outlook was very dark chapter v chesters first success chester and his mother and a few friends attended the funeral of walter bruce silas tripp was too busy at the store to pay this parting compliment to his nephew he expressed himself plainly about the folly of the rands in runnin into debt for a shifless fellow who had no claim upon them if they expect me to pay the funeral expenses theyre mistaken he added positively i aint no call to do it and i wont do it but he was not asked to defray the expenses of the simple funeral it was paid for out of the ministers charitable fund some time i will pay you back the money mr morris said chester i am mr bruces heir and it is right that i should pay very well chester if your bequest amounts to anything i will not object i hope for your sake that the lots may become valuable i dont expect it mr morris will you be kind enough to take care of the papers for me certainly chester i will keep them with my own papers at this time tacoma contained only four hundred inhabitants the northern pacific railroad had not been completed and there was no certainty when it would be so chester did not pay much attention or give much thought to his western property but began to look round anxiously for something to do during the sickness of walter bruce he had given up his time to helping his mother and the care of the sick man the money received from the minister enabled him to do this now the weekly income had ceased and it became a serious question what he should do to bring in an income he had almost forgotten his meeting with herbert conrad the young artist when the day after the funeral he received a letter in an unknown hand addressed to master chester rand wyncombe new york as he opened it his eyes opened wide with surprise and joy when two fivedollar bills fluttered to the ground for he had broken the seal in front of the post office he read the letter eagerly it ran thus dear chester i am glad to say that i have sold your sketch for ten dollars to one of the papers i showed you at wyncombe if you have any others ready send them along try to think up some bright original idea and illustrate it in your best style then send to me your sincere friend herbert chester hardly knew whether he was standing on his head or his heels it seems almost incredible that a sketch which he had dashed off in twenty minutes should bring in such a magnificent sum and for the first time it dawned upon him he was an artist fifty dollars gained in any other way would not have given him so much satisfaction why it was only three weeks that he had been out of a place and he had received more than he would have been paid in that time by mr tripp he decided to tell no one of his good luck but his mother and the minister if he were fortunate enough to earn more the neighbors might wonder as they pleased about the source of his supplies the money came at the right time for his mother needed some articles at the store he concluded to get them on the way home silas tripp was weighing out some sugar for a customer when chester entered silas eyed him sharply and was rather surprised to find him cheerful and in good spirits hows your mother this mornin chester asked the grocer pretty well thank you mr tripp are you doin anything yet there doesnt seem to be much work to do in wyncombe answered chester noncommittally you was foolish to leave a stiddy job at the store i couldnt afford to work for the money you offered me two dollars and a quarter is better than nothin i would have paid you two and a half i like you better than that wood boy is your mother workin she is doing a little sewing but she had no time for that with a sick man in the house i dont see what made you keep a man that was no kith or kin to you would you have had us put him into the street mr tripp id have laid the matter before the selecmen and got him into the poorhouse well it is all over now and im not sorry that we cared for the poor fellow i would like six pounds of sugar and two of butter you aint goin to run a bill be you asked silas cautiously i cant afford to trust out any more we dont owe you anything do we mr tripp no but i thought mebbe i will pay for the articles said chester briefly when he tendered the fivedollar bill silas tripp looked amazed where did you get so much money he gasped isnt it a good bill asked chester why yes but i think that is all you have a right to ask said chester firmly it cant make any difference to you where it came from i thought you were poor said mr tripp so we are but it seems strange that you should have so much money five dollars isnt much money mr tripp then a sudden idea came to silas tripp and he paused in weighing out the butter did my nephew leave any money he asked sharply yes sir then i lay claim to it im his only relation and it is right that i should have it you shall have it if you will pay the expense of his illness humph how much did he leave thirtyseven cents mr tripp looked discomfited you can keep it he said magnanimously i dont lay no claim to it thank you returned chester gravely then this fivedollar bill didnt come from him how could it he hadnt as much money in the world he was a shifless man a rolling stone gathers no moss observed mr tripp in a moralizing tone you havent been a rolling stone mr tripp no ive stuck to the store year in and year out for thirtyfive years i aint had moren three days off in that time if i had your money mr tripp id go off and enjoy myself what and leave the store said silas aghast at the thought you could hire some one to run it i wouldnt find much left when i came back no i must stay at home and attend to business do your folks go to bed early chester not before ten answered chester in some surprise then ill call this evenin after the store is closed very well sir youll find us up the idea had occurred to mr tripp that mrs rand must be very short of money and might be induced to dispose of her place at a largely reduced figure it would be a goodpaying investment for him and he was not above taking advantage of a poor widows necessities of course neither mrs rand nor chester had any idea of his motives or intentions and they awaited his visit with considerable curiosity about fifteen minutes after nine a shuffling was heard at the door there was a knock and a minute later chester admitted the thin and shriveled figure of silas tripp goodevening mr tripp said mrs rand politely goodevenin maam i thought id call in and inquire how you were gettin along thank you mr tripp for the interest you show in our affairs we are not doing very well as you may imagine so i surmised maam so i surmised it cant be possible he is going to offer us a loan thought chester youve got a tidy little place here maam it isnt mortgaged i recon no sir why dont you sell it you need the money and you might hire another house or pay rent for this do you know of anyone that wants to buy it mr tripp mebbe id buy it myself jest to help you along answered silas cautiously how much would you be willing to give put in chester well i calculate real estates very low at present three hundred and fifty dollars would be a fair price mrs rand looked amazed three hundred and fifty dollars she ejaculated why it is worth at least seven hundred you couldnt get it maam thats a fancy price what rent would you charge in case we sold it to you mr tripp asked chester well say five dollars a month about sixteen or seventeen per cent on the purchase money well id have to pay taxes and repairs explained tripp i dont care to sell mr tripp said mrs rand decisively you may have to maam if we do we shall try to get somewhere near its real value just as you like maam said silas disappointed id pay you cash down if i decide to sell on your terms ill let you know said mrs rand oh well i aint set upon it i only wanted to do you a favor we appreciate your kindness said mrs rand dryly women dont know much about business muttered silas as he plodded home disappointed chapter vi robert ramsay mrs rand was as much amazed as chester himself at his success as an artist how long were you in making the drawing she asked twenty minutes and you received ten dollars it doesnt seem possible i wish i could work twenty minutes every week at that rate laughed chester it would pay me better than working for silas tripp perhaps you can get some more work of the same kind i shall send two more sketches to mr conrad in a day or two i shall take pains and do my best two days later chester sent on the sketches and then set about trying to find a job of some kind in the village he heard of only one an elderly farmer job dexter offered him a dollar a week and board if he would work for him he would have eight cows to milk morning and night the care of the barn and a multitude of chores to attend to how much will you give me if i board at home mr dexter asked chester i must have you in the house i cant have you trapesing home when you ought to be at work then i dont think i can come mr dexter a dollar a week wouldnt pay me a dollar a week and board is good pay for a boy said the farmer it may be for some boys but not for me chester reflected that if he worked all day at the farmers he could not do any artistic work and so would lose much more than he made the sketch sold by mr conrad brought him in as much as he would receive in ten weeks from farmer dexter wyncombe people dont seem very liberal mother said chester i thought mr tripp pretty close but job dexter beats him in the meantime he met abel wood carrying groceries to a family in the village have you got a place yet chester he asked no but i have a chance of one where at farmer dexters dont you go i worked for him once how did you like it it almost killed me i had to get up at half past four work till seven in the evening and all for a dollar a week and board was the board good inquired chester curiously it was the poorest livin i ever had mrs dexter dont know much about cookin we had baked beans for dinner three times a week because they were cheap and what was left was put on for breakfast the next mornin i like baked beans you wouldnt like them as mrs dexter cooked them and you wouldnt want them for six meals a week no i dont think i should said chester smiling how do you get along with silas tripp hes always scoldin he says i am not half as smart as you i am much obliged to mr tripp for his favorable opinion but he didnt think enough of me to give me decent pay hes awful mean hes talkin of reducin me to two dollars a week he says business is very poor and he isnt makin any money i wish you and i were making half as much as he theres one thing i dont understand chester you aint workin yet you seem to have money how do you know i have mr tripp says you came into the store three or four days ago and changed a fivedollar bill yes mr tripp seemed anxious to know where i got it you didnt use to have fivedollar bills chester when you were at work this fivedollar bill dropped down the chimney one fine morning said chester laughing i wish one would drop down my chimney but i must be gettin along or old tripp will give me hail columbia when i get back about nine oclock that evening as chester was returning from a lecture in the church he was accosted by a roughlooking fellow having very much the appearance of a tramp who seemed somewhat under the influence of liquor i say boss said the tramp cant you give a poor man a quarter to help him along are you out of work asked chester staying his step yes times is hard and work is scarce i havent earned anything for a month where do you come from from pittsburg answered the tramp with some hesitation what do you work at when you are employed i am a machinist is there any chance in that line here not in wyncombe thats what i thought how about that quarter i am out of work myself and quarters are scarce with me thats what you all say theres small show for a good industrious man chester thought to himself that if the stranger was a good industrious man he was unfortunate in his appearance i have sympathy for all who are out of work he said mother and i are poor when i did work i only got three dollars a week where did you work in mr tripps store in the center of the village i know its a twostory building aint it with a piazza yes has the old fellow got money oh yes silas tripp is rich so he didnt pay you much wages though no he feels poor i dare say he feels poorer than i do such men ought not to have money growled the tramp theyre keepin it out of the hands of honest men what sort of a lookin man is this man tripp is he as big as me oh no he is a thin driedup little man who looks as if he hadnt had a full meal of victuals in his life what time does he shut up shop about this time answered chester rather puzzled by the tramps persistence in asking questions whats your name chester rand cant you give me a quarter im awful hungry i aint had a bit to eat since yesterday i have no money to give you but if you will come to our house ill give you some supper where do you live about five minutes walk go ahead then im with you mrs rand looked up with surprise when the door opened and chester entered followed by an illlooking tramp whose clothes were redolent of tobacco and his breath of whisky mother said chester this man tells me that he hasnt had anything to eat since yesterday no more i havent spoke up the tramp in a hoarse voice he asked for some money i could not give him that but i told him we would give him some supper of course we will said mrs rand in a tone of sympathy she did not admire the appearance of her late visitor but her heart was alive to the appeal of a hungry man sit down sir she said and ill make some hot tea and that with some bread and butter and cold meat will refresh you thank you maam i aint overpartial to tea and my doctor tells me i need whisky you dont happen to have any whisky in the house do you this is a temperance house said chester we never keep whisky well maybe i can get along with the tea sighed the tramp in evident disappointment you look strong and healthy observed mrs rand i aint maam looks is very deceiving ive got a weakness here and he touched the pit of his stomach that calls for strengthenin drink but ill be glad of the victuals when the table was spread with an extemporized supper the unsavory visitor sat down and did full justice to it he even drank the tea though he made up a face and called it slops where did you come from sir asked mrs rand from chicago maam were you at work there what is your business im a blacksmith maam i thought you were a machinist and came from pittsburg interrupted chester in surprise i came here by way of pittsburg answered the tramp coughing i am machinist too his stories dont seem to hang together thought chester after supper the tramp who said his name was robert ramsay took out his pipe and began to smoke if it had not been a cold evening mrs rand who disliked tobacco would have asked him to smoke out of doors but as it was she tolerated it both chester and his mother feared that their unwelcome visitor would ask to stay all night and they would not have felt safe with him in the house but about a quarter past ten he got up and said he must be moving goodnight and good luck to you said chester same to you returned the tramp i wonder where hes going thought chester but when the next morning came he heard news that answered this question chapter vii silas tripp makes a discovery when silas tripp went into his store the next day he was startled to find a window in the rear was partially open how did that window come open abel he asked as abel wood entered the store i dont know sir it must have been you that opened it said his employer sternly i didnt do it mr tripp honest i didnt declared abel earnestly then how did it come open thats what i want to know i am sure i cant tell somebody might have come in during the night and robbed the store so there might its very mysterious such things didnt happen when chester was here abel made no answer but began to sweep out the store his first morning duty when silas spoke of the store being robbed he had no idea that such a robbing had taken place but he went to the money drawer and opened it to make sure all was safe instantly there was a cry of dismay abel he exclaimed ive been robbed theres a lot of money missing abel stopped sweeping and turned pale is that so mr tripp he asked faintly yes theres lemme see theres been burglars here oh this is terrible who could have done it mr tripp i dunno but the store was entered last night i never shall feel safe again groaned silas didnt they leave no traces ha heres a handkerchief said mr tripp taking the article from the top of a flour barrel and yes by gracious its marked chester rand you dont think he took the money ejaculated abel in openeyed wonder of course it must have been him he knew just where i kept the money and he could find his way about in the dark he knew the store so well i didnt think chester would do such a thing thats how he came by his fivedollar bill he came in bold as brass and paid me with my own money the young rascal but how could he do it if the money was took last night it was two or three days ago he paid you the fivedollar bill this was a poser but mr tripp was equal to the emergency he must have robbed me before he said you havent missed money before have you not to my knowledge but he must have took it abel i want you to go right over to the widow rands and tell chester i want to see him i dunno but id better send the constable after him shall i carry him his handkerchief no and dont tell him its been found i dont want to put him on his guard abel put his broom behind the door and betook himself to the house of mrs rand the widow herself opened the door is chester at home asked abel yes hes eating his breakfast do you want to see him well mr tripp wants to see him possibly he wants chester to give him a little extra help she thought wont you come in and take a cup of coffee while chester is finishing his breakfast she said thank you maam abel was a boy who was always ready to eat and drink and he accepted the invitation with alacrity so mr tripp wants to see me said chester do you know what its about hell tell you answered abel evasively chester was not specially interested or excited he finished his breakfast in a leisurely manner and then taking his hat went out with abel it occurred to him that mr tripp might be intending to discharge abel and wished to see if he would return to his old place so you dont know what he wants to see me about he asked well i have an idea answered abel in a mysterious tone what is it then oh i dassnt tell look here abel i wont stir a step till you do tell me you are acting very strangely well somethin terrible has happened abel ejaculated in excited tones whats it the store was robbed last night the store was robbed repeated chester what was taken oh lots and lots of money was taken from the drawer and the window in the back of the store was left open im sorry to hear it i didnt know there was anybody in wyncombe that would do such things does mr tripp suspect anybody yes he does who is it he thinks you done it chester stopped abruptly and looked amazed why the man must be crazy what on earth makes him think i would stoop to do such a thing cause your handkerchief was found on a flour barrel side of the money drawer my handkerchief who says it was my handkerchief your name was on it in one corner i seed it myself then a light dawned upon chester the tramp whom he and his mother had entertained the evening before must have picked up his handkerchief and left it in the store to divert suspicion from himself the detective instinct was born within chester and now he felt impatient to have the investigation proceed come on abel he said i want to see about this matter well you neednt walk so plaguy fast wouldnt if i was you why not cause youll probably have to go to jail ill tell you what id do well id hook it you mean run away yes thats the last thing id do mr tripp would have a right to think i was guilty in that case well aint you abel wood i have a great mind to give you a licking dont you know me any better than that then why did you leave the handkerchief on the flour barrel thatll come out in due time they were near the store where mr tripp was impatiently waiting for their appearance he did not anticipate abels staying to breakfast and his suspicions were excited ill bet chester rand has left town with the money he groaned oh its awful to have your hard earnins carried off so sudden ill send chester to jail unless he returns it every cent of it here abel entered the store followed by chester chapter viii a scene in the grocery store so youve come have you you young thief said silas sternly as chester entered the store aint you ashamed of yourself no im not chester answered boldly ive done nothing to be ashamed of oh you hardened young villain give me the money right off or ill send you to jail i hear from abel that the store was robbed last night and i suppose from what you say that you suspect me so i do then you are mistaken i spent all last night at home as my mother can testify then how came your handkerchief here demanded silas triumphantly holding up the article it must have been brought here oho you admit that do you i didnt know but youd say it came here itself no i dont think it did i thought youd own up arter a while i own up to nothing isnt the handkerchief yours yes then you stay here while abel goes for the constable youve got to be punished for such doins but ill give ye one chance give me back the money you took thirtyseven dollars and sixty cents and ill forgive ye and wont have you sent to jail that is a very kind offer mr tripp and if i had taken the money i would accept it and thank you but i didnt take it go for the constable abel and mind you hurry you just stay where you are chester rand dont you go for to run away chester smiled he felt that he had the key to the mystery but he chose to defer throwing light upon it on the way abel said chester please call at our house and ask my mother to come to the store all right chester the constable was the first to arrive whats wanted silas he asked for in country villages neighbors are very apt to call one another by their christian names theres been robbery and burglary mr boody responded mr tripp my store was robbed last night of thirtyseven dollars and sixty cents sho silas how you talk its true and there stands the thief i am sitting mr tripp said chester smiling see how he brazens it out what a hardened young villain he is come silas you must be crazy expostulated the constable who felt very friendly to chester chester wouldnt no more steal from you than i would i thought so myself but when i found his handkerchief marked with his name on a flour barrel i was convinced is that so chester yes the handkerchief is mine it wasnt here last night proceeded silas and it was here this morning it stands to reason that it couldnt have walked here itself and so of course it was brought here by this time two other villagers entered the store what do you say to that chester said the constable beginning to be shaken in his conviction of chesters innocence i agree with mr tripp it must have been brought here at this moment mrs rand and the minister whom she had met on the way entered the store glad to see you widder said silas tripp grimly i hope you aint agoin to stand up for your son in his didoes i shall certainly stand by chester mr tripp what is the trouble only that he came into my store in the silent watches of last night answered silas sarcastically and made off with thirtyseven dollars and sixty cents its a falsehood whoever says it exclaimed mrs rand hotly i supposed youd stand up for him sneered silas and for a very good reason during the silent watches of last night as you express it chester was at home and in bed to my certain knowledge while his handkerchief walked over here and robbed the store suggested silas tripp with withering sarcasm as he held up the telltale evidence of chesters dishonesty was this handkerchief found in the store asked mrs rand in surprise yes maam it was and i calculate youll find it hard to get over that evidence mrs rands face lighted up with a sudden conviction i think i can explain it she said quietly oh you can can you maybe you can tell who took the money i think i can all eyes were turned upon her in eager expectation a tramp called at our house last evening she said at about halfpast nine and i gave him a meal as he professed to be hungry and penniless it was some minutes after ten when he left the house he must have picked up chesters handkerchief and left it in your store after robbing the money drawer thats all very fine said silas incredulously but i dont know as there was any tramp nobody saw him but you i beg your pardon mr tripp said the minister but i saw him about halfpast ten walking in the direction of your store i was returning from visiting a sick parishioner when i met a man roughly dressed and of middle height walking up the street he was smoking a pipe he lighted it before leaving our house said mrs rand how did he know about my store demanded silas incredulously he was asking questions about you while he was eating his supper silas tripp was forced to confess though reluctantly that the case against chester was falling to the ground but he did not like to give up id like to know where chester got the money hes been flauntin round the last week he said probably he stole it from your store last night said the constable with goodnatured sarcasm that aint answerin the question i dont propose to answer the question said chester firmly where i got my money is no concern of mr tripp as long as i dont get it from him have i got to lose the money asked silas in a tragical tone its very hard on a poor man all present smiled for silas was one of the richest men in the village we might take up a contribution for you silas said the constable jocosely oh its all very well for you to joke about it considerin you didnt lose it at this moment abel wood who had been sweeping the piazza entered the store in excitement i say theres the tramp now he exclaimed where where asked one and another out in the street constable perkins has got him call him in said the minister a moment later constable perkins came in escorting the tramp who was evidently under the influence of strong potations and had difficulty in holding himself up where am i hiccoughed ramsay where did you find him mr perkins asked rev mr morris just outside of farmer dexters barn he was lying on the ground with a jug of whisky at his side it was my jug said silas he must have taken it from the store i didnt miss it before he must have took it away with him there warnt much whisky left in the jug he must have absorbed most of it now mr tripps indignation was turned against this new individual where is my money you villain he demanded hotly whazzer matter hiccoughed ramsay you came into my store last night and stole some money is zis zer store it was jolly fun and the inebriate laughed yes it is where is the money you took spent it for whisky no you didnt you found the whisky here ramsay made no reply he must have the money about him suggested the minister youd better search his pockets mr perkins the constable thrust his hand into the pocket of his helpless charge and drew out a roll of bills silas tripp uttered an exclamation of joy give it to me he said its my money the bills were counted and all were there not one was missing part of the silver could not be found it had probably slipped from his pocket for he had no opportunity of spending any mr tripp was so pleased to recover his bills that he neglected to complain of the silver coins that were missing but still he felt incensed against the thief youll suffer for this he said sternly eying the tramp over his glasses who says i will i say so youll have to go to jail im a spectable man hiccoughed the tramp im an honest man i aint done nothin why did you take my handkerchief last night asked chester the tramp laughed good joke wasnt it so theyd think it was you it came near being a bad joke for me do you think i robbed your store now mr tripp to this question silas tripp did not find it convenient to make an answer he was one of those men very numerous they are too who dislike to own themselves mistaken it seems to me mr tripp said the minister that you owe an apology to our young friend here for your false suspicions anybodyd suspect him when they found his handkerchief growled silas but now you know he was not concerned in the robbery you should make reparation i dont know where he got his money said silas theres suthin very mysterious about that fivedollar bill ive got another mr tripp said chester smiling like as not whered you get it i dont feel obliged to tell it looks bad thats all ive got to say said the storekeeper i think mr tripp you need not borrow any trouble on that score interposed the minister i know where chesters money comes from and i can assure you that it is honestly earned more so than that which you receive from the whisky you sell silas tripp was a little afraid of the minister who was very plainspoken and turned away muttering the crowd dispersed some following constable perkins who took his prisoner to the lockup chapter ix new plans for chester two days later chester found another letter from mr conrad at the post office in it were two bills a ten and a five mr conrad wrote i have disposed of your two sketches to the same paper the publisher offered me fifteen dollars for the two and i thought it best to accept have you ever thought of coming to new york to live you would be more favorably placed for disposing of your sketches and would find more subjects in a large city than in a small village the fear is that if you continue to live in wyncombe you will exhaust your invention there is one objection the precarious nature of the business you might sometimes go a month perhaps without selling a sketch and meanwhile your expenses would go on i think however that i have found a way of obviating this objection i have a friend mr bushnell who is in the real estate business and he will take you into his office on my recommendation he will pay you five dollars a week if he finds you satisfactory this will afford you a steady income which you can supplement by your art work if you decide to accept my suggestion come to new york next saturday and you can stay with me over sunday and go to work on monday morning your sincere friend herbert conrad chester read this letter in a tumult of excitement the great city had always had a fascination for him and he had hoped without much expectation of the hope being realized that he might one day find employment there now the opportunity had come but could he accept it the question arose how would his mother get along in his absence she would be almost entirely without income could he send her enough from the city to help her along he went to his mother and showed her the letter fifteen dollars she exclaimed why that is fine chester i shall begin to be proud of you indeed i am proud of you now i can hardly realize it myself mother i wont get too much elated for it may not last what do you think of mr conrads proposal to go to new york yes mrs rands countenance fell i dont see how i can spare you chester she said soberly if there were any chance of making a living in wyncombe it would be different you might go back to mr tripps store after he had charged me with stealing no mother i will never serve silas tripp again there might be some other chance but there isnt mother by the way i heard at the post office that the shoe manufactory will open again in three weeks thats good news i shall have some more binding to do and i can send you something every week from new york but i will be so lonely chester with no one else in the house that is true mother but i wont let that stand in the way you may have prospects in new york you have none here and as mr conrad says i am likely to run out of subjects for sketches i think i shall have to give my consent then thank you mother said chester joyfully i will do what i can to pay you for the sacrifice you are making just then the doorbell rang it is mr gardener the lawyer said chester looking from the window a moment later he admitted the lawyer well chester said mr gardener pleasantly have you disposed of your lots in tacoma yet no mr gardener in fact i had almost forgotten about them sometime they may prove valuable i wish it might be soon i fancy you will have to wait a few years by the time you are twentyone you may come into a competence i wont think of it till then thats right work as if you had nothing to look forward to you dont want to take me into your office and make a lawyer of me mr gardener do you law in wyncombe does not offer any inducements if i depended on my law business i should fare poorly but thanks to a frugal and industrious father i have a fair income outside of my earnings mrs rand my visit this morning is to you how would you like to take a boarder chester and his mother looked surprised who is it mr gardener i have a cousin a lady of forty who thinks of settling down in wyncombe she thinks country air will be more favorable to her health than the city probably she is used to better accommodations than she would find here my cousin will be satisfied with a modest home we have but two chambers mine and chesters but you know mother i am going to new york to work thats true your room will be vacant mr gardener looked surprised isnt this something new he asked about you going to new york i mean yes sir that letter from mr conrad will explain all mr gardener read the letter attentively i think the plan a good one he said you will find that you will work better in a great city then if my cousin comes your mother will not be so lonesome it is the very thing said chester enthusiastically what is your cousins name mr gardener asked the widow miss jane dolby she is a spinster and at her age there is not much chance of her changing her condition shall i write her that you will receive her yes i shall be glad to do so and as miss dolby is a business woman she will expect me to tell her your terms will four dollars a week be too much asked mrs rand in a tone of hesitation four dollars my dear madam do you consider it too much i am afraid i could not afford to say less i consider it too little my cousin is a woman of means i will tell her your terms are eight dollars a week including washing but will she be willing to pay so much she pays twelve dollars a week in the city and could afford to pay more she is not mean but is always willing to pay a good price i can manage very comfortably on that sum said mrs rand brightening up i hope i shall be able to make your cousin comfortable i am sure of it miss dolby is a very sociable lady and if you are willing to hear her talk she will be content she will keep me from feeling lonesome when mr gardener left the house chester said all things seem to be working in aid of my plans mother i feel much more comfortable now that you will have company besides chester you will not need to send me any money the money miss dolby pays me will be sufficient to defray the expenses of the table and i shall still have some time for binding shoes then i hope i may be able to save some money during the afternoon chester went to the store to buy groceries mr tripp himself filled the order he seemed disposed to be friendly your money holds out well chester he said as he made change for a twodollar bill yes mr tripp i cant understand it for my part your mother must be a good manager yes mr tripp she is youd orter come back to work for me chester but you have got a boy already the wood boy aint worth shucks he aint got no push and hes allus forgettin his errands if youll come next monday ill pay you two dollars and a half a week thats pooty good for these times im sorry to disappoint you mr tripp but i am going to work somewhere else where asked silas in great surprise in new york answered chester proudly you dont say howd you get it mr conrad an artist a friend of the minister got it for me is your mother willin to have you go she will miss me but she thinks it will be for my advantage hows she goin to live it will take all you can earn to pay your own way in a big city in fact i dont believe you can do it ill try mr tripp chester did not care to mention the new boarder that was expected as he thought it probable that mr tripp who always looked out for his own interests would try to induce miss dolby to board with him as mr tripp had the reputation of keeping a very poor table he had never succeeded in retaining a boarder over four weeks chester found that his clothing needed replenishing and ventured to spend five dollars for small articles such as handkerchiefs socks etc saturday morning he walked to the depot with a small gripsack in his hand and bought a ticket for new york chapter x a railroad acquaintance the distance by rail from wyncombe to new york is fifty miles when about eight years of age chester had made the journey but not since then everything was new to him and of course interesting his attention was drawn from the scenery by the passage of a train boy through the cars with a bundle of new magazines and papers here is all the magazines puck and judge how much do you charge for puck asked chester with interest for it was puck that had accepted his first sketch ten cents give me one chester took the paper and handed the train boy a dime then he began to look over the pages all at once he gave a start his face flushed his heart beat with excitement there was his sketch looking much more attractive on the fair pages of the periodical than it had done in his pencil drawing he kept looking at it it seemed to have a fascination for him it was his first appearance in a paper and it was a proud moment for him what are you looking at so intently my son asked the gentleman who sat at his side he was a man of perhaps middle age and he wore spectacles which gave him a literary aspect i i am looking at this sketch answered chester in slight confusion let me see it chester handed over the paper and regarded his seat mate with some anxiety he wanted to see what impression this his maiden effort would have on a staid man of middle age ha very good said his companion but i dont see anything very remarkable about it yet you were looking at it for as much as five minutes because it is mine said chester half proudly half in embarrassment ah that is different did you really design it yes sir i suppose you got pay for it i understand puck pays for everything it publishes yes sir i got ten dollars ten dollars repeated the gentleman in surprise really that is very handsome do you often produce such sketches i have just begun sir that is the first i have had published you are beginning young how old are you i am almost sixteen that is young for an artist why i am fortyfive and i havent a particle of talent in that direction my youngest son asked me the other day to draw a cow on the slate i did as well as i could and what do you think he said what did he say asked chester interested he said papa if it wasnt for the horns i should think it was a horse chester laughed it was a joke he could appreciate i suppose all cannot draw he said it seems not may i ask you if you live in new york the city i mean no sir but you are going there yes sir to live i hope so a friend has written advising me to come he says i will be better placed to do art work and dispose of my sketches are you expecting to earn your living that way i hope to some time but not at first i am glad to hear it i should think you would find it very precarious i expect to work in a real estate office at five dollars a week and only to spend my leisure hours in art work that seems sensible have you been living in the country yes sir in wyncombe i have heard of the place but was never there so you are just beginning the battle of life yes sir it has just occurred to me that i may be able to throw some work in your way i am writing an ethnological work and it will need to be illustrated i cant afford to pay such prices as you receive from puck and other periodicals of the same class but then the work will not be original it will consist chiefly of copies i should think i might need a hundred illustrations and i am afraid i could not pay more than two dollars each a hundred illustrations at two dollars each why that would amount to two hundred dollars and there would be no racking his brains for original ideas if you think i can do the work sir i shall be glad to undertake it said chester eagerly i have no doubt you can do it for it will not require an expert suppose you call upon me some evening within a week i will do so gladly sir if you will tell me where you live here is my card said his companion drawing out his case and handing a card to chester this was what chester read prof edgar hazlitt do you know where lexington avenue is asked the professor i know very little about new york in fact nothing at all chester was obliged to confess you will soon find your way about i have no doubt you will find me and the professor mentioned the number shall we say next wednesday evening at eight oclock sharp thats if you have no engagement for that evening he added with a smile chester laughed at the idea of his having any evening engagements in a city which he had not seen for eight years if you are engaged to dine with william vanderbilt or jay gould on that evening continued the professor with a merry look i will say thursday if i find i am engaged in either place i think i can get off said chester then wednesday evening let it be as the train neared new york chester began to be solicitous about finding mr conrad in waiting for him he knew nothing about the city and would feel quite helpless should the artist not be present to meet him he left the car and walked slowly along the platform looking eagerly on all sides for the expected friendly face but nowhere could he see herbert conrad in some agitation he took from his pocket the card containing his friends address and he could hardly help inwardly reproaching him for leaving an inexperienced boy in the lurch he was already beginning to feel homesick and forlorn when a brightlooking lad of twelve with lightbrown hair came up and asked is this chester rand yes answered chester in surprise how do you know my name i was sent here by mr conrad to meet you chester brightened up at once so his friend had not forgotten him after all mr conrad couldnt come to meet you as he had an important engagement so he sent me to bring you to his room i am rob fisher i suppose that means robert fisher yes but everybody calls me rob are you a relation of mr conrad yes i am his cousin i live just outside of the city but i am visiting my cousin for the day i suppose you dont know much about new york i know nothing at all i am pretty well posted and i come into the city pretty often just follow me shall i carry your valise oh no i am older than you and better able to carry it what street is this fortysecond street we will go to fifth avenue and then walk down to thirtyfourth street that is where mr conrad lives isnt it yes it is one of the wide streets like fourteenth and twentythird and this street there are some fine houses here i should think so you live in wyncombe dont you yes the houses are all of wood there i suppose so mr conrad tells me you are an artist said rob eying his new friend with curiosity in a small way i should like to see some of your pictures i can show you one and chester opened his copy of puck and pointed to the sketch already referred to did you really draw this yourself yes and did you get any money for it ten dollars answered chester with natural pride my i wish i could get money for drawing perhaps you can some time bob shook his head i havent any talent that way what house is that asked chester pointing to the marble mansion at the corner of thirtyfourth street that used to belong to a t stewart the great merchant i suppose you havent any houses like that in wyncombe oh no we will turn down here this is thirtyfourth street they kept on crossing sixth and seventh avenues and presently stood in front of a neat brownstone house between seventh and eighth avenues that is where mr conrad lives said rob chapter xi chesters first experiences in new york the bell was rung and a servant opened the door i will go up to mr conrads room said rob the servant knew him and no objection was made they went up two flights to the front room on the third floor rob opened the door without ceremony and entered followed by chester he found himself in a spacious room neatly furnished and hung around with engravings with here and there an oil painting there was a table near the window with a portfolio on it here no doubt mr conrad did some of his work there was no bed in the room but through an open door chester saw a connecting bedroom this is a nice room he said yes cousin herbert likes to be comfortable here give me your valise and make yourself at home chester sat down by the window and gazed out on the broad street it was a pleasant sunny day and everything looked bright and attractive you are going to live in new york arent you asked rob yes if i can make a living here i guess cousin herbert will help you he has already he has obtained a place for me in a real estate office at five dollars a week i think i could live on five dollars a week i suppose it costs considerable to live in new york chester felt no apprehension however he was sure he should succeed and indeed he had reason to feel encouraged for had he not already engaged two hundred dollars worth of work and this sum seemed as much to him as two thousand would have done to mr conrad an hour glided by rapidly and then a step was heard on the stairs thats cousin herbert said rob and he ran to open the door hello rob did you find chester yes here he is glad to see you chester said the artist shaking his hand cordially you must excuse my not going to meet you but i was busily engaged on a large drawing for harpers weekly and feeling in a favorable mood i didnt want to lose the benefit of my inspiration you will find when you have more experience that an artist can accomplish three times as much when in the mood i am glad you didnt leave off for me rob has taken good care of me yes rob is used to the city i thought you would be in safe hands and how do you like my quarters they are very pleasant and the street is so wide too yes i like thirtyfourth street i lodge but i dont board here chester was surprised to hear this in wyncombe everyone took his meals in the same house in which he lodged and that reminds me dont you feel hungry i dont ask rob for he always has an appetite how is it with you chester i took a very early breakfast so i thought laughed conrad well put on our coats and well go to trainors they walked over to sixth avenue and entered a restaurant adjoining the standard theater it was handsomely decorated and seemed to chester quite the finest room he was ever in ranged in three rows were small tables each designed for four persons one of these was vacant and conrad took a seat on one side placing the two boys opposite now he said i had better do the ordering we will each order a different dish and by sharing them we will have a variety there is no need to mention of what the dinner consisted all three enjoyed it particularly the two boys it was the first meal chester had taken in a restaurant and he could not get rid of a feeling of embarrassment at the thought that the waiters who were better dressed than many of the prominent citizens of wyncombe were watching him he did not however allow this feeling to interfere with his appetite do you always eat here mr conrad asked chester no sometimes it is more convenient to go elsewhere now and then i take a table dhote dinner i dont think i can afford to come here often chester remarked after consulting the bill of fare and the prices set down opposite the different dishes no it will be better for you to secure a boarding place you want to be economical for the present how did you leave your mother very well thank you mr conrad we have been very fortunate in securing a boarder who pays eight dollars a week so that mother thinks she can get along for the present without help from me that is famous where did you get such a boarder in wyncombe it is a lady the cousin of mr gardener the lawyer she will be company for mother it is an excellent arrangement now boys if you have finished i will go up and settle the bill as they left the restaurant mr conrad said in honor of your arrival i shall not work any more today now shall we go back to my room or would you like to take a walk and see something of the city the unanimous decision was for the stroll mr conrad walked down broadway with the boys pointing out any notable buildings on the way chester was dazzled the great city exceeded his anticipations everything seemed on so grand a scale to the country boy and with his joyous excitement there mingled the thought and i too am going to live here i shall have a share in the great city and mingle in its scenes every day rob was used to the city and took matters quietly he was not particularly impressed yet he could not help enjoying the walk so perfect was the weather as they passed lord taylors a lady came out of the store why mother said rob is that you yes rob i came in on a shopping excursion and i want you to go with me and take care of me rob grumbled a little but of course acceded to his mothers request so chester was left alone with mr conrad how do you feel about coming to new york chester asked his friend you are not afraid of failure are you no mr conrad i feel very hopeful something has happened to me today that encourages me very much what is it chester told the story of his meeting with prof hazlitt and the proposition which had been made to him why this is famous exclaimed conrad looking pleased i know of prof hazlitt though i never met him he was once professor in a western college but inheriting a fortune from his uncle came to new york to pursue his favorite studies he does not teach now but i believe delivers an annual course of lectures before the students of columbia college he is a shrewd man and the offer of employment from him is indeed a compliment i am very glad you met him he may throw other work in your way i hope i can give him satisfaction said chester it makes me feel rich whenever i think of the sum i am to receive two hundred dollars is a good deal of money to a boy like you yes it doesnt go very far with me now it costs a good deal for me to live how much do you think i have to pay for my room without board three dollars a week guessed chester mr conrad smiled i pay ten dollars a week he said chesters breath was quite taken away why i did not think the whole house would cost as much for rent you will get a more correct idea of new york expenses after a while now let me come back to your plans you had better stay with me for a few days but i am afraid i shall be putting you to inconvenience mr conrad no it will be pleasant for me to have your company on monday morning i will go with you to the office of the real estate broker who is to employ you chester passed sunday pleasantly going to church in the forenoon and taking a walk with mr conrad in the afternoon he wrote a short letter to his mother informing her of his safe arrival in the city but not mentioning his engagement by prof hazlitt he preferred to wait till he had an interview with the professor and decided whether he could do the work satisfactorily your future employer is clement fairchild said the artist his office is on west fourteenth street between seventh and eight avenues what sort of a man is he asked chester i dont know him very well but i believe he does a very good business you will know more about him in a week than i can tell you there is one comfort and that is that you are not wholly dependent upon him i advise you however to say nothing in the office about your art work business men sometimes have a prejudice against outside workers they feel that an employee ought to be solely occupied with their interests i will remember what you say mr conrad chester looked forward with considerable curiosity and some anxiety to his coming interview with mr fairchild chapter xii a real estate office about eight oclock on monday morning chester accompanied by his friend conrad turned down fourteenth street from sixth avenue and kept on till they reached an office over which was the sign clement fairchild real estate this is the place chester said the artist i will go in and introduce you they entered the office it was of fair size and contained a high desk an office table covered with papers and several chairs there was but one person in the office a young man with black whiskers and mustache and an unamiable expression he sat on a high stool but he was only reading the morning paper he turned lazily as he heard the door open and let his glance rest on mr conrad what can i do for you he asked in a careless tone is mr fairchild in asked the artist no when will he be in cant say i am sure if you have any business i will attend to it i have no special business except to introduce my young friend here indeed said the clerk impudently who is he he is going to work here returned mr conrad sharply what queried the bookkeeper evidently taken by surprise who says he is going to work here mr fairchild he didnt say anything to me about it very remarkable certainly rejoined conrad i presume you have no objection look here said the bookkeeper i think there is some mistake about this the place was all but promised to my cousin youll have to settle that matter with your employer apparently he doesnt tell you everything mr my name is mullins david mullins said the bookkeeper with dignity then mr mullins i have the pleasure of introducing to you chester rand late of wyncombe now of new york who will be associated with you in the real estate business perhaps so sneered mullins he will stay here till mr fairchild makes his appearance oh he can sit down if he wants to i shall have to leave you chester as i must get to work when mr fairchild comes in show him this note from me all right sir chester was rather chilled by his reception he saw instinctively that his relations with mr mullins were not likely to be cordial and he suspected that if the bookkeeper could get him into trouble he would after the artist had left the office mr david mullins leisurely picked his teeth with his penknife and fixed a scrutinizing glance on chester of whom he was evidently taking the measure do you knew mr fairchild he at length asked abruptly no sir its queer he should have engaged you as office boy chester did not think it necessary to make any reply to this remark how much salary do you expect to get five dollars a week who told you so the gentleman who came in with me who is he mr herbert conrad an artist and draughtsman never heard of him mr mullins spoke as if this was enough to settle the status of mr conrad a man whom he did not know must be obscure so mr fairchild engaged you through mr conrad did he yes sir do you know anything about the city not much then i cant imagine why mr fairchild should have hired you you cant be of much use here chester began to feel discouraged all this was certainly very depressing i shall try to make myself useful he said oh yes sneered mr mullins new boys always say that there was a railing stretching across the office about midway dividing it into two parts the table and desk were inside the remaining space was left for the outside public a poor woman entered the office her face bearing the impress of sorrow is mr fairchild in she asked no he isnt ive come in about the months rent very well you can pay it to me what name mrs carlin sir ha yes your rent is six dollars pass it over and i will give you a receipt but i came to say that i had only three dollars and a half toward it and why have you only three dollars and a half id like to know said mullins rudely because my jimmy has been sick three days hes a telegraph boy and im a widow wid only me bye to help me i have nothing to do with the sickness of your son when you hired your rooms you agreed to pay the rent didnt you yes sir but and you didnt say anything about jimmy being sick or well true for you sir but i think mrs carlin youll have to get hold of the other two dollars and a half some how or out youll go see shure sir you are very hard with a poor widow said mrs carlin wiping her eyes with the corner of her apron business is business mrs carlin if mr fairchild were in hed trate me better than you will he be in soon perhaps he will and perhaps he wont you can pay the money to me i wont sir beggin your pardon id rather wait and see him very well you can take the consequences and mr mullins eyed the widow with an unpleasant and threatening glance she looked very sad and chester felt that he should like to give the bookkeeper a good shaking he could not help despising a man who appeared to enjoy distressing an unfortunate woman whose only crime was poverty at this moment the office door opened and a gentleman of perhaps forty entered he was a man with a kindly face and looked far less important than the bookkeeper mr mullins on seeing him laid aside his unpleasant manner and said in a matteroffact tone this is mrs carlin she owes six dollars rent and only brings three dollars and a half how is this mrs carlin inquired mr fairchild for this was he mrs carlin repeated her story of jimmys illness and her consequent inability to pay the whole rent when do you think jimmy will get well asked the agent kindly hes gettin better fast sir i think hell be able to go to work by wednesday if youll only wait a little while sir how long have you been paying rent here asked mr fairchild this is the third year sir and have you ever been in arrears before no sir then you deserve consideration mr mullins give mrs carlin a receipt on account and she will pay the balance as soon as she can thank you sir may the saints reward you sir shure i told this gentleman that youd make it all right with me he was very hard with me mr mullins said the agent sternly i have before now told you that our customers are to be treated with consideration and kindness david mullins did not reply but he dug his pen viciously into the paper on which he was writing a receipt and scowled but as his back was turned to his employer the latter did not see it when mrs carlin had left the office chester thought it best to introduce himself i am chester rand from wyncombe he said mr conrad came round to introduce me but you were not in ah yes you have come to be my office boy i am glad to see you and hope you will like the city mr mullins you will set this boy to work he told me he was to work here but as you had not mentioned it i thought there must be some mistake he says he doesnt know much about the city neither did i when i first came here from a country town it will be rather inconvenient sir now my cousin whom i mentioned to you is quite at home all over the city i am glad to hear it he will find this knowledge of service in some other situation added mr fairchild significantly david mullins bit his lip and was silent he could not understand why felix gordon his cousin had failed to impress mr fairchild favorably he had not noticed that felix entered the office with a cigarette in his mouth which he only threw away when he was introduced to the real estate agent ill have that boy out of this place within a month or my name isnt david mullins he said to himself chester could not read what was passing through his mind but he felt instinctively that the bookkeeper was his enemy chapter xiii mr mullins the bookkeeper chester felt that it was necessary to be on his guard the bookkeeper was already his enemy there were two causes for this first mr mullins was naturally of an ugly disposition and secondly he was disappointed in not securing the situation for his cousin at noon the latter made his appearance he was a thin darkcomplexioned boy with curiouslooking eyes that somehow inspired distrust he walked up to the desk where the book keeper was writing goodmorning cousin david he said goodmorning felix sit down for a few minutes and i will take you out to lunch all right answered felix whos that boy he inquired in a low voice the new office boy wait till we go out and i will tell you about it in five minutes david mullins put on his hat and coat and went out with his cousin stay here and mind the office he said to chester and if anybody comes in keep them if possible if any tenant comes to pay money take it and give a receipt all right sir when they were in the street felix asked where did you pick up the boy why didnt i get the place you must ask mr fairchild that he engaged him without consulting me what sort of a boy is he a country gawky he knows nothing of the city is he a friend of mr fairchild fairchild never met him before some beggarly artist interceded for him it is too bad i cant be in the office it would be so nice to be in the same place with you i did my best but fairchild didnt seem to fancy you i think he took a prejudice against you on account of your smoking cigarettes he must have seen you with one does the new boy smoke cigarettes i dont know that gives me an idea you had better get intimate with him and offer him cigarettes he doesnt know mr fairchilds prejudice and may fall into the trap how can i get acquainted with him ill see to that i shall be sending him out on an errand presently and you can offer to go with him thatll do but you must buy me a package of cigarettes very well my plan is to have the boy offend mr fairchilds prejudices and that may make a vacancy for you by the way never let him see you smoking i wont but as he is not about ill smoke a cigarette now better wait till after lunch about ten minutes after mr mullins left the office a man of forty evidently a mechanic entered is the bookkeeper in he asked hes gone to lunch he sent me a bill for this months rent which i have already paid please give me your name james long and where do you live the address was given a house on east twentieth street havent you the receipt asked chester no didnt mr mullins give you one yes but i carelessly left it on the table i suppose he found it and kept the money he added bitterly but that would be a mean thing to do said chester startled nothing is too mean for mullins said long hes a hard man and a tricky one he will come in soon if you can wait i cant i am at work and this is my noon hour i will tell him what you say perhaps i may have a chance to call in this afternoon i feel worried about this matter for although it is only ten dollars that is a good deal to a man with a family and earning only twelve dollars a week presently mr mullins returned has anybody been in he asked yes answered chester a man named james long a curious expression came into the bookkeepers eye well did he pay his rent no he said he had paid it already oh he did did he sneered the bookkeeper in that case of course he has the receipt no he said he had left it here on the table and did not think of it till some time afterwards a likely story he must think i am a fool even a boy like you can see through that he seemed to me like an honest man oh well you are from the country and could not be expected to know we have some sharp swindlers in new york chester was quite of that opinion but he was beginning to think that the description would apply better to david mullins than to james long by the way chester said mr mullins with unusual blandness this is my cousin felix gordon glad to meet you said felix with an artificial smile chester took the extended hand he was not especially drawn to felix but felt that it behooved him to be polite you boys must be somewhere near the same age said the bookkeeper i will give you a chance to become acquainted chester i want you to go to number four seventyone bleecker street i suppose you dont know where it is no sir felix go with him and show him the way chester was quite amazed at this unusual and unexpected kindness on the part of a man whom he had regarded as an enemy was it possible that he had misjudged him the two boys went out together when they were fairly in the street felix produced his package of cigarettes have one he asked no thank you i dont smoke dont smoke repeated felix in apparent amusement you dont mean that i never smoked a cigarette in my life then its high time you learned all boys smoke in the city i dont think i should like it oh nonsense just try one for my sake thank you felix you are very kind but i promised mother i wouldnt smoke your mother lives in the country doesnt she yes then she wont know it that will make no difference i made the promise and i mean to keep it said chester firmly oh well suit yourself what a muff he is thought felix however hell soon break over his virtuous resolutions do you know he continued changing the subject that you have got the situation i was after i think i heard mr mullins say something about it i am sorry if i have stood in your way oh if it hadnt been you it would have been some other boy how do you think you shall like the city very much i think what pay do you get five dollars a week you cant live on that i will try to of course it is different with me i should have lived at home youll have to run into debt i will try not to where do you live i am staying with a friend mr conrad an artist just now but i shall soon get a boarding place i live on eightysixth street in a flat my father is in the custom house how long has your cousin mr mullins been in this office about five years hes awfully smart cousin david is its he that runs the business mr fairchild is no sort of a business man chester wondered how under the circumstances mr mullins should not have influence enough to secure the situation of office boy for felix they soon reached bleecker street chester took notice of the way in order that he might know it again he was sharp and observing and meant to qualify himself for his position as soon as possible at five oclock the office was vacated chester remained to sweep up a piece of paper on the floor attracted his attention he picked it up and found to his surprise that it was james longs missing receipt it was on the floor of the clothes closet and he judged that it had dropped from the bookkeepers pocket what should he do with it chapter xiv the tables turned under ordinary circumstances chester would have handed the receipt to the bookkeeper but he was convinced that it was the purpose of mr mullins to defraud the tenant out of a months rent and he felt that it would not be in the interest of the latter for him to put this power in the hands of the enemy obviously the receipt belonged to james long who had lost it fortunately chester had the address of the mechanic on east twentieth street and he resolved though it would cost him quite a walk to call and give him the paper in twenty minutes after locking the office he found himself in front of a large tenement house which was occupied by a great number of families he found that long lived on the third floor back he knocked at the door it was opened to him by a woman of forty who had a babe in her arms while another a little girl was holding onto her dress does mr james long live here asked chester yes is he at home no but i am expecting him home from work every minute will you come in or shall i give him your message perhaps i had better see him if it wont inconvenience you oh no if you will excuse my poor rooms said mrs long pleasantly i am poor myself and am not used to fine rooms take the rockingchair said mrs long offering him the best chair in the room if you will excuse me i will go on preparing my husbands supper certainly shall i take the baby oh i wouldnt like to trouble you i like babies chester had seen that the babys face was clean and that it looked attractive babies know their friends instinctively and this particular baby was soon in a frolic with its young guardian i guess you are used to babies said the mother pleased no i am the only baby in my family but i am fond of children i may remark here that manly boys generally do like children and i havent much respect for those who will tease or tyrannize over them in ten minutes a heavy step was heard on the stairs and james long entered his face was sober for after his interview with chester rand he had not had time for a second call he began to fear that he should have to pay his months rent over again and this to him would involve a severe loss he looked with surprise at chester not immediately recognizing him i come from mr fairchilds office explained chester oh yes i remember seeing you there has the receipt been found he added eagerly yes james long looked very much relieved i am very glad he sighed mr mullins wouldnt have believed me what does he say now he doesnt know that the receipt is found how is that asked the mechanic puzzled i found it after mr mullins went away where did you find it in the clothes closet just under where mr mullins hangs his coat added chester significantly and you bring it to me yes it belongs to you besides after what i heard i didnt dare to trust it in the hands of the bookkeeper i see you think the same of him as i do i dont like him you think he meant to cheat me it looks like it i am all right now what do you think i had better do come round tomorrow but dont show the receipt unless mr fairchild is in the office he is a very different man from mr mullins the bookkeeper might still play a trick upon you i believe youre right shall i tell him how you found and gave me back the receipt no let mr mullins puzzle over it it is fortunate he didnt destroy the receipt or you would have had no resource youre a smart boy and ill take your advice how long have you been in the office this is my first day answered chester smiling well well i couldnt have believed it you will make a smart business man youve been a good friend to james long and he wont forget it i say wife perhaps this young gentleman will stay to supper thank you answered chester i would but i am to meet a friend uptown at six oclock it is so late he added looking at the clock on the mantel that i must go at once when chester met his friend the artist he told him of what had happened that mullins is evidently a rascal and a very mean one said mr conrad if i were going to defraud anyone it wouldnt be a poor mechanic mr mullins has already taken a dislike to me if he should discover that i have found the receipt and given it to mr long he would hate me even worse you must look out for him he will bear watching i wish he were more like mr fairchild he seems a fair honorable man he is i dont understand why he should employ such a fellow as mullins perhaps he hasnt found him out mullins will find it hard to explain this matter let me know how it comes out i suppose long will call at the office tomorrow yes i advised him to the next day about twenty minutes after twelve james long entered the office he looked about him anxiously and to his relief saw that mr fairchild was present he went up to the table where the broker was seated i came about my rent he said you can speak to mr mullins said the broker going on with his writing i would rather speak with you sir how is that asked mr fairchild his attention excited i will tell you sir said the bookkeeper with an ugly look this man came here yesterday and declined to pay his rent because he said he had paid it already and i had said long quietly i am a mechanic on small wages and i cant afford to pay my rent twice did you pay the rent to mr mullins yes sir when day before yesterday then he gave you a receipt he did sir it seems to me that than settles the question did you give him a receipt mr mullins if i had he could show it now he says that he left it behind in the office here of course thats too thin it is very important to take good care of your receipt mr long did you ever lose or mislay a receipt sir yes i have on two or three occasions so that i am not the only one to whom it has happened mr mullins did mr long come to the office on the day when he says he paid the rent yes sir and he didnt pay it no sir he said he hadnt the money but would bring it in a few days james long listened in indignant astonishment that is untrue sir i made no excuse but handed mr mullins the amount in full there is a very extraordinary discrepancy in your statements you say that he wrote out a receipt yes sir it is a pity that you cant produce it yes chimed in mullins with a sneer it is unlucky that you cannot produce it then came a sensation i can produce it said long the receipt has been found and he drew out the slip of paper and passed it to mr fairchild the face of mullins was a study his amazement was deep and genuine it must be a forgery he said mr long cant possibly have a receipt you are mistaken said mr fairchild the receipt and the signature are genuine and it is written on one of our letter heads mullins took the receipt and faltered i dont understand it nor do i said the broker sternly did you make any entry on the books i i dont remember show me the record mr fairchild opened the book and saw an entry made but afterward erased when the bookkeeper found the receipt on the table a promising piece of rascality was suggested to him he would keep the money himself and conceal the record mr long said the broker here is your receipt it is clear that you have paid your rent you will have no more trouble then as the mechanic left the office the broker turning to the bookkeeper said sternly another such transaction mr mullins and you leave my employ but sir stammered mullins you may spare your words i understand the matter if you had not been in my employ so long i would discharge you at the end of this week mullins went back to his desk crushed and mortified but his brain was busy with the thought where could james long have obtained the receipt he remembered having put it into the pocket of his overcoat and it had disappeared i was a fool that i didnt destroy it he reflected chapter xv a plot against chester the more the bookkeeper thought of it the more he was of the opinion that chester must have had something to do with the events that led to his discovery and humiliation otherwise how could james long have recovered the receipt he himself had found it and kept it in his possession chester must have chanced upon the receipt and carried it to long though well convinced of it he wished to find out positively accordingly he took his cousin felix into his confidence as far as was necessary and sent him to the room of the mechanic to find out whether chester had been there it was the middle of the forenoon when felix knocked at the door of james longs humble home mrs long with the baby in her arms answered the knock is this mrs long asked felix yes sir i am the friend of chester rand i dont think i know mr rand said mrs long who had not heard chesters name the boy from mr fairchilds office he called here i believe one day last week oh yes and a good friend he was to me and mine in what way asked felix his face lighting with satisfaction at the discovery he had made he brought my husband the receipt he had lost didnt he tell you oh yes i wasnt thinking of that he asked me to inquire if he left his gloves here i havent found any i should have seen them if he left them here all right i will tell him he thought he might have left them good morning maam and felix hurried downstairs he was not partial to poor people or tenement houses and he was glad to get away he reached the office in time to go out to lunch with the bookkeeper well asked mullins eagerly did you go to longs yes what did you find out i found out that your office boy had been there and carried them the receipt the young viper so he is trying to undermine me in the office well hell live to regret it and the bookkeeper shook his head vigorously id get even with him if i were you cousin david trust me for that i generally pay off all debts of that kind how will you do it asked felix curiously i dont know yet probably ill get him into some bad scrape that will secure his discharge and then youll get me into the place i am afraid i cant i am not on good terms with mr fairchild and my recommendation wont do you much good even if i do manage to get rid of chester then i dont see how i am going to be benefited by working for you said felix dissatisfied ill pay you in some way to begin with heres a dollar this is for your errand of this morning thank you cousin david said felix pocketing the bill with an air of satisfaction i think ill go to dalys theater tonight father doesnt give me much spending money only twentyfive cents a week and whats a fellow to do with such a beggarly sum as that it is more than i had at your age the world has progressed since then a boy needs more pocket money now than he did fifteen years ago how soon shall you try to get even with that boy i think it will be prudent to wait a while mr fairchild may suspect something if i move too soon the boy has been with us less than a week he has been with you long enough to do some harm thats true said mullins with an ugly look does he seem to suit mr fairchild yes he appears to be intelligent and he attends to his duties worse luck but hes a thorn in my side a thorn in my side id give twentyfive dollars if he was out of the office do you want me to break off acquaintance with him no keep on good terms with him let him think you are his intimate friend it will give me a chance to plot against him through you chapter xvi prof hazlitt at home chester did not forget his engagement to call upon prof hazlitt on wednesday evening he was shown at once into the professors study it was a large room the sides lined with bookcases crowded with volumes there seemed to be more books than chester had ever seen before in the center of the room was a study table covered with books open as if in use on one side was a desk at which prof hazlitt himself was seated goodevening my young friend he said cordially as chester entered the room you did not forget your appointment no sir i was not likely to forget such an engagement have you grown to feel at home in the city not entirely sir but i am getting a little used to it i think you mentioned that you were going into a real estate office yes sir i have commenced my duties there i hope you find them agreeable i might sir but that the bookkeeper seems to have taken a dislike to me i suspect that you would like better to devote yourself to art work i think i should sir but mr conrad thinks it better that i should only devote my leisure to drawing no doubt his advice is wise for the present at least now suppose we come to business i believe i told you i am writing a book on ethnology yes sir i find a good deal of help in rare volumes which i consult at the astor library these i cannot borrow but i have the use of anything i find suited to my needs in the library of columbia college then i import a good many books i shall spare no pains to make my own work valuable and comprehensive of course i shall feel at liberty to copy and use any illustrations i find in foreign publications it is here that you can help me yes sir here for instance and the professor opened a french book are some sketches illustrating the dress and appearance of the natives of madagascar do you think you can copy them i have no doubt of it sir he answered sit down in that chair and try you will find pencils and drawing paper before you i will mention one or two particulars in which i want you to deviate from the original chester sat down and was soon deep in his task he felt that it was important for him to do his best he could understand that though the professor was a kindhearted man he would be a strict critic he therefore worked slowly and carefully and it was nearly an hour before he raised his head and said i have finished show the sketch to me said the professor chester handed it to him he examined it with critical attention gradually his face lighted up with pleasure admirably done he exclaimed you have carried out my wishes then you are satisfied sir entirely i am very glad said chester with an air of relief he felt now he could do all that was required of him and as the contract would pay him two hundred dollars this success tonight was an important one i wont ask you to do any more this evening but i will give you some work to do at home i believe i agreed to pay you two dollars for each sketch yes sir probably you are not over well provided with money and i will pay you as you go on or rather i will give you ten dollars as an advance for future work thank you sir you are very kind only considerate i have seen the time when a tendollarbill would have been welcome to me now thanks to a wealthy relative who left me a fortune i am amply provided for at this moment the study door opened and a brightlooking boy of about fifteen entered may i come in uncle he asked with a smile yes chester this is my nephew arthur burks arthur this is chester rand a young artist who is assisting me arthur came forward and gave chester his hand cordially you ought to wear spectacles he said like uncle edgar you dont look dignified enough to be his assistant that may come in time said chester with a smile arthur i am done with chester for this evening said the professor you may carry him off and entertain him you may bring me the other two sketches whenever you are ready come up to my den said arthur i have the front room on the third floor as they went upstairs a prolonged melancholy shriek rang through the house chester stopped short in dismay and an expression of pain succeeded the gay look on arthurs face chapter xvii chester takes a lesson in boxing that is my poor little cousin explained arthur is he sick or in pain asked chester in quick sympathy he had a fever when he was three years old that left his mind a wreck he is now eight the most eminent physicians have seen him but there seems little hope of his improvement or recovery does he suffer pain you ask on account of the shriek you heard as far as we can tell he does not the shriek comes so the doctor tells us from a nervous spasm he would have been a bright boy if he had kept his health would you like to see him chester shrank back i am afraid i should excite him he said he had besides an idea that a boy so afflicted would be repulsive in appearance no said arthur it may relieve him to see you by diverting his thoughts without further words he opened the door of a room at the head of the staircase and entered followed reluctantly by chester ernest said arthur in a soothing tone i have brought you a friend his name is chester chester was amazed at the sight of the boy he was wonderfully handsome especially when at arthurs words the look of pain left his face and it brightened into radiant beauty he seemed to fall in love with chester at first sight he ran up to him seized his hand kissed it and said i love you arthur too looked amazed he never took to anyone so before he said you have fascinated him sit down let me sit in your lap pleaded ernest all feeling of repugnance all thoughts of the boys malady were forgotten chester sat in a low rockingchair and ernest seated himself in his lap touching his face and hair softly with a caressing hand what a charming boy he is thought chester did you come to see me asked ernest softly yes i came with arthur will you stay with me a little while a little while but i must soon go why did you scream so loud a little while ago i dont know were you in pain n no answered ernest softly do you like to cry out in that manner no but i have to do it i cant help it i think he gives the right explanation said arthur it is a nervous impulse and has nothing to do with pain does he ever sit in your lap like this no i think he likes me in a way for i am always kind to him but you seem to draw him to you irresistibly at that moment the professor came in when he saw ernest sitting in chesters lap he stopped short in astonishment this is strange he said isnt it uncle chester seems to fascinate my little cousin no sooner did he enter the room than ernest ran up to him kissed his hand and caressed him i cant explain it said the professor but chester seems to have a wonderful influence over my poor boy i never saw him look so happy or contented before all this while ernest continued to stroke chesters cheek and his hair and regarded him with looks of fond affection i am afraid ernest annoys you said the professor no i am glad he likes me i never had a little brother i think i should enjoy having one if he could only be always like this said the professor regretfully just then margaret entered she was the nurse who had constant charge of ernest she paused on the threshold and her looks showed her surprise ernest has found a friend margaret said the professor i never saw the like sir come here ernest the boy shook his head no i want to stay with him indicating chester did ernest ever see him before sir no it seems to be a case of love at first sight he has cut me out said arthur smiling ernest which do you like best me or him him answered ernest touching chesters cheek i must tell dr gridley of this new manifestation on the part of my poor boy said the professor perhaps he can interpret it for twenty minutes chester retained ernest on his lap then arthur said chester must go now ernest the boy left chesters lap obediently will you come and see me again he pleaded yes i will come said chester and stooping over he kissed the boys cheek ernests face lighted up with a loving smile and again he kissed chesters hand now chester you can come to my den arthur opened the door of a large room furnished with every comfort it was easy to see that it was a boys apartment on a table were boxing gloves over a desk in a corner was hung the photograph of a football team of which arthur was the captain there was another photograph representing him with gloves on about to have a setto with a boy friend do you box chester he asked no i never saw a pair of boxing gloves before i will give you a lesson here put on this pair chester smiled i shall be at your mercy he said i am perhaps as strong as you but i have no science it wont take you long to learn so the two boys faced each other before he knew what was going to happen chester received a light tap on the nose from his new friend i must tell you how to guard yourself i will be the professor and you the pupil chester soon became interested and at the end of half an hour his teacher declared that he had improved wonderfully we will have a lesson every time you come to see uncle he said then i shall come to see two professors yes an old one and young one between uncle ernest and myself you will find your time pretty well occupied when you come here i think it a great privilege to come here said chester gratefully and i am glad to have you i shall have some one to box with at any rate now he added with a comical look i cant induce my uncle to have a bout with me indeed i should be afraid to for he is so shortsighted he would need to wear spectacles and i would inevitably break them chester could not forbear laughing at the idea of the learned professor having a boxing match with his lively young nephew if you will make me as good a boxer as yourself i shall feel very much indebted that will come in time i am quite flattered at the opportunity of posing as a teacher have you a taste for jewelry just look in this drawer arthur opened one of the small drawers in his bureau and displayed a varied collection of studs sleeve buttons collar buttons scarf pins etc you might set up a jewelers store suggested chester where did you get them all i had an uncle who was in the business and he and other relatives have given me plenty i havent even a watch no really why how can you get along without one i have to wait a minute arthur opened another drawer revealing two silver watches one an open face the other a hunting watch take your choice he said do you really mean it certainly but would your uncle approve of your giving me such a valuable present my uncle doesnt bother himself about such trifles i dont use either of these watches i have a gold one given me last christmas since you are so kind i think i prefer the hunting watch all right there it is let me set it for you the chain goes with it of course chester felt delighted with his present he had hoped sometime when he was eighteen perhaps to own a watch but had no expectation of getting one so soon you are a generous friend arthur he said dont make too much of such a trifle chester returned the other lightly when chester said he must go home arthur put on his hat and proposed to walk with him part of the way an offer which chester gratefully accepted they walked over to broadway chatting as they went all at once chester who had not expected to see anyone he knew touched arthur on the arm do you see that man in front of us he asked pointing to a figure about six feet ahead yes what of him it is our bookkeeper david mullins is it indeed do you know whom he is walking with chester glanced at a rather flashily dressed individual who was walking arm in arm with the bookkeeper no he answered it is dick ralston answered arthur one of the most notorious gamblers in the city chapter xviii dick ralston chester was new to the city and a novice in worldly affairs but the discovery that the bookkeeper was on intimate terms with a gambler astounded him he felt that mr fairchild ought to know it but he shrank from telling him of course the presumption was that mullins was also a gambler but this was not certain chester decided to say nothing but to be watchful david mullins had been five years in his present place and his services must have been satisfactory or he would not have been retained there was one thing however that chester did not know this gambler dick ralston as he was familiarly called was only a recent acquaintance mullins had known him but three months but had already through his influence been smitten by the desire to become rich more quickly than he could in any legitimate way he had accompanied dick to the gaming table and tried his luck losing more than he could comfortably spare he was in debt to his dangerous friend one hundred and fifty dollars and on the evening in question dick had intimated that he was in need of the money but how can i give it to you asked mullins in a tone of annoyance you receive a good salary one hundred dollars a month yes but i cant spare more than thirty dollars a month toward paying the debt which would take you five months that wont suit me havent you got any money saved up no i ought to have but i have enjoyed myself as i went along and it has taken all i earned humph very pleasant for me and for me too it isnt very satisfactory to pinch and scrape for five months just to get out of debt if it was for articles i had had in other words for value received it would be different but it is just for money lost at the gaming table a gambling debt such debts among men of honor said dick loftily are the most binding everywhere they are debts of honor i dont see why grumbled mullins come said ralston soothingly you are out of sorts and cant see things in their right light ill lend you fifty dollars more making the debt two hundred dollars i dont see how that will help me ill tell you you must win the money to pay your debt at the gaming table why two hundred dollars is a trifle you might win it in one evening or lose as much more theres no such word as fail shall i tell you what i did once yes answered mullins in some curiosity i was in nashville dead broke i was younger then and losses affected me more i was even half inclined you will laugh i know to blow my brains out or to throw myself into the river when a stranger offered to lend me ten dollars to try my luck again well i thought as you did that it was of little use i would lose it and so make matters worse but desperation led me to accept it was one chance not a very good one but still a chance from motives of prudence i only risked five dollars at first i lost savagely i threw down the remaining five and won twentyfive then i got excited and kept on for an hour at the end of that time how do you think i stood how asked mullins eagerly i had won eight hundred and sixtyfive dollars answered dick ralston coolly i paid back the ten dollars and went out of the gambling house a rich man comparatively speaking now all this story was a clever fiction but david mullins did not know this he accepted it as plain matter of fact and his heart beat quickly as he fancied himself winning as large a sum but such cases must be rare he ventured not at all i could tell you more wonderful stories about friends of mine though it was the luckiest thing that ever happened to me now will you take the fifty dollars i offered you yes but i dont want to play again tonight i feel nervous very good meet me tomorrow evening at the gambling house and the money shall be ready for you then they parted and the bookkeeper who had a headache went home and to bed he had that evening lost fifty dollars to dick ralston and so increased his debt from one hundred to one hundred and fifty dollars but his heart was filled with feverish excitement the story told by ralston had its effect upon him and he decided to keep on in the dangerous path upon which he had entered why pinch himself for five months to pay his debt when a single evenings luck would clear him from every obligation if dick ralston and others could be lucky why not he this was the way mullins reasoned he never stopped to consider what would be the result if things did not turn out as he hoped if he lost instead of won some weeks passed the bookkeeper met with varying success at the gaming table sometimes he won sometimes he lost but on the whole his debt to dick ralston didnt increase there were reasons why the gambler decided to go slow he was playing with mullins as a cat plays with a mouse but our chief concern is with chester rand he found a comfortable room on twelfth street not far from the office which with board only cost him five dollars per week this to be sure took all his salary but he was earning something outside on account of so much time being taken up by his work for the professor he did little for the comic weeklies but occasionally through his friend the artist a five or tendollar bill came into his hands he bought himself a new suit and some other articles which he found he needed and wrote home to ask his mother if she wished any assistance thank you for your offer she replied but the money miss dolby pays me defrays all my housekeeping expenses and a little more she is certainly peculiar but is goodnatured and never finds fault she is a good deal of company for me of course i miss you very much but it cheers me to think you are doing well and are happy with good prospects for the future there is nothing for you in wyncombe as i very well know that is nothing you would be willing to accept that reminds me to say that mr tripp is having a hard time with boys he discharged abel wood soon after you went to new york he has tried two boys since but doesnt seem to get suited when i was in the store yesterday he inquired after you tell him he said that if he gets tired of new york he can come back to the store and i will pay him three dollars a week he said this with an air of a man who is making a magnificent offer i told him you were satisfied with your position in the city i must tell you of one mean thing he has done he has been trying to induce miss dolby to leave me and take board with him offering to take her for two dollars a week less she told me of this herself i wouldnt go there if hed take me for nothing she said and i believe she meant it she is not mean and is willing to pay a fair even a liberal price where she is suited you see therefore that neither you nor i need borrow any trouble on this point this letter relieved chester of all anxiety all things seemed bright to him what he did for the comic weeklies added to his work for prof hazlitt brought him in ten dollars a week on an average this added to the five dollars a week from mr fairchild gave him an aggregate salary of fifteen dollars a week so that he was always amply provided with money cousin david said felix to the bookkeeper one day i dont see how it happens that chester is so well supplied with cash is he asked mullins yes he has just bought a new suit a new hat and new shoes they must have cost him altogether as much as thirty dollars how much wages do you pay him five dollars a week and he pays all that for board for he told me so it does seem a little mysterious perhaps his friend the artist helps him no he doesnt i intimated as much one day but he said no that he paid his own way one evening last week i saw him going into dalys theatre with a young fellow handsomely dressed quite a young swell they had twodollar seats and i learned that chester paid for them he doesnt have any chance to pick up any money in this office does he asked felix significantly i cant say as to that i havent missed any i wish he would help himself of course he would be discharged and then you might find a place for me i may do so yet is there any chance of it asked felix eagerly in about two weeks mr fairchild is going west on business he will be gone for a month probably in his absence i shall run the office i see and i shall probably find some reason for discharging chester rand added the bookkeeper significantly in that case you will hold yourself ready to slip into his place bully for you cousin david exclaimed felix in exultation chapter xix mr fairchild leaves the city about ten days later chester found himself alone in the office with his employer the bookkeeper having gone out to call upon a man who had commissioned the broker to buy him a house chester said mr fairchild has mr mullins mentioned to you that i start next monday on a western trip i heard him say so to a gentleman in here on business i shall have to leave mr mullins to take charge of the office and run the business the time was when i would have done so with confidence but the affair of james long has made me distrustful he thoroughly understands my business and it would be difficult for me to supply his place for the present therefore i feel obliged to retain him during my absence however i wish if you see anything wrong that you would apprise me of it by letter you may direct letters to palmers hotel chicago and they will be forwarded to me from there what is your address chester gave it and mr fairchild wrote it down it is rather unusual continued mr fairchild for a man in my position to make a confidant of his office boy but i have observed you carefully and i believe that you are not only intelligent but are faithful to my interests thank you sir said chester with genuine gratification i think i can promise you that you will not be disappointed in me of course mr mullins must not know of the understanding between us dont breathe a hint of what i have said no sir i will not in case you think it necessary you may telegraph to me i hope however that no such emergency will arise chester asked himself whether it was his duty to apprise mr fairchild of his seeing mullins in intimate companionship with a gambler but on the whole decided not to do so he did not wish needlessly to prejudice his employer against the bookkeeper on monday morning mr fairchild left the office and took the sixth avenue elevated train to cortlandt street station from which it is only five minutes walk to the ferry connecting with the train on the pennsylvania railroad how long shall you be away mr fairchild asked the bookkeeper i cannot yet tell it will depend on the success i meet with in my business i am afraid i may be absent four weeks dont hurry back said mullins i will keep things running i rely upon your fidelity said the broker not without significance you may be assured of that i have been in your employ for over five years and of course understand all the details of my business that is true continue faithful to me and you will have no cause to repent it thank you sir you need have no anxiety chester said mr fairchild you may go with me as far as the station and carry my grip when they were outside the broker said i could have carried the grip myself but i wished to have a parting word with you mr mullins is thoroughly acquainted with my business but within the last six months i found myself distrusting him in four weeks for i shall be likely to be away that length of time something may occur detrimental to my interests and i heartily wish i had some one else in charge i may rely upon you bearing in mind what i told you the other day yes sir i wont forget i know that you are faithful and i only wish you understood the business well enough to be placed in charge i wish so too said chester frankly i think however mr fairchild added with a smile that it would be hardly prudent to trust my business to an office boy you are already trusting me very much mr fairchild yes i feel safe in doing so chester took the grip up the elevated stairway and parted with mr fairchild at the ticket office as he went down to the street he reflected that his own position during the brokers absence might not be very comfortable still he had his employers confidence and that gave him much pleasure he had reached harris large store on his way home when a rakishlooking figure springing from he knew not where overtook and touched him on the arm chester immediately recognized him as the gambler with whom he had seen the bookkeeper walking on the evening of his first visit to the house of prof hazlitt i say boy said ralston youre employed by fairchild the real estate man aint you yes sir answered chester coldly didnt i see him going to the elevated station with you just now yes sir with a grip in his hand yes is he off for a journey he has started for the west so i had business with him but i suppose i can transact it with mullins just as well you will find him in the office all right ill go there chester turned his glance upon dick ralston and rapidly took note of his appearance he was rather a stocky man with a red pimpled face a broad nose small twinkling eyes and intensely black hair he wore a loud striped sack suit and on one of his pudgy fingers was a diamond ring it was really a diamond and he had often found it serviceable when he was in very bad luck he pawned it for a comfortable sum but invariably redeemed it when fortune smiled upon him again he followed chester into the brokers office mullins sat on a stool at the desk picking his teeth he looked like a man of leisure with little upon his mind hello mullins old boy said dick pushing forward with extended hand so youre promoted to boss yes answered the bookkeeper showing his teeth in a complacent smile can i sell you a house this morning well not exactly im not quite up to that in the present state of my funds if you have on your list a onestory shanty on the rocks near central park i may invest cash down or do you want to have part of the purchase money on mortgage then both laughed and ralston made a playful dig at mullins ribs chester could not help hearing the conversation he saw in it a proof of the friendly relations between the two this so far as he knew was the first visit made by ralston to mr mullins it was clear that the bookkeeper felt that such a caller would injure him in the eyes of mr fairchild i am glad old fairchild is gone said dick ralston lowering his tone now i can come in freely dont come in too often replied mullins with a cautioning look at chester it might chester lost the rest of the sentence send him out suggested dick in a still lower tone but chester caught the words chester said the bookkeeper you may go up to the fifth avenue hotel and ask at the office if mr paul perkins of minneapolis has arrived yes sir after chester went out ralston inquired is there a man named paul perkins not that i know of answered mullins with a laugh i see youre a sharp fellow you only wanted to get rid of the kid exactly now we can talk freely thats what i came about do you know mullins you are owing me seven hundred and fifty dollars is it so much as that asked the bookkeeper anxiously yes i can show you the account now to tell you the truth mullins im in a tight fix and my bank account needs replenishing so does mine returned mullins with a sickly smile dick ralston frowned slightly no joking please he said roughly im in earnest i dont see what i am going to do about it muttered mullins defiantly dont you then perhaps i can help you by a suggestion i wish you would you are left in charge here during mr fairchilds absence well suppose i am and you handle the funds yes then and dick ralston bent over and whispered something in the bookkeepers ear mullins started and looked agitated what would you have me do he inquired borrow a little money from the office answered dick coolly but good heavens man it would ruin me must you have me risk prison dont be alarmed i only want you to borrow two or three hundred dollars you can return it before fairchild gets back how am i to return it you can win it back in one evening at the gaming table or lose more there was considerable further conversation dick ralston urging and mullins feebly opposing something which the gambler proposed then a customer came in who had to receive attention inside of an hour chester reentered the office accompanied by a sandycomplexioned stranger his head covered with a broad flapping western sombrero and wearing a long brown beard descending at least eighteen inches i hear you want to see me he said to mullins who are you asked the astonished bookkeeper i am paul perkins of minneapolis was the surprising reply chapter xx paul perkins of minneapolis if a bomb had exploded in the office david mullins and his friend ralston could not have been more astonished than by the appearance of paul perkins whose name was invented without the slightest idea that any such person existed before relating what followed a word of explanation is necessary chester went to the fifth avenue hotel without the slightest suspicion that he had been sent on a fools errand he imagined indeed that mr mullins wanted to get rid of him but did not doubt that there was such a man as paul perkins and that he was expected to arrive at the fifth avenue hotel he walked up broadway in a leisurely manner feeling that his hasty return was not desired he reached the fifth avenue and entering it was the first time he had ever visited the hotel went up to the desk the clerk was giving instructions to a bell boy who was directed to carry a visitors card to no when at leisure chester asked has mr paul perkins of minneapolis arrived at the hotel the clerk looked over the list of arrivals finally his forefinger stopped at an entry on the book yes he answered he arrived last evening did you wish to see him about this chester was in doubt he had only been asked to inquire if mr perkins had arrived he assumed however that the bookkeeper wished to see mr perkins at the office accordingly he answered yes sir i should like to see him the clerk rang a bell and another bell boy made his appearance write your name on a card said the clerk and i will send it up the gentleman wont know my name said chester then give the name of your firm so chester after slight hesitation wrote chester rand from clement fairchild real estate broker take that up to said the clerk to the bell boy in five minutes the boy returned mr perkins says you are to come upstairs to his room he reported chester followed the bell boy to the elevator he had never before ridden in such a conveyance and the sensation was a novel one they got off at one of the upper floors and chester followed his guide to the door of a room near by the bell boy knocked come in was heard from the inside chester entered and found himself in the presence of a man of fifty with a sandy complexion and thick brown beard he held the card in his hand and was looking at it are you chester rand he asked in a highpitched voice yes sir and you come from clement fairchild yes sir this is very curious i never heard the name before chester looked surprised i cant explain it sir he said i was asked to come to the hotel and ask if you had arrived where is mr fairchilds office on west fourteenth street and he is a real estate broker yes sir i dont understand what he wants of me or how in the name of all that is curious he ever heard of me i dont own any real estate except a threestory house in which i live perhaps sir if you will go to the office with me you will get an explanation precisely that is a very practical and sensible suggestion is it far off i ask because i have never been in new york before it is only about ten minutes walk then ill go with you that is if you can wait fifteen minutes while i finish writing a letter to my wife apprising her of my safe arrival yes sir i am in no especial hurry then sit down and you may look at this handing him the last copy of puck chester opened the paper eagerly for puck had accepted two of his sketches he opened it at random and his eye lighted up for there was one of the two sketches handsomely reproduced he uttered a little exclamation what have you found asked paul perkins looking up from his letter this picture is one of mine you dont mean it exclaimed the man from minneapolis dropping his pen in surprise i thought you were an office boy so i am sir but sometimes i sell sketches to the illustrated papers what did you get for this seven dollars and a half that is i sold this and another for fifteen dollars by the great horn spoon but this is wonderful chester did not feel called upon to say anything how long did it take you to draw this picture a little over half an hour jerusalem that is at the rate of ten dollars an hour i am contented to make ten dollars a day so should i be sir i dont draw all the time said chester with a smile i was going to ask if you wouldnt give me lessons in drawing and sketching i should be afraid to sir laughed chester you might prove a dangerous rival you neednt be afraid i can play as well as i can sing i suppose you sing well sir said chester roguishly you can judge when i was a young man i thought i would practice singing a little in my room one night the next morning my landlady said in a tone of sympathy i heard you groaning last night mr perkins did you have the toothache chester burst into a hearty laugh if that is the case he said i wont be afraid of you as a rival in drawing mr perkins set himself to finishing his letter and in twenty minutes it was done now i am ready he said as they went downstairs chester observed i will ask you as a favor mr perkins not to refer to my work in puck as it is not known at the office that i do any work outside all right my boy by the way how much do they pay you at the office five dollars a week evidently it isnt as good a business as drawing no sir but it is more reliable i cant always satisfy the comic papers and i am likely to have sketches left on my hands yes that is a practical way of looking at it and shows that you are a boy of sense what sort of a man is mr fairchild a very kind considerate man but i forgot to say that you wont see him but i thought he sent you to call on me no sir mr fairchild started for the west this morning it was mr mullins the bookkeeper who sent me that complicates the mystery is he a good friend of yours no sir he dislikes me mr perkins looked curious and chester considerably to his own surprise confided to him the story of his relations with the bookkeeper hes a scamp commented the man from minneapolis why does mr fairchild keep him i wouldnt id bounce him very quick he has been with mr fairchild five years and understands his business thoroughly well there is something in that but i wouldnt like to have in my employ a man whom i couldnt trust have you ever been out west no sir you ought to come out there the city i represent is a smart one and no mistake of course youve heard of the rivalry between minneapolis and st paul yes sir i dont take sides for i live in both but i think business facilities in minneapolis are greater i think you are a boy who would succeed at the west i should like to go there some day i own some property in washington territory you do exclaimed paul perkins in great surprise whereabouts in tacoma i own some lots there then let me tell you my boy that you will be a rich man but i thought prices of land in tacoma were small so they are at present but it is the future terminus of the northern pacific railroad when it is completed there will be a boom how many lots do you own five take my advice and hold on to them what square is this they had reached seventeenth street union square its a pretty place is tiffanys near here yes sir only two blocks away we shall pass it all right point it out to me im going to buy a gold watch for myself there ive needed one for a long time but i wanted the satisfaction of buying one at tiffanys anything that is sold there must be a no i have no doubt of it but i dont trade there much yet no you must wait till you have realized on your western lots they turned down fourteenth street and soon stood in front of mr fairchilds office they entered and this brings us to the point where the last chapter ends chapter xxi mr perkins makes an acquaintance dick ralston and the bookkeeper stared at their western friend in undisguised amazement finally mr mullins said what did i understand you to call yourself paul perkins of minneapolis and you are staying at the fifth avenue hotel certainly didnt you send this boy with a message said mr perkins rather impatiently yees how did you know that i was coming to new york thats what beats me mullins began to appreciate the situation and he was cudgeling his brains for an explanation finally one came i may be misinformed but i learned from a friend of yours that you were coming here with an intention of locating in our city now as we are in the real estate business i thought we would offer our services to find you a suitable house some friend of mine notified you of my coming to new york why i started off on a sudden without consulting anyone i dont see how anyone could give you the information i wont undertake to explain it said the bookkeeper i will only say that i am glad to meet you thank you you are very polite what was the name of the friend who spoke about me and my plans i have a poor memory for names but i believe i have the gentlemans card in my desk he opened the desk and made an elaborate search for what he knew he should not find its no use he said after a pause its disappeared what was the appearance of the person persisted mr perkins he was tall and yes with a dark complexion and and side whiskers about how old i should say about forty i know plenty of people answering that description but how did he happen to call on you there you have me he had some business with mr fairchild and unfortunately mr f started west this morning i see i can get no clew to the mystery however i am glad to have made the acquaintance of this young man indicating chester oh you mean our office boy returned mullins coldly just then dick ralston nudged the bookkeeper introduce me he said sotto voce the bookkeeper did not incline favorably to this request but did not dare to refuse dick ralstons appearance was decidedly against him and his loud attire was in keeping with his face and manners mr perkins said mullins allow me to introduce my friend mr ralston glad to meet you mr ralston said the man from minneapolis extending his hand which dick seized and pressed warmly proud to make your acquaintance mr perkins rejoined the gambler i always did like western people thank you i am not western by birth though i went out to minnesota when i was a mere boy and i have no doubt you have prospered said ralston who was really anxious to learn whether mr perkins was well provided with money and was worth fleecing well i dont complain answered perkins in a matteroffact tone i shall be glad to pay you any attentions insinuated ralston i know the ropes pretty well and i flatter myself i can show you the town as well as anyone eh mullins oh yes assented the bookkeeper not over cordially i have no doubt of it mr ralston and i take your offer kindly but i am afraid i wont have time to go round much wont you go out and take a drink mullins you go too thank you but i dont drink at any rate when i am away from home by the way mr and he stopped short for he did not remember the bookkeepers name mr mullins suggested that gentleman you are misinformed about my wanting to locate in this city new yorks a right smart place i admit but give me minneapolis that suits me all right sir i am misinformed thats all if you find my friends card just write and let me know his name id like to know who it is that knows so much about my plans i will where shall i direct oh just direct to minneapolis im well known there a letter will be sure to reach me shall you be at the hotel this evening mr perkins added dick ralston who found it hard to give up his design upon his new acquaintance i dont know i havent made any plans i was thinking i might call upon you dont trouble yourself mr ralston probably you would not find me in mr perkins was a tolerably shrewd man he had sized up the gambler and decided that he did not care to become any better acquainted with him just as you say returned dick ralston looking discomfited i thought perhaps i could make it pleasant for you if i find i have time i can call at your place of business said the man from minneapolis with a shrewd glance at the gambler i have no place of business returned ralston rather awkwardly i am a a capitalist and sometimes speculate in real estate dont i mullins of course by the way i forgot to tell you that i have four lots on ninetysixth street which would make a good investment ninetysixth street ahem rather far uptown whats the figure five thousand dollars ill take a look at them as soon as i have time you see mr perkins i do all my real estate business through my friend mr mullins just so neither mr perkins nor chester was taken in by ralstons assumption of the character of a capitalist the western man had already a shrewd suspicion of the gamblers real business and being a cautious and prudent man did not care to cultivate him goodmorning said mr perkins i must not take up any more of your time will you allow chester to go out with me for five minutes certainly david mullins would have liked to refuse but had no good excuse for doing so dont stay long he said rather sharply i wont keep him long when they were in the street mr perkins said i dont like the looks of that bookkeeper of yours nor do i returned chester i wouldnt trust him any further than i could see him who was that ralston have you ever seen him before once he doesnt come into the office when mr fairchild is at home do you know anything about him i know that is i have heard that he is a wellknown gambler by the great horn spoon if i didnt think so he seemed very anxious to show me round the city he would probably have taken you to a gambling house not if i was in my senses i dont gamble and i hope you dont i shouldnt know how answered chester with a smile have you any engagement for this evening no sir what time do you leave the office at five oclock then come round to the hotel and take dinner with me i dont know anyone in the city and i shall be glad to have your company this evening we will take a walk together and you can show me whats worth seeing are you not afraid that i will take you to a gambling house asked chester with a smile ill risk it you would find mr ralston a better guide but not so safe a one i shall be satisfied with you when chester returned to the office mullins asked sharply what did perkins want to say to you he asked me to dine with him tonight at the fifth avenue hotel speak a good word for me chester said ralston with unusual affability i would like to become better acquainted with him what shall i say mr ralston tell him i am a prominent man and expect to be nominated for congress next fall this he said with a wink chester and the bookkeeper laughed ill tell him said chester chapter xxii dick ralstons father when chester followed mr perkins into the great dining room of the fifth avenue he was rather dazzled by its size and the glistening appearance of the tables i hope you have brought your appetite with you chester said his western friend the fifth avenue sets a good table my appetite is sure to be good i was kept so busy today that i had hardly time to buy a sandwich for lunch all the better youll enjoy your meal as for me i dont have the appetite i do at home theres nothing like a tramp on the open prairie to make a man feel peckish have you ever been in new york before mr perkins not since i was a boy i was born up albany way and came here when i was about your age but lord the new york of that day wasnt a circumstance to what it is now there was no elevated railroad then nor horse cars either for that matter and where this hotel stands there was a riding school or something of that sort are you going to stay here long i go to washington tomorrow stopping at philadelphia and baltimore on the way no i have no business in washington but i think by the time a man is fifty odd he ought to see the capital of his country i shall shake hands with the president too if i find him at home have you ever been further west than minneapolis yes i have been clear out to the pacific ive seen the town of tacoma where youve got five lots i shall write out to a friend in portland to buy me as many then we shall both have an interest there you think the lots are worth something i know it when the northern pacific railroad is finished every dollar your friend spent for his lots will be worth thirty or forty i hope your predictions will come true mr perkins did i hear you speaking of tacoma asked a gentleman on chesters left hand yes sir i can tell you something about it i live at seattle am i right about there being a future for the place asked paul perkins you are i may say that lots there are already worth twice what they were last week hows that because work on the railroad has been resumed and there is no doubt now that it will be pushed to completion that settles it i must own property there i wont wait to write but will telegraph my friend in portland to go there at once at my expense and buy five no ten lots i got that idea from you chester and if i make a profit i shall feel indebted to you i shall be glad if it helps fill your pockets mr perkins come up to my room for a while chester went on the other and we will consider what to do we might go to the theater but i think i would rather walk about here and there using my eyes there is plenty to see in new york that will suit me mr perkins about eight oclock the two went downstairs near the entrance just inside the hotel chester heard himself called by name looking up he recognized felix gordon are you going to the theater chester asked felix no i think not wont you introduce me to your friend mr perkins this is felix gordon nephew of our bookkeeper said chester unwillingly hope you are well mr gordon said paul are you fond of the theater yes sir answered felix eagerly theres a good play at palmers i think youd like it no doubt but id rather see the streets of new york as you are a friend of chester do me the favor to buy yourself a ticket and mr perkins drew a twodollar bill from his pocket and tendered it to felix i am ever so much obliged said felix effusively as it is time for the performance to commence ill go at once if youll excuse me certainly you dont want to lose the beginning of the play as felix started off on a half run mr perkins said do you know why i was so polite to felix who by all accounts isnt your friend at all no i was rather puzzled i wanted to get rid of him he was probably sent here by his uncle as a spy upon us now he is disposed of i see you are shrewd said chester laughing yes im a little foxy when theres occasion rejoined mr perkins now where shall we go i will not undertake to describe the route followed by the two the city was pretty much all new to the stranger from minneapolis and it mattered little where he went about ten oclock the two witnessed from a distance a scene between a man of forty and an old infirm man apparently seventy years of age the younger man is ralston the gambler said chester in excitement when they were near enough to recognize the figures of the two halt a minute and let us hear what it is all about returned mr perkins i am hungry said the old man pitifully and i have no money for a bed have pity on me dick and give me something you ought not to have come here returned ralston roughly why didnt you stay in the country where you had a comfortable home in the poorhouse murmured the old man sadly well its no worse for being a poorhouse is it but is it right for me to live there when you are rich and prosperous how do you know i am rich and prosperous by your dress and theres a diamond in your shirt bosom that must be valuable its about all i own that is valuable it was a fools errand that brought you here you had better go back and ralston prepared to go on wont you give me a trifle dick well take that a quarter yes it will give you some supper but what shall i do for a bed go to the station house theyll take in an old man like you before the aged man could renew his application the younger one had disappeared round the corner of the next street follow me chester said paul perkins im going to speak to the old man he touched him on the shoulder are you in trouble my friend he asked the old man looking the picture of despondency in his ragged suit and with his long gray locks floating over his shoulders turned at the words yes sir he said i am poor and in trouble and my heart is sore is the man who has just left you related to you he is my only son he doesnt seem kind to you no he cares nothing for his old father how did you become so poor he is the cause when he was turned twentyone i was worth ten thousand dollars he forged my name more than once and to save him i paid the forged notes so it happened that i was turned out in my old age from the farm and the home that had been mine for twentyfive years and in the end i was sent to the poorhouse then he brought all this upon you yes do you know what he is now he tells me he is in business his business is carried on at the gambling house so my young friend here assures me you will get no help from him i begin to think so perhaps i was foolish to leave my home poor as it was and come here to ask help how much money will take you home two dollars here is a tendollar bill take it get a meal and a nights lodging and in the morning start for home it is the best thing you can do as for your son you can only leave him to his own devices a man who will treat his old father as he has treated you will never prosper thank you sir i will follow your advice i would rather be in your position old and poor as you are than in his chester added mr perkins as they walked on this ralston is a more contemptible rascal than i thought if my old father were living i would give half the money i possess while i had a dollar in my pocket he should share it i say the same mr perkins when they reached the fifth avenue hotel paul perkins shook hands with chester goodnight he said you wont see me for two weeks perhaps but ill be sure to find you out when i return to the city i hope you wont have any trouble with that scoundrel in the office thank you mr perkins but i am afraid i shall dont mind it if you do remember that you will always have a friend in paul perkins chapter xxiii chester is discharged well said david mullins addressing his cousin felix did you go to the fifth avenue hotel last evening yes cousin david did you see that man from minneapolis and chester yes where did they go i dont know you dont know frowned mullins and why not i should like to know because i went to palmers theater so that is the way you spent the quarter i gave you exclaimed the bookkeeper indignantly i couldnt go to palmers on that did you go with them asked mullins hopefully no but mr perkins gave me money to go what made him do it he thought i was a friend of chester how much did he give you i occupied a dollar seat answered felix noncommittally he did not care to mention that the sum given him was two dollars half of which he still had in his pocket humph so he gave you a dollar why didnt you take it and stay with them because he gave it to me expressly for the theater it would have looked strange if i had stayed with them after all i would have found a way but you are not smart felix did not make any reply being content with having deceived his cousin as to mr perkins gift i say cousin david arent you going to bounce that boy pretty quick and give me his place yes as soon as i get a good excuse will you do it today no it would look strange you may be sure i wont keep him long at this point chester came into the office and was surprised to see mr mullins and felix already there usually the bookkeeper did not show up till half an hour later goodmorning said mullins smoothly did you dine with mr perkins last evening yes sir i suppose you went to the theater no mr perkins preferred to take a walk as he has not been in new york since he was a boy did you enjoy the play felix yes thank you it was very nice i am ever so much obliged to mr perkins for the money to go mr perkins must be a rich man said mullins interrogatively i think he is pretty well off answered chester how long does he stay in the city he was to leave this morning he is going to washington david mullins was glad to hear this it would make it easier for him to discharge chester he dispatched him on an errand and was about to make some entries in the books when dick ralston strolled in how are you dick can i do anything for you this morning yes you can let me have a hundred dollars i cant do that answered the bookkeeper with a slight frown youll have to settle up soon said ralston in a surly tone give me time cant you i cant do everything in a minute what is the matter with you you look as if you had got out of the wrong side of the bed i had a disagreeable thing happen last evening who should appear to me on madison avenue but the old man your father yes he left a good comfortable home up in the country and came here to see if he couldnt get some money out of me did he i gave him a quarter and advised him to go back he seems to think i am made of money so he has a comfortable home yes answered ralston hesitating slightly hes better off than i am in one way he has no board to pay and sometimes i havent money to pay mine i suppose he is staying with friends or relatives said mullins who was not aware that mr ralston senior was the inmate of a poorhouse it is an arrangement i made for him i felt angry to see him here and i told him so however he isnt likely to come again have you heard from fairchild yet no it isnt time he wont reach chicago till this evening or tomorrow morning meanwhile that is while he is away you have full swing eh yes i suppose so then youll be a fool if you dont take advantage of it david mullins did not answer he repented now that it was too late that he had placed himself in the power of such a man as dick ralston as long as he owed him seven hundred and fifty dollars there was no escaping him and mullins felt very uncomfortable when he considered what steps the gambler wanted him to take to get free from his debts at this moment a dignifiedlooking gentleman living on west fortyseventh street entered the office he was the owner of a large building of which mr fairchild acted as agent he looked askance at dick ralston whose loud dress and general appearance left little doubt as to his character is mr fairchild in the caller asked no sir he started for the west yesterday i am sorry i can attend to your business mr gray no thank you i prefer to wait how long will mr fairchild be absent probably six weeks the gentleman took his leave with another side glance at ralston when he had gone ralston said who is that mullins mr gray a wealthy banker living on fortyseventh street so why didnt you introduce me to the old duffer i might have made something out of him he is not your style dick he wouldnt care to be introduced to a stranger so he puts on airs does he no but he is rather a proud reserved man thinks himself better than his fellow men i suppose sneered the gambler i cant say but it wouldnt have been policy to make you acquainted if you wont be offended dick i will say that though i am personally your friend i am afraid that it isnt best for you to be here so much so you are getting on your high horse mullins are you no but you are too well known dick if you were only an ordinary man now it would be different but your striking appearance naturally makes people curious about you dick ralston was not insensible to flattery and this compliment propitiated him he was about to go out when chester entered returning from his errand how are you kid inquired ralston very well mr ralston answered chester coldly for he could not forget how the gambler had treated his old father well did you pass the evening with that cowboy from minneapolis i spent the evening with mr perkins of course thats what i mean has he got money he didnt tell me he gave felix money to go to the theater interposed mullins is that so he seems to be liberal id like to cultivate his acquaintance how long is he going to stay at the fifth avenue he left for washington this morning i am sorry to hear it another chance gone mullins the bookkeeper looked warningly at ralston he did not care to have him speak so freely before the office boy i dont suppose we are likely to have any business with paul perkins he said i offered to sell him a house but he doesnt care to locate in new york things went on as usual for the rest of the day mr mullins if anything treated chester better than usual and the office boy began to think that he had done the bookkeeper injustice felix spent considerable of his time in the office spending his time in reading nickel libraries of which he generally carried a supply with him on the next day about three oclock in the afternoon chester was sent downtown on an errand he was delayed about ten minutes by a block on the sixth avenue car line when he entered the office mullins demanded sharply what made you so long chester explained thats too thin retorted the bookkeeper i have no doubt you loitered wasting your employers time that isnt true mr mullins said chester indignantly you wont mend mattters by impertinence it is clear to me that you wont suit us i will pay you your wages up to this evening and you can look for another place mr fairchild engaged me mr mullins it is only right that you should keep me till he returns and report your objections i dont require any instructions from you you are discharged do you understand yes answered chester slowly you neednt wait till evening here is your money felix will take your place for the present yes cousin david returned felix with alacrity i protest against this sudden discharge said chester for no fault of my own mr mullins you have said enough i understand my business there was nothing for chester to do but to accept the dismissal it took him by surprise for though he anticipated ill treatment he had not expected to be discharged well felix said the bookkeeper youve got the place at last yes smiled felix complacently didnt chester look glum when you bounced him i dont know and i dont care i have no further use for him hes too fresh chapter xxiv introduces mr sharpleigh the detective chester was not so much disturbed by his discharge so far as it related to his own welfare as by the thought that mr fairchilds interests were threatened he felt that his absent employer ought to be notified at once accordingly he went to the fifth avenue hotel and telegraphed to chicago i am discharged felix gordon is in my place will write a few hours later chester received the following message at his lodgings your telegram received will write you instructions fairchild two days later chester received a letter requesting him to call at once on a wellknown detective give him all the available information and request him to keep careful watch of mr mullins and his operations and interfere if any steps were taken prejudicial to mr fairchilds interests chester called on the detective and was fortunate enough to find him in he expected to see a large man of impressive manners and imposing presence and was rather disappointed when he found a small personage under the average height exceedingly plain and unpretentious who might easily have been taken for an humble clerk on a salary of ten or twelve dollars a week mr sharpleigh listened attentively to chesters communication and then proceeded to ask questions do you know anything of mr mullins outside of the office he asked a little sir has he any bad habits is he extravagant does he drink i have never seen any evidence that he drank answered chester perhaps he may drink a glass of wine or beer occasionally i dont mean that he is not what may be called an intemperate man no sir any other objectionable habits i think he gambles ha this is important what makes you think so he seems to be intimate with a man who i am told is a wellknown gambler who is it dick ralston ralston is as well known as any gambler in the city how is it that this has not excited the suspicions of mr fairchild i dont think mr fairchild knows it then ralston doesnt come into the office he did not when mr fairchild was in town as soon as mr fairchild left he came at once and now spends considerable time there probably mullins owes him money lost in gambling i think he does i overheard him one day urging mr mullins to give him money that makes it probable do you know if they keep company outside i have seen them walking late in the evening why do you think mr mullins discharged you he wanted the place for a cousin of his what name felix gordon is he there now yes felix was taken on when i was discharged at once yes he was in the office probably waiting for the vacancy the plan seems to have been cut and dried what sort of a boy is felix i dont know him very well he seems on confidential terms with mr mullins did the bookkeeper have any other reasons for disliking you yes i interfered to prevent his cheating a mechanic out of his months rent state the circumstances chester did so how long has mr mullins been in mr fairchilds employ about five years i think i have heard that speaks well for him probably his acquaintance with ralston is recent or he would have done something before this to insure his discharge there was a short silence and chester asked have you any more questions mr sharpleigh not at present will you give me your address chester did so i will send for you if i need you i think you can help me materially you seem to have a clear head and are observing it was the evening for chester to call at prof hazlitts i passed your office this morning chester said arthur burks and thought of calling in but i was in haste you wouldnt have found me arthur i am discharged what exclaimed arthur in surprise what complaint does mr fairchild make of you none at all he is out of the city the bookkeeper who dislikes me discharged me and gave the place to his cousin i am awfully sorry what will you do i have some money saved up besides i shall devote more time to drawing i made a sketch yesterday which mr conrad thinks i will get ten dollars for that is fine i never earned ten dollars in my life you have never felt obliged to work except in school i take care not to injure my health in studying said arthur with a laugh i will speak to uncle edgar and he will arrange to have you come four times a week instead of two then you will earn more money from him thank you arthur i should like that prof hazlitt on being spoken to ratified this arrangement so that chesters mind was easy he knew now that he would be able to support himself and more too chester soon had something more to encourage him he received at his lodgings the following letter mr chester rand dear sir we are about to establish a new comic weekly which we shall call the phoenix it is backed by sufficient capital to insure its success our attention has been called to some illustrations which you have furnished to some of our successful contemporaries and we shall be glad to secure your services we may be able to throw considerable work in your way please call at our office as soon as possible editors of the phoenix chester was quite exhilarated by this letter he felt that it was a proof of his growing popularity as an artist and this was particularly gratifying besides his income would be largely at any rate considerably increased he lost no time in presenting himself at the office of the phoenix it was located in a large office building on nassau street he took the elevator and went upstairs to the sixth floor on the door of a room a little way from the elevator he saw the name and knocked come in was the response chester opened the door and found himself in the presence of a man of about forty with a profusion of brown hair shading a pleasant countenance he looked up inquiringly as chester entered is this the editor of the phoenix inquired chester respectfully the phoenix will have no existence till next week answered the other pleasantly i expect to be its editor i came in answer to your letter to my letter repeated the editor puzzled yes my name is chester rand what exclaimed the brownhaired man almost incredulously you a boy how old are you sixteen and you are a contributor to puck and other papers yes sir you must be a smart boy shake hands chester shook hands with a smile will my being a boy make any difference he asked not if your work is satisfactory are you willing to work exclusively for the phoenix yes sir that is if i may be allowed to complete a contract i have made what sort of a contract i am illustrating prof hazlitts ethnological work i think it may take me some months more working evenings that wont interfere with us i was afraid you might be under an engagement with a rival publication no sir so far as that goes i will confine myself to the phoenix if terms are satisfactory i suppose yes sir then i will agree to pay you twentyfive dollars a week for the first six months i may be able to do better afterward chester was dazzled twentyfive dollars a week what would silas tripp say to that or his enemy the bookkeeper i accept he answered promptly chapter xxv chester meets another artist where do you wish me to work asked chester after a pause you can work at home but you can call at the office every day to leave your work and receive instructions all right sir when do you wish me to commence at once have you any work ready i asked because we want to get out the first number as soon as possible i have one sketch and have several ideas jotted down good deliver as much as possible tomorrow chester returned home in a high state of exultation he would be paid less for individual sketches but on the other hand he would have a steady income and an assured market for all he might produce it seemed a wonderful promotion from five dollars a week to twentyfive to be sure when in the real estate office he had picked up extra compensation for outside work but this was precarious and could not be depended on with twentyfive dollars a week he would feel rich this set him to considering that he must have a better room if he was to do work at home in the same house where he now occupied a hall bedroom was a large square room well lighted with two windows well furnished and having a good writing desk left by some previous tenant in part payment of arrears of rent which he could have for five dollars a week he had often thought he would like to occupy it and wished he might find an agreeable roommate who would share the expense with him now he felt that he could bear the expense alone he lost no time in securing it and moving his few belongings in mrs crosby his landlady was rather surprised you must be doing well she said chester smiled i have been discharged from my position in the real estate office he said then said the landlady in some dismay isnt it imprudent to take a more expensive room i have secured a much better place oh that alters the case is it likely to be permanent if i lose it i will go back to my old room i am sure i am glad to hear of your good luck mr rand it is very seldom that a young man of your age call me a boy i am not a young man yet you seem to be getting on as well as a young man i think you are real smart you mustnt flatter me mrs crosby you will make me vain i forgot to say that i shall be a considerable part of the time in my room that is why i want a larger one but when will you work asked the landlady puzzled i shall work in my room but what work can you do there i am an artist that is i am to make drawings for a new magazine you dont say so will that pay very handsomely i hope you will show me some of them i never met an artist before i am afraid i am not much of an artist i can show you one of my pictures now chester took from the table a number of puck and pointed out a sketch thats pretty good said the landlady you wouldnt get more than thirtyfive cents for such a picture would you i was paid five dollars for that do tell exclaimed mrs crosby who was brought up in a country town and still used some of the expressions which were familiar to her in early days i cant hardly believe it it seems foolish to pay so much for such a little thing i dont think it foolish mrs crosby it must pay them or they wouldnt keep on doing it chester moved into his new room and enjoyed his ample accommodations very much the next day he went to the office of the phoenix and carried in two sketches they were fortunate enough to win the approval of the editor i see you are practical and understand what we want mr rand he said just behind chester was a man of fifty rather shabby and neglectful in his personal appearance he might be described as an artist going to seed whatever talent he might have had originally had been dulled and obscured by chronic intemperance excuse me sir he said deferentially but i would like to submit a couple of sketches i am guy radcliff glad to see you mr radcliff let me examine them i am afraid said the editor after a brief examination that these are not quite what we want is it possible exclaimed mr radcliff indignantly you scorn my work yet accept the sketches of that boy pointing at chester with withering contempt because he has given me what i want i was a famous artist before he was born very likely and had done good work but this is not good work sir my dear sir dont be offended i dont care for the age of any of my contributors i know something of your famous successes and i hope next time to approve and buy what you bring me mr radcliff seemed only half propitiated he and chester went out together what is your name boy asked the artist chester rand i never heard of you i am only a beginner said chester modestly you seem to have got in with fleming i may not keep in with him are you doing pretty well yes for a boy have you got a loose quarter about you i havent done much work lately and am hard up chester took half a dollar from his pocket and handed it to the elder man his compassion was stirred as he felt for radcliffs humiliation in being obliged to make such an appeal to a boy like himself thank you youre a gentleman ill return it soon said radcliff looking relieved good luck to you youre a good fellow after all i wish you good luck too mr radcliff chester did not need to be told what had brought the elder artist into such an impecunious condition his face with its unnatural flush showed that his habits had been far from creditable if i needed anything to keep me from drinking mr radcliffs example would be sufficient thought chester he had before now been invited to take a drink at some convenient saloon but he had never been tempted to do so two days later chester was walking through union square when he came face to face with felix gordon felix espied him first hello chester said his successor hello i didnt see you i envy you why you have nothing to do but to enjoy yourself answered felix significantly oh thats it said chester smiling he saw that felix thought him to be out of employment that was the case with you before you succeeded me in the real estate office how do you like it pretty well but i think i ought to get more salary you got five dollars didnt you yes i will try and get six when mr fairchild gets back i wish you success you dont feel any grudge against me for taking your place no it wasnt you who got me discharged i thought youd be in to get a letter of recommendation from cousin david would he give me one i dont know are you trying to get a place no felix looked surprised you aint rich are you he asked no what makes you ask i dont see how you can live without any salary i couldnt i ought to tell you that i have got a place you have exclaimed felix in surprise and it must be confessed disappointment yes where is it in the office of a new paper what is it the phoenix a comic paper just started where is the office in nassau street then why are you not there i dont have to be there all the time do you get good pay yes how much i get more than i did at the real estate office you dont say yes i was in luck do you get six dollars more i dont care to tell you just how much i get by the way there was an old man in the office yesterday inquiring after you did he give his name yes he said his name was silas tripp what on earth brought mr tripp to new york chester asked himself this question will be answered in the next chapter chapter xxvi a stranger in new york it was not often that silas tripp went to new york the expense was a consideration and again he found it difficult to leave his business but he had received a circular from an investment company in wall street offering ten per cent interest for any money he might have to invest high interest always attracts men who love money and it so happened that silas had five hundred dollars invested the difference between six and ten per cent interest on this sum would make twenty dollars annually besides a contingent share in extra profits promised in the circular and on the whole he thought it would pay him to make the journey he went at once to the office of messrs gripp co on his arrival in the city he found the financial agents occupying handsome offices well furnished and covered with a thick turkey carpet everything betokened prosperity and mr tripp was dazzled the result was that he made the investment and laid away in his oldfashioned wallet five new bonds assuring a dividend of ten per cent i calclate its safe he said to mr gripp a stout man with a florid face expensively dressed and sporting a large and showy diamond ring assuredly my dear sir said gripp with suavity i congratulate you mr tripp on making an unusually profitable investment i venture to say that within the year besides the regular dividend there will be an extra dividend of five per cent making fifteen per cent in all it is a pity you had not more invested mebby ill bring you in some more bimeby said mr tripp cautiously i trust you will for your own sake to us it is not important as we have plenty of capital offered indeed we have had to limit investments to five thousand dollars for each person why a millionaire whose name would be very familiar to you if i could venture to mention it came here last week and wanted to invest fifty thousand dollars in our bonds but i firmly refused to take more than five thousand i dont see why you should said silas puzzled i will tell you why we wish to give a chance to smaller investors like yourself for instance rich men have plenty of ways in which to invest their money to advantage while you probably dont know where to get over six per cent no i never got moren that i dare say you have considerable invested at that small interest well mebbe think how much it would be for your advantage to get four per cent more to be sure sartin well ill think of it mr gripp mebbe ill come and see you agin soon mr gripp smiled to himself he saw that the bait was likely to prove effective well goodby mr gripp youll send me any information about the bonds yes mr tripp with pleasure whenever you are in the city even if you have no business with us make our office your home whenever you have any letters to write we will furnish you a desk and all facilities thank you mr gripp youre very obleeging so the old man went out feeling very complacent over his new investment and much pleased with the handsome way he was treated by mr gripp lemme see he reflected ive got five thousand dollars invested at ten per cent it would amount to five hundred dollars and with an extra dividend of two hundred and fifty dollars more ill have to think it over all seems safe and square and mr gripp is a real gentleman silas tripp looked at his watch it was only halfpast ten how should he occupy his spare time i guess ill go and see chester rand he said his mother told me where he was working perhaps hell know of some cheap place where i can get dinner the last time i was in the city it cost me forty cents thats a terrible price mr tripp knew the location of mr fairchilds office and after some inquiry he found his way there he felt so much like a stranger in the big city that he anticipated with pleasure seeing a familiar face perhaps chester would invite him out to lunch and mr tripp in his frugality would not have declined the offer even of an office boy as long as it would save him expense felix gordon was just leaving the office on an errand is that mr fairchilds office inquired silas yes answered felix with rather a disdainful glance at silas tripps rusty garments much obleeged to ye said silas he entered the office and glanced about expecting to see chester david mullins came forward and with some show of civility greeted the old country merchant though he was not naturally polite he knew that the size of a mans purse could not always be judged from the cut or quality of his garments and he was just as ready to make money out of silas as out of any fashionably dressed customer is mr fairchild in asked silas no mr fairchild is out west i am mr mullins his bookkeeper and represent him just so have you a boy workin for you named chester chester rand are you a friend of his asked the bookkeeper well yes i come from wyncombe where he lives and i know his folks i was told he was workin here yes he was working here answered mullins emphasizing the past tense isnt he here now demanded silas with surprise no hows that its rather a delicate matter as you are a friend of his but some days since i was obliged to discharge him you dont say ejaculated silas in manifest surprise i am sorry to say it but what was the matter what did he do well as to that he did nothing very serious but he wasted time when he was sent out on an errand and i felt that it was injurious to the interests of mr fairchild to retain him he used to be spry enough when he worked for me when he worked for you yes i keep a store out in wyncombe and he was in my employ most a year i used to think him quite a lively boy i dare say he would do very well in a country store but in the city we want boys to be active and wide awake i dont want to say anything against him he was perfectly honest so far as i know has he got another place i dont think he has it is difficult for a boy to get a place in this city that is a good place and he wouldnt be likely to refer any employer to me im afraid hell be put to it to live for his mother was poor how much wages did you pay him five dollars a week thats pretty high pay so it is and we expect a firstclass boy for that have you got a better boy in his place yes i have taken in a cousin of mine who knows my ways and satisfies me was it the boy i saw just after i came in a darkcomplexioned boy with black hair yes that is felix and you find him better than chester yes silas tripp did not make any comments but he had not been very favorably impressed by the little he had seen of chesters successor mebbe chester isnt adapted to the city silas said i think you are right it would be better for him to go back into your store but country boys fancy they must come to the city and become city business men thats so mebbe i wouldnt succeed in the city myself though im doin a tidy business in wyncombe id like to see chester can you tell me where he lives no i havent his address i wonder he hasnt gone back home mebbe he hasnt got the money i presume you are correct in your conjecture his mother hasnt said anything to me about chester bein out of work im surprised at that perhaps he did not like to tell her very like very like im really sorry to hear chester aint done no better he isnt quite up to our mark but i dare say he will do very well in the country or in some small business are you doin a large business you dont seem to have much stock here my dear sir we cant get brownstone houses and country villas into an office like this is that what you sell yes i sold a fiftythousanddollar house this morning up on fortyfifth street and yesterday i sold a summer hotel for forty thousand dollars our commission in each case would be several hundred dollars sho well you be doin a good business can you tell where i can get a good dinner moderate felix came in at this moment felix said his cousin you may keep the office while i go out to lunch mr you didnt tell me your name silas tripp mr tripp it will give me pleasure if you will go out and take lunch with me well i am sure youre very polite said silas pleased to think he would be saved expense im much obliged so the two went out together mullins continued to say considerable that was derogatory to chester and left mr tripp under the impression that he was a failure so far as new york business was concerned chapter xxvii mr tripp is disappointed silas tripp returned home full of the news he had heard in new york just as i thought he said to himself chester rand ought never to have left wyncombe he aint calclated to succeed in the city hed orter have stayed in my store in two or three years he might have been earnin four or five dollars a week and he could have boarded at home it costs a sight to live in the city i aint sure that i could afford it myself mr tripp decided to offer chester his old place at two dollars and a half a week abel wood was again in his employ but he didnt like him as well as chester the latter he had always found reliable while abel was rather apt to forget what silas told him once he had stopped in the street and played ball losing ten or fifteen minutes in that way mr tripp was obliged to confess that he never had a more satisfactory boy than chester the store closed at nine and silas instead of going into the house walked over to mrs rands cottage she was rather surprised when she saw who her visitor was goodevening mr tripp she said politely wont you come in thank you widder its rather late to call but i thought you might like to hear about york seein chester is there have you been to new york today yes i went up on a little business did you see chester no i didnt see him answered silas significantly did you hear anything of him mrs rand naturally asked mr tripp coughed well yes i heered somethin about him is he sick asked the mother anxiously made apprehensive by his tone not that i know of haint he writ anything special to you i had a letter yesterday but there was nothing special in it i suppose he didnt say nothin about his place yes he likes it very much i dont like to say it widder but hes deceivin you i saw his employer myself and he said that he had to discharge chester somehow mrs rand did not seem so much disturbed by this intelligence as the storekeeper thought she would be oh you mean the real estate office she said yes i was treated quite handsome by mr mullins the bookkeeper who is runnin the business while mr fairchild is away he says chester wasnt spry enough that he wasnt wide awake enough to work in the city mrs rand actually smiled so that is what he said she returned i can tell you why chester was discharged mr mullins wanted to give the place to his nephew mebbe so answered silas dubiously anyhow its unfortunate for chester to lose his place i feel for you mrs rand as i always liked chester myself and i came here tonight to say that im ready to take him back into the store and give him two dollars and a half a week he suits me mr tripp leaned back in the rockingchair and looked as if he had made a very handsome proposal i see mr tripp said mrs rand smiling that you think chester is out of a position so he is wasnt he discharged i know from what mr mullins said he wont take him back chester would not be willing to go back he has a new and better place you dont say ejaculated mr tripp surprised and it must be confessed disappointed what sort of a place is it he is working for a new york paper or magazine sho does he get as much pay as he did at the other place considerably more mrs rand answered with satisfaction moren five dollars a week yes he offers to send me five dollars a week but i can get along without assistance since miss dolby pays me so liberally well i am surprised chester is very lucky mebbe it wont last he continued hopefully it seems likely to be permanent well i guess i must be goin if he should lose his place tell him i will take him back any time i dont think he would be satisfied to come back to wyncombe after working in new york silas tripp returned to his house rather disappointed he had felt so sure of securing chesters services and now his old boy seemed to be quite out of his reach offered to send his mother five dollars a week he soliloquized then he must be makin as much as ten in his new place mr mullins didnt seem to know about it i wonder what he can be doin to get such a high salary chapter xxviii prof nugent chester still went three times a week to the house of prof hazlitt he was getting on fast with the professors work i think i shall go to press with my book before the end of the year said the professor one evening as chester was taking his leave in my preface i shall mention your name chester as my artistic collaborator couldnt you mention my name too uncle edgar asked arthur burks in what way inquired the professor smiling you can say that i supervised the illustrations answered arthur demurely i am afraid you will have to wait till you are better entitled to credit now thats mean uncle edgar i know how ill get even with you how i will write a rival book and get chester to illustrate it better than yours it would need better illustrations since there would be nothing else in the work worthy of attention your uncle has got you there said chester youll illustrate my book wont you certainly that is if i can depend on prompt payment chester and arthur burks were fast friends arthur did not shine in scholarship but he was fond of fun and was a warmhearted and pleasant companion and a true friend one afternoon he called on chester at his room i bring you an invitation to dinner he said uncle has a friend from oregon visiting him and as he is an interesting talker you will enjoy meeting him i believe he is a professor in williamette university thank you arthur i shall be very glad to come come with me now if you have got through your days work you can have a little scientific conversation before dinner it will be the science of baseball and tennis i suspect arthur no doubt you will find me very instructive you always are arthur thank you i like to be appreciated by somebody at the dinner table chester was introduced to prof nugent this is chester rand the young artist who is illustrating my ethnological work brother nugent said prof hazlitt what this boy prof nugent exclaimed in a tone of surprise yes boy as he is he is a salaried contributor to the phoenix you surprise me how old are you mr rand sixteen i suppose you began your art education early chester smiled no sir he answered four months ago i was the boy in a country grocery store this is wonderful i shall subscribe to the phoenix before i go back to my western home i am afraid sir it will be too light to suit your taste my dear young friend dont suppose i am always grave what says the latin poet dulce est desipere in loco if you dont understand it probably arthur can enlighten you what does it mean arthur it means when all your serious work is done tis best to have a little fun answered arthur promptly bravo arthur said prof nugent clapping his hands so we have a young poet as well as a young artist here oh yes answered arthur im pretty smart but few people find it out youd better ask the professor about tacoma suggested arthur during a pause in the conversation chapter xxix mr fairchilds telegram tacoma repeated the professor who is interested in tacoma i own five lots of land there answered chester then i congratulate you lots are rising there and are destined to go to a still higher point how do you account for that asked prof hazlitt in three months the northern pacific railroad will be completed and that will give a great impetus to the growth of the town i expect to live to see fifty thousand people there let me ask how you became possessed of these lots they were given to me by a friend now dead what was his name walter bruce indeed why i own three lots adjoining the bruce lots they are among the best located in the town would you advise me to keep them or sell if i have the chance to keep them by all means i shall keep mine if however you wish to sell i will myself pay you five hundred dollars each then i may consider myself worth twentyfive hundred dollars said chester in a tone of satisfaction yes and more if you are willing to wait i think mr bruce only gave twentyfive dollars apiece for them very likely mine only cost thirty dollars each i shall begin to look upon you as a rich man chester said arthur burks only a rich boy corrected chester laughing i havent begun to shave yet i think i shall commence next week remarked arthur rubbing his cheek vigorously since you own property in our neighborhood mr rand said prof nugent why dont you make us a visit i hope to some day when i can afford it replied chester but i didnt know till you told me just now that my lots were worth more than a trifle if ever you do come dont forget to call on me at the university it is located in salem oregon i may be able to take a trip to tacoma with you thank you sir i should like nothing better the next afternoon chester chanced to enter the fifth avenue hotel he went through the corridor and into the reading room to buy a paper what was his surprise to see his recent acquaintance paul perkins sitting in an armchair reading a minneapolis journal why chester exclaimed mr perkins cordially as he rose and shook chesters hand vigorously it does my heart good to see you i was intending to call at your office tomorrow you wouldnt have found me mr perkins how is that i have been discharged by that rascal mullins its a shame i must see if i cant find you another position thank you but it is not necessary i have a place already good is it in the real estate business no i am engaged on the phoenix a new weekly humorous paper as one of the regular staff of artists whew that is good do you get fair pay twentyfive dollars a week you dont say so that is surprising how much did you get at the other place five then this is five times as good you ought to give mr mullins a vote of thanks for bouncing you i dont think he meant to benefit me said chester smiling do you have to work hard what are your hours i have none i work at home and select my own hours are you through work for the day yes then you must stay and dine with me it is four oclock we can chat for an hour and then go to dinner thank you i will accept with pleasure did you have a pleasant journey yes but i should have enjoyed it better if you had been with me i called at the white house and shook hands with the president did you tell him you wanted an office no office for me i would rather have my own business and be my own master washingtons a fine city but give me minneapolis i may call on you in minneapolis sometime mr perkins i hope you will youll find it worth visiting its a right smart place if i do say it i have seen a professor from a university in oregon and he has given me good news of my lots in tacoma i have five as i think i told you he offered me five hundred dollars apiece cash down dont you take it theyre going a good deal higher now that the railroad is nearly completed so he told me i congratulate you on your good luck chester i am sure you deserve it but you havent told me why you were bounced mr mullins said i wasted time in going his errands it wasnt true but it was only an excuse to get rid of me he took his cousin felix in my place the two friends went to dinner about six oclock at seven they came downstairs and sat in the lobby on a sofa near the door through the portal there was a constant ingress and egress of men a motley crowd business men politicians professionals and men perhaps of shady character for a great hotel cannot discriminate and hundreds pass in and out who are not guests and have no connection with the house it is a wonderful place chester said mr perkins everybody seems at home here i suppose everybody everybody at least who is presentable in new york comes here sometime during the year just then chester uttered a little exclamation of surprise as if to emphasize mr perkins remark two persons came in who were very well known to the young artist they were david mullins and dick ralston mullins heard the slight exclamation and turned his head in the direction of the sofa on which chester and his friend were sitting so did ralston why its your old boy he said mullins smiled a little maliciously he had not heard that chester had a place i suppose you are boarding here he said with a little sarcasm no mr mullins but i have just dined here with my friend mr perkins mullins inclined his head slightly has he adopted you he asked in a tone bordering on impertinence no sir answered mr perkins but if chester ever wants me to i will at present he is prosperous and requires no help or adoption oh have you got a place asked mullins turning to chester yes in the same business no i am in the office of a weekly paper oh said the bookkeeper disdainfully they pay beggarly salaries at such places then i am favored i receive more than twice as much as i did in your office chester did not care to just state how much he received that cant be possible it is a fact however has mr fairchild returned no why do you want to know i have no wish to go back mr mullins dont be apprehensive of that i dont wish to disturb felix dick ralston listened with some interest to the conversation it strikes me the kid has come to no harm from being discharged he said i believe this is mr perkins of minneapolis yes sir answered the westerner eying the gambler with a penetrating glance i shall be glad to be your guide if you wish to see something of new york will you join us this evening you are very polite but i have an engagement with chester a mere boy he knows nothing about the city still i am satisfied with him the two passed on and went into the barroom where they sat down at a table and ordered some liquid refreshment well mullins said the gambler i am getting impatient the days are slipping by and you have done nothing you know what i am waiting for yesterday a check for a thousand dollars was paid in at the office and deposited in the bank today good and then i will send felix to the bank and draw out sixteen hundred will that satisfy you i see and according to our arrangement felix will hand it to me on his way back to the office and then swear that it was taken from him by some unknown party you have coached him have you yes of course i had to let him into the secret partially promising him twentyfive dollars for himself ten would have been sufficient he would not have been satisfied we can spare that how soon do you expect fairchild back in three days but on the morrow mullins was disconcerted by receiving the following telegram expect me back sometime today fairchild chapter xxx the attempted robbery dick ralston was in the real estate office when the telegram was received indeed he spent a good deal of his time there so that it was supposed by some that he had a share in the business look at that dick said the bookkeeper passing the telegram to his confederate confusion what sends him home so soon said ralston do you suppose he suspects anything no how can he perhaps said mullins nervously we had better give up the whole thing you see how i will be placed im afraid i shall be suspected look here growled ralston i dont want to hear any such weak puerile talk how do you propose to pay me the nine hundred and sixtyodd dollars you owe me do you expect to save it out of your salary he concluded with a sneer i wish we had never met said the bookkeeper in a troubled tone thank you but it is too late for that there is nothing to do but to carry out our program how much money is there on deposit in the bank about twentyfour hundred dollars then we had better draw out more than eighteen hundred as well be hanged for a sheep as for a lamb you forget ralston that such a wholesale draft will raise suspicion at the bank youre awfully cautious i dont want everything to miscarry through imprudence come it is ten oclock better send felix to the bank better wait a little while if we drew such a large amount just at the beginning of banking hours the bank officers might suspect something cautious again well wait half an hour if you must call felix and give him his instructions felix gordon came in at this moment and was admitted to the conference felix said the bookkeeper you remember the arrangement i made with you yesterday yes cousin david it is to be carried out today i shall give you a check for eighteen hundred dollars and you will receive the money and come from the bank here yes cousin david you will carry the parcel in the lefthand pocket of your sack coat and if it is taken you can appear to be unconscious of it yes and that is all you will have to do except to say that a tall thin man ralston was short and sturdy jostled against you and must have taken it all right i see and i am to have twentyfive dollars for your trouble yes give it to me now wait till you come back dont be afraid you will get it all right when felix was on his way to the bank he did not know that he was followed at a little distance by a small man with keen black eyes who without appearing to do so watched carefully every movement of the young office boy when felix entered the bank he also entered the bank and stood behind felix in the line at the paying tellers window he nodded secretly to the teller when that official read the check presented by felix eighteen hundred dollars the latter repeated aloud yes sir answered felix composedly i shall have to go back to get it we havent as much here he went to another part of the bank and returned after a time with three packages one was labeled one thousand dollars another five hundred dollars and a third two hundred dollars then he counted out from the drawer beside him a hundred dollars in bills felix with a look of relief took the three parcels and dropped them carelessly in the side pocket of his sack coat and put the bills in loose then he started on his way back to the office mr sharpleigh for it was he as the reader has doubtless guessed walked closely behind him he was not quite sure as to the manner in which the money was to be taken but guessed at once when he caught sight of dick ralston at a little distance with his eyes intently fixed upon felix the office boy sauntered along with nothing apparently on his mind and finally stopped in front of a window on union square which appeared to have considerable attraction for him then it was that the detective saw ralston come up and while apparently watching the window also thrust his hand into the pocket of the office boy and withdraw the package of money which he at once slipped into his own pocket mr sharpleigh smiled a little to himself very neat he soliloquized but it wont go down my cunning friend felix gave a little side glance seeing what was going on but immediately stared again in at the window sharpleigh beckoned to a tall man dressed as a civilian but really an officer in plain clothes go after him he said in a low voice indicating ralston then he followed felix who in about five minutes began to show signs of agitation he thrust his hand wildly into his pocket and looked panicstricken what is the matter my boy asked sharpleigh blandly oh sir i have been robbed faltered felix robbed of what i had eighteen hundred dollars in bank bills in my pocket in four parcels and and they must have been taken while i was looking in at this window you seem to have been very careless said sharpleigh why were you not more careful when you knew you had so much money in your care i i ought to have been i know it sir but i wasnt thinking where are you employed at mr fairchilds office on fourteenth street the real estate agent yes sir i know the place my cousin is the bookkeeper he will be so angry with me i think he will have reason i saw a man following you rather closely i presume he took the money oh wont you come back to the office with me and tell my cousin that i am afraid he will discharge me yes i will go with you so it happened that felix and mr sharpleigh went together into the office where mullins was eagerly waiting for the return of his emissary whats the matter felix he said as the boy entered have you brought the money oh cousin david i am so sorry so sorry for what i i have lost the money a pickpocket took it while i was looking in at a window this gentleman was near and he saw a suspiciouslooking man next to me this is a strange story felix we must notify the police at once did you see anyone likely to commit the theft sir this was of course addressed to mr sharpleigh yes you will be willing to testify to this at the police office you see this boy is my cousin mr fairchild is away and i shall be blamed for this terrible loss why there were eighteen hundred dollars in the parcel there were three parcels and a roll of bills cousin david mr mullins looked surprised then it was not all put in one parcel he said no that is strange i i dont know what to do mr fairchild has telegraphed that he will be at home sometime during the day probably i had better wait till he comes before notifying the police this he said in a questioning sort of way as if asking sharpleighs advice that will give the thief a chance to escape suggested the detective true perhaps you will be kind enough to leave word at the nearest police office i only wish mr fairchild were here all right sir said the detective i will comply with your request he left the office but it is needless to say that he didnt go far away this is a very interesting comedy he murmured rubbing his hands a very interesting comedy and apparently played for my benefit now felix said the bookkeeper tell me how it all came out did the paying teller look suspicious when you presented the check no he said he hadnt as much money in the drawer and went to the safe in the back part of the bank he returned with three parcels of bills in brown paper and a hundred dollars loose and then you put it in your pocket yes cousin david i did exactly as you told me i put them in my pocket and walked back in a leisurely way did you see anything of ralston yes i saw him out of the corner of my eye while i was looking in at a window on union square he took the money yes now cousin david give me the twentyfive dollars at that instant the door was opened suddenly and dick ralston dashed into the office looking very much excited mullins he said weve been sold sold regularly sold look at this and he showed one of the brown packages partly torn open well said the bookkeeper whats the matter matter matter enough heres a package marked one thousand dollars and it contains only slips of green paper in place of bills you can see for yourself chapter xxxi a day of surprises the bookkeeper looked amazed he turned to felix was this package given you at the bank he asked yes answered felix i dont understand it do you think they suspected anything he continued turning to ralston what could they suspect growled dick its a pretty trick for a respectable bank to play on a customer was all the money bogus asked mullins here are a hundred dollars in good bills have you opened any of the other packages no but i will the gambler tore off a little of the outer paper from the fivehundreddollar and twohundreddollar packages only to discover that their contents were no more valuable than those of the first bundle id like to know what all this means said ralston is it a trick of yours he demanded looking suspiciously at mullins no on my honor no it is very puzzling they must have made a mistake at the bank send the boy back it wont do he has already reported that he has been robbed its its very awkward you must do something said dick ralston harshly im not going to be swindled in this way it was at this point that the office door was heard to open mr sharpleigh entered and fixed his glance on ralston mr mullins he said you wish to know who robbed your office boy of the money he drew from the bank yes faltered mullins there he stands answered sharpleigh calmly pointing to ralston its a lie exclaimed the gambler but he turned pale i saw the robbery with my own eyes went on the detective and he turned his eyes to the door which opened to admit a stalwart policeman arrest that man said the detective he lay in wait for the office boy and on his return from the bank robbed him of a large sum of money which he had just drawn out who are you demanded ralston trying to brazen it out i am james sharpleigh a detective mullins listened in dismay for sharpleighs name was familiar to him as one of the cleverest detectives in the city and who authorized you to meddle in a matter that did not concern you the answer came from an unexpected quarter mr fairchild valise in hand and dusty with travel entered the office he heard the question and quickly comprehended the situation it is nearly two weeks he said since i engaged mr sharpleigh to watch what was going on in the office chester rand telegraphed me that he had been discharged and my suspicions were excited so its that boy muttered the bookkeeper spitefully i left all to the discretion of my friend sharpleigh who has justified my confidence i shall have to ask him to throw light on the present situation this the detective did in a few brief sentences am i to arrest this man asked the policeman yes answered the broker sternly mr sharpleigh will you accompany the officer and prefer charges see here said ralston with an ugly look im not going to be a scapegoat your bookkeeper put up this job mr fairchild turned slowly and regarded david mullins attentively i will bear in mind what you say he answered i took nothing of value continued ralston and you cant hold me here are three packages filled with green paper yes said sharpleigh the bank teller was acting under my instructions i took care however to have one roll of genuine bills when the three had left the office mr fairchild turned to the bookkeeper mr mullins he said what could induce you to engage in such a wicked plot i dont admit any complicity in the affair replied the bookkeeper in a surly tone have you seen chester rand lately i saw him last evening at the fifth avenue hotel why did you discharge him i thought him unfit for his place there may be a difference of opinion on that point this boy he added significantly is a relative of yours i believe yes will you give me an idea of what has been done during my absence together the broker and the bookkeeper went over the books then mr fairchild went out to dinner he was no sooner out of the office than mullins said felix remain here till mr fairchild returns i am going out on an errand he opened the safe drew therefrom a small package and left the office half an hour later he was on a cortlandt street ferryboat bound for the jersey shore the package which he took with him contained four hundred dollars in bills which he had drawn from the bank the day previous without the knowledge of his confederate he had been providing for contingencies when mr fairchild returned felix delivered the message the broker at once looked suspicious did mr mullins say where he was going he asked yes sir he said he was going out on an errand did he take anything with him i didnt observe sir when sharpleigh came in a little later he looked about him inquiringly wheres mullins i dont think we shall see him again very soon and the broker told the detective what he knew about his disappearance sharpleigh shrugged his shoulders he has been too sharp for us he said do you want me to do anything no his loss of place and reputation will be a sufficient punishment at the close of the day felix said i suppose you dont want me any more you can stay till the end of the week i have not had time to form any plans do do you think cousin david will come back i think it very improbable said the broker seriously can you throw any light on the events of today yes sir go on was the robbery planned yes sir i was to receive twentyfive dollars for my share i believe you know chester rand yes sir do you know where he lives yes sir will you ask him to call here tomorrow i will sir but he tells me he has a good place and would not care to return i am aware of that it is possible i may retain you oh sir if you would on condition that you agree to serve me faithfully this was quite beyond the expectations of felix i will try to do so he said earnestly you have begun well by confessing your share in the plot which came so near being successful as your days work is ended i will consider the errand on which i am sending you extra and will pay you for it the broker handed a half dollar to felix which he accepted joyfully i dont much care if cousin david has gone away he soliloquized mr fairchild seems a good sort of man and ill do my best to please him when felix was ushered into chesters presence the latter was just finishing a comic sketch for the phoenix whats that asked felix in surprise for he was quite unaware of chesters artistic gifts chester showed it to him with a smile now you see how i am making my living he said do you get pay for that yes certainly then felix bethought himself of his errand theres a great row at the office he said mr fairchild has got home cousin david has run away and mr ralston is arrested thats a budget of news when did mr fairchild return this forenoon he wants you to call tomorrow all right i will do so and if he offers you back your old place you wont take it said felix anxiously if you dont i think hell keep me then ill promise not to accept i am better satisfied where i am have you had supper felix no then come and take supper with me i go out about this time it had certainly been a day of surprises as felix reflected when he found himself seated opposite a boy whom he had always disliked as his guest chapter xxxii edward granger i suppose you dont care to come back to the office chester said mr fairchild when chester called upon him the next day at the office i like my present position better answered chester besides i suppose you are hardly prepared to offer me twentyfive dollars a week do you receive as much as that asked the broker in amazement yes sir i congratulate you heartily said mr fairchild it is clear that you are too high priced for the real estate business felix tells me you may retain him i will give him a chance it depends upon himself whether he stays i am very glad of it sir felix has hardly been my friend but now that his cousin is away he may improve i certainly hope so what shall you do about ralston asked chester presently i shall proceed against him such a man is a curse to the community it was through him that my bookkeeper lost his integrity and ruined his prospects if he is locked up he will be prevented from doing any more harm as dick ralston will not again figure in this story it may be mentioned here that he was found guilty in the trial that soon followed and was sentenced to a term of several years imprisonment the bitterest reflection he had when sentence was pronounced was that his confederate mullins had escaped and was a free man rogues may work together but it is seldom that any tie of friendship exists between them chester was now able to save money including what he received from prof hazlitt his income was about thirtyfive dollars a week his personal expenses were greater than they had been on account of having a more expensive room yet altogether they did not exceed twelve dollars per week leaving him a balance of twentythree of this sum he proposed to send his mother a part but she wrote that the liberal board paid by miss jane dolby covered all her expenses i hope if you have money to spare you will put it in some savings bank she wrote at present we are well and prospering but the time may come when our income will be diminished and then it will be very comfortable to have some money laid aside chester acted upon his mothers suggestion he did not tell her how much he earned he wished this to be an agreeable surprise at some future day then chester moved into a larger room the hall bedroom which he had hitherto occupied was taken by a young man of nineteen named edward granger he was slender and looked younger than he was he did not seem strong and there was a sad expression on his face sometimes he called on chester but for several days they had not met about six oclock one afternoon chester knocked at his door come in he heard in a low voice entering he saw edward lying on the bed face downward in an attitude of despondency whats the matter edward he asked are you sick yes sick at heart was the sad reply how is that inquired chester in a tone of sympathy i have lost my place when was that three days since my employer has engaged in my place a boy from the country his nephew and i am laid aside that is unfortunate certainly but you must try to get another place your employer will give you a recommendation wont he yes i have one in my pocket but it is not easy to get a new place and meanwhile he hesitated meanwhile you are out of money i suppose said chester yes i couldnt save anything i got only five dollars a week and my room costs two i suppose when the week is up mrs randolph will turn me into the street not while you have a friend in the next room said chester cordially edward looked up quickly will you really be my friend he asked try me have you had supper i have not eaten anything for two days answered granger sadly why didnt you call upon me i wouldnt have seen you suffer i didnt like to ask i thought you would consider me a beggar you will understand me better after a while now put on your hat and come out with me edward did so but he was so weak from long fasting that he was obliged to lean upon chester in walking to the restaurant which was luckily near by let me advise you to take some soup first said chester your stomach is weak and that will prepare it for heartier food i dont feel hungry returned edward i only feel faint it may be well not to eat very much at first how kind you are i must be two or three years older than you yet you care for and advise me consider me your uncle said chester brightly now tell me how it happens that you didnt apply to some friend or relative a shadow passed over the boys face i have none in new york except yourself then you are not a city boy no i came from portland in maine no in oregon you have relatives there a mother i suppose you hear from her edward granger was silent i dont wish you to tell me if you have an objection yes i will tell you for i think you are a true friend my mother is married again and my stepfather from the first disliked me i think it is because my mother had money and he feared she would leave it to me so he got up a false charge against me of dishonesty my mother became cold to me and i left home i am of a sensitive nature and i could not bear the cold looks i met with how long ago was this about six months since you came to new york directly yes where did you get the money to come i came by it honestly answered edward quickly i had a deposit in a savings bank put in during my own fathers life i felt i had a right to use this and i did so it brought me to new york and kept me here till i got a place in an insurance office and you managed to live on five dollars a week yes it was hard but i went to the cheapest eating houses and i got along but you had no money to buy clothing i brought a fair supply with me now i am beginning to need some small articles such as handkerchiefs and socks i wondered you would never go to supper with me i didnt want you to know how little i ordered you might have thought me mean poor fellow said chester pityingly you have certainly had a hard time and all the while your mother was living in comfort yes in luxury for she is worth at least fifty thousand dollars in her own right i hope your stepfather has not got possession of it he had not when i came away my mother is naturally cautious and would not give it to him he attributed this to my influence over her but it was not so she is of scotch descent and this made her careful about giving up her property she allowed him the use of the income only reserving a little for herself have you had any communication with her since you left portland i wrote her once but received no answer the letter may not have reached her it may have fallen into the hands of your stepfather what is his name trimble abner trimble was he in any business yes he kept a liquor saloon and patronized his own bar too much for his own good i shouldnt think your mother would like to have him in that business she asked him to change it but he wouldnt he had a set of disreputable companions who made his saloon their headquarters and he did not wish to give them up as he might have had to do if he had gone into another business by this time supper was over and the two walked to broadway edward felt stronger and his eye was brighter suddenly he gripped chesters arm do you see that man he asked pointing to a blackbearded man on the other side of the street yes what of him it is a gentleman from portland a neighbor of ours what can he be doing in new york chapter xxxiii a friend from oregon go over and speak to him suggested chester come with me then the two boys crossed the street and intercepted the man from portland he was of medium height with dark hair and had a brisk western way with him dont you remember me mr wilson said edward what edward granger ejaculated the oregonian well i am glad to see you didnt know what had become of you are you living here yes sir let me introduce my friend chester rand glad to meet you mr rand said wilson heartily so you are a friend of edwards indeed he is an excellent friend exclaimed young granger have you seen my mother lately come over to my hotel and ill answer all your questions im stopping at the continental on the next block all right will you come chester yes i shall be glad to they were soon sitting in the office of the continental hotel at the corner of broadway and twentieth street now ill answer your questions said nathaniel wilson yes i saw your mother the day before i set out and is she well asked edward anxiously she was looking somewhat careworn she probably misses you she never writes to me said edward bitterly it may be because she doesnt know your address then your stepfather keeps her prejudiced against you i suppose there is no change in him no except that he is drinking harder than ever his business is against him though he would drink even if he didnt keep a saloon does he treat my mother well i think he does i have never heard anything to the contrary you see he wouldnt dare to do otherwise as your mother has the property and he wants to keep in with her in order to get a share i have been afraid that she would give a part to him thus far i am confident she hasnt done it she is scotch isnt she yes her name was downie and she was born in glasgow but came to this country at an early age the scotch are careful and conservative she probably gives most of her income to trimble indeed he collects her rents but the principal she keeps in her own hands once i heard your stepfather complaining bitterly of this my wife he said treats me very badly shes rolling in wealth and i am a poor man obliged to work early and late for a poor living he pays nothing toward the support of the house said edward indignantly mother pays all bills and gives him money for himself besides i dont see how she could have married such a man nor i he seems coarse and is half the time under the influence of drink i wonder whether he has induced your mother to make a will in his favor said wilson thoughtfully if he did i think her life would be in danger edward turned pale at this suggestion i dont care so much for the property he said but i cant bear to think of my mothers life as being in danger probably your mothers caution will serve her a good turn here also said wilson it isnt best to borrow trouble i will keep watch and if i see or hear of anything alarming i will write you but now tell me about yourself are you at work not just at present replied edward embarrassed but i think i can get him another place in a day or two said chester quickly if you need a little money call on me added the warmhearted westerner you know you used to call me your uncle nathaniel i wouldnt like to borrow said edward shyly when was your birthday a month ago then i must give you a birthday present you cant object to that and mr wilson took a tendollar gold piece from his pocket and pressed it upon edward thank you very much i cant decline a birthday gift thats what i thought i am an old friend and have a right to remember you was mr rand in the same office with you no chester is an artist an artist a boy like him ejaculated the oregonian in surprise chester smiled i am getting older every day he said thats whats the matter with me rejoined mr wilson you havent any gray hair yet while i have plenty not quite yet smiled chester what kind of an artist are you i make drawings for an illustrated weekly it is a comic paper and perhaps you put your friends in occasionally not friends exactly but sometimes i sketch a face i meet in the street you may use me whenever you want a representative of the wild and woolly west thank you mr wilson but in that case you must send me a copy of the paper i wont forget it how long are you staying in new york mr wilson asked edward i go away tomorrow you must spend the evening with me i should like to do so it seems good to see an old friend by and by we will go to delmonicos and have an ice cream i suppose you have been there no office boys dont often patronize delmonico they are more likely to go to beefsteak johns i never heard that name is it a fashionable place yes with those of small pocketbooks it is a perfectly respectable place but people living on fifth avenue prefer the brunswick or delmonicos edward brightened up so much owing to the presence of a friend from his distant home that chester could hardly believe that it was the same boy whom he had found but a short time before in the depths of despondency about nine oclock they adjourned to delmonicos and ordered ices and cake this seems a tiptop place said the oregonian looking about him we havent got anything equal to it in portland but we may have sometime the western people are progressive we dont want to be at the tail end of the procession mr rand you ought to come out and see something of the west particularly of the pacific coast you may not feel an interest in it at present but i have more interest in it than you imagine mr wilson i have some property at tacoma you dont mean it what kind of property i own five lots there then you are in luck lots in tacoma are rising every day but it wouldnt be well to sell at present would it no the railroad has only recently been completed and the growth of tacoma has only just begun i hope to go west some day when you do you must call on me perhaps you will come too edward edward granger shook his head it wont be worth while for me to go back while mr trimble is alive he seems to have such an influence over my mother that it would not be pleasant for me to go there and have a cold reception from her i will call on her and mention your name then i can see how the land lays how she can prefer such a man as abner trimble to her own son i cant understand about ten oclock the two boys left mr wilson who had been going about all day and showed signs of fatigue shant i see you again mr wilson asked edward no i must take an early start in the morning you had better let me lend you a little money no thank you sir your generous gift will help me till i get a place so the farewells were said and the boys walked home now said edward i must try to get a place this money will last me two weeks and in that time i ought to secure something he went from place to place answering advertisements the next day but met with no luck he was feeling rather depressed when chester came into his room i have found a place for you he said brightly you dont mean it where is it asked young granger at the office of the phoenix you will be in the mailing department the salary is small only seven dollars a week but i shall feel rich it is two dollars more than i received at my last place when am i to go to work tomorrow the mailing clerk has got a better place and that makes an opening for you and i owe this good fortune to you said edward gratefully how can i repay you by being my friend that i shall be for life replied edward fervently chapter xxxiv after a year a year passed chester remained in the service of the phoenix which had become an established success his artistic work was so satisfactory that his salary had been raised from twentyfive to thirty dollars per week yet he had not increased his personal expenses and now had nearly a thousand dollars deposited in different savings banks he had concealed the extent of his prosperity from his mother meaning in time to surprise her agreeably about this period he received a letter from wyncombe it was from his mother it ran thus dear chester i am sorry to write you bad news miss jane dolby has decided to visit a sister in chicago and remain a year of course this cuts off the liberal income i have received from her and which has been adequate to meet my expenses i may be able to earn something by sewing but it will be only a little i shall therefore have to accept the offer you made me sometime since to send me a weekly sum i am sorry to be a burden to you but it will only be for a year at the end of that time miss dolby promises to come back and resume boarding with me i think we have reason to feel grateful for your continued success in new york silas tripp called a few evenings since he has had a great deal of trouble with boys he says he has not had anyone to suit him since you left he asked me if i thought you would come back for four dollars a week this he seemed to consider a very liberal offer and it was for him i didnt give him any encouragement as i presume you prefer art to the grocery business you need not begin to send me money at once as i have been able to save a little from miss dolbys board your affectionate mother sarah rand chester answered at once dear mother dont feel any anxiety about your loss of income through miss dolbys departure and dont try to earn any money by sewing my income is larger than you suppose and i will send you weekly as much as you have been accustomed to receive from your boarder should it be more than you need you can lay aside any surplus for future use tell mr tripp i prefer new york to wyncombe as a place of business and i am obliged to decline his generous offer i cannot help thinking sometimes how fortunate it was that he declined over a year since to increase my pay as in that case i might still have been working for him instead of establishing a reputation as an artist here last week i received a larger offer from another publication but as the publishers of the phoenix have always treated me well i didnt think that i would be justified in making a change i mean in a week or two to come home to pass sunday i shall feel delighted to see my friends in wyncombe and most of all my mother your loving son chester mrs rand protested against chester sending her eight dollars a week but he insisted upon it advising her to lay aside what she did not need one evening about this time edward granger who still occupied the small apartment adjoining came into chesters room looking agitated what is the matter asked chester have you had bad news yes i have had a letter from mr wilson of portland whom you recollect we met about a year ago i remember him i will read you his letter you will see that i have reason to feel anxious the letter ran as follows dear edward i promised to send you any news i might pick up about your mother and her premising husband trimble is indulging in liquor more than ever and i dont see how he can stand it unless he has a castiron constitution from what i hear he has never given up trying to get your mothers property into his hands she has held out pretty firm but she may yield yet i hear that he is circulating reports that you are dead in that case he thinks she may be induced to make a will leaving her property to mr trimble having as i believe no near relatives so that he would seem to be the natural heir i may be doing trimble an injustice but i think if such a will were made she wouldnt live long your stepfather is in great straits for money it seems and he might be tempted to do something desperate as far as i can hear abner trimbles plan is this he took a pal of his around to the house who had been in new york recently and the latter gave a circumstantial account of your dying with typhoid fever evidently your mother believed it for she seemed quite broken down and has aged considerably since the news no doubt her husband will seize this opportunity to induce her to make a will in his favor here lies the danger and i think i ought to warn you of it for your presence here is needed to defeat your stepfathers wicked plans come out at once if you can your friend nathaniel wilson what do you think of that chester asked edward in a troubled voice i think it very important your mothers life and your interests both are in peril and the worst of it is that i am helpless said edward sadly i ought to go out there but you know how small my salary is it has required the utmost economy to live and i havent as much as five dollars saved up how can i make such a long and costly journey i see the difficulty edward but i need time to think it over tomorrow afternoon come in and i may have some advice to give you i know that you will advise me for the best chester there is a good deal in age and experience said chester smiling when edward left the room chester took from his pocket a letter received the day previous and postmarked tacoma it was to this effect mr chester rand dear sir we learn that you own five lots on main street numbered from to we have inquiries as to three of those lots as a location for a new hotel which it is proposed to erect at an early date we are therefore led to ask whether you are disposed to sell and if so on what terms we should be glad to have a personal interview with you but if it is impracticable or inconvenient for you to come on to tacoma we will undertake as your agents to carry on the negotiations yours respectfully dean downie real estate agents why shouldnt i go to tacoma thought chester i can probably sell the lots to better advantage than any agents and should be entirely unable to fix upon a suitable price unless i am on the ground in case i go on i can take edward with me and trust to him to repay the money advanced at some future time the more chester thought of this plan the more favorable it struck him he went the next day to the office of the phoenix and after delivering his sketches said i should like leave of absence for two months can you spare me does your health require it mr rand asked the editor no answered chester but i own a little property in tacoma and there are parties out there who wish to buy it is important that i should go out there to attend to the matter the editor arched his brows in astonishment what he said an artist and own real estate this is truly surprising i didnt earn it by my art replied chester smiling it was a bequest that accounts for it i suppose under the circumstances we must let you go but why need you give up your work probably ideas and suggestions may come to you while you are traveling these you can send to us by mail but i cant do enough to earn the salary you pay me then we will pay according to the amount you do that will be satisfactory do you need an advance for the expenses of your journey no i have some money laid by another surprise when do you want to start as soon as possible i will not come to the office again then good luck and a pleasant journey when edward granger came into his room later in the day chester said day after tomorrow we start for oregon ask your employers to hold your place for you and get ready at once but the money chester gasped edward i will advance it to you and you shall repay me when you can chapter xxxv preparing for the journey no sooner had chester decided upon his western journey than he telegraphed to dean downe of tacoma i will call upon you within two weeks mrs rand was much surprised when chester coming home unexpectedly announced his intentions do you want me to take you with me mother asked chester with a smile i am afraid i could not help you much but you are not used to traveling you may take the wrong cars again chester smiled i have spent over a year in the city mother he said i have got along pretty well in the last twelve months havent i yes but suppose you were to fall sick with no one to look after you i didnt tell you that i am going to have company edward granger who was born in oregon and is three years older than myself will go with me then i shall feel easier he knows the way and can look after you chester was secretly of opinion that he was more competent to look after edward but did not say so he saw that his mother was easier in mind and this relieved him before he started from new york he called to see mr fairchild on fourteenth street he fell in with felix gordon how are you getting along felix he asked pretty well mr fairchild has raised me to six dollars a week i am glad of it that shows he is satisfied with you i try to please him i began to think that is the best policy that is why you have succeeded so well do you ever hear from mr mullins no but i know where he is where of course you know that i have no wish to injure him he is somewhere in oregon or perhaps in washington territory washington had not at that time been advanced to the dignity of a state that is curious why is it curious because i am going to start for oregon and washington tonight you dont mean it what are you going for on business answered chester not caring to make a confidant of felix wont it cost a good deal of money yes but i expect to get paid for going what a lucky fellow you are said felix not without a trace of envy i wish i could go i like to travel but i have never had a chance mr fairchild was equally surprised when told of chesters plans are you going as an artist he asked no as a real estate man answered chester i own a few lots in tacoma and have a chance of selling a part of them then he went into particulars i congratulate you i have only one piece of advice to offer make careful inquiries as to the value of property then ask a fair price not one that is exorbitant that might drive the hotel people to seeking another site for their house thank you mr fairchild i will remember your advice the journey is an expensive one if you need two or three hundred dollars i will loan it to you cheerfully thank you very much but i have more money saved up than i shall require i see you are careful and provident well chester i wish you every success i am sure of that mr fairchild by the way i hear that your old bookkeeper is in oregon or washington who told you felix have you any message for him if i happen to meet him say that i have no intention of prosecuting him if he is ever able i shall be glad to have him return the money he took from me as to punishment i am sure he has been punished enough by his enforced flight and sense of wrongdoing chapter xxxvi a great surprise from new york to tacoma is a long journey over three thousand miles must be traversed by rail but the trip is far from tiresome chester and his companion thoroughly enjoyed it all was new and strange and the broad spaces through which they passed were full of interest they stopped at niagara falls but only for a few hours and spent a day in chicago then they were whirled onward to st paul and minneapolis and later on over the broad plains of north dakota and through the mountains of montana i never thought the country was so large before said chester to edward you have been over the ground once before yes but part of it was during the night it is pleasant to see it once more many of the places have grown considerably though it is only two years since i came from portland chester made some agreeable acquaintances an unsociable traveler misses many of the profitable results of his journey besides finding time hang heavily on his hands just after leaving bismarck in north dakota chesters attention was called to an old man whose white hair and wrinkled face indicated that he had passed the age of seventy years the conductor came through the car collecting tickets the old man searched for his and an expression of dismay overspread his face i cant find my ticket he said that is unfortunate where did you come from from buffalo when did you last see your ticket i stopped over one night in bismarck and had to share my room with a young man for the hotel was crowded i think he must have picked my pocket of the ticket did you know the ticket was missing when you boarded the train no sir i did not think to look your case is unfortunate how far are you going to tacoma i have a son there i am afraid you will have to pay the fare from here i have no discretion in the matter and cannot allow you to ride without a ticket dont you believe my ticket was stolen asked the old man in a state of nervous agitation yes i believe it i dont think a man of your age would deceive me but i cannot let you travel without paying for another i havent money enough said the old man piteously if you will wait till i reach tacoma my son will give me money to pay you i am not allowed to do that i think you will have to get out at the next station the old man was much agitated it is very hard he sighed i i dont know what to do chester had listened to this conversation with great sympathy for the unfortunate traveler on account of his age and apparent helplessness how much is the fare to tacoma from this point he asked in the neighborhood of fifty dollars answered the conductor will your son be able to pay this asked chester oh yes answered the old man william has been doin well he is going to build a large hotel in tacoma he and another man then said chester i will advance you what money you need you can give me a memorandum so that i can collect it from your son heaven bless you young man said the old man fervently you are indeed a friend to me who am but a stranger i am sure you will prosper thank you what a fellow you are chester said edward you will make yourself poor helping others i shall sleep better for having aided the old man answered chester the rest of the journey was uneventful the two boys went at once to tacoma as chester felt that the gentlemen who were negotiating for his lots were probably in a hurry to arrange for the building of the hotel after establishing themselves at a hotel and eating dinner they went at once to the office of dean downie the real estate agents from whom chester had received a letter here a surprise awaited him standing at a desk in the rear of the office was a figure that looked familiar the man turned as the door opened to admit chester and the latter recognized to his great astonishment his old enemy david mullins chapter xxxvii david mullins again when david mullins saw chester enter the office he turned pale and looked panicstricken you here he exclaimed in a hollow voice yes mr mullins i am surprised to meet you then you didnt know i was here i heard from felix that you were in this part of the country i am trying to earn an honest living said mullins in agitation my employers know nothing to my prejudice do you come as a friend or an enemy mr mullins i havent the least intention of harming you i will not even appear to know you i came here to see dean downie with whom i have business heaven be praised i will not soon forget your kindness here comes mr dean remember your promise at this moment mr dean entered the office david mullins had returned to his desk this young man wishes to see you mr dean he said formally when his employer entered mr dean looked at chester inquiringly i am chester rand with whom you have had some correspondence said chester tendering his card i have just arrived from new york the broker regarded him in surprise you chester rand he exclaimed why you are a boy i must plead guilty to that indictment said chester smiling but i am the owner of the lots which i understand are wanted for the new hotel david mullins who heard this conversation looked up in amazement he had not known of the correspondence with chester as mr dean had written his letter personally and it had not gone through the office can you furnish any evidence of this asked mr dean here is the letter you sent me and here is a copy of my reply the broker took the letter from chesters hand and all doubt vanished from his countenance i am glad to see you here so soon mr rand he said as the parties with whom i am negotiating are anxious to conclude matters as soon as possible will you go over with me to mr taylors office taylor and pearson are the parties names i will go with pleasure as they walked through the chief business street chester noticed with interest evidences of activity everywhere tacoma he found was situated like san francisco on a side hill sloping down toward puget sound what a fine location for a town he said yes answered mr dean this is destined to be a large city our people are enterprising and progressive seattle is at present ahead of us but we mean to catch up and that ere many years at what price are lots selling on this street i see you have business ideas said the broker smiling i suppose you want to know what price you can charge for your lots you are right of course it will not be right for me to advise you being employed by the other party but i will give you some idea the lot adjoining your plot sold last week for two thousand dollars two thousand yes probably it would be well for me to wait a year or two as the lots would undoubtedly command more then that is one way of looking at it let me point out another you have five lots have you not yes sir if you sell three to the hotel company you can hold the other two five years if you like the proximity of the hotel will help to enhance their value i see that that is a point to be considered if you ask a prohibitory price the hotel will go elsewhere and you may have to wait a good while before you have a chance to sell but here is mr taylors office the broker entered followed by chester here a surprise awaited him sitting in an armchair was his venerable friend of the train appearing very much at home his face lighted up when chester came in william he said to a stout man of middle age this is the young man who generously advanced money to meet my car fare when i was in danger of being put off the train the younger man advanced and cordially offered his hand my boy he said i shall not soon forget your kindness to my father i will gladly repay you for the money you disbursed on his account i was very glad to stand his friend sir returned chester modestly let me know to whom i am indebted mr taylor said the broker this young gentleman is chester rand owner of the lots which you wish to buy is it possible ejaculated william taylor i didnt know that the owner of the lots was a boy the lots were a bequest to me from the original owner said chester and you have never been out this way before this is my first visit to tacoma you are hardly old enough to be in business i am an artist that is i furnish illustrations to a comic weekly paper in new york you have begun life early i suspect you are better fitted for business than most young men of your age here is my partner mr pearson in the negotiation that followed the reader will not be interested at length a mutually satisfactory arrangement was made chester agreed to sell the three lots wanted for the hotel for eight thousand dollars half cash and the balance on a years time at twelve per cent interest when the business was concluded and papers signed mr dean said mr rand i think you have made a good bargain you might have extorted more but you have received a fair price and retained the good will of the purchaser what do you propose to do with the four thousand dollars you will receive in cash i have not had time to think i will venture to give you some advice my partner john downie has made a specialty of city property and he will invest any part for you in lowerpriced city lots which are sure to advance rapidly then i will put the matter in his hands and rely on his judgment i will carry back with me a thousand dollars and leave with him three thousand dollars for investment then come back to the office and i will introduce you to mr downie with whom you can leave instructions chester was presented to mr downie a blond young man who looked honest and reliable and they soon came to an understanding they walked about the town it was not a city then and chester picked out several lots which he was in favor of buying he remained a week in tacoma and before the end of that time all arrangements were perfected and he found himself the owner of seven lots more or less eligible in addition to the two he had reserved in the original plot on the evening of the second day as he was taking a walk alone he encountered david mullins goodevening mr mullins he said politely goodevening chester returned the bookkeeper flushing slightly i want to thank you for not exposing my past misdeeds i hope mr mullins you did not think me mean enough to do so i am sorry to say that according to my sad experience eight out of ten would have done so especially if they had reason like you to complain of personal ill treatment i dont believe in persecuting a man i wish all were of your way of thinking shall i tell you my experience if you will when i left new york i went to chicago and obtained the position of collector for a mercantile establishment i was paid a commission and got on very well till one unlucky day i fell in with an acquaintance from new york where are you working he asked i told him the next day my employer summoned me to his presence i shall not require your services any longer he said i asked no questions i understood that my treacherous friend had given me away i had a few dollars saved and went to minneapolis there i was undisturbed for six months then the same man appeared and again deprived me of my situation how contemptible ejaculated chester with a ring of scorn in his voice then i came to tacoma and here i have been thus far undisturbed when i saw you i had a scare i thought my time had come and i must again move on so far from wishing to harm you mr mullins said chester if through the meanness of others you get into trouble you can any time send to me for a loan of fifty dollars thank you ejaculated mullins gratefully wringing chesters hand you are heaping coals of fire on my head you will always have my best wishes for your prosperity if ever you are able repay the money you took from mr fairchild and i will venture to promise that he will forgive you with gods help i will chapter xxxviii abner trimbles plot just off first street in portland ore is a saloon over which appears the name of the proprietor abner trimble two roughlooking fellows smoking pipes entered the saloon behind the bar stood a stout redfaced man this was trimble and his appearance indicated that he patronized the liquors he dispensed to others glad to see you floyd said trimble that means a glass of whisky doesnt it returned floyd well not now i want you to go up to the house again to see my wife about the old matter yes she isnt quite satisfied about the kids death and she wont make a will in my favor till she is she wants to ask you a few questions floyd made a wry face shes as bad as a

boat was upset and all three were drowned yes i remember its a smart yarn isnt it grinned floyd yes but you mustnt let her doubt it you remember how you came to know about the drowning no i forget abner trimble frowned look here floyd youd better remember or you wont get the money i promised you you were out in a boat yourself and saw the whole thing you jumped into the water and tried to save the kid but it was no use he went to the bottom and that was the end of him a very pretty story said floyd complacently wont i get somethin for tryin to save the kids life as like as not ill suggest it to the old lady myself when do you want me to go up to the house now the lawyers coming at four oclock and i want you to confirm mrs t in her belief in the boys death its dry talkin abner said floyd significantly take a glass of sarsaparilla then sarsaparilla repeated floyd contemptuously thats only fit for children lemon soda then whats the matter with whisky are you a fool do you think mrs t will believe your story if you come to her smelling of whisky youre hard on me abner just one little glass you can put that off till afterward here take some lemon soda or ill mix you a glass of lemonade well if i must said floyd in a tone of resignation you can have as much whisky as you like afterward then the sooner we get over the job the better im ready now here tim take my place said abner trimble calling his barkeeper im going to the house for an hour now come along abner trimble lived in a comfortable dwelling in the nicer portion of the city it belonged to his wife when he married her and he had simply taken up his residence in her house he would have liked to have lived nearer the saloon and had suggested this to his wife but she was attached to her home and was unwilling to move trimble ushered his visitor into the sitting room and went up to see his wife she was sitting in an armchair in the room adjoining her chamber looking pale and sorrowful well mary said trimble ive brought floyd along to answer any questions relating to poor edwards death yes i shall be glad to see him answered his wife in a dull spiritless tone shall i bring him up if you like trimble went to the landing and called out you can come up floyd floyd entered the room holding his hat awkwardly in his hands he was not used to society and did not look forward with much pleasure to the interview which had been forced upon him i hope i see you well maam he said bobbing his head as well as i ever expect to be answered mrs trimble sadly your name is floyd maam darius floyd and you knew my poor son yes maam i knew him well ed and i was regular cronies mrs trimble looked at the man before her and was mildly surprised certainly edward must have changed or he would not keep such company but prejudiced against her son as she had been by her husbands misrepresentations she feared that this was only another proof of edwards moral decadence you have been in new york recently yes i was there quite a while and you used to see edward most every day maam how was he employed this was not a question to which mr floyd had prepared an answer he looked to mr trimble as if for a suggestion and the latter nodded impatiently and shaped his mouth to mean anything he was tendin a pool room maam said floyd with what he thought a lucky inspiration he was tendin a pool room on sixth avenue he must indeed have changed to accept such employment i hope he didnt drink not often maam just a glass of sarsaparilla or lemon soda them are my favorites abner trimble turned aside to conceal a smile he remembered mr floyds objecting to the innocent beverages mentioned and his decided preference for whisky i am glad that he was not intemperate you saw the accident yes maam please tell me once more what you can i took a boat down at the battery to have a row one afternoon when after a while i saw another boat comin out with three fellers into it one of them was your son edward did you know edwards companions never saw them before in my life they was about as old as he well by and by one of them stood up in the boat i surmise he had been drinkin then a minute afterward i saw the boat upset and the three was strugglin in the water i didnt take no interest in the others but i wanted to save edward so i jumped into the water and made for him that is i thought i did but it so happened in the confusion that i got hold of the wrong boy and when i managed to get him on board my boat i saw my mistake it was too late to correct it excuse my emotion maam and mr floyd drew a red silk handkerchief from his pocket and wiped his eyes but when i looked out and couldnt see either of the other young fellers and realized that they were drowned i felt awful bad mrs trimble put her handkerchief to her eyes and moaned the picture drawn by mr floyd was too much for her i wish i could see the young man whose life you saved she said after a pause have you his name and address no maam he didnt even thank me i didnt get even the price of a glass of sarsaparilla out of him mr floyd came near saying whisky but bethought himself in time i have been much interested by your sad story mr floyd said the sorrowstricken mother you seem to have a good and sympathetic heart yes maam replied floyd that is my weakness dont call it a weakness it does you credit mr floyd exchanged a sly glance of complacency with abner trimble who was pleased that his agent got off so creditably he had evidently produced a good impression on mrs trimble you see my dear he said gently that there can be no doubt about poor edwards death i have thought under the circumstances that you would feel like making a will and seeing that i was suitably provided for as matters stand your property would go to distant cousins and second cousins at that while i would be left out in the cold i know of course that you are younger than myself and likely to outlive me but still life is uncertain i dont care much for money but i wouldnt like to die destitute and so i asked mr coleman the lawyer to come round i think i hear his ring now will you see him yes if you wish it i care very little what becomes of the property now my boy is no more mr trimble went downstairs and returned with a very respectablelooking man of middle age whom he introduced as mr coleman chapter xxxix making a will mr coleman said trimble with suavity this is my wife mrs trimble the lawyer bowed i believe you wish to execute a will mrs trimble said he yes answered the poor mother in a spiritless tone various questions were asked in relation to the property and then the lawyer seated himself at a table and wrote the formal part of the will i understand you wish to leave the entire property to your husband he said in a tone of inquiry in the event of my sons death interpolated mrs trimble but my dear he is dead said abner trimble with a slight frown i would prefer to have it expressed in this way i am sure continued trimble annoyed that mr coleman will consider it unnecessary i see no objections to it said the lawyer of course the son being dead it wont count mr coleman explained mrs trimble i have no reason to doubt my poor sons death but i didnt see him die and there may have been a mistake how can there be demanded trimble impatiently didnt my friend floyd see him drowned he may have been mistaken besides he only says he did not see him after the boat upset he may have been picked up by some other boat for the first time trimble and floyd saw the flaw in the story which had been invented by trimble himself was there any boat near floyd asked trimble winking significantly no sir not within a quarter of a mile edward could swim he may have reached one by swimming this was news to trimble he had not been aware that his stepson could swim under the circumstances said the lawyer i think mrs trimble is right trimble looked panicstricken knowing that edward granger was still living he recognized the fact that such a will would do him no good if he were alive he would let us know he said after a pause probably he would so that we may conclude he is dead it might be stipulated that if the missing son does not appear within three years from the time the will is made he may be regarded as dead suggested the lawyer one year would be sufficient it seems to me put in trimble i would rather make it three said his wife abner trimble looked disappointed but did not dare object the lawyer continued to write i understand then he observed that you bequeath all your estate to your husband in the event of your son being decided to be dead mrs trimble paused to consider i think she said i will leave the sum of five thousand dollars to charitable purposes as a memorial of edward i dont think much of charitable societies growled trimble some of them do a great deal of good said the lawyer are there any particular societies which you would wish to remember mrs trimble i leave the choice to my executor said the lady whom have you selected for that office will you serve she asked then you dont care to appoint mr trimble no i think not it is customary to appoint the husband isnt it mr coleman asked abner it is quite often done i would prefer you said mrs trimble decidedly if it will ease your mind i will take the office mrs trimble now said the lawyer after a brief interval i will read the draft of the will as i have written it and you can see if it meets your views he had about half completed reading the document when there was heard a sharp ring at the doorbell then there were steps on the stairs a terrible surprise was in store for mrs trimble chapter xl an unexpected surprise the door of the sitting room was opened quickly and two boys dashed into the room they were edward granger and chester rand abner trimble turned pale and uttered an imprecation all his plans so carefully laid were menaced with ignominious defeat floyd looked up in surprise but did not comprehend the situation in spite of the positive testimony he had given he did not even know edward granger by sight mrs trimble uttered a wild cry but her face lighted up with supreme joy edward she exclaimed and half rising opened her arms her son sprang forward and embraced his mother oh edward she murmured are you really alive very much alive mother answered edward with a smile and i was mourning you as dead i thought i should never see you again i have not died that i am aware of mother who told you i was dead mr trimble and this gentleman looking at floyd he told me he saw you drowned in new york bay edward regarded floyd with curiosity i havent any recollection of ever seeing the gentleman he said i dont know him how do you explain this mr floyd asked mrs trimble suspiciously floyd tried to speak but faltered and stammered he was in a very awkward position and he realized it abner trimble came to his assistance you must have been mistaken floyd he said the young man you saw drowned must have been a stranger yes returned floyd grasping the suggestion of course i must have been mistaken the young man i saw bore a wonderful resemblance to mr granger how long is it since you saw me drowned mr floyd asked edward about three weeks answered floyd in an embarrassed tone in new york bay yes you were out in a boat with two other young fellows that is a young man who was the perfect image of you was the boat upset and all three were spilled out i saved the life of one but the others were as i thought drowned i am sorry that i was mistaken does that mean you are sorry i was not drowned no i am sorry to have harrowed up your mothers feelings by a story which proves to be untrue i suppose mr trimble brought you here said edward quietly he had in former days stood in fear of his stepfather but now backed up by chester he felt a new sense of courage and independence of course i brought him here growled trimble fully believing in my friend floyds story for i know him to be a gentleman of truth i thought your mother ought to know it i was about to make my will at mr trimbles suggestion leaving him all my property said mrs trimble regarding her husband suspiciously of course it was better to leave it to me than to second cousins whom you dont care anything about interposed trimble sourly come floyd our business is at an end we will go over to the saloon shant i get anything for my trouble asked floyd uneasily a remark which led the lawyer to regard him sharply your valuable time will be paid for said trimble sarcastically he led the way out and floyd followed mrs trimble said the lawyer rising allow me to congratulate you on the happy event of this day i am particularly glad that my services are not needed they will be needed mr coleman will you do me the favor of drawing up a will leaving my entire property with the exception of a thousand dollars to my son edward and bring it here tomorrow morning with two trusty witnesses and i will sign it to whom will you leave the thousand dollars to my to mr trimble answered mrs trimble coldly i will not utterly ignore him very well mrs trimble i will call at halfpast ten oclock tomorrow morning the lawyer bowed himself out leaving mrs trimble and the boys together mother said edward i have not yet had a chance to introduce to you my friend chester rand of new york i am very glad to welcome any friend of yours edward you have reason to do so in this case mother but for chester i should not have had the money to come on from new york he paid my traveling expenses he shall be repaid and promptly and he will accept my heartiest thanks also i hope mr rand you will make your home with us while you are in portland thank you mrs trimble but i have already secured lodgings at a hotel at some future time i may accept your invitation chester strongly suspected that he would not be a welcome guest to mr trimble when that gentleman learned that he had been instrumental in bringing home his stepson in time to defeat his plans but he called every day till his business being concluded he started on his return to new york edward had expected to go back with him but to this mrs trimble would not listen we have been separated long enough edward she said henceforth your place is at my side i feel that i have done you injustice and i want to repair it i made a mistake in marrying mr trimble but it is too late to correct that i will not permit him hereafter to separate me from my son if you wish me to remain mother i will rejoined edward i was not happy away from you from this time forth i will stand by you and protect you from all that is unpleasant edward spoke with a courage and manliness which he had not formerly shown it was clear that adversity had strengthened and improved him chapter xli conclusion let us go back to wyncombe mrs greene living near mrs rand was a lady who made it her business to know all about her neighbors affairs she stepped into silas tripps store to buy a pound of butter mr tripp himself waited upon her mrs greene generally had some item of news and for this he possessed a keen relish any news mrs greene he asked as he handed her the package of butter i suppose youve heard that the widder rand has lost her boarder you dont say so returned silas with genuine interest yes its so i saw her go off myself yesterday afternoon bag and baggage was she dissatisfied do you think like as not the widder says shes comin back but i dont believe it between you and me mr tripp i wonder that she stayed so long now if she had been boardin with you it would have been different so it would mrs greene so it would i would have been willing to take her just to oblige so would i mr tripp the widder charged her a ridiculous price eight dollars a week it was extortionate i never charged such a price nor i miss dolbys board ran the house so that chester didnt need to send any home and now chesters lost his place you dont say so ejaculated silas eagerly yes mrs rand told me herself that he had left his work and gone out west in search of a place i dont see for my part what the widders goin to do im sorry chesters been so unlucky but he neednt have gone out west im ready to take him back into my store thats very kind of you mr tripp i want to help along his mother seein shes a widder and in hard luck shall i tell her you will take chester back no ill call round and see her about it there may be some dickerin about the salary chesters got rather high notions but i cant afford to pay extravagant prices just so im sorry for the widder rand but shes sot too much on that boy and thought there wasnt no other boy in wyncombe that was equal to him im sure my fred is just as smart as he it was not till the next evening that mr tripp found it convenient to call on mrs rand she was rather surprised by the visit and a little curious to learn what it meant goodevenin widder said silas coughing goodevening mr tripp wont you step in for a few minutes thank you i dont care if i do i heard yesterday from mrs greene that youd lost your boarder yes miss dolby has gone to chicago for a year she has a sister there do you expect her back yes after a year i wouldnt calclate too much upon it if i were you women folks is mighty onsartin when they make promises mrs rand smiled you may be right mr tripp she said i hear too that chesters lost his place no he has left it for a time but he expects to go back thats onsartin too im sorry for you widder thank you mr tripp but theres no occasion youll be rather put to it to get along i reckon still i have good friends in wyncombe said mrs rand smiling mischievously now if i were really put to it i am sure i could rely upon your assistance im very short of money returned silas alarmed at this suggestion still ive got the will to help you if chesters out of work im ready to take him back into the store i will tell him that when i write where is he now hes gone out west hes made a mistake i knew a boy that went out west some years since and nearly starved he came home ragged and hungry i am not afraid chester will have that experience he had saved up some money when at work in new york it wont last long widder it dont take long for fifty dollars to melt away did he have that much i think he did mr tripp hed better have put it in a savings bank and come back to wyncombe to work for me how soon do you expect him back next week when he comes send him round to see me a few days later mrs greene went into silas tripps store again well mr tripp she said chester rands got home you dont say if you see him tell him to come round and see me and i can tell you some more news you know that halfacre lot that jins onto the widders land the apple orchard yes well chesters bought it you dont mean it where on earth did he get the money do you know what he paid two hundred dollars hell never be able to pay for it he has paid cash down besides hes got a new suit of clothes and a gold watch i dont believe he will be willing to take a place in your store silas tripp was amazed nay more he was incredulous but it so happened that chester himself came into the store in five minutes and confirmed the news where did you get the money chester asked mr tripp curiously eying the boy with unwonted respect i saved it i received high pay in new york but youve lost the place oh no i go back to work next week how much pay do you get thirty dollars a week dont try to fool me said silas with asperity it aint creditable to deceive a man old enough to be your grandfather chester smiled do you want me to bring an affidavit from my employers he asked but its ridiculous payin a boy such wages objected silas it would be foolish for you to pay it mr tripp but they think me worth it what sort of work do you do i make pictures i will show you a couple and chester produced a copy of the phoenix why i didnt think they paid moren a quarter apiece for such pictures its lucky for me that they pay higher than that what was you doin out west i went partly to see the country i spose it cost you considerable money yes traveling is expensive youd better have put the money in the bank i dont think so boys have foolish notions i spose you was sorry to hear that miss dolby had gone away no i want mother to have a few months rest your motherll miss her board no for i shall make it up to her you talk as if you was rich chester i am not so rich as you mr tripp you seem to be spending more money some day youll be put to it to get along but that has not yet come two years have passed and chester is still in the employ of the phoenix but he now receives forty dollars per week he has sold his other two lots in tacoma for five thousand dollars each and still has the cheaper lots he bought as an investment he could sell these at a handsome profit but will hold them a while longer about a year ago he received intelligence from edward granger that his stepfather had died suddenly of heart trouble brought on by an undue use of alcoholic mixtures edward concluded now there is nothing to mar my mothers happiness i live at home and manage her business besides filling a responsible place in a brokers office we hope you will pay us a visit before long we have never forgotten your kindness to me in my time of need a month since mr fairchild was surprised by receiving a remittance from tacoma his old bookkeeper david mullins remitted to him the amount he had stolen at the time of his hurried departure from new york with interest up to date i hope mr fairchild he concluded you will now forgive me for my treachery i feel great satisfaction in paying my debt i have been assisted by a fortunate investment in outside lots i am glad to hear that felix is doing well you were kind to retain him felix is really doing well and bids fair to make a good business man he was weak and influenced to evil by his cousin but with good surroundings he is likely to turn out creditably chester retains the friendship and good opinion of his first friend carl conrad and is a favorite visitor at the house of prof hazlitt whose great work has just appeared from the press of a subscription publisher his nephew arthur burks is now in college and he and chester remain intimate friends silas tripp has ceased to expect to secure the services of chester in his store he had never been able to understand the secret of chesters success but has been heard to remark it does beat all how that boy gets along fortunately prosperity has not spoiled chester he is still the same modest and warmhearted boy or perhaps i should say young man and his friends all agree that he deserves his success the end
